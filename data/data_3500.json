        "Neuronal impact of patient-specific aberrant NRXN1\u03b1 splicing. NRXN1 undergoes extensive alternative splicing, and non-recurrent heterozygous deletions in NRXN1 are strongly associated with neuropsychiatric disorders. We establish that human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived neurons well represent the diversity of NRXN1\u03b1 alternative splicing observed in the human brain, cataloguing 123 high-confidence in-frame human NRXN1\u03b1 isoforms. Patient-derived NRXN1+/- hiPSC-neurons show a greater than twofold reduction in half of the wild-type NRXN1\u03b1 isoforms and express dozens of novel isoforms from the mutant allele. Reduced neuronal activity in patient-derived NRXN1+/- hiPSC-neurons is ameliorated by overexpression of individual control isoforms in a genotype-dependent manner, whereas individual mutant isoforms decrease neuronal activity levels in control hiPSC-neurons. In a genotype-dependent manner, the phenotypic impact of patient-specific NRXN1+/- mutations can occur through a reduction in wild-type NRXN1\u03b1 isoform levels as well as the presence of mutant NRXN1\u03b1 isoforms.

        "Risk of Operative and Nonoperative Interventions Up to 4 Years After Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass vs Vertical Sleeve Gastrectomy in a Nationwide US Commercial Insurance Claims Database. Importance: There are few nationwide studies comparing the risk of reintervention after contemporary bariatric procedures. Objective: To compare the risk of intervention after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) vs vertical sleeve gastrectomy (VSG). Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study used a nationwide US commercial insurance claims database. Adults aged 18 to 64 years who underwent a first RYGB or VSG procedure between January 1, 2010, and June 30, 2017, were matched on US region, year of surgery, most recent presurgery body mass index (BMI) category (based on diagnosis codes), and baseline type 2 diabetes. The prematch pool included 4496 patients undergoing RYGB and 8627 patients undergoing VSG, and the final weighted matched sample included 4476 patients undergoing RYGB and 8551 patients undergoing VSG. Exposures: Bariatric surgery procedure type (RYGB vs VSG). Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was any abdominal operative intervention after the index procedure. Secondary outcomes included the following subtypes of operative intervention: biliary procedures, abdominal wall hernia repair, bariatric conversion or revision, and other abdominal operations. Nonoperative outcomes included endoscopy and enteral access. Time to first event was compared using multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression modeling. Results: Among 13\u202f027 patients, the mean (SD) age was 44.4 (10.3) years, and 74.1% were female; 13.7% had a preoperative BMI between 30 and 39.9, 45.8% had a preoperative BMI between 40 and 49.9, and 24.2% had a preoperative BMI of at least 50. Patients were followed up for up to 4 years after surgery (median, 1.6 years; interquartile range, 0.7-3.2 years), with 41.9% having at least 2 years of follow-up and 16.3% having at least 4 years of follow-up. Patients undergoing VSG were less likely to have any subsequent operative intervention than matched patients undergoing RYGB (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 0.80; 95% CI, 0.72-0.89) and similarly were less likely to undergo biliary procedures (aHR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.67-0.90), abdominal wall hernia repair (aHR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.47-0.75), other abdominal operations (aHR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.61-0.82), and endoscopy (aHR, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.49-0.59) or have enteral access placed (aHR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.39-0.86). Patients undergoing VSG were more likely to undergo bariatric conversion or revision (aHR, 1.83; 95% CI, 1.19-2.80). Conclusions and Relevance: In this nationwide study, patients undergoing VSG appeared to be less likely than matched patients undergoing RYGB to experience subsequent abdominal operative interventions, except for bariatric conversion or revision procedures. Patients considering bariatric surgery should be aware of the increased risk of subsequent procedures associated with RYGB vs VSG as part of shared decision-making around procedure choice. ",
        "Precision Sensorimotor Control in Aging FMR1 Gene Premutation Carriers. Background: Individuals with premutation alleles of the FMR1 gene are at risk of developing fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS), a neurodegenerative condition affecting sensorimotor function. Information on quantitative symptom traits associated with aging in premutation carriers is needed to clarify neurodegenerative processes contributing to FXTAS. Materials and Methods: 26 FMR1 premutation carriers ages 44-77 years and 31 age-matched healthy controls completed rapid (2 s) and sustained (8 s) visually guided precision gripping tasks. Individuals pressed at multiple force levels to determine the impact of increasing the difficulty of sensorimotor actions on precision behavior. During initial pressing, reaction time, the rate at which individuals increased their force, the duration of pressing, and force accuracy were measured. During sustained gripping, the complexity of the force time series, force variability, and mean force were examined. During relaxation, the rate at which individuals decreased their force was measured. We also examined the relationships between visuomotor behavior and cytosine-guanine-guanine (CGG) repeat length and clinically rated FXTAS symptoms. Results: Relative to controls, premutation carriers showed reduced rates of initial force generation during rapid motor actions and longer durations of their initial pressing with their dominant hand. During sustained force, premutation carriers demonstrated reduced force complexity, though this effect was specific to younger premutation carries during dominant hand pressing and was more severe for younger relative to older premutation carriers at low and medium force levels. Increased reaction time and lower sustained force complexity each were associated with greater CGG repeat length for premutation carriers. Increased reaction time and increased sustained force variability were associated with more severe clinically rated FXTAS symptoms. Conclusion: Overall our findings suggest multiple sensorimotor processes are disrupted in aging premutation carriers, including initial force control guided by feedforward mechanisms and sustained sensorimotor behaviors guided by sensory feedback control processes. Results indicating that sensorimotor issues in aging premutation carriers relate to both greater CGG repeat length and clinically rated FXTAS symptoms suggest that quantitative tests of precision sensorimotor ability may serve as key targets for monitoring FXTAS risk and progression.

        "Evidence for a Direct Harmful Effect of Alcohol on Myocardial Health: A Large Cross-Sectional Study of Consumption Patterns and Cardiovascular Disease Risk Biomarkers From Northwest Russia, 2015 to 2017. Background Alcohol drinking is an increasingly recognized risk factor for cardiovascular disease. However, there are few studies of the impact of harmful and hazardous drinking on biomarkers of myocardial health. We conducted a study in Russia to investigate the impact of heavy drinking on biomarkers of cardiac damage and inflammation. Methods and Results The Know Your Heart study recruited a random sample of 2479 participants from the population of northwest Russia (general population) plus 278 patients (narcology clinic subsample) with alcohol problems. The general population sample was categorized into harmful drinkers, hazardous drinkers, nonproblem drinkers, and nondrinkers, according to self-reported level of alcohol consumption, whereas the narcology clinic sample was treated as the separate group in the analysis. Measurements were made of the following: (1) high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T, (2) NT-proBNP (N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide), and (3) hsCRP (high-sensitivity C-reactive protein). The narcology clinic subsample had the most extreme drinking pattern and the highest levels of all 3 biomarkers relative to nonproblem drinkers in the general population: high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T was elevated by 10.3% (95% CI, 3.7%-17.4%), NT-proBNP by 46.7% (95% CI, 26.8%-69.8%), and hsCRP by 69.2% (95% CI, 43%-100%). In the general population sample, NT-proBNP was 31.5% (95% CI, 3.4%-67.2%) higher among harmful drinkers compared with nonproblem drinkers. Overall, NT-proBNP and hsCRP increased with increasing intensity of alcohol exposure (test of trend P<0.001). Conclusions These results support the hypothesis that heavy alcohol drinking has an adverse effect on cardiac structure and function that may not be driven by atherosclerosis. ",
        "Sleep patterns, genetic susceptibility, and incident cardiovascular disease: a prospective study of 385\u2009292 UK biobank participants. AIMS: To quantify the association of combined sleep behaviours and genetic susceptibility with the incidence of cardiovascular disease (CVD). METHODS AND RESULTS: This study included 385\u00a0292 participants initially free of CVD from UK Biobank. We newly created a healthy sleep score according to five sleep factors and defined the low-risk groups as follows: early chronotype, sleep 7-8\u2009h per day, never/rarely insomnia, no snoring, and no frequent excessive daytime sleepiness. Weighted genetic risk scores of coronary heart disease (CHD) or stroke were calculated. During a median of 8.5 years of follow-up, we documented 7280 incident CVD cases including 4667 CHD and 2650 stroke cases. Compared to those with a sleep score of 0-1, participants with a score of 5 had a 35% (19-48%), 34% (22-44%), and 34% (25-42%) reduced risk of CVD, CHD, and stroke, respectively. Nearly 10% of cardiovascular events in this cohort could be attributed to poor sleep pattern. Participants with poor sleep pattern and high genetic risk showed the highest risk of CHD and stroke. CONCLUSION: In this large prospective study, a healthy sleep pattern was associated with reduced risks of CVD, CHD, and stroke among participants with low, intermediate, or high genetic risk. ",
        "Beta-caryophyllene enhances wound healing through multiple routes. Beta-caryophyllene is an odoriferous bicyclic sesquiterpene found in various herbs and spices. Recently, it was found that beta-caryophyllene is a ligand of the cannabinoid receptor 2 (CB2). Activation of CB2 will decrease pain, a major signal for inflammatory responses. We hypothesized that beta-caryophyllene can affect wound healing by decreasing inflammation. Here we show that cutaneous wounds of mice treated with beta-caryophyllene had enhanced re-epithelialization. The treated tissue showed increased cell proliferation and cells treated with beta-caryophyllene showed enhanced cell migration, suggesting that the higher re-epithelialization is due to enhanced cell proliferation and cell migration. The treated tissues also had up-regulated gene expression for hair follicle bulge stem cells. Olfactory receptors were not involved in the enhanced wound healing. Transient Receptor Potential channel genes were up-regulated in the injured skin exposed to beta-caryophyllene. Interestingly, there were sex differences in the impact of beta- caryophyllene as only the injured skin of female mice had enhanced re-epithelialization after exposure to beta-caryophyllene. Our study suggests that chemical compounds included in essential oils have the capability to improve wound healing, an effect generated by synergetic impacts of multiple pathways. ",
        "A Comparative Study of Modern and Heirloom Wheat on Indicators of Gastrointestinal Health. Wheat consumption has declined amid growing concerns about gluten-sensitivity. To determine if genetic manipulation of wheat contributes to systemic and localized gut inflammation, we compared the effects of the modern variety Gallagher and a blend of two heirloom varieties, Turkey and Kharkof, on measures of gut inflammation, structural characteristics, and barrier integrity under normal and Western diet (WD) conditions in C57BL/6 mice. Indicators of gut inflammation, including lymphocyte infiltration and cytokine expression, were largely unaffected by WD or wheat, although WD elevated interferon-\u03b3 (Ifng) and heirloom varieties modestly reduced interleukin-17 (Il17) in the context of WD. WD negatively affected jejunal villi structure, while the modern variety improved villi structure in the ileum. Relative mRNA and tight junction proteins and serum lipopolysaccharide binding protein were unaltered by WD or wheat. These findings indicate that the modern variety did not compromise barrier function or contribute to gut inflammation compared to its heirloom predecessor. ",
        "Air Pollution (Particulate Matter) Exposure and Associations with Depression, Anxiety, Bipolar, Psychosis and Suicide Risk: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis. BACKGROUND:. Particulate air pollution's physical health effects are well known, but associations between particulate matter (PM) exposure and mental illness have not yet been established. However, there is increasing interest in emerging evidence supporting a possible etiological link. . OBJECTIVES:. This systematic review aims to provide a comprehensive overview and synthesis of the epidemiological literature to date by investigating quantitative associations between PM and multiple adverse mental health outcomes (depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, psychosis, or suicide). . METHODS:. We undertook a systematic review and meta-analysis. We searched Medline, PsycINFO, and EMBASE from January 1974 to September 2017 for English-language human observational studies reporting quantitative associations between exposure to PM <1.0\u03bcm in aerodynamic diameter (ultrafine particles) and PM <2.5 and <10\u03bcm in aerodynamic diameter (PM2.5 and PM10, respectively) and the above psychiatric outcomes. We extracted data, appraised study quality using a published quality assessment tool, summarized methodological approaches, and conducted meta-analyses where appropriate. . RESULTS:. Of 1,826 citations identified, 22 met our overall inclusion criteria, and we included 9 in our primary meta-analyses. In our meta-analysis of associations between long-term (>6\u2009months) PM2.5 exposure and depression (n=5 studies), the pooled odds ratio was 1.102 per 10-\u03bcg/m3 PM2.5 increase (95% CI: 1.023, 1.189; I2=0.00%). Two of the included studies investigating associations between long-term PM2.5 exposure and anxiety also reported statistically significant positive associations, and we found a statistically significant association between short-term PM10 exposure and suicide in meta-analysis at a 0-2 d cumulative exposure lag. . DISCUSSION:. Our findings support the hypothesis of an association between long-term PM2.5 exposure and depression, as well as supporting hypotheses of possible associations between long-term PM2.5 exposure and anxiety and between short-term PM10 exposure and suicide. The limited literature and methodological challenges in this field, including heterogeneous outcome definitions, exposure assessment, and residual confounding, suggest further high-quality studies are warranted to investigate potentially causal associations between air pollution and poor mental health. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP4595.

        "DNA enrichment and tagmentation method for species-level identification and strain-level differentiation using ON-rep-seq. Despite the massive developments within culture-independent methods for detection of microorganisms during the last decade, culture-based methods remain a cornerstone in microbiology. Yet, the problem of rapid, accurate and inexpensive identification of bacterial isolates down to species/strain level remains unresolved. We have developed a new method for bacterial DNA enrichment and tagmentation allowing fast (<24\u2009h) and cost-effective species level identification and strain level differentiation using the MinION portable sequencing platform (ON-rep-seq). DNA library preparation for 96 isolates takes less than 5\u2009h and ensures highly reproducible distribution of reads that can be used to generate strain level specific read length counts profiles (LCp). We have developed a pipeline that by correcting reads error within peaks of LCp generates a set of high quality (>99%) consensus reads. Whereas, the information from high quality reads is used to retrieve species level taxonomy, comparison of LCp allows for strain level differentiation. ",
        "The TRPA1 Ion Channel Contributes to Sensory-Guided Avoidance of Menthol in Mice. The flavoring agent menthol elicits complex orosensory and behavioral effects including perceived cooling at low concentrations and irritation and ingestive avoidance at higher intensities. Oral menthol engages the cold-activated transient receptor potential (TRP) ion channel TRP melastatin 8 (TRPM8) on trigeminal fibers, although its aversive feature was discussed to involve activation of TRP ankyrin 1 (TRPA1) associated with nociceptive processing. Here, we studied the roles of TRPM8 and TRPA1 in orosensory responding to menthol by subjecting mice gene deficient for either channel to brief-access exposure tests, which measure immediate licking responses to fluid stimuli to capture sensory/tongue control of behavior. Stimuli included aqueous concentration series of (-)-menthol [0 (water), 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 1.0, 1.5, and 2.3 mM] and the aversive bitter taste stimulus quinine-HCl (0, 0.01, 0.03, 0.1, 0.3, 1, and 3 mM). Concentration-response data were generated from daily brief-access tests conducted in lickometers, which recorded the number of licks water-restricted mice emitted to a randomly selected stimulus concentration over a block of several 10-s stimulus presentations. Wild-type mice showed aversive orosensory responses to menthol above 0.7 mM. Oral aversion to menthol was reduced in mice deficient for TRPA1 but not TRPM8. Oral aversion to quinine was similar between TRPA1 mutant and control mice but stronger than avoidance of menthol. This implied menthol avoidance under the present conditions represented a moderate form of oral aversion. These data reveal TRPA1 contributes to the oral sensory valence of menthol and have implications for how input from TRPA1 and TRPM8 shapes somatosensory-guided behaviors. ",
        "Real-world tree nut consumption in peanut-allergic individuals. BACKGROUND: Individuals with peanut allergy often avoid tree nuts, yet true rates of tree nut allergy in peanut-allergic individuals are as low as 7%. OBJECTIVE: To examine tree nut sensitization patterns in peanut-allergic individuals, patient and family choice regarding tree nut consumption, and factors that influence consumption of tree nuts. METHODS: All patients presenting for peanut allergy evaluation to an outpatient allergy office were included during a 4-month period. In addition to demographic information, sensitization to tree nuts and tree nut consumption were collected. Logistic regression was performed to generate odds ratios with 95% CIs in univariate and multivariate analyses for variables that predict tree nut consumption. RESULTS: A total of 258 individuals with peanut allergy were enrolled. Ninety-five (36.8%) consumed all tree nuts ad libitum, 63 (24.4%) consumed some but not all tree nuts, and 100 (38.8%) consumed no tree nuts. Of the 100 electively avoiding all tree nuts, the most commonly reported reason was fear of cross-contact (50%). Although there was no difference between rates of sensitization between individual tree nuts (P\u00a0= .056), cashew and pistachio had higher serum specific IgE levels compared with other tree nuts (P < .001). The tree nut most commonly consumed by peanut-allergic individuals was almond (P < .001). Consumption of foods with precautionary labeling was the strongest predictor of tree nut consumption in peanut allergic individuals (P < .001) CONCLUSION: Our data highlight the potential for safe introduction of tree nuts in peanut-allergic individuals and indicate that peanut-allergic individuals who consume foods with precautionary labeling are most likely to consume tree nuts.

        "Risk Factors and Birth Outcomes Associated with Teenage Pregnancy: A Canadian Sample. STUDY OBJECTIVE: To examine the extent to which socioeconomic status, mental health, and substance use are associated with teenage pregnancies in Southwestern Ontario (SWO), and whether these pregnancies are at an elevated risk for adverse birth outcomes, after controlling for medical, behavioral, and socioeconomic status factors. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study using perinatal and neonatal databases. SETTING: Tertiary care hospital in SWO. PARTICIPANTS: Women residing in SWO who gave birth to singleton infants without congenital anomalies between 2009 and 2014. Teenage pregnancies (19\u00a0years of age or younger) were compared with pregnancies of women 20-34\u00a0years and 35\u00a0years or older. INTERVENTIONS: None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Low birth weight (LBW), very LBW, term LBW, preterm birth, very preterm birth, low and very low Apgar score, and fetal macrosomia. RESULTS: Of 25,263 pregnant women, 1080 (4.3%) were 19\u00a0years of age or younger. Approximately 18% of teenage mothers lived in socioeconomically disadvantaged neighborhoods, compared with 11% of mothers aged 20-34 and 9% of women 35\u00a0years of age or older (P\u00a0<\u00a0.001). Teenage mothers had higher rates of depression during pregnancy (9.8%) than mothers 20-34\u00a0years (5.8%) and those 35\u00a0years of age or older (6.8%; P\u00a0<\u00a0.001). Young mothers self-reported higher tobacco, marijuana, and alcohol use during pregnancy than adult mothers (P\u00a0<\u00a0.001). Teenage pregnancy increased the risk of a low Apgar score (adjusted odds ratio, 1.56; 95% confidence interval, 1.21-2.02), but was not associated with other birth outcomes after adjusting for covariates. CONCLUSION: Teenage pregnancy is associated with a higher risk of socioeconomic disadvantage, mental health problems, and substance use during pregnancy, but is largely unrelated to adverse birth outcomes in SWO.

        "A short translational ramp determines the efficiency of protein synthesis. Translation initiation is a major rate-limiting step for protein synthesis. However, recent studies strongly suggest that the efficiency of protein synthesis is additionally regulated by multiple factors that impact the elongation phase. To assess the influence of early elongation on protein synthesis, we employed a library of more than 250,000 reporters combined with in vitro and in vivo protein expression assays. Here we report that the identity of the amino acids encoded by codons 3 to 5 impact protein yield. This effect is independent of tRNA abundance, translation initiation efficiency, or overall mRNA structure. Single-molecule measurements of translation kinetics revealed pausing of the ribosome and aborted protein synthesis on codons 4 and 5 of distinct amino acid and nucleotide compositions. Finally, introduction of preferred sequence motifs only at specific codon positions improves protein synthesis efficiency for recombinant proteins. Collectively, our data underscore the critical role of early elongation events in translational control of gene expression. ",
        "Reward sensitivity deficits in a rat model of compulsive eating behavior. Compulsive eating behavior is hypothesized to be driven in part by reward deficits likely due to neuroadaptations to the mesolimbic dopamine (DA) system. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess deficits in reward system functioning and mesolimbic DA after alternating a standard chow with palatable diet, a model of compulsive eating. In this model, rats in the control group (Chow/Chow) are provided a standard chow diet 7 days a week, while the experimental group (Chow/Palatable) is provided chow for 5 days a week (\"C Phase\"), followed by 2 days of access to a highly palatable sucrose diet (\"P Phase\"). We first tested the sensitivity to d-Amphetamine's stimulatory, reward-enhancing, and primary rewarding effects using a locomotor activity assay, an intracranial self-stimulation (ICSS) procedure, and a conditioned place preference test, respectively. We then quantified DA release in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) shell after treatment with d-Amphetamine using in vivo microdialysis, quantified levels of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and dopamine transporter (DAT) mRNA using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), and lastly, quantified baseline extracellular DA and function of DAT in vivo using quantitative \"no-net-flux\" microdialysis. Chow/Palatable rats displayed blunted d-Amphetamine-induced locomotor activity, insensitivity to d-Amphetamine potentiation of ICSS threshold, and decreased place preference for d-Amphetamine during the P Phase. We found that Chow/Palatable rats had blunted DA efflux following d-Amphetamine treatment. Furthermore, DAT mRNA was increased in Chow/Palatable rats during the P Phase. Finally, quantitative \"no-net-flux\" microdialysis revealed reduced extracellular baseline DA and DAT function in Chow/Palatable rats. Altogether, these results provide evidence of reduced reward system functioning and related neuroadaptations in the DA and DAT systems in this model of compulsive eating. Reward deficits, resulting from repeated overeating, may in turn contribute to the perpetuation of compulsive eating behavior. ",
        "Hippocampal clock regulates memory retrieval via Dopamine and PKA-induced GluA1 phosphorylation. Cognitive performance in people varies according to time-of-day, with memory retrieval declining in the late afternoon-early evening. However, functional roles of local brain circadian clocks in memory performance remains unclear. Here, we show that hippocampal clock controlled by the circadian-dependent transcription factor BMAL1 regulates time-of-day retrieval profile. Inducible transgenic dominant negative BMAL1 (dnBMAL1) expression in mouse forebrain or hippocampus disrupted retrieval of hippocampal memories at Zeitgeber Time 8-12, independently of retention delay, encoding time and Zeitgeber entrainment cue. This altered retrieval profile was associated with downregulation of hippocampal Dopamine-cAMP signaling in dnBMAL1 mice. These changes included decreases in Dopamine Receptors (D1-R and D5-R) and GluA1-S845 phosphorylation by PKA. Consistently, pharmacological activation of cAMP-signals or D1/5Rs rescued impaired retrieval in dnBMAL1 mice. Importantly, GluA1 S845A knock-in mice showed similar retrieval deficits with dnBMAL1 mice. Our findings suggest mechanisms underlying regulation of retrieval by hippocampal clock through D1/5R-cAMP-PKA-mediated GluA1 phosphorylation. ",
        "Recurrent functional misinterpretation of RNA-seq data caused by sample-specific gene length bias. Data normalization is a critical step in RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis, aiming to remove systematic effects from the data to ensure that technical biases have minimal impact on the results. Analyzing numerous RNA-seq datasets, we detected a prevalent sample-specific length effect that leads to a strong association between gene length and fold-change estimates between samples. This stochastic sample-specific effect is not corrected by common normalization methods, including reads per kilobase of transcript length per million reads (RPKM), Trimmed Mean of M values (TMM), relative log expression (RLE), and quantile and upper-quartile normalization. Importantly, we demonstrate that this bias causes recurrent false positive calls by gene-set enrichment analysis (GSEA) methods, thereby leading to frequent functional misinterpretation of the data. Gene sets characterized by markedly short genes (e.g., ribosomal protein genes) or long genes (e.g., extracellular matrix genes) are particularly prone to such false calls. This sample-specific length bias is effectively removed by the conditional quantile normalization (cqn) and EDASeq methods, which allow the integration of gene length as a sample-specific covariate. Consequently, using these normalization methods led to substantial reduction in GSEA false results while retaining true ones. In addition, we found that application of gene-set tests that take into account gene-gene correlations attenuates false positive rates caused by the length bias, but statistical power is reduced as well. Our results advocate the inspection and correction of sample-specific length biases as default steps in RNA-seq analysis pipelines and reiterate the need to account for intergene correlations when performing gene-set enrichment tests to lessen false interpretation of transcriptomic data.

        "A computationally inspired in-vivo approach identifies a link between amygdalar transcriptional heterogeneity, socialization and anxiety. Pharmaceutical breakthroughs for anxiety have been lackluster in the last half-century. Converging behavior and limbic molecular heterogeneity has the potential to revolutionize biomarker-driven interventions. However, current in vivo models too often deploy artificial systems including directed evolution, mutations and fear induction, which poorly mirror clinical manifestations. Here, we explore transcriptional heterogeneity of the amygdala in isogenic mice using an unbiased multi-dimensional computational approach that segregates intra-cohort reactions to moderate situational adversity and intersects it with high content molecular profiling. We show that while the computational approach stratifies known features of clinical anxiety including nitric oxide, opioid and corticotropin signaling, previously unrecognized druggable biomarkers emerge, such as calpain11 and scand1. Through ingenuity pathway analyses, we further describe a role for neurosteroid estradiol signaling, heat shock proteins, ubiquitin ligases and lipid metabolism. In addition, we report a remarkable behavioral pattern that maps to molecular features of anxiety in mice through counterphobic social attitudes, which manifest as increased, yet spatially distant socialization. These findings provide an unbiased approach for interrogating anxiolytics, and hint toward biomarkers underpinning behavioral and social patterns that merit further exploration. ",
        "Synergistic effect of IgG4 antibody and CTLs causes tissue inflammation in IgG4-related disease. IgG4-related disease (IgG4-RD) is characterized by multi-organ irreversible damage resulting from tissue-specific infiltration of IgG4+ plasma cells and cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs). However, whether IgG4 antibody contributes to the inflammation remains unclear. In this study, we established a mouse model that enabled us to evaluate the pathogenic function of IgG4 antibodies in response to a tissue-specific autoantigen using recombinant ovalbumin (OVA)-specific human IgG4 monoclonal antibody (rOVA-hIgG4 mAb) and the mice expressing OVA of the pancreatic islets (RIP-mOVA mice). We found no inflammatory effect of rOVA-hIgG4 mAb transfer alone; however, co-transfer with OVA-specific CD8 CTLs (OT-I T cells) induced tissue damage with dense lymphocytic inflammation in the pancreas of RIP-mOVA mice. rOVA-hIgG4 mAb caused accumulation of conventional DC1 cells (cDC1s) in the lymphoid tissues, and the dendritic cells (DCs) activated the OT-I T cells via cross-presentation. We also revealed that the synergistic effects of CTLs and antibodies were observed in the other subclasses including endogenous antibodies if they recognized the same antigen. The transfer of OVA-specific CD4 helper T cells (OT-II T cells) into RIP-mOVA mice induced the production of anti-OVA antibody, which had a synergistic effect, through acquisition of a T follicular helper (TFH) phenotype. Moreover, using OT-II T cells deficient in Bcl6 caused lower anti-OVA antibody production and inflammation with OT-I T cells. Our results indicated that autoreactive IgG4 antibodies play an important role of the tissue-specific CTL response in IgG4-RD. ",
        "Residential area deprivation and risk of subsequent hospital admission in a British population: the EPIC-Norfolk cohort. OBJECTIVES: To investigate whether residential area deprivation index predicts subsequent admissions to hospital and time spent in hospital independently of individual social class and lifestyle factors. DESIGN: Prospective population-based study. SETTING: The European Prospective Investigation into Cancer in Norfolk (EPIC-Norfolk) study. PARTICIPANTS: 11 214 men and 13 763 women in the general population, aged 40-79 years at recruitment (1993-1997), alive in 1999. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Total admissions to hospital and time spent in hospital during a 19-year time period (1999-2018). RESULTS: Compared to those with residential Townsend Area Deprivation Index lower than the average for England and Wales, those with a higher than average deprivation index had a higher likelihood of spending >20 days in hospital multivariable adjusted OR 1.18 (95% CI 1.07 to 1.29) and having 7 or more admissions OR 1.11 (95% CI 1.02 to 1.22) after adjustment for age, sex, smoking status, education, social class and body mass index. Occupational social class and educational attainment modified the association between area deprivation and hospitalisation; those with manual social class and lower education level were at greater risk of hospitalisation when living in an area with higher deprivation index (p-interaction=0.025\u2009and 0.020, respectively), while the risk for non-manual and more highly educated participants did not vary greatly by area of residence. CONCLUSION: Residential area deprivation predicts future hospitalisations, time spent in hospital and number of admissions, independently of individual social class and education level and other behavioural factors. There are significant interactions such that residential area deprivation has greater impact in those with low education level or manual social class. Conversely, higher education level and social class mitigated the association of area deprivation with hospital usage. ",
        "Impaired cell fate through gain-of-function mutations in a chromatin reader. Modifications of histone proteins have essential roles in normal development and human disease. Recognition of modified histones by 'reader' proteins is a key mechanism that mediates the function of histone modifications, but how the dysregulation of these readers might contribute to disease remains poorly understood. We previously identified the ENL protein as a reader of histone acetylation via its YEATS domain, linking it to the expression of cancer-driving genes in acute leukaemia1. Recurrent hotspot mutations have been found in the ENL YEATS domain in Wilms tumour2,3, the most common type of paediatric kidney cancer. Here we show, using human and mouse cells, that these mutations impair cell-fate regulation by conferring gain-of-function in chromatin recruitment and transcriptional control. ENL mutants induce gene-expression changes that favour a premalignant cell fate, and, in an assay for nephrogenesis using murine cells, result in undifferentiated structures resembling those observed in human Wilms tumour. Mechanistically, although bound to largely similar genomic loci as the wild-type protein, ENL mutants exhibit increased occupancy at a subset of targets, leading to a marked increase in the recruitment and activity of transcription elongation machinery that enforces active transcription from target loci. Furthermore, ectopically expressed ENL mutants exhibit greater self-association and form discrete and dynamic nuclear puncta that are characteristic of biomolecular hubs consisting of local high concentrations of regulatory factors. Such mutation-driven ENL self-association is functionally linked to enhanced chromatin occupancy and gene activation. Collectively, our findings show that hotspot mutations in a chromatin-reader domain drive self-reinforced recruitment, derailing normal cell-fate control during development and leading to an oncogenic outcome.

        "A transposable element insertion is associated with an\u00a0alternative life history strategy. Tradeoffs affect resource allocation during development and result in fitness consequences that drive the evolution of life history strategies. Yet despite their importance, we know little about the mechanisms underlying life history tradeoffs. Many species of Colias butterflies exhibit an alternative life history strategy (ALHS) where females divert resources from wing pigment synthesis to reproductive and somatic development. Due to this reallocation, a wing color polymorphism is associated with the ALHS: either yellow/orange or white. Here we map the locus associated with this ALHS in Colias crocea to a transposable element insertion located downstream of the Colias homolog of BarH-1, a homeobox transcription factor. Using CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing, antibody staining, and electron microscopy we find white-specific expression of BarH-1 suppresses the formation of pigment granules in wing scales and gives rise to white wing color. Lipid and transcriptome analyses reveal physiological differences associated with the ALHS. Together, these findings characterize a mechanism for a female-limited ALHS. ",
        "Prefrontal Regulation of Punished Ethanol Self-administration. BACKGROUND: A clinical hallmark of alcohol use disorder is persistent drinking despite potential adverse consequences. The ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) are positioned to exert top-down control over subcortical regions, such as the nucleus accumbens shell (NAcS) and basolateral amygdala, which encode positive and negative valence of ethanol (EtOH)-related stimuli. Prior rodent studies have implicated these regions in regulation of punished EtOH self-administration (EtOH-SA). METHODS: We conducted in\u00a0vivo electrophysiological recordings in mouse vmPFC and dmPFC to obtain neuronal correlates of footshock-punished EtOH-SA. Ex\u00a0vivo recordings were performed in NAcS D1 receptor-expressing medium spiny neurons receiving vmPFC input to examine punishment-related plasticity in this pathway. Optogenetic photosilencing was employed to assess the functional contribution of the vmPFC, dmPFC, vmPFC projections to NAcS, or vmPFC projections to basolateral amygdala, to punished EtOH-SA. RESULTS: Punishment reduced EtOH lever pressing and elicited aborted presses (lever approach followed by rapid retraction). Neurons in the vmPFC and dmPFC exhibited phasic firing to EtOH lever presses and aborts, but only in the vmPFC was there a population-level shift in coding from lever presses to aborts with punishment. Closed-loop vmPFC, but not dmPFC, photosilencing on a postpunishment probe test negated the reduction in EtOH lever presses but not in aborts. Punishment was associated with altered plasticity at vmPFC inputs to D1 receptor-expressing medium spiny neurons in the NAcS. Photosilencing vmPFC projections to the NAcS, but not to the basolateral amygdala, partially reversed suppression of EtOH lever presses on probe testing. CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate a key role for the vmPFC in regulating EtOH-SA after punishment, with implications for understanding the neural basis of compulsive drinking in alcohol use disorder.

        "Activity of the poly(A) binding protein MSUT2 determines susceptibility to pathological tau in the mammalian brain. Brain lesions composed of pathological tau help to drive neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related tauopathies. Here, we identified the mammalian suppressor of tauopathy 2 (MSUT2) gene as a modifier of susceptibility to tau toxicity in two mouse models of tauopathy. Transgenic PS19 mice overexpressing tau, a model of AD, and lacking the Msut2 gene exhibited decreased learning and memory deficits, reduced neurodegeneration, and reduced accumulation of pathological tau compared to PS19 tau transgenic mice expressing Msut2 Conversely, Msut2 overexpression in 4RTauTg2652 tau transgenic mice increased pathological tau deposition and promoted the neuroinflammatory response to pathological tau. MSUT2 is a poly(A) RNA binding protein that antagonizes the canonical nuclear poly(A) binding protein PABPN1. In individuals with AD, MSUT2 abundance in postmortem brain tissue predicted an earlier age of disease onset. Postmortem AD brain tissue samples with normal amounts of MSUT2 showed elevated neuroinflammation associated with tau pathology. We observed co-depletion of MSUT2 and PABPN1 in postmortem brain samples from a subset of AD cases with higher tau burden and increased neuronal loss. This suggested that MSUT2 and PABPN1 may act together in a macromolecular complex bound to poly(A) RNA. Although MSUT2 and PABPN1 had opposing effects on both tau aggregation and poly(A) RNA tail length, we found that increased poly(A) tail length did not ameliorate tauopathy, implicating other functions of the MSUT2/PABPN1 complex in tau proteostasis. Our findings implicate poly(A) RNA binding proteins both as modulators of pathological tau toxicity in AD and as potential molecular targets for interventions to slow neurodegeneration in tauopathies.

        "Midlife Work and Women's Long-Term Health and Mortality. Although paid work is a well-established predictor of health, several gaps in our knowledge about the relationship between adult work patterns and later health and mortality remain, including whether these benefits persist over long periods and whether they are dependent on subjective experiences with work. We draw on more than three decades of data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Mature Women to assess how labor force participation over a period of 20 years during midlife is related to mental and physical health and mortality over the following 16-25 years. We find that consistent work earlier in life continues to predict improved health and longevity over many years as women enter late life, and this relationship does not differ between women with positive and those with negative subjective work experiences. These findings add to knowledge about how key adult social experiences are related to health as individuals enter later life. ",
        "Long-Term Evolocumab in Patients With Familial\u00a0Hypercholesterolemia. BACKGROUND: Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitor therapy is a treatment option for patients with familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) who are unable to reach low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) goals. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to provide long-term safety and efficacy data for evolocumab in patients with homozygous FH (HoFH) and severe heterozygous FH (HeFH). METHODS: In this open-label, single-arm study, patients with HoFH or severe HeFH\u00a0\u226512 years of age and on stable lipid-lowering therapy began subcutaneous evolocumab 420\u00a0mg monthly or 420\u00a0mg every 2\u00a0weeks if on lipoprotein apheresis. After 12\u00a0weeks, those not on apheresis could be up-titrated to 420\u00a0mg every 2\u00a0weeks. The primary endpoint was the incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events; secondary endpoints were changes in LDL-C and other lipids. RESULTS: In total, 300 patients (106 with HoFH, including 14\u00a0<18 years of age at enrollment) received evolocumab for a median of 4.1 years. Adverse events occurred in 89.3% of patients, the most common of which were nasopharyngitis, influenza, upper respiratory tract infection, and headache. Mean change in LDL-C from baseline to week 12 was\u00a0-21.2% (-59.8\u00a0mg/dl) in patients with HoFH and\u00a0-54.9% (-104.4\u00a0mg/dl) in those with severe HeFH and was sustained over time. Of 48 patients with HoFH who were up-titrated, mean change in LDL-C improved from\u00a0-19.6% at week 12 to\u00a0-29.7% after 12\u00a0weeks of 420\u00a0mg every 2\u00a0weeks. The adjudicated cardiovascular event rate was 2.7% per year. Of\u00a061\u00a0patients receiving apheresis at enrollment, 16 discontinued apheresis. CONCLUSIONS: Evolocumab was well tolerated and effectively reduced plasma LDL-C levels in patients with HoFH and severe HeFH over a median of 4.1 years. ",
        "Treatment of 5 Critically Ill Patients With COVID-19 With Convalescent Plasma. Importance: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a pandemic with no specific therapeutic agents and substantial mortality. It is critical to find new treatments. Objective: To determine whether convalescent plasma transfusion may be beneficial in the treatment of critically ill patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Design, Setting, and Participants: Case series of 5 critically ill patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) who met the following criteria: severe pneumonia with rapid progression and continuously high viral load despite antiviral treatment; Pao2/Fio2 <300; and mechanical ventilation. All 5 were treated with convalescent plasma transfusion. The study was conducted at the infectious disease department, Shenzhen Third People's Hospital in Shenzhen, China, from January 20, 2020, to March 25, 2020; final date of follow-up was March 25, 2020. Clinical outcomes were compared before and after convalescent plasma transfusion. Exposures: Patients received transfusion with convalescent plasma with a SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody (IgG) binding titer greater than 1:1000 (end point dilution titer, by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [ELISA]) and a neutralization titer greater than 40 (end point dilution titer) that had been obtained from 5 patients who recovered from COVID-19. Convalescent plasma was administered between 10 and 22 days after admission. Main Outcomes and Measures: Changes of body temperature, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score (range 0-24, with higher scores indicating more severe illness), Pao2/Fio2, viral load, serum antibody titer, routine blood biochemical index, ARDS, and ventilatory and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) supports before and after convalescent plasma transfusion. Results: All 5 patients (age range, 36-65 years; 2 women) were receiving mechanical ventilation at the time of treatment and all had received antiviral agents and methylprednisolone. Following plasma transfusion, body temperature normalized within 3 days in 4 of 5 patients, the SOFA score decreased, and Pao2/Fio2 increased within 12 days (range, 172-276 before and 284-366 after). Viral loads also decreased and became negative within 12 days after the transfusion, and SARS-CoV-2-specific ELISA and neutralizing antibody titers increased following the transfusion (range, 40-60 before and 80-320 on day 7). ARDS resolved in 4 patients at 12 days after transfusion, and 3 patients were weaned from mechanical ventilation within 2 weeks of treatment. Of the 5 patients, 3 have been discharged from the hospital (length of stay: 53, 51, and 55 days), and 2 are in stable condition at 37 days after transfusion. Conclusions and Relevance: In this preliminary uncontrolled case series of 5 critically ill patients with COVID-19 and ARDS, administration of convalescent plasma containing neutralizing antibody was followed by improvement in their clinical status. The limited sample size and study design preclude a definitive statement about the potential effectiveness of this treatment, and these observations require evaluation in clinical trials. ",
        "Trial of Nemolizumab in Moderate-to-Severe Prurigo Nodularis. BACKGROUND: Prurigo nodularis is a chronic pruritic skin disease with multiple nodular skin lesions. Nemolizumab is a monoclonal antibody targeting the interleukin-31 receptor, which is involved in the pathogenesis of prurigo nodularis. METHODS: We conducted a 12-week, randomized, double-blind, phase 2 trial of nemolizumab (at a dose of 0.5 mg per kilogram of body weight) administered subcutaneously at baseline, week 4, and week 8, as compared with placebo, in patients with moderate-to-severe prurigo nodularis and severe pruritus. Moderate-to-severe prurigo nodularis was defined as 20 or more nodules, and severe pruritus was defined as a mean score of at least 7 for the worst daily intensity of pruritus on the numerical rating scale (scores range from 0 [no itch] to 10 [worst itch imaginable]). The primary outcome was the percent change from baseline in the mean peak score for pruritus on the numerical rating scale at week 4. Secondary outcomes included additional measures of itching and disease severity. Safety assessments were performed through week 18. RESULTS: A total of 70 patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive nemolizumab (34 patients) or placebo (36). The initial pruritus score on the numerical rating scale was 8.4 in each group. At week 4, the peak pruritus score on the numerical rating scale was reduced from baseline by 4.5 points (change, -53.0%) in the nemolizumab group, as compared with a reduction of 1.7 points (change, -20.2%) in the placebo group (difference, -32.8 percentage points; 95% confidence interval, -46.8 to -18.8; P<0.001). Results for secondary outcomes were in the same direction as for the primary outcome. Nemolizumab was associated with gastrointestinal symptoms (abdominal pain and diarrhea) and musculoskeletal symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Nemolizumab resulted in a greater reduction in pruritus and severity of skin lesions than placebo in patients with prurigo nodularis but was associated with adverse events. Larger and longer trials are needed to determine the durability and safety of nemolizumab for the treatment of prurigo nodularis. (Funded by Galderma; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT03181503.). ",
        "Mechanical, Team-Focused, Video-Reviewed Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation Improves Return of Spontaneous Circulation After Emergency Department Implementation. Background Outcomes in cardiac arrest remain suboptimal. Mechanical cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) has not demonstrated clear clinical benefit; however, video review provides the capability to monitor CPR quality and provide constructive feedback to individuals and teams to improve their performance. The aim of our study was to evaluate cardiac arrest outcomes before and after initiation of a mechanical, team-focused, video-reviewed CPR intervention. Methods and Results In 2018, our emergency department began using mechanical CPR; a new team-focused strategy with nurse-led Advanced Cardiovascular Life Support; and biweekly, multidisciplinary video review of cardiac arrests. A revised approach to resuscitation was generated from a performance improvement session, and in situ simulation was used to disseminate our approach. The primary outcome of this study was the return of spontaneous circulation rate before and after our mechanical, team-focused, video-reviewed CPR intervention. Secondary outcomes included survival to admission and discharge. Multivariable logistic regression modeling was used. The pre- and postintervention groups were similar at baseline. A total of 248 patients were included in our study (97 before and 151 after mechanical, team-focused, video-reviewed CPR). Return of spontaneous circulation was higher in the intervention group (41% versus 26%; P=0.014). There were nonsignificant increases in survival to admission (26% versus 20%; P=0.257) and survival to discharge (7% versus 3%; P=0.163). After controlling for covariates, the odds of return of spontaneous circulation remained higher after the intervention (odds ratio, 2.11; 95% CI, 1.14-3.89). Conclusions Implementation of our mechanical, team-focused, video-reviewed CPR intervention for cardiac arrest patients in our emergency department improved return of spontaneous circulation rates. Survival to hospital admission and discharge did not improve. ",
        "Early puberty and risk for type 2 diabetes in men. AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: The association between pubertal timing and type 2 diabetes, independent of prepubertal BMI, is not fully understood. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the association between pubertal timing and risk of adult type 2 diabetes, independent of prepubertal BMI, in Swedish men. METHODS: We included 30,697 men who had data for BMI at age 8 and 20\u00a0years and age at Peak Height Velocity (PHV), an objective assessment of pubertal timing, available from the BMI Epidemiology Study Gothenburg (BEST Gothenburg), Sweden. Information on type 2 diabetes (n\u2009=\u20091851) was retrieved from the Swedish National Patient Register. HRs and 95% CIs were estimated by Cox regression analysis. We observed violations of the assumption of proportional hazards for the association between age at PHV and the risk of type 2 diabetes and therefore split the follow-up period at the median age of type 2 diabetes diagnosis (57.2\u00a0years of age) to define early (\u226457.2\u00a0years) and late (>57.2\u00a0years) type 2 diabetes diagnosis. RESULTS: Age at PHV was inversely associated with both early (HR 1.28 per year decrease in age at PHV, 95% CI 1.21, 1.36) and late (HR 1.13, 95% CI 1.06, 1.19) type 2 diabetes. After adjustment for childhood BMI, the associations between age at PHV and both early (HR 1.24, 95% CI 1.17, 1.31) and late (HR 1.11, 95% CI 1.05, 1.17) type 2 diabetes were similar. Moreover, early age at PHV predicted insulin treatment of type 2 diabetes (OR 1.25 per year decrease in age at PHV, 95% CI 1.17, 1.33). Assuming a higher risk among those with an age at PHV below the median, the population attributable factor indicates that 15% fewer of the diagnosed individuals would have developed type 2 diabetes had they not reached puberty early. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: These findings indicate that early puberty may be a novel independent risk factor for type 2 diabetes. ",
        "Association of Long-term Exposure to Elevated Lipoprotein(a) Levels With Parental Life Span, Chronic Disease-Free Survival, and Mortality Risk: A Mendelian Randomization Analysis. Importance: Elevated lipoprotein(a) (Lp[a]) levels are associated with atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases. The association between high Lp(a) levels and human longevity phenotypes is, however, controversial. Objective: To examine whether genetically determined Lp(a) levels are associated with parental life span and chronic disease-free survival (health span) and the association between Lp(a) levels and long-term, all-cause mortality risk. Design, Setting, and Participants: In this genetic association study, cross-sectional mendelian randomization (UK Biobank [2006-2010] and LifeGen Consortium) and prospective analyses (European Prospective Investigation Into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC)-Norfolk [1993-1997, with patients followed up to 2016]) were conducted using individual-level data on 139\u202f362 participants. The association between a weighted genetic risk score of 26 independent single-nucleotide polymorphisms at the LPA locus on parental life span using individual participant data from the UK Biobank, as well as with summary statistics of a genome-wide association study of more than 1 million life spans (UK Biobank and LifeGen), were examined. The association between these single-nucleotide polymorphisms and the age at the end of the health span was tested using summary statistics of a previous genome-wide association study in the UK Biobank. The association between Lp(a) levels and all-cause mortality in the EPIC-Norfolk study was also investigated. Data were analyzed from December 2018 to December 2019. Exposures: Genetically determined and measured Lp(a) levels. Main Outcomes and Measures: Parental life span, health span, and all-cause mortality. Results: In 139\u202f362 white British participants (mean [SD] age, 62.8 [3.9] years; 52% women) from the UK Biobank, increases in the genetic risk score (weighted for a 50-mg/dL increase in Lp[a] levels) were inversely associated with a high parental life span (odds ratio, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.89-0.94; P\u2009=\u20092.7\u2009\u00d7\u200910-8). Using the Egger-mendelian randomization method, a negative association between LPA single-nucleotide polymorphisms and parental life span (mean [SD] Egger-mendelian randomization slope, -0.0019 [0.0002]; P\u2009=\u20092.22\u2009\u00d7\u200910-18) and health span (-0.0019 [0.0003]; P\u2009=\u20093.00\u2009\u00d7\u200910-13) was noted. In 18\u202f720 participants from EPIC-Norfolk (5686 cases), the mortality risk for those with Lp(a) levels equal to or above the 95th percentile was equivalent to being 1.5 years older in chronologic age (\u03b2 coefficient [SE], 0.194 [0.064]). Conclusions and Relevance: The results of this study suggest a potential causal effect of absolute Lp(a) levels on human longevity as defined by parental life span, health span, and all-cause mortality. The results also provide a rationale for trials of Lp(a)-lowering therapy in individuals with high Lp(a) levels. ",
        "Pubertal Suppression for Transgender Youth and Risk of Suicidal Ideation. BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogues are commonly prescribed to suppress endogenous puberty for transgender adolescents. There are limited data regarding the mental health benefits of this treatment. Our objective for this study was to examine associations between access to pubertal suppression during adolescence and adult mental health outcomes. METHODS: Using a cross-sectional survey of 20\u2009619 transgender adults aged 18 to 36 years, we examined self-reported history of pubertal suppression during adolescence. Using multivariable logistic regression, we examined associations between access to pubertal suppression and adult mental health outcomes, including multiple measures of suicidality. RESULTS: Of the sample, 16.9% reported that they ever wanted pubertal suppression as part of their gender-related care. Their mean age was 23.4 years, and 45.2% were assigned male sex at birth. Of them, 2.5% received pubertal suppression. After adjustment for demographic variables and level of family support for gender identity, those who received treatment with pubertal suppression, when compared with those who wanted pubertal suppression but did not receive it, had lower odds of lifetime suicidal ideation (adjusted odds ratio = 0.3; 95% confidence interval = 0.2-0.6). CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study in which associations between access to pubertal suppression and suicidality are examined. There is a significant inverse association between treatment with pubertal suppression during adolescence and lifetime suicidal ideation among transgender adults who ever wanted this treatment. These results align with past literature, suggesting that pubertal suppression for transgender adolescents who want this treatment is associated with favorable mental health outcomes. ",
        "Associations of Fish Oil Supplement Use With Testicular Function in Young Men. Importance: Many young men have poor semen quality, and the causes are often unknown. Supplement intake of \u03c9-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid has been found to improve semen quality among men with infertility, but the association with semen quality among healthy men is unknown. Objective: To determine if intake of \u03c9-3 fatty acid supplements is associated with testicular function as measured by semen quality and reproductive hormone levels among healthy men. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cross-sectional study included young Danish men from the general population recruited between January 1, 2012, and December 31, 2017, at compulsory examinations to determine their fitness for military service. Young unselected men were approached after the examination and invited to participate in a study of reproductive function, regardless of their fitness for military service. Data analysis was conducted from September 1, 2018, to June 30, 2019. Exposures: Intake of supplements, including fish oil, during the past 3 months. Main Outcomes and Measures: Semen quality, measured as volume, concentration, total sperm count, percentage of morphologically normal spermatozoa, and motility, and serum reproductive hormone levels, measured as follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, testosterone, free testosterone, and inhibin B levels. Results: Among 1679 young Danish men (median [interquartile range] age, 18.9 [18.7-19.4] years) recruited to participate, 98 men (5.8%) reported use of fish oil supplements during the past 3 months, of whom 53 (54.1%) reported intake on 60 or more days. After adjustment and compared with men with no supplement intake, men with fish oil supplement intake on fewer than 60 days had semen volume that was 0.38 (95% CI, -0.03 to 0.80) mL higher, and men with fish oil supplement intake on 60 or more days had semen volume that was 0.64 (95% CI, 0.15 to 1.12) mL higher (P for trend\u2009<\u2009.001). Similarly, testicular size in men with supplement intake on fewer than 60 days was 0.8 (95% CI, -0.2 to 1.9) mL larger and in men with fish oil supplement intake on 60 or more days was 1.5 (95% CI, 0.2 to 2.8) mL larger compared with men with no supplement intake (P for trend\u2009=\u2009.007). After adjustment, men with fish oil supplement intake had a 20% (95% CI, 9%-31%) lower follicle-stimulating hormone level and 16% (95% CI, 8%-24%) lower luteinizing hormone level compared with men with no supplement intake. There were no associations of intake of other supplements with measures of testicular function. Conclusions and Relevance: These findings suggest that intake of fish oil supplements was associated with better testicular function, which is less likely to be due to confounding by indication, as no associations of intake of other supplements with testicular function were found. This cross-sectional study did not examine the actual content of \u03c9-3 fatty acids in the supplements; therefore, these findings need confirmation in well-designed randomized clinical trials among unselected men.

        "An internet-based mind/body intervention to mitigate distress in women experiencing infertility: A randomized pilot trial. OBJECTIVE: To determine if an internet-based mind/body program would lead to participants experiencing infertility (1) being willing to be recruited and randomized and (2) accepting and being ready to engage in a fertility-specific intervention. Secondary exploratory goals were to examine reduced distress over the course of the intervention and increased likelihood to conceive. METHODS: This was a pilot randomized controlled feasibility trial with a between-groups, repeated measure design. Seventy-one women self-identified as nulliparous and meeting criteria for infertility. Participants were randomized to the internet-based version of the Mind/Body Program for Fertility or wait-list control group and asked to complete pre-, mid- and post-assessments. Primary outcomes include retention rates, number of modules completed, and satisfaction with intervention. Secondary exploratory outcomes sought to provide preliminary data on the impact of the program on distress (anxiety and depression) and self-reported pregnancy rates relative to a quasi-control group. RESULTS: The retention, adherence, and satisfaction rates were comparable to those reported in other internet-based RCTs. Although time between pre- and post-assessment differed between groups, using intent-to-treat analyses, women in the intervention group (relative to the wait-list group) had significant reduction in distress (anxiety, p = .003; depression, p = .007; stress, p = .041 fertility-social, p = .018; fertility-sexual, p = .006), estimated as medium-to-large effect sizes (ds = 0.45 to 0.86). The odds of becoming pregnant was 4.47 times higher for the intervention group participants as compared to the wait-list group, OR 95% CI [1.56, 12.85], p = .005 and occurred earlier. The findings suggest that the research design and program specific to this population are feasible and acceptable. Replication efforts with an active control group are needed to verify distress reduction and conception promotion findings. ",
        "Association of Subclinical Hypothyroidism and Cardiovascular Disease With Mortality. Importance: Subclinical hypothyroidism is a common clinical entity among US adults associated in some studies with an increase in the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and mortality. However, the extent to which CVD mediates the association between elevated serum thyrotropin (TSH) and mortality has not yet been well established or sufficiently quantified. Objective: To elucidate the extent to which subclinical hypothyroidism, elevated serum TSH and normal serum free thyroxine, or high-normal TSH concentrations (ie, upper normative-range TSH concentrations) are associated with mortality through CVD among US adults. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study relied on representative samples of US adults enrolled in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey in 2001 to 2002, 2007 to 2008, 2009 to 2010, and 2011 to 2012 and their mortality data through 2015. Data were analyzed from January to August 2019. Main Outcomes and Measures: Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to investigate associations between the TSH concentration category (subclinical hypothyroidism or tertiles of serum TSH concentrations within the reference range; low-normal TSH, 0.34-1.19 mIU/L; middle-normal TSH, 1.20-1.95 mIU/L; and high-normal TSH, 1.96-5.60 mIU/L) and all-cause mortality. Mediation analysis was used within the counterfactual framework to estimate natural direct associations (not through CVD) and indirect associations (through CVD). Results: Of 9020 participants, 4658 (51.6%) were men; the mean (SD) age was 49.4 (17.8) years. Throughout follow-up (median [interquartile range], 7.3 [5.4-8.3] years), serum thyroid function test results consistent with subclinical hypothyroidism and high-normal TSH concentrations were both associated with increased all-cause mortality (subclinical hypothyroidism: hazard ratio, 1.90; 95% CI, 1.14-3.19; high-normal TSH: hazard ratio, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.07-1.73) compared with the middle-normal TSH group. Cardiovascular disease mediated 14.3% and 5.9% of the associations of subclinical hypothyroidism and high-normal TSH with all-cause mortality, respectively, with the CVD mediation being most pronounced in women (7.5%-13.7% of the association) and participants aged 60 years and older (6.0%-14.8% of the association). Conclusions and Relevance: In this study, CVD mediated the associations of subclinical hypothyroidism and high-normal TSH concentrations with all-cause mortality in the US general population. Further studies are needed to examine the clinical benefit of thyroid hormone replacement therapy targeted to a middle-normal TSH concentration or active CVD screening for people with elevated TSH concentrations.

        "Studies of insulin and proinsulin in pancreas and serum support the existence of aetiopathological endotypes of type 1 diabetes associated with age at diagnosis. AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: It is unclear whether type 1 diabetes is a single disease or if endotypes exist. Our aim was to use a unique collection of pancreas samples recovered soon after disease onset to resolve this issue. METHODS: Immunohistological analysis was used to determine the distribution of proinsulin and insulin in the islets of pancreas samples recovered soon after type 1 diabetes onset (<2\u00a0years) from young people diagnosed at age <7\u00a0years, 7-12\u00a0years and \u226513\u00a0years. The patterns were correlated with the insulitis profiles in the inflamed islets of the same groups of individuals. C-peptide levels and the proinsulin:C-peptide ratio were measured in the circulation of a cohort of living patients with longer duration of disease but who were diagnosed in these same age ranges. RESULTS: Distinct patterns of proinsulin localisation were seen in the islets of people with recent-onset type 1 diabetes, which differed markedly between children diagnosed at <7\u00a0years and those diagnosed at \u226513\u00a0years. Proinsulin processing was aberrant in most residual insulin-containing islets of the younger group but this was much less evident in the group \u226513\u00a0years (p\u2009<\u20090.0001). Among all individuals (including children in the middle [7-12\u00a0years] range) aberrant proinsulin processing correlated with the assigned immune cell profiles defined by analysis of the lymphocyte composition of islet infiltrates. C-peptide levels were much lower in individuals diagnosed at <7\u00a0years than in those diagnosed at \u226513\u00a0years (median <3\u00a0pmol/l, IQR <3 to <3 vs 34.5\u00a0pmol/l, IQR <3-151; p\u2009<\u20090.0001), while the median proinsulin:C-peptide ratio was increased in those with age of onset <7\u00a0years compared with people diagnosed aged \u226513\u00a0years (0.18, IQR 0.10-0.31) vs 0.01, IQR 0.009-0.10\u00a0pmol/l; p\u2009<\u20090.0001). CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Among those with type 1 diabetes diagnosed under the age of 30\u00a0years, there are histologically distinct endotypes that correlate with age at diagnosis. Recognition of such differences should inform the design of future immunotherapeutic interventions designed to arrest disease progression. ",
        "Effect of Multimodal Prehabilitation vs Postoperative Rehabilitation on 30-Day Postoperative Complications for Frail Patients Undergoing Resection of Colorectal Cancer: A Randomized Clinical Trial. Importance: Research supports use of prehabilitation to optimize physical status before and after colorectal cancer resection, but its effect on postoperative complications remains unclear. Frail patients are a target for prehabilitation interventions owing to increased risk for poor postoperative outcomes. Objective: To assess the extent to which a prehabilitation program affects 30-day postoperative complications in frail patients undergoing colorectal cancer resection compared with postoperative rehabilitation. Design, Setting, and Participants: This single-blind, parallel-arm, superiority randomized clinical trial recruited patients undergoing colorectal cancer resection from September 7, 2015, through June 19, 2019. Patients were followed up for 4 weeks before surgery and 4 weeks after surgery at 2 university-affiliated tertiary hospitals. A total of 418 patients 65 years or older were assessed for eligibility. Of these, 298 patients were excluded (not frail [n\u2009=\u2009290], unable to exercise [n\u2009=\u20093], and planned neoadjuvant treatment [n\u2009=\u20095]), and 120 frail patients (Fried Frailty Index,\u22652) were randomized. Ten patients were excluded after randomization because they refused surgery (n\u2009=\u20093), died before surgery (n\u2009=\u20093), had no cancer (n\u2009=\u20091), had surgery without bowel resection (n\u2009=\u20091), or were switched to palliative care (n\u2009=\u20092). Hence, 110 patients were included in the intention-to-treat analysis (55 in the prehabilitation [Prehab] and 55 in the rehabilitation [Rehab] groups). Data were analyzed from July 25 through August 21, 2019. Interventions: Multimodal program involving exercise, nutritional, and psychological interventions initiated before (Prehab group) or after (Rehab group) surgery. All patients were treated within a standardized enhanced recovery pathway. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome included the Comprehensive Complications Index measured at 30 days after surgery. Secondary outcomes were 30-day overall and severe complications, primary and total length of hospital stay, 30-day emergency department visits and hospital readmissions, recovery of walking capacity, and patient-reported outcome measures. Results: Of 110 patients randomized, mean (SD) age was 78 (7) years; 52 (47.3%) were men and 58 (52.7%) were women; 31 (28.2%) had rectal cancer; and 87 (79.1%) underwent minimally invasive surgery. There was no between-group difference in the primary outcome measure, 30-day Comprehensive Complications Index (adjusted mean difference, -3.2; 95% CI, -11.8 to 5.3; P\u2009=\u2009.45). Secondary outcome measures were also not different between groups. Conclusions and Relevance: In frail patients undergoing colorectal cancer resection (predominantly minimally invasive) within an enhanced recovery pathway, a multimodal prehabilitation program did not affect postoperative outcomes. Alternative strategies should be considered to optimize treatment of frail patients preoperatively. Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02502760. ",
        "Asymptomatic and Presymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 Infections in Residents of a Long-Term Care Skilled Nursing Facility - King County, Washington, March 2020. Older adults are susceptible to severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outcomes as a consequence of their age and, in some cases, underlying health conditions (1). A COVID-19 outbreak in a long-term care skilled nursing facility (SNF) in King County, Washington that was first identified on February 28, 2020, highlighted the potential for rapid spread among residents of these types of facilities (2). On March 1, a health care provider at a second long-term care skilled nursing facility (facility A) in King County, Washington, had a positive test result for SARS-CoV-2, the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19, after working while symptomatic on February 26 and 28. By March 6, seven residents of this second facility were symptomatic and had positive test results for SARS-CoV-2. On March 13, CDC performed symptom assessments and SARS-CoV-2 testing for 76 (93%) of the 82 facility A residents to evaluate the utility of symptom screening for identification of COVID-19 in SNF residents. Residents were categorized as asymptomatic or symptomatic at the time of testing, based on the absence or presence of fever, cough, shortness of breath, or other symptoms on the day of testing or during the preceding 14 days. Among 23 (30%) residents with positive test results, 10 (43%) had symptoms on the date of testing, and 13 (57%) were asymptomatic. Seven days after testing, 10 of these 13 previously asymptomatic residents had developed symptoms and were recategorized as presymptomatic at the time of testing. The reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing cycle threshold (Ct) values indicated large quantities of viral RNA in asymptomatic, presymptomatic, and symptomatic residents, suggesting the potential for transmission regardless of symptoms. Symptom-based screening in SNFs could fail to identify approximately half of residents with COVID-19. Long-term care facilities should take proactive steps to prevent introduction of SARS-CoV-2 (3). Once a confirmed case is identified in an SNF, all residents should be placed on isolation precautions if possible (3), with considerations for extended use or reuse of personal protective equipment (PPE) as needed (4).

        "Trends in Incidence of Early-Onset Colorectal Cancer in the United States Among Those Approaching Screening Age. Importance: Early-onset colorectal cancer incidence rates among patients aged 45 to 49 years have been considered much lower compared with the rates among patients aged 50 to 54 years, prompting debate about earlier screening benefits at 45 years. However, the observed incidence rates in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) registries may underestimate colorectal cancer case burdens in those younger than 50 years compared with those older than 50 years because average-risk screening is generally not performed to detect preclinical cases of colorectal cancer. Finding steep incidence increases of invasive stage (beyond in situ) cases of colorectal cancer from age 49 to 50 years would be consistent with high rates of preexisting, undetected cancers in younger patients ultimately receiving a diagnosis of colorectal cancer after undergoing screening at 50 years. Objective: To assess the preclinical burden of colorectal cancer by analyzing its incidence in 1-year age increments, focusing on the transition between ages 49 and 50 years. Design, Setting, and Participants: Data from the SEER 18 registries, representing 28% of the US population, were used to conduct a cross-sectional study of colorectal cancer incidence rates from January 1, 2000, to December 31, 2015, in 1-year age increments (ages 30-60 years) stratified by US region (South, West, Northeast, and Midwest), sex, race, disease stage, and tumor location. Statistical analysis was conducted from November 1, 2018, to December 15, 2019. Main Outcomes and Measures: Incidence rates of colorectal cancer. Results: A total of 170\u202f434 cases of colorectal cancer were analyzed among 165\u202f160 patients (92\u202f247 men [55.9%]; mean [SD] age, 51.6 [6.7] years). Steep increases in the incidence of colorectal cancer in the SEER 18 registries were found from 49 to 50 years of age (46.1% increase: 34.9 [95% CI, 34.1-35.8] to 51.0 [95% CI, 50.0-52.1] per 100\u202f000 population). Steep rate increases from 49 to 50 years of age were also seen in all US regions, men and women, white and black populations, and in colon and rectal cancers. The rate ratio incidence increase in the SEER 18 registries from 49 to 50 years of age (1.46 [95% CI, 1.43-1.51]) was significantly higher than earlier 1-year age transitions. Steep rate increases in the SEER 18 registries were found from 49 to 50 years of age in localized-stage (75.9% increase: 11.2 [95% CI, 10.7-11.7] to 19.7 [95% CI, 19.0-20.3] per 100\u202f000) and regional-stage (30.3% increase: 13.2 [95% CI, 12.7-13.8] to 17.2 [95% CI, 16.7-17.8] per 100\u202f000) colorectal cancers. A total of 8799 of the 9474 cases (92.9%) of colorectal cancer in the SEER 18 registries from 2000 to 2015 that were diagnosed among individuals aged 50 years were invasive. Conclusions and Relevance: Steep incidence increases between 49 and 50 years of age are consistent with previously undetected colorectal cancers diagnosed via screening uptake at 50 years. These cancers are not reflected in observed rates of colorectal cancer in the SEER registries among individuals younger than 50 years. Hence, using observed incidence rates from 45 to 49 years of age alone to assess potential outcomes of earlier screening may underestimate cancer prevention benefits. ",
        "A Multi-Institutional Cohort of Therapy-Associated Polyposis in Childhood and Young Adulthood Cancer Survivors. Prior small reports have postulated a link between gastrointestinal polyposis and childhood and young adulthood cancer (CYAC) treatment (therapy-associated polyposis; TAP), but this remains a poorly understood phenomenon. The aim of this study was to describe the phenotypic spectrum of TAP in a multi-institutional cohort. TAP cases were identified from eight high-risk cancer centers. Cases were defined as patients with \u226510 gastrointestinal polyps without known causative germline alteration or hereditary colorectal cancer predisposition syndrome who had a history of prior treatment with chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy for CYAC. A total of 34 TAP cases were included (original CYAC: 27 Hodgkin lymphoma, three neuroblastoma, one acute myeloid leukemia, one medulloblastoma, one nephroblastoma, and one non-Hodgkin lymphoma). Gastrointestinal polyposis was first detected at a median of 27 years (interquartile range, 20-33) after CYAC treatment. A total of 12 of 34 (35%) TAP cases had \u226550 colorectal polyps. A total of 32 of 34 (94%) had >1 histologic polyp type. A total of 25 of 34 (74%) had clinical features suggestive of \u22651 colorectal cancer predisposition syndrome [e.g., attenuated familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), serrated polyposis syndrome, extracolonic manifestations of FAP, mismatch repair-deficient colorectal cancer, or hamartomatous polyposis] including 8 of 34 (24%) with features of multiple such syndromes. TAP is an apparently acquired phenomenon that should be considered in patients who develop significant polyposis without known causative germline alteration but who have had prior treatment for a CYAC. Patients with TAP have features that may mimic various hereditary colorectal cancer syndromes, suggesting multiple concurrent biologic mechanisms, and recognition of this diagnosis may have implications for cancer risk and screening.

        "Continuous Wearable Monitoring Analytics Predict Heart Failure Hospitalization: The LINK-HF Multicenter Study. BACKGROUND: Implantable cardiac sensors have shown promise in reducing rehospitalization for heart failure (HF), but the efficacy of noninvasive approaches has not been determined. The objective of this study was to determine the accuracy of noninvasive remote monitoring in predicting HF rehospitalization. METHODS: The LINK-HF study (Multisensor Non-invasive Remote Monitoring for Prediction of Heart Failure Exacerbation) examined the performance of a personalized analytical platform using continuous data streams to predict rehospitalization after HF admission. Study subjects were monitored for up to 3 months using a disposable multisensor patch placed on the chest that recorded physiological data. Data were uploaded continuously via smartphone to a cloud analytics platform. Machine learning was used to design a prognostic algorithm to detect HF exacerbation. Clinical events were formally adjudicated. RESULTS: One hundred subjects aged 68.4\u00b110.2 years (98% male) were enrolled. After discharge, the analytical platform derived a personalized baseline model of expected physiological values. Differences between baseline model estimated vital signs and actual monitored values were used to trigger a clinical alert. There were 35 unplanned nontrauma hospitalization events, including 24 worsening HF events. The platform was able to detect precursors of hospitalization for HF exacerbation with 76% to 88% sensitivity and 85% specificity. Median time between initial alert and readmission was 6.5 (4.2-13.7) days. CONCLUSIONS: Multivariate physiological telemetry from a wearable sensor can provide accurate early detection of impending rehospitalization with a predictive accuracy comparable to implanted devices. The clinical efficacy and generalizability of this low-cost noninvasive approach to rehospitalization mitigation should be further tested. Registration: URL: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov.

        "Family History of Gastric Cancer and Helicobacter pylori Treatment. BACKGROUND: Helicobacter pylori infection and a family history of gastric cancer are the main risk factors for gastric cancer. Whether treatment to eradicate H. pylori can reduce the risk of gastric cancer in persons with a family history of gastric cancer in first-degree relatives is unknown. METHODS: In this single-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, we screened 3100 first-degree relatives of patients with gastric cancer. We randomly assigned 1838 participants with H. pylori infection to receive either eradication therapy (lansoprazole [30 mg], amoxicillin [1000 mg], and clarithromycin [500 mg], each taken twice daily for 7 days) or placebo. The primary outcome was development of gastric cancer. A prespecified secondary outcome was development of gastric cancer according to H. pylori eradication status, assessed during the follow-up period. RESULTS: A total of 1676 participants were included in the modified intention-to-treat population for the analysis of the primary outcome (832 in the treatment group and 844 in the placebo group). During a median follow-up of 9.2 years, gastric cancer developed in 10 participants (1.2%) in the treatment group and in 23 (2.7%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.45; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.21 to 0.94; P\u2009=\u20090.03 by log-rank test). Among the 10 participants in the treatment group in whom gastric cancer developed, 5 (50.0%) had persistent H. pylori infection. Gastric cancer developed in 0.8% of participants (5 of 608) in whom H. pylori infection was eradicated and in 2.9% of participants (28 of 979) who had persistent infection (hazard ratio, 0.27; 95% CI, 0.10 to 0.70). Adverse events were mild and were more common in the treatment group than in the placebo group (53.0% vs. 19.1%; P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Among persons with H. pylori infection who had a family history of gastric cancer in first-degree relatives, H. pylori eradication treatment reduced the risk of gastric cancer.

        "Evaluation of the Association Between Gastric Acid Suppression and Risk of Intestinal Colonization With Multidrug-Resistant Microorganisms: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis. Importance: Acid suppressants inhibit gastric acid secretion and disrupt the intestinal microbiome. Whether acid suppression increases the risk of colonization with multidrug-resistant microorganisms (MDROs) is unclear. Objectives: To systematically examine the association of use of acid suppressants with the risk of colonization with MDROs and to perform a meta-analysis of current evidence. Data Sources: PubMed, Embase, the Web of Science Core Collection, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched from database inception through July 8, 2019. Study Selection: Study selection was performed independently by 2 authors (R.P.J.W. and C.M.J.E.V.-G.) on the basis of predefined selection criteria; conflicts were resolved by consensus or by an adjudicator (K.v.D.). Human observational studies (case control, cohort, and cross-sectional) and clinical trial designs were selected if they quantified the risk of MDRO colonization in users of acid suppressants in comparison with nonusers. Data Extraction and Synthesis: The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) and Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) recommendations were followed. Data were extracted independently by the same 2 authors, and adjudication was conducted when necessary. Risk of bias was assessed according to a modified Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Pooled odds ratios (ORs) were estimated using random-effects models; heterogeneity was evaluated using the I2 method. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome measure was intestinal colonization with MDROs of the Enterobacterales order (producing extended-spectrum \u03b2-lactamases, carbapenemases, or plasmid-mediated AmpC \u03b2-lactamases), vancomycin-resistant enterococci, methicillin-resistant or vancomycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, or multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas or Acinetobacter species. Results: A total of 26 observational studies including 29\u202f382 patients (11\u202f439 [38.9%] acid suppressant users) met the selection criteria. Primary meta-analysis of 12 studies including 22\u202f305 patients that provided adjusted ORs showed that acid suppression increased the odds of intestinal carriage of MDROs of the Enterobacterales order and of vancomycin-resistant enterococci by roughly 75% (OR\u2009=\u20091.74; 95% CI, 1.40-2.16; I2\u2009=\u200968%). The odds were concordant with the secondary pooled analysis of all 26 studies (OR\u2009=\u20091.70; 95% CI, 1.44-1.99; I2\u2009=\u200954%). Heterogeneity was partially explained by variations in study setting and the type of acid suppression. Conclusions and Relevance: Acid suppression is associated with increased odds of MDRO colonization. Notwithstanding the limitations of observational studies, the association is plausible and is strengthened by controlling for confounders. In view of the global increase in antimicrobial resistance, stewardship to reduce unnecessary use of acid suppressants may help to prevent MDRO colonization. ",
        "Association of Aspirin with Hepatocellular Carcinoma and Liver-Related Mortality. BACKGROUND: More information is needed about the long-term effects of low-dose aspirin (\u2264160 mg) on incident hepatocellular carcinoma, liver-related mortality, and gastrointestinal bleeding in persons with chronic hepatitis B or hepatitis C virus infection. METHODS: Using nationwide Swedish registries, we identified all adults who received a diagnosis of chronic hepatitis B or hepatitis C from 2005 through 2015 and who did not have a history of aspirin use (50,275 patients). Patients who were starting to take low-dose aspirin (14,205 patients) were identified by their first filled prescriptions for 90 or more consecutive doses of aspirin. We constructed a propensity score and applied inverse probability of treatment weighting to balance baseline characteristics between groups. Using Cox proportional-hazards regression modeling, we estimated the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma and liver-related mortality, accounting for competing events. RESULTS: With a median of 7.9 years of follow-up, the estimated cumulative incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma was 4.0% among aspirin users and 8.3% among nonusers of aspirin (difference, -4.3 percentage points; 95% confidence interval [CI], -5.0 to -3.6; adjusted hazard ratio, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.62 to 0.76). This inverse association appeared to be duration-dependent; as compared with short-term use (3 months to <1 year), the adjusted hazard ratios were 0.90 (95% CI, 0.76 to 1.06) for 1 to less than 3 years of use, 0.66 (95% CI, 0.56 to 0.78) for 3 to less than 5 years of use, and 0.57 (95% CI, 0.42 to 0.70) for 5 or more years of use. Ten-year liver-related mortality was 11.0% among aspirin users and 17.9% among nonusers (difference, -6.9 percentage points [95% CI, -8.1 to -5.7]; adjusted hazard ratio, 0.73 [95% CI, 0.67 to 0.81]). However, the 10-year risk of gastrointestinal bleeding did not differ significantly between users and nonusers of aspirin (7.8% and 6.9%, respectively; difference, 0.9 percentage points; 95% CI, -0.6 to 2.4). CONCLUSIONS: In a nationwide study of patients with chronic viral hepatitis in Sweden, use of low-dose aspirin was associated with a significantly lower risk of hepatocellular carcinoma and lower liver-related mortality than no use of aspirin, without a significantly higher risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.

        "Efficacy and Safety of Upadacitinib in a Randomized Trial of Patients With Crohn's Disease. BACKGROUND & AIMS: We evaluated the efficacy and safety of upadacitinib, an oral selective Janus kinase 1 inhibitor, in a randomized trial of patients with Crohn's disease (CD). METHODS: We performed a double-blind, phase 2 trial in adults with moderate to severe CD and inadequate response or intolerance to immunosuppressants or tumor necrosis factor antagonists. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1:1:1:1:1) to groups given placebo; or 3 mg, 6 mg, 12 mg, or 24 mg upadacitinib twice daily; or 24 mg upadacitinib once daily and were evaluated by ileocolonoscopy at weeks 12 or 16 of the induction period. Patients who completed week 16 were re-randomized to a 36-week period of maintenance therapy with upadacitinib. The primary endpoints were clinical remission at week 16 and endoscopic remission at week 12 or 16 using the multiple comparison procedure and modeling and the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test, with a 2-sided level of 10%. RESULTS: Among the 220 patients in the study, clinical remission was achieved by 13% of patients receiving 3 mg upadacitinib, 27% of patients receiving 6 mg upadacitinib (P < .1 vs placebo), 11% of patients receiving 12 mg upadacitinib, and 22% of patients receiving 24 mg upadacitinib twice daily, and by 14% of patients receiving 24 mg upadacitinib once daily, vs 11% of patients receiving placebo. Endoscopic remission was achieved by 10% (P < .1 vs placebo), 8%, 8% (P < .1 vs placebo), 22% (P < .01 vs placebo), and 14% (P < .05 vs placebo) of patients receiving upadacitinib, respectively, vs none of the patients receiving placebo. Endoscopic but not clinical remission increased with dose during the induction period. Efficacy was maintained for most endpoints through week 52. During the induction period, patients in the upadacitinib groups had higher incidences of infections and serious infections vs placebo. Patients in the twice daily 12 mg and 24 mg upadacitinib groups had significant increases in total, high-density lipoprotein, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, compared with patients in the placebo group. CONCLUSIONS: In a phase 2 trial of patients with CD, upadacitinib induced endoscopic remission in a significant proportion of patients compared with placebo. Upadacitinib's benefit/risk profile supports further development for treatment of CD. (Clinicaltrials.gov, Number: NCT02365649). ",
        "Vocal Biomarker Is Associated With Hospitalization and Mortality Among Heart Failure Patients. Background The purpose of this article is to evaluate the association of voice signal analysis with adverse outcome among patients with congestive heart failure (CHF). Methods and Results The study cohort included 10\u00a0583 patients who were registered to a call center of patients who had chronic conditions including CHF in Israel between 2013 and 2018. A total of 223 acoustic features were extracted from 20\u00a0s of speech for each patient. A biomarker was developed based on a training cohort of non-CHF patients (N=8316). The biomarker was tested on a mutually exclusive CHF study cohort (N=2267) and was evaluated as a continuous and ordinal (4 quartiles) variable. Median age of the CHF study population was 77 (interquartile range 68-83) and 63% were men. During a median follow-up of 20\u00a0months (interquartile range 9-34), 824 (36%) patients died. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed higher cumulative probability of death with increasing quartiles (23%, 29%, 38%, and 54%; P<0.001). Survival analysis with adjustment to known predictors of poor survival demonstrated that each SD increase in the biomarker was associated with a significant 32% increased risk of death during follow-up (95% CI, 1.24-1.41, P<0.001) and that compared with the lowest quartile, patients in the highest quartile were 96% more likely to die (95% CI, 1.59-2.42, P<0.001). The model consistently demonstrated an independent association of the biomarker with hospitalizations during follow-up (P<0.001). Conclusions Noninvasive vocal biomarker is associated with adverse outcome among CHF patients, suggesting a possible role for voice analysis in telemedicine and CHF patient care. ",
        "Short-term Outcomes After Robot-Assisted vs Open Pancreaticoduodenectomy After the Learning Curve. Importance: Robot-assisted pancreaticoduodenectomy (RPD) has been reported to be safe and feasible. As a new technique, RPD has a learning curve similar to that of other types of minimally invasive pancreatic surgery such as laparoscopic pancreaticoduodenectomy. To our knowledge, no reports exist on the outcomes of open pancreaticoduodenectomy (OPD) and RPD after the learning curve. Objective: To analyze and evaluate the actual advantages of RPD. Design, Setting, and Participants: Between May 2010 and December 2018, 450 patients underwent RPD in the Shanghai Ruijin Hospital affiliated with Shanghai Jiaotong University in Shanghai, China, a high-volume pancreatic disease center. According to our previous study, an important flexion point in the learning curve is 250 cases. Data on the last 200 RPD cases were collected from January 2017 to December 2018. During that period, 634 patients underwent OPD. These patients were divided into 2 groups, and propensity score matching was used to minimize bias. The demographic data and operative outcomes were collected and analyzed. Analysis began May 2019. Exposures: Robot-assisted pancreaticoduodenectomy and OPD. Main Outcomes and Measures: The short-term operative outcomes of RPD and OPD. Results: After 1:1 matching, 187 cases of RPD and OPD were recorded. In the RPD group, 78 patients (41.7%) were women, and the mean (SD) age was 60.9\u2009(11.4) years. In the OPD group, 80 patients (42.8%) were women, and the mean (SD) age was 60.1\u2009(10.8) years. Robot-assisted pancreaticoduodenectomy had advantages in operative time (mean [SD], 279.7\u2009[76.3] minutes vs 298.2\u2009[78.3] minutes; P\u2009=\u2009.02), estimated blood loss (mean [SD], 297.3\u2009[246.8] mL vs 415.2\u2009[497.9] mL; P\u2009=\u2009.002), and postoperative length of hospital stay (mean [SD], 22.4\u2009[16.7] days vs 26.1\u2009[16.3] days; P\u2009=\u2009.03). However, there was no significant difference in the R0 resection rate and incidence rate of postoperative complications, such as postoperative pancreatic fistula, bile leak, and delayed gastric emptying. The incidence rates of postoperative bleeding and reoperation in the RPD group were similar to those in the OPD group, with no statistically significant difference. Conclusions and Relevance: After passing the learning curve, RPD had advantages in operative time and blood loss compared with OPD. There were no differences in postoperative complications such as postoperative pancreatic fistula, bile leak, and delayed gastric emptying. However, patients recovered more quickly after RPD than after OPD. A prospective randomized clinical trial is needed in the future to verify these results. ",
        "Timing of Endoscopy for Acute Upper Gastrointestinal Bleeding. BACKGROUND: It is recommended that patients with acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding undergo endoscopy within 24 hours after gastroenterologic consultation. The role of endoscopy performed within time frames shorter than 24 hours has not been adequately defined. METHODS: To evaluate whether urgent endoscopy improves outcomes in patients predicted to be at high risk for further bleeding or death, we randomly assigned patients with overt signs of acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding and a Glasgow-Blatchford score of 12 or higher (scores range from 0 to 23, with higher scores indicating a higher risk of further bleeding or death) to undergo endoscopy within 6 hours (urgent-endoscopy group) or between 6 and 24 hours (early-endoscopy group) after gastroenterologic consultation. The primary end point was death from any cause within 30 days after randomization. RESULTS: A total of 516 patients were enrolled. The 30-day mortality was 8.9% (23 of 258 patients) in the urgent-endoscopy group and 6.6% (17 of 258) in the early-endoscopy group (difference, 2.3 percentage points; 95% confidence interval [CI], -2.3 to 6.9). Further bleeding within 30 days occurred in 28 patients (10.9%) in the urgent-endoscopy group and in 20 (7.8%) in the early-endoscopy group (difference, 3.1 percentage points; 95% CI, -1.9 to 8.1). Ulcers with active bleeding or visible vessels were found on initial endoscopy in 105 of the 158 patients (66.4%) with peptic ulcers in the urgent-endoscopy group and in 76 of 159 (47.8%) in the early-endoscopy group. Endoscopic hemostatic treatment was administered at initial endoscopy for 155 patients (60.1%) in the urgent-endoscopy group and for 125 (48.4%) in the early-endoscopy group. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding who were at high risk for further bleeding or death, endoscopy performed within 6 hours after gastroenterologic consultation was not associated with lower 30-day mortality than endoscopy performed between 6 and 24 hours after consultation.

        "Characteristics of Ocular Findings of Patients With Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Hubei Province, China. Importance: While the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has resulted in more than 100\u202f000 infected individuals in China and worldwide, there are few reports on the association of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) with ocular abnormalities. Understanding ocular manifestations of patients with COVID-19 by ophthalmologists and others may facilitate the diagnosis and prevention of transmission of the disease. Objective: To investigate ocular manifestations and viral prevalence in the conjunctiva of patients with COVID-19. Design, Setting, and Participants: In this case series, patients with COVID-19 treated from February 9 to 15, 2020, at a hospital center in Hubei province, China, were retrospectively reviewed for ocular manifestations. During the period of treatment, the ocular signs and symptoms as well as results of blood tests and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) from nasopharyngeal and conjunctival swabs for SARS-CoV-2 were noted and analyzed. Main Outcomes and Measures: Ocular signs and symptoms as well as results of blood tests and RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2. Results: Of the 38 included patients with clinically confirmed COVID-19, 25 (65.8%) were male, and the mean (SD) age was 65.8 (16.6) years. Among them, 28 patients (73.7%) had positive findings for COVID-19 on RT-PCR from nasopharyngeal swabs, and of these, 2 patients (5.2%) yielded positive findings for SARS-CoV-2 in their conjunctival as well as nasopharyngeal specimens. A total of 12 of 38 patients (31.6%; 95% CI, 17.5-48.7) had ocular manifestations consistent with conjunctivitis, including conjunctival hyperemia, chemosis, epiphora, or increased secretions. By univariate analysis, patients with ocular symptoms were more likely to have higher white blood cell and neutrophil counts and higher levels of procalcitonin, C-reactive protein, and lactate dehydrogenase than patients without ocular symptoms. In addition, 11 of 12 patients with ocular abnormalities (91.7%; 95% CI, 61.5-99.8) had positive results for SARS-CoV-2 on RT-PCR from nasopharyngeal swabs. Of these, 2 (16.7%) had positive results for SARS-CoV-2 on RT-PCR from both conjunctival and nasopharyngeal swabs. Conclusions and Relevance: In this study, one-third of patients with COVID-19 had ocular abnormalities, which frequently occurred in patients with more severe COVID-19. Although there is a low prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in tears, it is possible to transmit via the eyes. ",
        "Association of Functional, Cognitive, and Psychological Measures With 1-Year Mortality in Patients Undergoing Major Surgery. Importance: More older adults are undergoing major surgery despite the greater risk of postoperative mortality. Although measures, such as functional, cognitive, and psychological status, are known to be crucial components of health in older persons, they are not often used in assessing the risk of adverse postoperative outcomes in older adults. Objective: To determine the association between measures of physical, cognitive, and psychological function and 1-year mortality in older adults after major surgery. Design, Setting, and Participants: Retrospective analysis of a prospective cohort study of participants 66 years or older who were enrolled in the nationally representative Health and Retirement Study and underwent 1 of 3 types of major surgery. Exposures: Major surgery, including abdominal aortic aneurysm repair, coronary artery bypass graft, and colectomy. Main Outcomes and Measures: Our outcome was mortality within 1 year of major surgery. Our primary associated factors included functional, cognitive, and psychological factors: dependence in activities of daily living (ADL), dependence in instrumental ADL, inability to walk several blocks, cognitive status, and presence of depression. We adjusted for other demographic and clinical predictors. Results: Of 1341 participants, the mean (SD) participant age was 76 (6) years, 737 (55%) were women, 99 (7%) underwent abdominal aortic aneurysm repair, 686 (51%) coronary artery bypass graft, and 556 (42%) colectomy; 223 (17%) died within 1 year of their operation. After adjusting for age, comorbidity burden, surgical type, sex, race/ethnicity, wealth, income, and education, the following measures were significantly associated with 1-year mortality: more than 1 ADL dependence (29% vs 13%; adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 2.76; P\u2009=\u2009.001), more than 1 instrumental ADL dependence (21% vs 14%; aHR, 1.32; P\u2009=\u2009.05), the inability to walk several blocks (17% vs 11%; aHR, 1.64; P\u2009=\u2009.01), dementia (21% vs 12%; aHR, 1.91; P\u2009=\u2009.03), and depression (19% vs 12%; aHR, 1.72; P\u2009=\u2009.01). The risk of 1-year mortality increased within the increasing risk factors present (0 factors: 10.0%; 1 factor: 16.2%; 2 factors: 27.8%). Conclusions and Relevance: In this older adult cohort, 223 participants (17%) who underwent major surgery died within 1 year and poor function, cognition, and psychological well-being were significantly associated with mortality. Measures in function, cognition, and psychological well-being need to be incorporated into the preoperative assessment to enhance surgical decision-making and patient counseling. ",
        "Association of Maximal Extent of Resection of Contrast-Enhanced and Non-Contrast-Enhanced Tumor With Survival Within Molecular Subgroups of Patients With Newly Diagnosed Glioblastoma. Importance: Per the World Health Organization 2016 integrative classification, newly diagnosed glioblastomas are separated into isocitrate dehydrogenase gene 1 or 2 (IDH)-wild-type and IDH-mutant subtypes, with median patient survival of 1.2 and 3.6 years, respectively. Although maximal resection of contrast-enhanced (CE) tumor is associated with longer survival, the prognostic importance of maximal resection within molecular subgroups and the potential importance of resection of non-contrast-enhanced (NCE) disease is poorly understood. Objective: To assess the association of resection of CE and NCE tumors in conjunction with molecular and clinical information to develop a new road map for cytoreductive surgery. Design, Setting, and Participants: This retrospective, multicenter cohort study included a development cohort from the University of California, San Francisco (761 patients diagnosed from January 1, 1997, through December 31, 2017, with 9.6 years of follow-up) and validation cohorts from the Mayo Clinic (107 patients diagnosed from January 1, 2004, through December 31, 2014, with 5.7 years of follow-up) and the Cleveland Clinic's Ohio Brain Tumor Study (99 patients with data collected from January 1, 2008, through December 31, 2011, with a median follow-up of 10.9 months). Image accessors were blinded to patient groupings. Eligible patients underwent surgical resection for newly diagnosed glioblastoma and had available survival, molecular, and clinical data and preoperative and postoperative magnetic resonance images. Data were analyzed from November 15, 2018, to March 15, 2019. Main Outcomes and Measures: Overall survival. Results: Among the 761 patients included in the development cohort (468 [61.5%] men; median age, 60 [interquartile range, 51.6-67.7] years), younger patients with IDH-wild-type tumors and aggressive resection of CE and NCE tumors had survival similar to that of patients with IDH-mutant tumors (median overall survival [OS], 37.3 [95% CI, 31.6-70.7] months). Younger patients with IDH-wild-type tumors and reduction of CE tumor but residual NCE tumors fared worse (median OS, 16.5 [95% CI, 14.7-18.3] months). Older patients with IDH-wild-type tumors benefited from reduction of CE tumor (median OS, 12.4 [95% CI, 11.4-14.0] months). The results were validated in the 2 external cohorts. The association between aggressive CE and NCE in patients with IDH-wild-type tumors was not attenuated by the methylation status of the promoter region of the DNA repair enzyme O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase. Conclusions and Relevance: This study confirms an association between maximal resection of CE tumor and OS in patients with glioblastoma across all subgroups. In addition, maximal resection of NCE tumor was associated with longer OS in younger patients, regardless of IDH status, and among patients with IDH-wild-type glioblastoma regardless of the methylation status of the promoter region of the DNA repair enzyme O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase. These conclusions may help reassess surgical strategies for individual patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma. ",
        "Effect of Pembrolizumab Plus Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy on Pathologic Complete Response in Women With Early-Stage Breast Cancer: An Analysis of the Ongoing Phase 2 Adaptively Randomized I-SPY2 Trial. Importance: Approximately 25% of patients with early-stage breast cancer who receive (neo)adjuvant chemotherapy experience a recurrence within 5 years. Improvements in therapy are greatly needed. Objective: To determine if pembrolizumab plus neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) in early-stage breast cancer is likely to be successful in a 300-patient, confirmatory randomized phase 3 neoadjuvant clinical trial. Design, Setting, and Participants: The I-SPY2 study is an ongoing open-label, multicenter, adaptively randomized phase 2 platform trial for high-risk, stage II/III breast cancer, evaluating multiple investigational arms in parallel. Standard NACT serves as the common control arm; investigational agent(s) are added to this backbone. Patients with ERBB2 (formerly HER2)-negative breast cancer were eligible for randomization to pembrolizumab between November 2015 and November 2016. Interventions: Participants were randomized to receive taxane- and anthracycline-based NACT with or without pembrolizumab, followed by definitive surgery. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary end point was pathologic complete response (pCR). Secondary end points were residual cancer burden (RCB) and 3-year event-free and distant recurrence-free survival. Investigational arms graduated when demonstrating an 85% predictive probability of success in a hypothetical confirmatory phase 3 trial. Results: Of the 250 women included in the final analysis, 181 were randomized to the standard NACT control group (median [range] age, 47 [24.77] years). Sixty-nine women (median [range] age, 50 [27-71] years) were randomized to 4 cycles of pembrolizumab in combination with weekly paclitaxel followed by AC; 40 hormone receptor (HR)-positive and 29 triple-negative. Pembrolizumab graduated in all 3 biomarker signatures studied. Final estimated pCR rates, evaluated in March 2017, were 44% vs 17%, 30% vs 13%, and 60% vs 22% for pembrolizumab vs control in the ERBB2-negative, HR-positive/ERBB2-negative, and triple-negative cohorts, respectively. Pembrolizumab shifted the RCB distribution to a lower disease burden for each cohort evaluated. Adverse events included immune-related endocrinopathies, notably thyroid abnormalities (13.0%) and adrenal insufficiency (8.7%). Achieving a pCR appeared predictive of long-term outcome, where patients with pCR following pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy had high event-free survival rates (93% at 3 years with 2.8 years' median follow-up). Conclusions and Relevance: When added to standard neoadjuvant chemotherapy, pembrolizumab more than doubled the estimated pCR rates for both HR-positive/ERBB2-negative and triple-negative breast cancer, indicating that checkpoint blockade in women with early-stage, high-risk, ERBB2-negative breast cancer is highly likely to succeed in a phase 3 trial. Pembrolizumab was the first of 10 agents to graduate in the HR-positive/ERBB2-negative signature. Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01042379. ",
        "Treatment times in breast cancer patients receiving neoadjuvant vs adjuvant chemotherapy: Is efficiency a benefit of preoperative chemotherapy?. BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE: Delays in times to surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy impair survival in breast cancer patients. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) confers equivalent survival to adjuvant chemotherapy (AC), but it remains unknown which approach facilitates faster initiation and completion of treatment. METHODS: Women \u226518\u00a0years old with nonrecurrent, noninflammatory, clinical stage I-III breast cancer diagnosed between 2004 and 2015 who underwent both surgery and chemotherapy were reviewed from the National Cancer Database. RESULTS: Among 155\u00a0606 women overall, 28\u00a0241 patients received NAC and 127\u00a0365 patients received AC. NAC patients had higher clinical T and N stages (35.8% T3/4 vs 4.9% T3/4; 14.4% N2/3 vs 3.7% N2/3). After adjusting for stage and other factors, NAC patients had longer times to begin treatment (36.1 vs 35.4\u00a0days adjusted, P\u00a0=\u00a0.15), and took significantly longer to start radiotherapy (240.8 vs 218.2\u00a0days adjusted, P\u00a0<\u00a0.0001), and endocrine therapy (301.6 vs 275.7\u00a0days adjusted, P\u00a0<\u00a0.0001). Unplanned readmissions (1.2% vs 1.7%), 30-day mortality (0.04% vs 0.01%), and 90-day mortality (0.30% vs 0.08%) were all low and clinically insignificant between NAC and AC. CONCLUSION: Compared to patients receiving AC, those receiving NAC do not start treatment sooner. In addition, patients receiving NAC do not complete treatment faster. Although there are clear indications for administering NAC vs AC, rapidity of treatment should not be considered a benefit of giving chemotherapy preoperatively. ",
        "Association of Germline Variant Status With Therapy Response in High-risk Early-Stage Breast Cancer: A Secondary Analysis of the GeparOcto Randomized Clinical Trial. Importance: The GeparOcto randomized clinical trial compared the efficacy of 2 neoadjuvant breast cancer (BC) treatment regimens: sequential intense dose-dense epirubicin, paclitaxel, and cyclophosphamide (iddEPC) vs weekly paclitaxel and nonpegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PM) in patients with different biological BC subtypes. Patients with triple-negative BC (TNBC) randomized to the PM arm received additional carboplatin (PMCb). Overall, no difference in pathologic complete response (pCR) rates was observed between study arms. It remained elusive whether the germline variant status of BRCA1/2 and further BC predisposition genes are associated with treatment outcome. Objective: To determine treatment outcome for BC according to germline variant status. Design, Setting, and Participants: This retrospective biomarker study is a secondary analysis of the GeparOcto multicenter prospective randomized clinical trial conducted between December 2014 and June 2016. Genetic analyses assessing for variants in BRCA1/2 and 16 other BC predisposition genes in 914 of 945 women were performed at the Center for Familial Breast and Ovarian Cancer, Cologne, Germany, from August 2017 through December 2018. Main Outcomes and Measures: Proportion of patients who achieved pCR (ypT0/is ypN0 definition) after neoadjuvant treatment according to germline variant status. Results: In the study sample of 914 women with different BC subtypes with a mean (range) age at BC diagnosis of 48 (21-76) years, overall higher pCR rates were observed in patients with BRCA1/2 variants than in patients without (60.4% vs 46.7%; odds ratio [OR], 1.74; 95% CI, 1.13-2.68; P\u2009=\u2009.01); variants in non-BRCA1/2 BC predisposition genes were not associated with therapy response. Patients with TNBC with BRCA1/2 variants achieved highest pCR rates. In the TNBC subgroup, a positive BRCA1/2 variant status was associated with therapy response in both the PMCb arm (74.3% vs 47.0% without BRCA1/2 variant; OR, 3.26; 95% CI, 1.44-7.39; P\u2009=\u2009.005) and the iddEPC arm (64.7% vs 45.0%; OR, 2.24; 95% CI, 1.04-4.84; P\u2009=\u2009.04). A positive BRCA1/2 variant status was also associated with elevated pCR rates in patients with ERBB2-negative, hormone receptor-positive BC (31.8% vs 11.9%; OR, 3.44; 95% CI, 1.22-9.72; P\u2009=\u2009.02). Conclusions and Relevance: Effective chemotherapy for BRCA1/2-mutated TNBC is commonly suggested to be platinum based. With a pCR rate of 64.7%, iddEPC may also be effective in these patients, though further prospective studies are needed. The elevated pCR rate in BRCA1/2-mutated ERBB2-negative, hormone receptor-positive BC suggests that germline BRCA1/2 testing should be considered prior to treatment start.

        "Comparison of Mortality and Major Cardiovascular Events Among Adults With Type 2 Diabetes Using Human vs Analogue Insulins. Importance: The comparative cardiovascular safety of analogue and human insulins in adults with type 2 diabetes who initiate insulin therapy in usual care settings has not been carefully evaluated using machine learning and other rigorous analytic methods. Objective: To examine the association of analogue vs human insulin use with mortality and major cardiovascular events. Design, Setting, and Participants: This retrospective cohort study included 127\u202f600 adults aged 21 to 89 years with type 2 diabetes at 4 health care delivery systems who initiated insulin therapy from January 1, 2000, through December 31, 2013. Machine learning and rigorous inference methods with time-varying exposures were used to evaluate associations of continuous exposure to analogue vs human insulins with mortality and major cardiovascular events. Data were analyzed from September 1, 2017, through June 30, 2018. Exposures: On the index date (first insulin dispensing), participants were classified as using analogue insulin with or without human insulin or human insulin only. Main Outcomes and Measures: Overall mortality, mortality due to cardiovascular disease (CVD), myocardial infarction (MI), stroke or cerebrovascular accident (CVA), and hospitalization for congestive heart failure (CHF) were evaluated. Marginal structural modeling (MSM) with inverse probability weighting was used to compare event-free survival in separate per-protocol analyses. Adjusted and unadjusted hazard ratios and cumulative risk differences were based on logistic MSM parameterizations for counterfactual hazards. Propensity scores were estimated using a data-adaptive approach (machine learning) based on 3 nested covariate adjustment sets. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to address potential residual confounding from unmeasured differences in risk factors across delivery systems. Results: The 127\u202f600 participants (mean [SD] age, 59.4 [12.6] years; 68 588 men [53.8%]; mean [SD] body mass index, 32.3 [7.1]) had a median follow-up of 4 quarters (interquartile range, 3-9 quarters) and experienced 5464 deaths overall (4.3%), 1729 MIs (1.4%), 1301 CVAs (1.0%), and 3082 CHF hospitalizations (2.4%). There were no differences in adjusted hazard ratios for continuous analogue vs human insulin exposure during 10 quarters for overall mortality (1.15; 95% CI, 0.97-1.34), CVD mortality (1.26; 95% CI, 0.86-1.66), MI (1.11; 95% CI, 0.77-1.45), CVA (1.30; 95% CI, 0.81-1.78), or CHF hospitalization (0.93; 95% CI, 0.75-1.11). Conclusions and Relevance: Insulin-naive adults with type 2 diabetes who initiate and continue treatment with human vs analogue insulins had similar observed rates of major cardiovascular events, CVD mortality, and overall mortality.

        "Strong vaccine responses during chemotherapy are associated with prolonged cancer survival. Therapeutic cancer vaccines have effectively induced durable regressions of premalignant oncogenic human papilloma virus type 16 (HPV16)-induced anogenital lesions. However, the treatment of HPV16-induced cancers requires appropriate countermeasures to overcome cancer-induced immune suppression. We previously showed that standard-of-care carboplatin/paclitaxel chemotherapy can reduce abnormally high numbers of immunosuppressive myeloid cells in patients, allowing the development of much stronger therapeutic HPV16 vaccine (ISA101)-induced tumor immunity. We now show the clinical effects of ISA101 vaccination during chemotherapy in 77 patients with advanced, recurrent, or metastatic cervical cancer in a dose assessment study of ISA101. Tumor regressions were observed in 43% of 72 evaluable patients. The depletion of myeloid suppressive cells by carboplatin/paclitaxel was associated with detection of low frequency of spontaneous HPV16-specific immunity in 21 of 62 tested patients. Patients mounted type 1 T cell responses to the vaccine across all doses. The group of patients with higher than median vaccine-induced immune responses lived longer, with a flat tail on the survival curve. This demonstrates that chemoimmunotherapy can be exploited to the benefit of patients with advanced cancer based on a defined mode of action. ",
        "The Cancer Bell: Too Much of a Good Thing?. PURPOSE: Patients around the world often ring a bell on the final day of radiation therapy (RT) to celebrate treatment completion. Patients appear to enjoy ringing the bell, but its psychological impact is unexamined. Applying a psychological principle named the \"peak-end rule,\" we hypothesized that ringing the bell would improve patients' perceptions of the overall distress from cancer treatment. METHODS AND MATERIALS: We enrolled 2 cohorts of patients completing definitive RT in a single-center outpatient radiation oncology clinic. Patients in the control arm completed treatment and filled out the survey mentioned below. A bell was then installed in the clinic, and patients in the intervention arm rang the bell on the final day of RT and filled out the same survey. Patients evaluated their overall distress from cancer treatment using a survey composed of an 11-point numerical rating scale in combination with the Verbal Rating Scale. At follow-up, a shorter survey was completed that asked the same questions about distress from cancer treatment. RESULTS: Two hundred ten patients were enrolled, 107 in the bell group and 103 in the control group. One hundred sixty-three patients completed follow-up surveys, n = 86 (80%) and n = 77 (75%) in the bell and control groups, respectively. Demographics and treatment characteristics were well balanced. The bell group reported worse overall distress scores than those not ringing the bell (mean [standard deviation] 5.6 [2.8] vs 4.7 [2.7], P = .045). This difference worsened further at follow-up (6.4 [2.9] vs 5.1 [3.0], P = .009; mean 103 vs 130 days, P = .056). CONCLUSIONS: Counter to our hypothesis, ringing the bell on the final day of RT worsens patients' evaluation of overall distress from cancer treatment, and this distress persists and even worsens in the months after treatment. Emotional arousal created by ringing the bell may magnify the distress from cancer treatment and subsequently worsen the perception of distress from treatment. ",
        "Management and Outcome of Local Regrowths in a Watch-and-wait Prospective Cohort for Complete Responses in Rectal Cancer. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the management and oncological outcomes of rectal cancer patients with local regrowth in a watch-and-wait (W&W) program. BACKGROUND: Approximately 15%-30% of patients with a clinical complete response after (chemo) radiotherapy who undergo a W&W policy will experience a local regrowth. The risks of these local regrowths have not yet been fully established and main concerns include high postoperative morbidity, requirement of advanced surgery, and pelvic recurrence after regrowth treatment. METHODS: All patients with a local regrowth after an initial W&W approach between January 2005 and March 2018 were retrospectively identified from 2 cohorts of rectal cancer patients with a clinical complete response after (chemo) radiotherapy. Type and outcome of regrowth treatment were assessed. Oncological outcome was assessed using Kaplan-Meier estimates. RESULTS: Eighty-nine out of 385 patients developed a local regrowth after a median of 9 (interquartile range 7-14) months. Median follow-up time was 28 (interquartile range 19-41) months. Eighty-four (94%) patients underwent surgical treatment of the local regrowth: total mesorectal excision was performed in 58 out of 84 (69%) patients and local excision was performed in 26 (31%) patients. The 2-year local recurrence-free rate, distant metastasis-free rate, disease-free survival, and overall survival in the patients undergoing surgical treatment were 97.8%, 91.8%, 90.3%, and 98.4%, respectively. CONCLUSION: The vast majority (97%) of patients with regrowth after a W&W policy were able to undergo treatment with curative intent for local regrowth. Uncontrolled pelvic disease was very rare. ",
        "Survival, Nonrelapse Mortality, and Relapse-Related Mortality After Allogeneic Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation: Comparing 2003-2007 Versus 2013-2017 Cohorts. Background: Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation is indicated for refractory hematologic cancer and some nonmalignant disorders. Survival is limited by recurrent cancer and organ toxicity. Objective: To determine whether survival has improved over the past decade and note impediments to better outcomes. Design: The authors compared cohorts that had transplants during 2003 to 2007 versus 2013 to 2017. Survival outcome measures were analyzed, along with transplant-related complications. Setting: A center performing allogeneic transplant procedures. Participants: All recipients of a first allogeneic transplant during 2003 to 2007 and 2013 to 2017. Intervention: Patients received a conditioning regimen, infusion of donor hematopoietic cells, then immunosuppressive drugs and antimicrobial approaches to infection control. Measurements: Day-200 nonrelapse mortality (NRM), recurrence or progression of cancer, relapse-related mortality, and overall mortality, adjusted for comorbidity scores, source of donor cells, donor type, patient age, disease severity, conditioning regimen, patient and donor sex, and cytomegalovirus serostatus. Results: During the 2003-to-2007 and 2013-to-2017 periods, 1148 and 1131 patients, respectively, received their first transplant. Over the decade, decreases were seen in the adjusted hazards of day-200 NRM (hazard ratio [HR], 0.66 [95% CI, 0.48 to 0.89]), relapse of cancer (HR, 0.76 [CI, 0.61 to 0.94]), relapse-related mortality (HR, 0.69 [CI, 0.54 to 0.87]), and overall mortality (HR, 0.66 [CI, 0.56 to 0.78]). The degree of reduction in overall mortality was similar for patients who received myeloablative versus reduced-intensity conditioning, as well as for patients whose allograft came from a matched sibling versus an unrelated donor. Reductions were also seen in the frequency of jaundice, renal insufficiency, mechanical ventilation, high-level cytomegalovirus viremia, gram-negative bacteremia, invasive mold infection, acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease, and prednisone exposure. Limitation: Cohort studies cannot determine causality, and current disease severity criteria were not available for patients in the 2003-to-2007 cohort. Conclusion: Improvement in survival and reduction in complications were substantial after allogeneic transplant. Relapse of cancer remains the largest obstacle to better survival outcomes.

        "Temporary Emergency Guidance to US Stroke Centers During the COVID-19 Pandemic. During this unprecedented time of extraordinary stress on the US healthcare system, the AHA/ASA Stroke Council-as individuals in our localities and together as an entity at the national level-acknowledge the mounting concern regarding optimal stroke care during the COVID-19 pandemic among vascular neurologists and those clinicians who care for patients with stroke. We therefore seek to provide guidance for the care of stroke patients in the midst of the crisis. Ordinarily, national recommendations go through a rigorous process of development, refinement, peer review, and thoughtful promulgation. None of that is possible at this time, yet we believe there is a substantial need for a broad policy statement that reflects both the commonality of the pandemic across the US and the individual variability necessary at local sites. We issue this temporary statement as an interim stopgap opinion, pending a more thorough and considered process. ",
        "Use of CAR-Transduced Natural Killer Cells in CD19-Positive Lymphoid Tumors. BACKGROUND: Anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy has shown remarkable clinical efficacy in B-cell cancers. However, CAR T cells can induce substantial toxic effects, and the manufacture of the cells is complex. Natural killer (NK) cells that have been modified to express an anti-CD19 CAR have the potential to overcome these limitations. METHODS: In this phase 1 and 2 trial, we administered HLA-mismatched anti-CD19 CAR-NK cells derived from cord blood to 11 patients with relapsed or refractory CD19-positive cancers (non-Hodgkin's lymphoma or chronic lymphocytic leukemia [CLL]). NK cells were transduced with a retroviral vector expressing genes that encode anti-CD19 CAR, interleukin-15, and inducible caspase 9 as a safety switch. The cells were expanded ex vivo and administered in a single infusion at one of three doses (1\u00d7105, 1\u00d7106, or 1\u00d7107 CAR-NK cells per kilogram of body weight) after lymphodepleting chemotherapy. RESULTS: The administration of CAR-NK cells was not associated with the development of cytokine release syndrome, neurotoxicity, or graft-versus-host disease, and there was no increase in the levels of inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin-6, over baseline. The maximum tolerated dose was not reached. Of the 11 patients who were treated, 8 (73%) had a response; of these patients, 7 (4 with lymphoma and 3 with CLL) had a complete remission, and 1 had remission of the Richter's transformation component but had persistent CLL. Responses were rapid and seen within 30 days after infusion at all dose levels. The infused CAR-NK cells expanded and persisted at low levels for at least 12 months. CONCLUSIONS: Among 11 patients with relapsed or refractory CD19-positive cancers, a majority had a response to treatment with CAR-NK cells without the development of major toxic effects.

        "Microbiota as Predictor of Mortality in Allogeneic Hematopoietic-Cell Transplantation. BACKGROUND: Relationships between microbiota composition and clinical outcomes after allogeneic hematopoietic-cell transplantation have been described in single-center studies. Geographic variations in the composition of human microbial communities and differences in clinical practices across institutions raise the question of whether these associations are generalizable. METHODS: The microbiota composition of fecal samples obtained from patients who were undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic-cell transplantation at four centers was profiled by means of 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing. In an observational study, we examined associations between microbiota diversity and mortality using Cox proportional-hazards analysis. For stratification of the cohorts into higher- and lower-diversity groups, the median diversity value that was observed at the study center in New York was used. In the analysis of independent cohorts, the New York center was cohort 1, and three centers in Germany, Japan, and North Carolina composed cohort 2. Cohort 1 and subgroups within it were analyzed for additional outcomes, including transplantation-related death. RESULTS: We profiled 8767 fecal samples obtained from 1362 patients undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic-cell transplantation at the four centers. We observed patterns of microbiota disruption characterized by loss of diversity and domination by single taxa. Higher diversity of intestinal microbiota was associated with a lower risk of death in independent cohorts (cohort 1: 104 deaths among 354 patients in the higher-diversity group vs. 136 deaths among 350 patients in the lower-diversity group; adjusted hazard ratio, 0.71; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.55 to 0.92; cohort 2: 18 deaths among 87 patients in the higher-diversity group vs. 35 deaths among 92 patients in the lower-diversity group; adjusted hazard ratio, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.27 to 0.90). Subgroup analyses identified an association between lower intestinal diversity and higher risks of transplantation-related death and death attributable to graft-versus-host disease. Baseline samples obtained before transplantation already showed evidence of microbiome disruption, and lower diversity before transplantation was associated with poor survival. CONCLUSIONS: Patterns of microbiota disruption during allogeneic hematopoietic-cell transplantation were similar across transplantation centers and geographic locations; patterns were characterized by loss of diversity and domination by single taxa. Higher diversity of intestinal microbiota at the time of neutrophil engraftment was associated with lower mortality. (Funded by the National Cancer Institute and others.). ",
        "Therapy for Stage IV Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer Without Driver Alterations: ASCO and OH (CCO) Joint Guideline Update. PURPOSE: The aim of this work is to provide evidence-based recommendations updating the 2017 ASCO guideline on systemic therapy for patients with stage IV non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) without driver alterations. A guideline update for patients with stage IV NSCLC with driver alterations will be published separately. METHODS: The American Society of Clinical Oncology and Ontario Health (Cancer Care Ontario) NSCLC Expert Panel made updated recommendations based on a systematic review of randomized controlled trials from December 2015 to 2019. RESULTS: This guideline update reflects changes in evidence since the previous guideline update. Five randomized controlled trials provide the evidence base. Additional literature suggested by the Expert Panel is discussed. RECOMMENDATIONS: Recommendations apply to patients without driver alterations in epidermal growth factor receptor or ALK. For patients with high programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression (tumor proportion score [TPS] \u2265 50%) and non-squamous cell carcinoma (non-SCC), the Expert Panel recommends single-agent pembrolizumab. Additional treatment options include pembrolizumab/carboplatin/pemetrexed, atezolizumab/carboplatin/paclitaxel/bevacizumab, or atezolizumab/carboplatin/nab-paclitaxel. For most patients with non-SCC and either negative (0%) or low positive (1% to 49%) PD-L1, the Expert Panel recommends pembrolizumab/carboplatin/pemetrexed. Additional options are atezolizumab/carboplatin/nab-paclitaxel, atezolizumab/carboplatin/paclitaxel/bevacizumab, platinum-based two-drug combination chemotherapy, or non-platinum-based two-drug therapy. Single-agent pembrolizumab is an option for low positive PD-L1. For patients with high PD-L1 expression (TPS \u2265 50%) and SCC, the Expert Panel recommends single-agent pembrolizumab. An additional treatment option is pembrolizumab/carboplatin/(paclitaxel or nab-paclitaxel). For most patients with SCC and either negative (0%) or low positive PD-L1 (TPS 1% to 49%), the Expert Panel recommends pembrolizumab/carboplatin/(paclitaxel or nab-paclitaxel) or chemotherapy. Single-agent pembrolizumab is an option in select cases of low positive PD-L1. Recommendations are conditional on the basis of histology, PD-L1 status, and/or the presence or absence of contraindications.

        "Lung cancer incidence in young women vs. young men: A systematic analysis in 40 countries. Previous studies have reported converging lung cancer rates between sexes. We examine lung cancer incidence rates in young women vs. young men in 40 countries across five continents. Lung and bronchial cancer cases by 5-year age group (ages 30-64) and 5-year calendar period (1993-2012) were extracted from Cancer Incidence in Five Continents. Female-to-male incidence rate ratios (IRRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95%CIs) were calculated by age group and birth cohort. Among men, age-specific lung cancer incidence rates generally decreased in all countries, while in women the rates varied across countries with the trends in most countries stable or declining, albeit at a slower pace compared to those in men. As a result, the female-to-male IRRs increased among recent birth cohorts, with IRRs significantly greater than unity in Canada, Denmark, Germany, New Zealand, the Netherlands and the United States. For example, the IRRs in ages 45-49\u2009year in the Netherlands increased from 0.7 (95% CI: 0.6-0.8) to 1.5 (95% CI: 1.4-1.7) in those born circa 1948 and 1963, respectively. Similar patterns, though nonsignificant, were found in 23 additional countries. These crossovers were largely driven by increasing adenocarcinoma incidence rates in women. For those countries with historical smoking data, smoking prevalence in women approached, but rarely exceeded, those of men. In conclusion, the emerging higher lung cancer incidence rates in young women compared to young men is widespread and not fully explained by sex differences in smoking patterns. Future studies are needed to identify reasons for the elevated incidence of lung cancer among young women. ",
        "Vemurafenib in non-small-cell lung cancer patients with BRAFV600 and BRAFnonV600 mutations. BACKGROUND: BRAF mutations occurring in 1%-5% of patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) are therapeutic targets for these cancers but the impact of the exact mutation on clinical activity is unclear. The French National Cancer Institute (INCA) launched the AcS\u00e9 vemurafenib trial to assess the efficacy and safety of vemurafenib in cancers with various BRAF mutations. We herein report the results of the NSCLC cohort. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Tumour samples were screened for BRAF mutations in INCA-certified molecular genetic centres. Patients with BRAF-mutated tumours progressing after \u22651 line of treatment were proposed vemurafenib 960 mg twice daily. Between October 2014 and July 2018, 118 patients were enrolled in the NSCLC cohort. The primary outcome was the objective response rate (ORR) assessed every 8 weeks (RECIST v1.1). A sequential Bayesian approach was planned with an inefficacy bound of 10% for ORR. If no early stopping occurred, the treatment was of interest if the estimated ORR was \u226530% with a 90% probability. Secondary outcomes were tolerance, response duration, progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS). RESULTS: Of the 118 patients enrolled, 101 presented with a BRAFV600 mutation and 17 with BRAFnonV600 mutations; the median follow-up was 23.9 months. In the BRAFnonV600 cohort, no objective response was observed and this cohort was stopped. In the BRAFV600 cohort, 43/96 patients had objective responses. The mean Bayesian estimated success rate was 44.9% [95% confidence intervals (CI) 35.2%-54.8%]. The ORR had a 99.9% probability of being \u226530%. Median response duration was 6.4 months, median PFS was 5.2 months (95% CI 3.8-6.8), and OS was 10 months (95% CI 6.8-15.7). The vemurafenib safety profile was consistent with previous publications. CONCLUSION: Routine biomarker screening of NSCLC should include BRAFV600 mutations. Vemurafenib monotherapy is effective for treating patients with BRAFV600-mutated NSCLC but not those with BRAFnonV600 mutations. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02304809. ",
        "Efficacy of chemotherapy and atezolizumab in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer receiving antibiotics and proton pump inhibitors: pooled post hoc analyses of the OAK and POPLAR trials. BACKGROUND: Preclinical data have shown that proton pump inhibitors (PPI) can modulate the microbiome, and single-arm studies suggested that antibiotics (ATB) may decrease the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI), but randomized controlled trial data are lacking. This pooled analysis evaluated the effect of ATB and PPI on outcome in patients randomized between ICI and chemotherapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This retrospective analysis used pooled data from the phase II POPLAR (NCT01903993) and phase III OAK (NCT02008227) trials, which included 1512 patients with previously treated non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) randomly assigned to receive atezolizumab (n\u00a0= 757) or docetaxel (n\u00a0= 755). The main objective of this analysis was to assess the impact of ATB and PPI use on overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). RESULTS: A total of 169 (22.3%) patients in the atezolizumab group and 202 (26.8%) in the docetaxel group received ATB, and 234 (30.9%) and 260 (34.4%), respectively, received PPI. Multivariate analysis in all patients revealed that ATB were associated with shorter OS [hazard ratio (HR) 1.20, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.04-1.39], as was PPI (HR 1.26, 95% CI 1.10-1.44). Within the atezolizumab population, OS was significantly shorter in patients who received ATB (8.5 versus 14.1 months, HR 1.32, 95% CI 1.06-1.63, P\u00a0= 0.01) or PPI (9.6 versus 14.5 months, HR 1.45, 95% CI 1.20-1.75, P\u00a0=\u00a00.0001). PPI use was associated with shorter PFS in the atezolizumab population (1.9 versus 2.8 months, HR 1.30, 95% CI 1.10-1.53, P\u00a0= 0.001). There was no association between ATB and PPI use and PFS or OS within the docetaxel population. CONCLUSION: In this unplanned analysis from two randomized trials, data suggest that ATB or PPI use in patients with metastatic NSCLC is associated with poor outcome and may influence the efficacy of ICI.

        "Updating insights into rosiglitazone and cardiovascular risk through shared data: individual patient and summary level meta-analyses. OBJECTIVES: To conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of the effects of rosiglitazone treatment on cardiovascular risk and mortality using multiple data sources and varying analytical approaches with three aims in mind: to clarify uncertainties about the cardiovascular risk of rosiglitazone; to determine whether different analytical approaches are likely to alter the conclusions of adverse event meta-analyses; and to inform efforts to promote clinical trial transparency and data sharing. DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials. DATA SOURCES: GlaxoSmithKline's (GSK's) ClinicalStudyDataRequest.com for individual patient level data (IPD) and GSK's Study Register platforms, MEDLINE, PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane Central Registry of Controlled Trials, Scopus, and ClinicalTrials.gov from inception to January 2019 for summary level data. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR SELECTING STUDIES: Randomized, controlled, phase II-IV clinical trials that compared rosiglitazone with any control for at least 24 weeks in adults. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: For analyses of trials for which IPD were available, a composite outcome of acute myocardial infarction, heart failure, cardiovascular related death, and non-cardiovascular related death was examined. These four events were examined independently as secondary analyses. For analyses including trials for which IPD were not available, myocardial infarction and cardiovascular related death were examined, which were determined from summary level data. Multiple meta-analyses were conducted that accounted for trials with zero events in one or both arms with two different continuity corrections (0.5 constant and treatment arm) to calculate odds ratios and risk ratios with 95% confidence intervals. RESULTS: 33 eligible trials were identified from ClinicalStudyDataRequest.com for which IPD were available (21\u2009156 patients). Additionally, 103 trials for which IPD were not available were included in the meta-analyses for myocardial infarction (23\u2009683 patients), and 103 trials for which IPD were not available contributed to the meta-analyses for cardiovascular related death (22\u2009772 patients). Among 29 trials for which IPD were available and that were included in previous meta-analyses using GSK's summary level data, more myocardial infarction events were identified by using IPD instead of summary level data for 26 trials, and fewer cardiovascular related deaths for five trials. When analyses were limited to trials for which IPD were available, and a constant continuity correction of 0.5 and a random effects model were used to account for trials with zero events in only one arm, patients treated with rosiglitazone had a 33% increased risk of a composite event compared with controls (odds ratio 1.33, 95% confidence interval 1.09 to 1.61; rosiglitazone population: 274 events among 11\u2009837 patients; control population: 219 events among 9319 patients). The odds ratios for myocardial infarction, heart failure, cardiovascular related death, and non-cardiovascular related death were 1.17 (0.92 to 1.51), 1.54 (1.14 to 2.09), 1.15 (0.55 to 2.41), and 1.18 (0.60 to 2.30), respectively. For analyses including trials for which IPD were not available, odds ratios for myocardial infarction and cardiovascular related death were attenuated (1.09, 0.88 to 1.35, and 1.12, 0.72 to 1.74, respectively). Results were broadly consistent when analyses were repeated using trials with zero events across both arms and either of the two continuity corrections was used. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that rosiglitazone is associated with an increased cardiovascular risk, especially for heart failure events. Although increased risk of myocardial infarction was observed across analyses, the strength of the evidence varied and effect estimates were attenuated when summary level data were used in addition to IPD. Because more myocardial infarctions and fewer cardiovascular related deaths were reported in the IPD than in the summary level data, sharing IPD might be necessary when performing meta-analyses focused on safety.

        "Safety and feasibility of anti-CD19 CAR T cells with fully human binding domains in patients with B-cell lymphoma. Anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-expressing T cells are an effective treatment for B-cell lymphoma, but often cause neurologic toxicity. We treated 20 patients with B-cell lymphoma on a phase I, first-in-human clinical trial of T cells expressing the new anti-CD19 CAR Hu19-CD828Z (NCT02659943). The primary objective was to assess safety and feasibility of Hu19-CD828Z T-cell therapy. Secondary objectives included assessments of blood levels of CAR T cells, anti-lymphoma activity, second infusions and immunogenicity. All objectives were met. Fifty-five percent of patients who received Hu19-CD828Z T cells obtained complete remission. Hu19-CD828Z T cells had clinical anti-lymphoma activity similar to that of T cells expressing FMC63-28Z, an anti-CD19 CAR tested previously by our group, which contains murine binding domains and is used in axicabtagene ciloleucel. However, severe neurologic toxicity occurred in only 5% of patients who received Hu19-CD828Z T cells, whereas 50% of patients who received FMC63-28Z T cells experienced this degree of toxicity (P\u2009=\u20090.0017). T cells expressing Hu19-CD828Z released lower levels of cytokines than T cells expressing FMC63-28Z. Lower levels of cytokines were detected in blood from patients who received Hu19-CD828Z T cells than in blood from those who received FMC63-28Z T cells, which could explain the lower level of neurologic toxicity associated with Hu19-CD828Z. Levels of cytokines released by CAR-expressing T cells particularly depended on the hinge and transmembrane domains included in the CAR design. ",
        "KTE-X19 CAR T-Cell Therapy in Relapsed or Refractory Mantle-Cell Lymphoma. BACKGROUND: Patients with relapsed or refractory mantle-cell lymphoma who have disease progression during or after the receipt of Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor therapy have a poor prognosis. KTE-X19, an anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy, may have benefit in patients with relapsed or refractory mantle-cell lymphoma. METHODS: In a multicenter, phase 2 trial, we evaluated KTE-X19 in patients with relapsed or refractory mantle-cell lymphoma. Patients had disease that had relapsed or was refractory after the receipt of up to five previous therapies; all patients had to have received BTK inhibitor therapy previously. Patients underwent leukapheresis and optional bridging therapy, followed by conditioning chemotherapy and a single infusion of KTE-X19 at a dose of 2\u00d7106 CAR T cells per kilogram of body weight. The primary end point was the percentage of patients with an objective response (complete or partial response) as assessed by an independent radiologic review committee according to the Lugano classification. Per the protocol, the primary efficacy analysis was to be conducted after 60 patients had been treated and followed for 7 months. RESULTS: A total of 74 patients were enrolled. KTE-X19 was manufactured for 71 patients and administered to 68. The primary efficacy analysis showed that 93% (95% confidence interval [CI], 84 to 98) of the 60 patients in the primary efficacy analysis had an objective response; 67% (95% CI, 53 to 78) had a complete response. In an intention-to-treat analysis involving all 74 patients, 85% had an objective response; 59% had a complete response. At a median follow-up of 12.3 months (range, 7.0 to 32.3), 57% of the 60 patients in the primary efficacy analysis were in remission. At 12 months, the estimated progression-free survival and overall survival were 61% and 83%, respectively. Common adverse events of grade 3 or higher were cytopenias (in 94% of the patients) and infections (in 32%). Grade 3 or higher cytokine release syndrome and neurologic events occurred in 15% and 31% of patients, respectively; none were fatal. Two grade 5 infectious adverse events occurred. CONCLUSIONS: KTE-X19 induced durable remissions in a majority of patients with relapsed or refractory mantle-cell lymphoma. The therapy led to serious and life-threatening toxic effects that were consistent with those reported with other CAR T-cell therapies.

        "Alcohol Use Among Patients With Cancer and Survivors in the United States, 2000-2017. BACKGROUND: Alcohol use is an established risk factor for several malignancies and is associated with adverse oncologic outcomes among individuals diagnosed with cancer. The prevalence and patterns of alcohol use among cancer survivors are poorly described. METHODS: We used the National Health Interview Survey from 2000 to 2017 to examine alcohol drinking prevalence and patterns among adults reporting a cancer diagnosis. Multivariable logistic regression was used to define the association between demographic and socioeconomic variables and odds of self-reporting as a current drinker, exceeding moderate drinking limits, and engaging in binge drinking. The association between specific cancer type and odds of drinking were assessed. RESULTS: Among 34,080 survey participants with a known cancer diagnosis, 56.5% self-reported as current drinkers, including 34.9% who exceeded moderate drinking limits and 21.0% who engaged in binge drinking. Younger age, smoking history, and more recent survey period were associated with higher odds of current, exceeding moderate, and binge drinking (P<.001 for all, except P=.008 for excess drinking). Similar associations persisted when the cohort was limited to 20,828 cancer survivors diagnosed \u22655 years before survey administration. Diagnoses of melanoma and cervical, head and neck, and testicular cancers were associated with higher odds of binge drinking (P<.05 for all) compared with other cancer diagnoses. CONCLUSIONS: Most cancer survivors self-report as current alcohol drinkers, including a subset who seem to engage in excessive drinking behaviors. Given that alcohol intake has implications for cancer prevention and is a potentially modifiable risk factor for cancer-specific outcomes, the high prevalence of alcohol use among cancer survivors highlights the need for public health strategies aimed at the reduction of alcohol consumption.

        "Clinical Characteristics of 138 Hospitalized Patients With 2019 Novel Coronavirus-Infected Pneumonia in Wuhan, China. Importance: In December 2019, novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)-infected pneumonia (NCIP) occurred in Wuhan, China. The number of cases has increased rapidly but information on the clinical characteristics of affected patients is limited. Objective: To describe the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of NCIP. Design, Setting, and Participants: Retrospective, single-center case series of the 138 consecutive hospitalized patients with confirmed NCIP at Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University in Wuhan, China, from January 1 to January 28, 2020; final date of follow-up was February 3, 2020. Exposures: Documented NCIP. Main Outcomes and Measures: Epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and treatment data were collected and analyzed. Outcomes of critically ill patients and noncritically ill patients were compared. Presumed hospital-related transmission was suspected if a cluster of health professionals or hospitalized patients in the same wards became infected and a possible source of infection could be tracked. Results: Of 138 hospitalized patients with NCIP, the median age was 56 years (interquartile range, 42-68; range, 22-92 years) and 75 (54.3%) were men. Hospital-associated transmission was suspected as the presumed mechanism of infection for affected health professionals (40 [29%]) and hospitalized patients (17 [12.3%]). Common symptoms included fever (136 [98.6%]), fatigue (96 [69.6%]), and dry cough (82 [59.4%]). Lymphopenia (lymphocyte count, 0.8\u2009\u00d7\u2009109/L [interquartile range {IQR}, 0.6-1.1]) occurred in 97 patients (70.3%), prolonged prothrombin time (13.0 seconds [IQR, 12.3-13.7]) in 80 patients (58%), and elevated lactate dehydrogenase (261 U/L [IQR, 182-403]) in 55 patients (39.9%). Chest computed tomographic scans showed bilateral patchy shadows or ground glass opacity in the lungs of all patients. Most patients received antiviral therapy (oseltamivir, 124 [89.9%]), and many received antibacterial therapy (moxifloxacin, 89 [64.4%]; ceftriaxone, 34 [24.6%]; azithromycin, 25 [18.1%]) and glucocorticoid therapy (62 [44.9%]). Thirty-six patients (26.1%) were transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) because of complications, including acute respiratory distress syndrome (22 [61.1%]), arrhythmia (16 [44.4%]), and shock (11 [30.6%]). The median time from first symptom to dyspnea was 5.0 days, to hospital admission was 7.0 days, and to ARDS was 8.0 days. Patients treated in the ICU (n\u2009=\u200936), compared with patients not treated in the ICU (n\u2009=\u2009102), were older (median age, 66 years vs 51 years), were more likely to have underlying comorbidities (26 [72.2%] vs 38 [37.3%]), and were more likely to have dyspnea (23 [63.9%] vs 20 [19.6%]), and anorexia (24 [66.7%] vs 31 [30.4%]). Of the 36 cases in the ICU, 4 (11.1%) received high-flow oxygen therapy, 15 (41.7%) received noninvasive ventilation, and 17 (47.2%) received invasive ventilation (4 were switched to extracorporeal membrane oxygenation). As of February 3, 47 patients (34.1%) were discharged and 6 died (overall mortality, 4.3%), but the remaining patients are still hospitalized. Among those discharged alive (n\u2009=\u200947), the median hospital stay was 10 days (IQR, 7.0-14.0). Conclusions and Relevance: In this single-center case series of 138 hospitalized patients with confirmed NCIP in Wuhan, China, presumed hospital-related transmission of 2019-nCoV was suspected in 41% of patients, 26% of patients received ICU care, and mortality was 4.3%.

        "Lenvatinib Plus Pembrolizumab in Patients With Advanced Endometrial Cancer. PURPOSE: Patients with advanced endometrial carcinoma have limited treatment options. We report final primary efficacy analysis results for a patient cohort with advanced endometrial carcinoma receiving lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab in an ongoing phase Ib/II study of selected solid tumors. METHODS: Patients took lenvatinib 20 mg once daily orally plus pembrolizumab 200 mg intravenously once every 3 weeks, in 3-week cycles. The primary end point was objective response rate (ORR) at 24 weeks (ORRWk24); secondary efficacy end points included duration of response (DOR), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS). Tumor assessments were evaluated by investigators per immune-related RECIST. RESULTS: At data cutoff, 108 patients with previously treated endometrial carcinoma were enrolled, with a median follow-up of 18.7 months. The ORRWk24 was 38.0% (95% CI, 28.8% to 47.8%). Among subgroups, the ORRWk24 (95% CI) was 63.6% (30.8% to 89.1%) in patients with microsatellite instability (MSI)-high tumors (n = 11) and 36.2% (26.5% to 46.7%) in patients with microsatellite-stable tumors (n = 94). For previously treated patients, regardless of tumor MSI status, the median DOR was 21.2 months (95% CI, 7.6 months to not estimable), median PFS was 7.4 months (95% CI, 5.3 to 8.7 months), and median OS was 16.7 months (15.0 months to not estimable). Grade 3 or 4 treatment-related adverse events occurred in 83/124 (66.9%) patients. CONCLUSION: Lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab showed promising antitumor activity in patients with advanced endometrial carcinoma who have experienced disease progression after prior systemic therapy, regardless of tumor MSI status. The combination therapy had a manageable toxicity profile. ",
        "Phase 2 study of pembrolizumab in patients with advanced rare cancers. BACKGROUND: Patients with advanced rare cancers have poor prognosis and few treatment options. As immunotherapy is effective across multiple cancer types, we aimed to assess pembrolizumab (programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) inhibitor) in patients with advanced rare cancers. METHODS: In this open-label, phase 2 trial, patients with advanced rare cancers whose tumors had progressed on standard therapies, if available, within the previous 6\u2009months were enrolled in nine tumor-specific cohorts and a 10th cohort for other rare histologies. Pembrolizumab 200\u2009mg was administered intravenously every 21 days. The primary endpoint was non-progression rate (NPR) at 27 weeks; secondary endpoints were safety and tolerability, objective response rate (ORR), and clinical benefit rate (CBR). RESULTS: A total of 127 patients treated between August 15, 2016 and July 27, 2018 were included in this analysis. At the time of data cut-off, the NPR at 27 weeks was 28% (95% CI, 19% to 37%). A confirmed objective response (OR) was seen in 15 of 110 (14%) evaluable patients (complete response in one and partial response in 14). CBR, defined as the percentage of patients with an OR or stable disease \u22654 months, was 38% (n=42). Treatment was ongoing in 11 of 15 patients with OR at last follow-up. In the cohort with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the skin, the NPR at 27 weeks was 36%, ORR 31%, and CBR 38%. In patients with adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC), NPR at 27 weeks was 31%, ORR 15%, and CBR 54%. In the patients with carcinoma of unknown primary (CUP), NPR at 27 weeks was 33%, ORR 23%, and CBR 54%. In the paraganglioma-pheochromocytoma cohort, NPR at 27 weeks was 43%, ORR 0%, and CBR 75%. Treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) occurred in 66 of 127 (52%) patients, and 12 (9%) had grade \u22653 TRAEs. The most common TRAEs were fatigue (n=25) and rash (n=17). There were six deaths, all of which were unrelated to the study drug. CONCLUSIONS: The favorable toxicity profile and antitumor activity seen in patients with SCC of skin, ACC, CUP, and paraganglioma-pheochromocytoma supports further evaluation of pembrolizumab in this patient population.

        "Association Between Breastfeeding and Ovarian Cancer Risk. Importance: Breastfeeding has been associated with a reduced risk of epithelial ovarian cancer in multiple studies, but others showed no association. Whether risk reduction extends beyond that provided by pregnancy alone or differs by histotype is unclear. Furthermore, the observed associations between duration and timing of breastfeeding with ovarian cancer risk have been inconsistent. Objective: To determine the association between breastfeeding (ie, ever/never, duration, timing) and ovarian cancer risk overall and by histotype. Design, Setting, and Participants: A pooled analysis of parous women with ovarian cancer and controls from 13 case-control studies participating in the Ovarian Cancer Association Consortium was performed. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs of the overall association were calculated using multivariable logistic regression and polytomous logistic regression for histotype-specific associations. All data were collected from individual sites from November 1989 to December 2009, and analysis took place from September 2017 to July 2019. Exposures: Data on breastfeeding history, including duration per child breastfed, age at first and last breastfeeding, and years since last breastfeeding were collected by questionnaire or interview and was harmonized across studies. Main Outcomes and Measures: Diagnosis of epithelial ovarian cancer. Results: A total of 9973 women with ovarian cancer (mean [SD] age, 57.4 [11.1] years) and 13\u202f843 controls (mean [SD] age, 56.4 [11.7] years) were included. Breastfeeding was associated with a 24% lower risk of invasive ovarian cancer (odds ratio [OR],\u20090.76; 95% CI, 0.71-0.80). Independent of parity, ever having breastfed was associated with reduction in risk of all invasive ovarian cancers, particularly high-grade serous and endometrioid cancers. For a single breastfeeding episode, mean breastfeeding duration of 1 to 3 months was associated with 18% lower risk (OR,\u20090.82; 95% CI, 0.76-0.88), and breastfeeding for 12 or more months was associated with a 34% lower risk (OR,\u20090.66; 95% CI, 0.58-0.75). More recent breastfeeding was associated with a reduction in risk (OR,\u20090.56; 95% CI, 0.47-0.66 for <10 years) that persisted for decades (OR,\u20090.83; 95% CI, 0.77-0.90 for \u226530 years; P for trend\u2009=\u2009.02). Conclusions and Relevance: Breastfeeding is associated with a significant decrease in risk of ovarian cancer overall and for the high-grade serous subtype, the most lethal type of ovarian cancer. The findings suggest that breastfeeding is a potentially modifiable factor that may lower risk of ovarian cancer independent of pregnancy alone. ",
        "A Trial of Lopinavir-Ritonavir in Adults Hospitalized with Severe Covid-19. BACKGROUND: No therapeutics have yet been proven effective for the treatment of severe illness caused by SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: We conducted a randomized, controlled, open-label trial involving hospitalized adult patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, which causes the respiratory illness Covid-19, and an oxygen saturation (Sao2) of 94% or less while they were breathing ambient air or a ratio of the partial pressure of oxygen (Pao2) to the fraction of inspired oxygen (Fio2) of less than 300 mm Hg. Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either lopinavir-ritonavir (400 mg and 100 mg, respectively) twice a day for 14 days, in addition to standard care, or standard care alone. The primary end point was the time to clinical improvement, defined as the time from randomization to either an improvement of two points on a seven-category ordinal scale or discharge from the hospital, whichever came first. RESULTS: A total of 199 patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection underwent randomization; 99 were assigned to the lopinavir-ritonavir group, and 100 to the standard-care group. Treatment with lopinavir-ritonavir was not associated with a difference from standard care in the time to clinical improvement (hazard ratio for clinical improvement, 1.31; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.95 to 1.80). Mortality at 28 days was similar in the lopinavir-ritonavir group and the standard-care group (19.2% vs. 25.0%; difference, -5.8 percentage points; 95% CI, -17.3 to 5.7). The percentages of patients with detectable viral RNA at various time points were similar. In a modified intention-to-treat analysis, lopinavir-ritonavir led to a median time to clinical improvement that was shorter by 1 day than that observed with standard care (hazard ratio, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.00 to 1.91). Gastrointestinal adverse events were more common in the lopinavir-ritonavir group, but serious adverse events were more common in the standard-care group. Lopinavir-ritonavir treatment was stopped early in 13 patients (13.8%) because of adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: In hospitalized adult patients with severe Covid-19, no benefit was observed with lopinavir-ritonavir treatment beyond standard care. Future trials in patients with severe illness may help to confirm or exclude the possibility of a treatment benefit.

        "Early Transmission Dynamics in Wuhan, China, of Novel Coronavirus-Infected Pneumonia. BACKGROUND: The initial cases of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)-infected pneumonia (NCIP) occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, in December 2019 and January 2020. We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP. METHODS: We collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020. We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions. In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number. RESULTS: Among the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male. The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases. The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days. In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days. With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9). CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019. Considerable efforts to reduce transmission will be required to control outbreaks if similar dynamics apply elsewhere. Measures to prevent or reduce transmission should be implemented in populations at risk. (Funded by the Ministry of Science and Technology of China and others.). ",

        "Apixaban for the Treatment of Venous Thromboembolism Associated with Cancer. BACKGROUND: Recent guidelines recommend consideration of the use of oral edoxaban or rivaroxaban for the treatment of venous thromboembolism in patients with cancer. However, the benefit of these oral agents is limited by the increased risk of bleeding associated with their use. METHODS: This was a multinational, randomized, investigator-initiated, open-label, noninferiority trial with blinded central outcome adjudication. We randomly assigned consecutive patients with cancer who had symptomatic or incidental acute proximal deep-vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism to receive oral apixaban (at a dose of 10 mg twice daily for the first 7 days, followed by 5 mg twice daily) or subcutaneous dalteparin (at a dose of 200 IU per kilogram of body weight once daily for the first month, followed by 150 IU per kilogram once daily). The treatments were administered for 6 months. The primary outcome was objectively confirmed recurrent venous thromboembolism during the trial period. The principal safety outcome was major bleeding. RESULTS: Recurrent venous thromboembolism occurred in 32 of 576 patients (5.6%) in the apixaban group and in 46 of 579 patients (7.9%) in the dalteparin group (hazard ratio, 0.63; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.37 to 1.07; P<0.001 for noninferiority). Major bleeding occurred in 22 patients (3.8%) in the apixaban group and in 23 patients (4.0%) in the dalteparin group (hazard ratio, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.40 to 1.69; P\u2009=\u20090.60). CONCLUSIONS: Oral apixaban was noninferior to subcutaneous dalteparin for the treatment of cancer-associated venous thromboembolism without an increased risk of major bleeding.

        "Selumetinib in Children with Inoperable Plexiform Neurofibromas. BACKGROUND: No approved therapies exist for inoperable plexiform neurofibromas in patients with neurofibromatosis type 1. METHODS: We conducted an open-label, phase 2 trial of selumetinib to determine the objective response rate among patients with plexiform neurofibromas and to assess clinical benefit. Children with neurofibromatosis type 1 and symptomatic inoperable plexiform neurofibromas received oral selumetinib twice daily at a dose of 25 mg per square meter of body-surface area on a continuous dosing schedule (28-day cycles). Volumetric magnetic resonance imaging and clinical outcome assessments (pain, quality of life, disfigurement, and function) were performed at least every four cycles. Children rated tumor pain intensity on a scale from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst pain imaginable). RESULTS: A total of 50 children (median age, 10.2 years; range, 3.5 to 17.4) were enrolled from August 2015 through August 2016. The most frequent neurofibroma-related symptoms were disfigurement (44 patients), motor dysfunction (33), and pain (26). A total of 35 patients (70%) had a confirmed partial response as of March 29, 2019, and 28 of these patients had a durable response (lasting \u22651 year). After 1 year of treatment, the mean decrease in child-reported tumor pain-intensity scores was 2 points, considered a clinically meaningful improvement. In addition, clinically meaningful improvements were seen in child-reported and parent-reported interference of pain in daily functioning (38% and 50%, respectively) and overall health-related quality of life (48% and 58%, respectively) as well as in functional outcomes of strength (56% of patients) and range of motion (38% of patients). Five patients discontinued treatment because of toxic effects possibly related to selumetinib, and 6 patients had disease progression. The most frequent toxic effects were nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea; an asymptomatic increase in the creatine phosphokinase level; acneiform rash; and paronychia. CONCLUSIONS: In this phase 2 trial, most children with neurofibromatosis type 1 and inoperable plexiform neurofibromas had durable tumor shrinkage and clinical benefit from selumetinib.

        "Treatment of Highly Drug-Resistant Pulmonary Tuberculosis. BACKGROUND: Patients with highly drug-resistant forms of tuberculosis have limited treatment options and historically have had poor outcomes. METHODS: In an open-label, single-group study in which follow-up is ongoing at three South African sites, we investigated treatment with three oral drugs - bedaquiline, pretomanid, and linezolid - that have bactericidal activity against tuberculosis and to which there is little preexisting resistance. We evaluated the safety and efficacy of the drug combination for 26 weeks in patients with extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis and patients with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis that was not responsive to treatment or for which a second-line regimen had been discontinued because of side effects. The primary end point was the incidence of an unfavorable outcome, defined as treatment failure (bacteriologic or clinical) or relapse during follow-up, which continued until 6 months after the end of treatment. Patients were classified as having a favorable outcome at 6 months if they had resolution of clinical disease, a negative culture status, and had not already been classified as having had an unfavorable outcome. Other efficacy end points and safety were also evaluated. RESULTS: A total of 109 patients were enrolled in the study and were included in the evaluation of efficacy and safety end points. At 6 months after the end of treatment in the intention-to-treat analysis, 11 patients (10%) had an unfavorable outcome and 98 patients (90%; 95% confidence interval, 83 to 95) had a favorable outcome. The 11 unfavorable outcomes were 7 deaths (6 during treatment and 1 from an unknown cause during follow-up), 1 withdrawal of consent during treatment, 2 relapses during follow-up, and 1 loss to follow-up. The expected linezolid toxic effects of peripheral neuropathy (occurring in 81% of patients) and myelosuppression (48%), although common, were manageable, often leading to dose reductions or interruptions in treatment with linezolid. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of bedaquiline, pretomanid, and linezolid led to a favorable outcome at 6 months after the end of therapy in a high percentage of patients with highly drug-resistant forms of tuberculosis; some associated toxic effects were observed.

        "Effect of Home Blood Pressure Monitoring via a Smartphone Hypertension Coaching Application or Tracking Application on Adults With Uncontrolled Hypertension: A Randomized Clinical Trial. Importance: Mobile applications (apps) may help improve hypertension self-management. Objective: To investigate the effect of an artificial intelligence smartphone coaching app to promote home monitoring and hypertension-related behaviors on systolic blood pressure level compared with a blood pressure tracking app. Design, Setting, and Participants: This was a 2-group, open, randomized clinical trial. Participants with uncontrolled hypertension were recruited in 2016 and 2017 and were followed up for 6 months. Data analysis was performed from April 2019 to December 2019. Interventions: Intervention group participants received a smartphone coaching app to promote home monitoring and behavioral changes associated with hypertension self-management plus a home blood pressure monitor. Control participants received a blood pressure tracking app plus a home blood pressure monitor. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary study outcome was systolic blood pressure at 6 months. Secondary outcomes included self-reported antihypertensive medication adherence, home monitoring and self-management practices, measures of self-efficacy associated with blood pressure, weight, and self-reported health behaviors. Results: There were 333 participants randomized, and 297 completed the follow-up assessment. Among the participants who completed the study, the mean (SD) age was 58.9 (12.8) years, 182 (61.3%) were women, and 103 (34.7%) were black. Baseline mean (SD) systolic blood pressure was 140.6 (12.2) mm Hg among intervention participants and 141.8 (13.4) mm Hg among control participants. After 6 months, the corresponding mean (SD) systolic blood pressures were 132.3 (15.0) mm Hg and 135.0 (13.9) mm Hg, with a between-group adjusted difference of -2.0 mm Hg (95% CI, -4.9 mm Hg to 0.8 mm Hg; P\u2009=\u2009.16). At 6 months, self-confidence in controlling blood pressure was greater in the intervention group (0.36 point on a 5-point scale; 95% CI, 0.18 point to 0.54 point; P\u2009<\u2009.001). There were no significant differences between the 2 groups in other secondary outcomes. The adjusted difference in self-reported physical activity was 26.7 minutes per week (95% CI, -5.4 minutes per week to 58.8 minutes per week; P\u2009=\u2009.10). Subgroup analysis raised the possibility that intervention effects differed by age. Conclusions and Relevance: Among individuals with uncontrolled hypertension, those randomized to a smartphone coaching app plus home monitor had similar systolic blood pressure compared with those who received a blood pressure tracking app plus home monitor. Given the direction of the difference in systolic blood pressure between groups and the possibility for differences in treatment effects across subgroups, future studies are warranted.

        "Rivaroxaban or Enoxaparin in Nonmajor Orthopedic Surgery. BACKGROUND: Nonmajor orthopedic surgery of the lower limbs that results in transient reduced mobility places patients at risk for venous thromboembolism. Rivaroxaban may be noninferior to enoxaparin with regard to the prevention of major venous thromboembolism in these patients. METHODS: In this international, parallel-group, randomized, double-blind, noninferiority trial, we randomly assigned adult patients undergoing lower-limb nonmajor orthopedic surgery who were considered to be at risk for venous thromboembolism on the basis of the investigator's judgment to receive either rivaroxaban or enoxaparin. The primary efficacy outcome of major venous thromboembolism was a composite of symptomatic distal or proximal deep-vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, or venous thromboembolism-related death during the treatment period or asymptomatic proximal deep-vein thrombosis at the end of treatment. A test for superiority was planned if rivaroxaban proved to be noninferior to enoxaparin. For all outcomes, multiple imputation was used to account for missing data. Prespecified safety outcomes included major bleeding (fatal, critical, or clinically overt bleeding or bleeding at the surgical site leading to intervention) and nonmajor clinically relevant bleeding. RESULTS: A total of 3604 patients underwent randomization; 1809 patients were assigned to receive rivaroxaban, and 1795 to receive enoxaparin. Major venous thromboembolism occurred in 4 of 1661 patients (0.2%) in the rivaroxaban group and in 18 of 1640 patients (1.1%) in the enoxaparin group (risk ratio with multiple imputation, 0.25; 95% confidence interval, 0.09 to 0.75; P<0.001 for noninferiority; P\u2009=\u20090.01 for superiority). The incidence of bleeding did not differ significantly between the rivaroxaban group and the enoxaparin group (1.1% and 1.0%, respectively, for major bleeding or nonmajor clinically relevant bleeding; 0.6% and 0.7%, respectively, for major bleeding). CONCLUSIONS: Rivaroxaban was more effective than enoxaparin in the prevention of venous thromboembolic events during a period of immobilization after nonmajor orthopedic surgery of the lower limbs.

        "Evolocumab Use in HIV-Infected Patients With Dyslipidemia: Primary Results of the Randomized, Double-blind BEIJERINCK Study. BACKGROUND: People living with HIV (PLHIV) are at increased risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) and prone to statin-related adverse events from drug-drug interactions with certain antiretroviral regimens. OBJECTIVES: This study sought to evaluate the efficacy and safety of evolocumab in dyslipidemic PLHIV. METHODS: BEIJERINCK is a randomized, double-blind, multinational trial comparing monthly subcutaneous evolocumab 420 mg with placebo in PLHIV with hypercholesterolemia/mixed dyslipidemia taking maximally-tolerated statin therapy. The primary endpoint was the percent change (baseline to week 24) in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C); secondary endpoints included achievement of LDL-C <70 mg/dL and percent change in other plasma lipid and lipoprotein levels. Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were also examined. RESULTS: A total of 464 patients were analyzed (mean age of 56.4 years, 82.5% male, mean duration with HIV of 17.4 years). ASCVD was documented in 35.6% of patients, and statin intolerance/contraindications to statin use were present in 20.7% of patients. Evolocumab reduced LDL-C by 56.9% (95% CI: 61.6%, 52.3%) from baseline to week 24 versus placebo. An LDL-C level of <70 mg/dL was achieved in 73.3% of patients in the evolocumab group versus 7.9% in the placebo group. Evolocumab also significantly reduced other atherogenic lipid levels, including non-HDL-C, ApoB, and Lp(a) (all p<0.0001). Evolocumab was well tolerated, and TEAE patient incidence was similar among evolocumab and placebo groups. CONCLUSIONS: Evolocumab was safe and significantly reduced lipid levels in dyslipidemic PLHIV on maximally-tolerated statin therapy. Evolocumab is an effective therapy for lowering atherogenic lipoproteins in PLHIV with high cardiovascular risk. ",
        "Comparative Pricing of Branded Tenofovir Alafenamide-Emtricitabine Relative to Generic Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate-Emtricitabine for HIV Preexposure Prophylaxis: A Cost-Effectiveness Analysis. Background: Tenofovir alafenamide-emtricitabine (F/TAF) was recently approved as a noninferior and potentially safer option than tenofovir disoproxil fumarate-emtricitabine (F/TDF) for HIV preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) in the United States. Objective: To estimate the greatest possible clinical benefits and economic savings attributable to the improved safety profile of F/TAF and the maximum price payers should be willing to pay for F/TAF over generic F/TDF. Design: Cost-effectiveness analysis. Data Sources: Published literature on F/TDF safety (in persons with and those without HIV) and the cost and quality-of-life effects of fractures and end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Target Population: Age-stratified U.S. men who have sex with men (MSM) using PrEP. Time Horizon: Five years. Perspective: Health care sector. Intervention: Preexposure prophylaxis with F/TAF versus F/TDF. Outcome Measures: Fractures averted, cases of ESRD averted, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) saved, costs, incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs), and maximum justifiable price for F/TAF compared with generic F/TDF. Results of Base-Case Analysis: Over a 5-year horizon, compared with F/TDF, F/TAF averted 2101 fractures and 25 cases of ESRD for the 123\u00a0610 MSM receiving PrEP, with an ICER of more than $7 million per QALY. At a 50% discount for generic F/TDF ($8300 per year) and a societal willingness to pay up to $100\u00a0000 per QALY, the maximum fair price for F/TAF was $8670 per year. Results of Sensitivity Analysis: Among persons older than 55 years, the ICER for F/TAF remained more than $3 million per QALY and the maximum permissible fair price for F/TAF was $8970 per year. Results were robust to alternative time horizons and PrEP-using population sizes. Limitation: Intermittent use and on-demand PrEP were not considered. Conclusion: In the presence of a generic F/TDF alternative, the improved safety of F/TAF is worth no more than an additional $370 per person per year.

        "MRI-Targeted, Systematic, and Combined Biopsy for Prostate Cancer Diagnosis. BACKGROUND: The use of 12-core systematic prostate biopsy is associated with diagnostic inaccuracy that contributes to both overdiagnosis and underdiagnosis of prostate cancer. Biopsies performed with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) targeting may reduce the misclassification of prostate cancer in men with MRI-visible lesions. METHODS: Men with MRI-visible prostate lesions underwent both MRI-targeted and systematic biopsy. The primary outcome was cancer detection according to grade group (i.e., a clustering of Gleason grades). Grade group 1 refers to clinically insignificant disease; grade group 2 or higher, cancer with favorable intermediate risk or worse; and grade group 3 or higher, cancer with unfavorable intermediate risk or worse. Among the men who underwent subsequent radical prostatectomy, upgrading and downgrading of grade group from biopsy to whole-mount histopathological analysis of surgical specimens were recorded. Secondary outcomes were the detection of cancers of grade group 2 or higher and grade group 3 or higher, cancer detection stratified by previous biopsy status, and grade reclassification between biopsy and radical prostatectomy. RESULTS: A total of 2103 men underwent both biopsy methods; cancer was diagnosed in 1312 (62.4%) by a combination of the two methods (combined biopsy), and 404 (19.2%) underwent radical prostatectomy. Cancer detection rates on MRI-targeted biopsy were significantly lower than on systematic biopsy for grade group 1 cancers and significantly higher for grade groups 3 through 5 (P<0.01 for all comparisons). Combined biopsy led to cancer diagnoses in 208 more men (9.9%) than with either method alone and to upgrading to a higher grade group in 458 men (21.8%). However, if only MRI-target biopsies had been performed, 8.8% of clinically significant cancers (grade group \u22653) would have been misclassified. Among the 404 men who underwent subsequent radical prostatectomy, combined biopsy was associated with the fewest upgrades to grade group 3 or higher on histopathological analysis of surgical specimens (3.5%), as compared with MRI-targeted biopsy (8.7%) and systematic biopsy (16.8%). CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with MRI-visible lesions, combined biopsy led to more detection of all prostate cancers. However, MRI-targeted biopsy alone underestimated the histologic grade of some tumors. After radical prostatectomy, upgrades to grade group 3 or higher on histopathological analysis were substantially lower after combined biopsy.

        "Polymer-based or Polymer-free Stents in Patients at High Bleeding Risk. BACKGROUND: Polymer-free drug-coated stents provide superior clinical outcomes to bare-metal stents in patients at high bleeding risk who undergo percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and are treated with 1 month of dual antiplatelet therapy. Data on the use of polymer-based drug-eluting stents, as compared with polymer-free drug-coated stents, in such patients are limited. METHODS: In an international, randomized, single-blind trial, we compared polymer-based zotarolimus-eluting stents with polymer-free umirolimus-coated stents in patients at high bleeding risk. After PCI, patients were treated with 1 month of dual antiplatelet therapy, followed by single antiplatelet therapy. The primary outcome was a safety composite of death from cardiac causes, myocardial infarction, or stent thrombosis at 1 year. The principal secondary outcome was target-lesion failure, an effectiveness composite of death from cardiac causes, target-vessel myocardial infarction, or clinically indicated target-lesion revascularization. Both outcomes were powered for noninferiority. RESULTS: A total of 1996 patients at high bleeding risk were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive zotarolimus-eluting stents (1003 patients) or polymer-free drug-coated stents (993 patients). At 1 year, the primary outcome was observed in 169 of 988 patients (17.1%) in the zotarolimus-eluting stent group and in 164 of 969 (16.9%) in the polymer-free drug-coated stent group (risk difference, 0.2 percentage points; upper boundary of the one-sided 97.5% confidence interval [CI], 3.5; noninferiority margin, 4.1; P\u2009=\u20090.01 for noninferiority). The principal secondary outcome was observed in 174 patients (17.6%) in the zotarolimus-eluting stent group and in 169 (17.4%) in the polymer-free drug-coated stent group (risk difference, 0.2 percentage points; upper boundary of the one-sided 97.5% CI, 3.5; noninferiority margin, 4.4; P\u2009=\u20090.007 for noninferiority). CONCLUSIONS: Among patients at high bleeding risk who received 1 month of dual antiplatelet therapy after PCI, use of polymer-based zotarolimus-eluting stents was noninferior to use of polymer-free drug-coated stents with regard to safety and effectiveness composite outcomes.

        "A Randomized, Controlled Trial of Liraglutide for Adolescents with Obesity. BACKGROUND: Obesity is a chronic disease with limited treatment options in pediatric patients. Liraglutide may be useful for weight management in adolescents with obesity. METHODS: In this randomized, double-blind trial, which consisted of a 56-week treatment period and a 26-week follow-up period, we enrolled adolescents (12 to <18 years of age) with obesity and a poor response to lifestyle therapy alone. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either liraglutide (3.0 mg) or placebo subcutaneously once daily, in addition to lifestyle therapy. The primary end point was the change from baseline in the body-mass index (BMI; the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) standard-deviation score at week 56. RESULTS: A total of 125 participants were assigned to the liraglutide group and 126 to the placebo group. Liraglutide was superior to placebo with regard to the change from baseline in the BMI standard-deviation score at week 56 (estimated difference, -0.22; 95% confidence interval [CI], -0.37 to -0.08; P\u2009=\u20090.002). A reduction in BMI of at least 5% was observed in 51 of 113 participants in the liraglutide group and in 20 of 105 participants in the placebo group (estimated percentage, 43.3% vs. 18.7%), and a reduction in BMI of at least 10% was observed in 33 and 9, respectively (estimated percentage, 26.1% vs. 8.1%). A greater reduction was observed with liraglutide than with placebo for BMI (estimated difference, -4.64 percentage points) and for body weight (estimated difference, -4.50 kg [for absolute change] and -5.01 percentage points [for relative change]). After discontinuation, a greater increase in the BMI standard-deviation score was observed with liraglutide than with placebo (estimated difference, 0.15; 95% CI, 0.07 to 0.23). More participants in the liraglutide group than in the placebo group had gastrointestinal adverse events (81 of 125 [64.8%] vs. 46 of 126 [36.5%]) and adverse events that led to discontinuation of the trial treatment (13 [10.4%] vs. 0). Few participants in either group had serious adverse events (3 [2.4%] vs. 5 [4.0%]). One suicide, which occurred in the liraglutide group, was assessed by the investigator as unlikely to be related to the trial treatment. CONCLUSIONS: In adolescents with obesity, the use of liraglutide (3.0 mg) plus lifestyle therapy led to a significantly greater reduction in the BMI standard-deviation score than placebo plus lifestyle therapy.

Background and Purpose- The TST trial (Treat Stroke to Target) evaluated the benefit of targeting a LDL (low-density lipoprotein) cholesterol of <70 mg/dL to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events in 2860 patients with ischemic stroke with atherosclerotic stenosis of cerebral vasculature or aortic arch plaque >4 mm, in a French and Korean population. The follow-up lasted a median of 5.3 years in French patients (similar to the median follow-up time in the SPARCL trial [Stroke Prevention by Aggressive Reduction in Cholesterol Level]) and 2.0 years in Korean patients. Exposure duration to statin is a well-known driver for cardiovascular risk reduction. We report here the TST results in the French cohort. Methods- One thousand seventy-three French patients were assigned to <70 mg/dL (1.8 mmol/L) and 1075 to 100\u00b110 mg/dL (90-110 mg/dL, 2.3-2.8 mmol/L). To achieve these goals, investigators used the statin and dosage of their choice and added ezetimibe on top if needed. The primary outcome was the composite of ischemic stroke, myocardial infarction, new symptoms requiring urgent coronary or carotid revascularization and vascular death. Results- After a median follow-up of 5.3 years, the achieved LDL cholesterol was 66 (1.69 mmol/L) and 96 mg/dL (2.46 mmol/L) on average, respectively. The primary end point occurred in 9.6% and 12.9% of patients, respectively (HR, 0.74 [95% CI, 0.57-0.94]; P=0.019). Cerebral infarction or urgent carotid revascularization following transient ischemic attack was reduced by 27% (P=0.046). Cerebral infarction or intracranial hemorrhage was reduced by 28% (P=0.023). The primary outcome or intracranial hemorrhage was reduced by 25% (P=0.021). Intracranial hemorrhages occurred in 13 and 11 patients, respectively (HR, 1.17 [95% CI, 0.53-2.62]; P=0.70). Conclusions- After an ischemic stroke of documented atherosclerotic origin, targeting a LDL cholesterol of <70 mg/dL during 5.3 years avoided 1 subsequent major vascular event in 4 (number needed to treat of 30) and no increase in intracranial hemorrhage.

        "Time Trends in Survival Following First Hemorrhagic or Ischemic Stroke Between 1991 and 2015 in the Rotterdam Study. Background and Purpose- The introduction of stroke units and the implementation of evidence-based interventions have been a breakthrough in the management of patients with stroke over the past decade. Survival following stroke is an important indicator in monitoring stroke burden. Recent data on survival by stroke subtype in the general population is scarce. We assessed (1) recent temporal time trends in survival; (2) age-standardized death rates; (3) survival probabilities at 6 months, 1, 2, and 3 years following first hemorrhagic or ischemic stroke. Methods- Within the population-based Rotterdam Study between 1991 and 2015, we assessed time trends in survival among 162 with first-ever hemorrhagic and 988 patients with first-ever ischemic stroke across 3 time periods (1991-1998; 1999-2007; 2008-2015) using time-varying Cox regression model and calculated age-standardized death rates according to the European 2010 census population. Results- In the hemorrhagic stroke group, a total of 144 deaths occurred during 386 person-years. Following a hemorrhagic stroke, we observed similar mortality rates over the years with 30 per 100 person-years in 2015 compared with 25/100 person-years in 1991. Similarly, compared with the earliest study period (1991-1998), mortality rates remained unchanged in the latest study period (2008-2015; hazard ratio, 0.97 [95% CI, 0.61-1.57]; P=0.93). In the ischemic stroke group, a total of 711 deaths occurred during 4897 person-years. We observed a decline in mortality rates in 2015 (11 per 100 person-years) compared with 1991 (29/100 person-years). This translated to favorable trends in the latest study period 2008 to 2015 (hazard ratio, 0.71 [95% CI, 0.56-0.90]; P<0.01). Conclusions- Survival following ischemic stroke has improved over the past decade, while no change was observed in survival following hemorrhagic stroke. ",
        "Effect of Intravenous Tenecteplase Dose on Cerebral Reperfusion Before Thrombectomy in Patients With Large Vessel Occlusion Ischemic Stroke: The EXTEND-IA TNK Part 2 Randomized Clinical Trial. Importance: Intravenous thrombolysis with tenecteplase improves reperfusion prior to endovascular thrombectomy for ischemic stroke compared with alteplase. Objective: To determine whether 0.40 mg/kg of tenecteplase safely improves reperfusion before endovascular thrombectomy vs 0.25 mg/kg of tenecteplase in patients with large vessel occlusion ischemic stroke. Design, Setting, and Participants: Randomized clinical trial at 27 hospitals in Australia and 1 in New Zealand using open-label treatment and blinded assessment of radiological and clinical outcomes. Patients were enrolled from December 2017 to July 2019 with follow-up until October 2019. Adult patients (N\u2009=\u2009300) with ischemic stroke due to occlusion of the intracranial internal carotid, \\basilar, or middle cerebral artery were included less than 4.5 hours after symptom onset using standard intravenous thrombolysis eligibility criteria. Interventions: Open-label tenecteplase at 0.40 mg/kg (maximum, 40 mg; n\u2009=\u2009150) or 0.25 mg/kg (maximum, 25 mg; n\u2009=\u2009150) given as a bolus before endovascular thrombectomy. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was reperfusion of greater than 50% of the involved ischemic territory prior to thrombectomy, assessed by consensus of 2 blinded neuroradiologists. Prespecified secondary outcomes were level of disability at day 90 (modified Rankin Scale [mRS] score; range, 0-6); mRS score of 0 to 1 (freedom from disability) or no change from baseline at 90 days; mRS score of 0 to 2 (functional independence) or no change from baseline at 90 days; substantial neurological improvement at 3 days; symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage within 36 hours; and all-cause death. Results: All 300 patients who were randomized (mean age, 72.7 years; 141 [47%] women) completed the trial. The number of participants with greater than 50% reperfusion of the previously occluded vascular territory was 29 of 150 (19.3%) in the 0.40 mg/kg group vs 29 of 150 (19.3%) in the 0.25 mg/kg group (unadjusted risk difference, 0.0% [95% CI, -8.9% to -8.9%]; adjusted risk ratio, 1.03 [95% CI, 0.66-1.61]; P\u2009=\u2009.89). Among the 6 secondary outcomes, there were no significant differences in any of the 4 functional outcomes between the 0.40 mg/kg and 0.25 mg/kg groups nor in all-cause deaths (26 [17%] vs 22 [15%]; unadjusted risk difference, 2.7% [95% CI, -5.6% to 11.0%]) or symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (7 [4.7%] vs 2 [1.3%]; unadjusted risk difference, 3.3% [95% CI, -0.5% to 7.2%]). Conclusions and Relevance: Among patients with large vessel occlusion ischemic stroke, a dose of 0.40 mg/kg, compared with 0.25 mg/kg, of tenecteplase did not significantly improve cerebral reperfusion prior to endovascular thrombectomy. The findings suggest that the 0.40-mg/kg dose of tenecteplase does not confer an advantage over the 0.25-mg/kg dose in patients with large vessel occlusion ischemic stroke in whom endovascular thrombectomy is planned.

        "Randomized, Multicenter, Phase II Trial of Gemcitabine and Cisplatin With or Without Veliparib in Patients With Pancreas Adenocarcinoma and a Germline BRCA/PALB2 Mutation. PURPOSE: Five percent to 9% of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas (PDACs) develop in patients with a germline BRCA1/2 or PALB2 (gBRCA/PALB2+) mutation. Phase IB data from a trial that used cisplatin, gemcitabine, and veliparib treatment demonstrated a high response rate (RR), disease control rate (DCR), and overall survival (OS) in this population. We designed an open-label, randomized, multicenter, two-arm phase II trial to investigate cisplatin and gemcitabine with or without veliparib in gBRCA/PALB2+ PDAC. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eligible patients had untreated gBRCA/PALB2+ PDAC with measurable stage III to IV disease and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 to 1. Treatment for patients in arm A consisted of cisplatin 25 mg/m2 and gemcitabine 600 mg/m2 intravenously on days 3 and 10; treatment for patients in arm B was the same as that for patients in arm A, and arm A also received veliparib 80 mg orally twice per day on days 1 to 12 cycled every 3 weeks. The primary end point was RRs of arm A and arm B evaluated separately using a Simon two-stage design. Secondary end points were progression-free survival, DCR, OS, safety, and correlative analyses. RESULTS: Fifty patients were evaluated by modified intention-to-treat analysis. The RR for arm A was 74.1% and 65.2% for arm B (P = .55); both arms exceeded the prespecified activity threshold. DCR was 100% for arm A and 78.3% for arm B (P = .02). Median progression-free survival was 10.1 months for arm A (95% CI, 6.7 to 11.5 months) and 9.7 months for arm B (95% CI, 4.2 to 13.6 months; P = .73). Median OS for arm A was 15.5 months (95% CI, 12.2 to 24.3 months) and 16.4 months for arm B (95% CI, 11.7 to 23.4 months; P = .6). Two-year OS rate for the entire cohort was 30.6% (95% CI, 17.8% to 44.4%), and 3-year OS rate was 17.8% (95% CI, 8.1% to 30.7%). Grade 3 to 4 hematologic toxicities for arm A versus arm B were 13 (48%) versus seven (30%) for neutropenia, 15 (55%) versus two (9%) for thrombocytopenia, and 14 (52%) versus eight (35%) for anemia. CONCLUSION: Cisplatin and gemcitabine is an effective regimen in advanced gBRCA/PALB2+ PDAC. Concurrent veliparib did not improve RR. These data establish cisplatin and gemcitabine as a standard approach in gBRCA/PALB2+ PDAC. ",
        "Nonsedation or Light Sedation in Critically Ill, Mechanically Ventilated Patients. BACKGROUND: In critically ill, mechanically ventilated patients, daily interruption of sedation has been shown to reduce the time on ventilation and the length of stay in the intensive care unit (ICU). Data on whether a plan of no sedation, as compared with a plan of light sedation, has an effect on mortality are lacking. METHODS: In a multicenter, randomized, controlled trial, we assigned, in a 1:1 ratio, mechanically ventilated ICU patients to a plan of no sedation (nonsedation group) or to a plan of light sedation (i.e., to a level at which the patient was arousable, defined as a score of -2 to -3 on the Richmond Agitation and Sedation Scale [RASS], on which scores range from -5 [unresponsive] to +4 [combative]) (sedation group) with daily interruption. The primary outcome was mortality at 90 days. Secondary outcomes were the number of major thromboembolic events, the number of days free from coma or delirium, acute kidney injury according to severity, the number of ICU-free days, and the number of ventilator-free days. Between-group differences were calculated as the value in the nonsedation group minus the value in the sedation group. RESULTS: A total of 710 patients underwent randomization, and 700 were included in the modified intention-to-treat analysis. The characteristics of the patients at baseline were similar in the two trial groups, except for the score on the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II, which was 1 point higher in the nonsedation group than in the sedation group, indicating a greater chance of in-hospital death. The mean RASS score in the nonsedation group increased from -1.3 on day 1 to -0.8 on day 7 and, in the sedation group, from -2.3 on day 1 to -1.8 on day 7. Mortality at 90 days was 42.4% in the nonsedation group and 37.0% in the sedated group (difference, 5.4 percentage points; 95% confidence interval [CI], -2.2 to 12.2; P\u2009=\u20090.65). The number of ICU-free days and of ventilator-free days did not differ significantly between the trial groups. The patients in the nonsedation group had a median of 27 days free from coma or delirium, and those in the sedation group had a median of 26 days free from coma or delirium. A major thromboembolic event occurred in 1 patient (0.3%) in the nonsedation group and in 10 patients (2.8%) in the sedation group (difference, -2.5 percentage points; 95% CI, -4.8 to -0.7 [unadjusted for multiple comparisons]). CONCLUSIONS: Among mechanically ventilated ICU patients, mortality at 90 days did not differ significantly between those assigned to a plan of no sedation and those assigned to a plan of light sedation with daily interruption.

        "Effect of Intravenous Interferon \u03b2-1a on Death and Days Free From Mechanical Ventilation Among Patients With Moderate to Severe Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome: A Randomized Clinical Trial. Importance: Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is associated with high mortality. Interferon (IFN) \u03b2-1a may prevent the underlying event of vascular leakage. Objective: To determine the efficacy and adverse events of IFN-\u03b2-1a in patients with moderate to severe ARDS. Design, Setting, and Participants: Multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group trial conducted at 74 intensive care units in 8 European countries (December 2015-December 2017) that included 301 adults with moderate to severe ARDS according to the Berlin definition. The radiological and partial pressure of oxygen, arterial (Pao2)/fraction of inspired oxygen (Fio2) criteria for ARDS had to be met within a 24-hour period, and the administration of the first dose of the study drug had to occur within 48 hours of the diagnosis of ARDS. The last patient visit was on March 6, 2018. Interventions: Patients were randomized to receive an intravenous injection of 10 \u03bcg of IFN-\u03b2-1a (144 patients) or placebo (152 patients) once daily for 6 days. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was a score combining death and number of ventilator-free days at day 28 (score ranged from -1 for death to 27 if the patient was off ventilator on the first day). There were 16 secondary outcomes, including 28-day mortality, which were tested hierarchically to control type I error. Results: Among 301 patients who were randomized (mean age, 58 years; 103 women [34.2%]), 296 (98.3%) completed the trial and were included in the primary analysis. At 28 days, the median composite score of death and number of ventilator-free days at day 28 was 10 days (interquartile range, -1 to 20) in the IFN-\u03b2-1a group and 8.5 days (interquartile range, 0 to 20) in the placebo group (P\u2009=\u2009.82). There was no significant difference in 28-day mortality between the IFN-\u03b2-1a vs placebo groups (26.4% vs 23.0%; difference, 3.4% [95% CI, -8.1% to 14.8%]; P\u2009=\u2009.53). Seventy-four patients (25.0%) experienced adverse events considered to be related to treatment during the study (41 patients [28.5%] in the IFN-\u03b2-1a group and 33 [21.7%] in the placebo group). Conclusions and Relevance: Among adults with moderate or severe ARDS, intravenous IFN-\u03b2-1a administered for 6 days, compared with placebo, resulted in no significant difference in a composite score that included death and number of ventilator-free days over 28 days. These results do not support the use of IFN-\u03b2-1a in the management of ARDS. Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02622724. ",
        "Vaping-Associated Respiratory Distress Syndrome: Case Classification and Clinical Guidance. Exposure to vaping is associated with a growing list of respiratory syndromes including an acute progressive form with life-threatening hypoxemic respiratory failure and pathologic changes of lung injury termed vaping-associated respiratory distress syndrome. Center from Disease Control, Departments of Public Health, MEDLINE (via PubMed), and the Cochrane Library. Cases, series, and public health reports of cases that met the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention case definition of vaping-associated respiratory disease were extracted by an author with perfect verification by a second. Cases were classified on the basis of toxin exposure, symptoms, oxygen saturation, progression to respiratory failure, and pathologic features, and a clinically actionable system of classification was based on expert opinion. The reported spectrum of vaping-associated respiratory diseases allows clinical classification of cases into groups with distinct evaluation, management, and recommendations for prevention and follow-up. Clinical stratification also identifies a small proportion of vaping-exposed patients who are at risk for progression to hypoxemic respiratory failure and an acute respiratory distress syndrome-like illness.

        "Association of Initiation of Dialysis With Hospital Length of Stay and Intensity of Care in Older Adults With Kidney Failure. Importance: Comparative outcome data examining the association of dialysis initiation with hospital length of stay and intensity of care in older adults with kidney failure are scarce, and prior studies are limited to patients treated by nephrology teams. Objective: To compare in-hospital days and intensity of care among older adults with kidney failure who were treated vs not treated with maintenance dialysis. Design, Setting, and Participants: This population-based, retrospective cohort study included adults in Alberta, Canada, 65 years or older with kidney failure, defined by at least 2 consecutive outpatient estimated glomerular filtration rate values of less than 10 mL/min/1.73 m2 spanning a period of at least 90 days from May 15, 2002, to March 31, 2014. Data were analyzed from August 1, 2017, to August 29, 2019. Exposures: Time-varying exposure to maintenance dialysis for treatment of kidney failure. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was rate of in-hospital days. Secondary outcomes included rates of hospital admissions, intensive care unit admissions, cardiopulmonary resuscitations, inpatient palliative care, and emergency department visits; risk of in-hospital death; and time to admission to long-term care. Results: A total of 968 patients (median age, 78.5 [interquartile range, 72.4-84.7] years; 489 men [50.5%]; median follow-up, 2.0 [interquartile range, 0.8-3.9] years) were included in the analysis. Patients who underwent dialysis spent more adjusted in-hospital days per person-year (36.25 [95% CI, 30.72-41.77] vs 14.65 [95% CI, 12.28-17.02]; incidence rate ratio [IRR], 2.47 [95% CI, 1.99-3.08]). However, the dialysis group did not have a higher rate of hospital admissions (1.18 [95% CI 1.07-1.29] vs 1.32 [95% CI 1.17-1.48] per year; IRR, 0.89 [95% CI, 0.77-1.03]). Patients in the dialysis group had a higher rate of intensive care unit admissions per 1000 hospitalizations (98.37 [95% CI, 81.09-115.65] vs 54.51 [95% CI, 37.76-71.26]; IRR, 1.80 [95% CI, 1.28-2.54]) and lower rates of inpatient palliative care per 1000 in-hospital days (3.92 [95% CI, 3.13-4.72] vs 8.60 [95% CI, 6.3-11.0]; IRR, 0.45 [95% CI, 0.32-0.64]). Conclusions and Relevance: In this cohort study, compared with nondialysis care, patients who received maintenance dialysis spent more time in the hospital and were more likely to be admitted to intensive care units. This finding suggests trade-offs between longer survival and higher intensity of use of health care services as a function of dialysis initiation. Maintenance dialysis may be a proxy for the type of philosophy of care driving increased in-hospital time and intensive care and less use of palliative care. ",
        "17-Gene Genomic Prostate Score Test Results in the Canary Prostate Active Surveillance Study (PASS) Cohort. PURPOSE: The 17-gene Oncotype DX Genomic Prostate Score (GPS) test predicts adverse pathology (AP) in patients with low-risk prostate cancer treated with immediate surgery. We evaluated the GPS test as a predictor of outcomes in a multicenter active surveillance cohort. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Diagnostic biopsy tissue was obtained from men enrolled at 8 sites in the Canary Prostate Active Surveillance Study. The primary endpoint was AP (Gleason Grade Group [GG] \u2265 3, \u2265 pT3a) in men who underwent radical prostatectomy (RP) after initial surveillance. Multivariable regression models for interval-censored data were used to evaluate the association between AP and GPS. Inverse probability of censoring weighting was applied to adjust for informative censoring. Predictiveness curves were used to evaluate how models stratified risk of AP. Association between GPS and time to upgrade on surveillance biopsy was evaluated using Cox proportional hazards models. RESULTS: GPS results were obtained for 432 men (median follow-up, 4.6 years); 101 underwent RP after a median 2.1 years of surveillance, and 52 had AP. A total of 167 men (39%) upgraded at a subsequent biopsy. GPS was significantly associated with AP when adjusted for diagnostic GG (hazards ratio [HR]/5 GPS units, 1.18; 95% CI, 1.04 to 1.44; P = .030), but not when also adjusted for prostate-specific antigen density (PSAD; HR, 1.85; 95% CI, 0.99 to 4.19; P = .066). Models containing PSAD and GG, or PSAD, GG, and GPS may stratify risk better than a model with GPS and GG. No association was observed between GPS and subsequent biopsy upgrade (P = .48). CONCLUSION: In our study, the independent association of GPS with AP after initial active surveillance was not statistically significant, and there was no association with upgrading in surveillance biopsy. Adding GPS to a model containing PSAD and diagnostic GG did not significantly improve stratification of risk for AP over the clinical variables alone. ",
        "Global, regional, and national burden of chronic kidney disease, 1990-2017: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2017. BACKGROUND: Health system planning requires careful assessment of chronic kidney disease (CKD) epidemiology, but data for morbidity and mortality of this disease are scarce or non-existent in many countries. We estimated the global, regional, and national burden of CKD, as well as the burden of cardiovascular disease and gout attributable to impaired kidney function, for the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2017. We use the term CKD to refer to the morbidity and mortality that can be directly attributed to all stages of CKD, and we use the term impaired kidney function to refer to the additional risk of CKD from cardiovascular disease and gout. METHODS: The main data sources we used were published literature, vital registration systems, end-stage kidney disease registries, and household surveys. Estimates of CKD burden were produced using a Cause of Death Ensemble model and a Bayesian meta-regression analytical tool, and included incidence, prevalence, years lived with disability, mortality, years of life lost, and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs). A comparative risk assessment approach was used to estimate the proportion of cardiovascular diseases and gout burden attributable to impaired kidney function. FINDINGS: Globally, in 2017, 1\u00b72 million (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 1\u00b72 to 1\u00b73) people died from CKD. The global all-age mortality rate from CKD increased 41\u00b75% (95% UI 35\u00b72 to 46\u00b75) between 1990 and 2017, although there was no significant change in the age-standardised mortality rate (2\u00b78%, -1\u00b75 to 6\u00b73). In 2017, 697\u00b75 million (95% UI 649\u00b72 to 752\u00b70) cases of all-stage CKD were recorded, for a global prevalence of 9\u00b71% (8\u00b75 to 9\u00b78). The global all-age prevalence of CKD increased 29\u00b73% (95% UI 26\u00b74 to 32\u00b76) since 1990, whereas the age-standardised prevalence remained stable (1\u00b72%, -1\u00b71 to 3\u00b75). CKD resulted in 35\u00b78 million (95% UI 33\u00b77 to 38\u00b70) DALYs in 2017, with diabetic nephropathy accounting for almost a third of DALYs. Most of the burden of CKD was concentrated in the three lowest quintiles of Socio-demographic Index (SDI). In several regions, particularly Oceania, sub-Saharan Africa, and Latin America, the burden of CKD was much higher than expected for the level of development, whereas the disease burden in western, eastern, and central sub-Saharan Africa, east Asia, south Asia, central and eastern Europe, Australasia, and western Europe was lower than expected. 1\u00b74 million (95% UI 1\u00b72 to 1\u00b76) cardiovascular disease-related deaths and 25\u00b73 million (22\u00b72 to 28\u00b79) cardiovascular disease DALYs were attributable to impaired kidney function. INTERPRETATION: Kidney disease has a major effect on global health, both as a direct cause of global morbidity and mortality and as an important risk factor for cardiovascular disease. CKD is largely preventable and treatable and deserves greater attention in global health policy decision making, particularly in locations with low and middle SDI.

        "Dietary flavonols and risk of Alzheimer dementia. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether dietary intake of flavonols is associated with Alzheimer dementia. METHODS: The study was conducted among 921 participants of the Rush Memory and Aging Project (MAP), an ongoing community-based, prospective cohort. Participants completed annual neurologic evaluations and dietary assessments using a validated food frequency questionnaire. RESULTS: Among 921 MAP participants who initially had no dementia in the analyzed sample, 220 developed Alzheimer dementia. The mean age of the sample was 81.2 years (SD 7.2), with the majority (n = 691, 75%) being female. Participants with the highest intake of total flavonols had higher levels of education and more participation in physical and cognitive activities. In Cox proportional hazards models, dietary intakes of flavonols were inversely associated with incident Alzheimer dementia in models adjusted for age, sex, education, APOE \u025b4, and participation in cognitive and physical activities. Hazard ratios (HRs) for the fifth vs first quintiles of intake were as follows: for total flavonol, 0.52 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.33-0.84); for kaempferol, 0.49 (95% CI, 0.31-0.77); for myricetin, 0.62 (95% CI, 0.4-0.97); and for isorhamnetin, 0.62 (95% CI, 0.39-0.98). Quercetin was not associated with Alzheimer dementia (HR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.43-1.09). CONCLUSION: Higher dietary intakes of flavonols may be associated with reduced risk of developing Alzheimer dementia. ",
        "Symptom improvement in children with autism spectrum disorder following bumetanide administration is associated with decreased GABA/glutamate ratios. Bumetanide has been reported to alter synaptic excitation-inhibition (E-I) balance by potentiating the action of \u03b3-aminobutyric acid (GABA), thereby attenuating the severity of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in animal models. However, clinical evidence of its efficacy in young patients with ASD is limited. This was investigated in the present clinical trial of 83 patients, randomised to the bumetanide group (bumetanide treatment, 0.5\u2009mg twice daily) or the control group (no bumetanide treatment). Primary [Children Autism Rating Scale (CARS)], secondary [Clinical Global Impressions (CGI)], and exploratory [inhibitory (\u03b3-aminobutyric acid, GABA) and excitatory (glutamate, Glx) neurotransmitter concentrations measured in the insular cortex (IC) and visual cortex (VC) by magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS)] outcome measures were evaluated at baseline and at the 3-month follow-up. Side effects were monitored throughout the treatment course. Compared with the control group, the bumetanide group showed significant reduction in symptom severity, as indicated by both total CARS score and number of items assigned a score\u2009\u2265\u20093. The improvement in clinical symptoms was confirmed by CGI. GABA/Glx ratio in both the IC and VC decreased more rapidly over the 3-month period in the bumetanide group than that in the control group. This decrease in the IC was associated with the symptom improvement in the bumetanide group. Our study confirmed the clinical efficacy of bumetanide on alleviating the core symptoms of ASD in young children and it is the first demonstration that the improvement is associated with reduction in GABA/Glx ratios. This study suggests that the GABA/Glx ratio measured by MRS may provide a neuroimaging biomarker for assessing treatment efficacy for bumetanide. ",

METHODS: The guideline panel followed the American Academy of Neurology 2011 guideline development process, as amended. The systematic review included studies through December 2017. Recommendations were based on evidence, related evidence, principles of care, and inferences. MAJOR RECOMMENDATIONS LEVEL B: For children and adolescents with ASD and sleep disturbance, clinicians should assess for medications and coexisting conditions that could contribute to the sleep disturbance and should address identified issues. Clinicians should counsel parents regarding strategies for improved sleep habits with behavioral strategies as a first-line treatment approach for sleep disturbance either alone or in combination with pharmacologic or nutraceutical approaches. Clinicians should offer melatonin if behavioral strategies have not been helpful and contributing coexisting conditions and use of concomitant medications have been addressed, starting with a low dose. Clinicians should recommend using pharmaceutical-grade melatonin if available. Clinicians should counsel children, adolescents, and parents regarding potential adverse effects of melatonin use and the lack of long-term safety data. Clinicians should counsel that there is currently no evidence to support the routine use of weighted blankets or specialized mattress technology for improving disrupted sleep. If asked about weighted blankets, clinicians should counsel that the trial reported no serious adverse events with blanket use and that blankets could be a reasonable nonpharmacologic approach for some individuals.

        "Association Between Adverse Childhood Experiences and Dementia in Older Japanese Adults. Importance: The prevalence of dementia in Japan has been increasing. Childhood poverty has been associated with increased risk of cognitive impairment, possibly mediated by individuals' educational paths. However, the associations between dementia and adverse childhood experiences other than poverty and education have not been well documented. Objective: To examine the association between adverse childhood experiences and dementia onset among Japanese individuals born before 1948 who grew up during and after World War II. Design, Setting, and Participants: A 3-year (2013-2016) follow-up was performed of 17\u202f412 participants in the Japan Gerontological Evaluation Study, a population-based cohort study of adults aged 65 years or older. Data were analyzed in December 2019. Main Outcomes and Measures: Dementia onset was assessed through the public long-term care insurance system. Adverse childhood experiences before the age of 18 years were assessed by survey at baseline. Seven adverse childhood experiences were assessed: parental death, parental divorce, parental mental illness, family violence, physical abuse, psychological neglect, and psychological abuse. Participants were classified according to whether they had 0, 1, 2, or 3 or more adverse childhood experiences. Cox regression models were used to estimate hazard ratios for the risk of dementia. Results: Among 17\u202f412 participants (9281 women [53.3%]; mean [SD] age, 73.5 [6.0] years), dementia occurred in 703 participants (312 men and 391 women) during a mean follow-up of 3.2 years (range, 2.4-3.3 years). Among all participants, 6804 (39.1%) were older than 75 years; 10\u202f968 (63.0%) reported 0 adverse childhood experiences, 5129 (29.5%) reported 1 adverse childhood experience, 964 (5.5%) reported 2 adverse childhood experiences, and 351 (2.0%) reported 3 or more adverse childhood experiences. Participants who experienced 3 or more adverse childhood experiences had a greater risk of developing dementia compared with those who grew up without adverse childhood experiences, after adjustment for age, sex, childhood economic hardship, nutritional environment, and education (hazard ratio, 2.18; 95% CI, 1.42-3.35). After successive adjustment for adult sociodemographic characteristics, social relationships, health behavior, and health status, this hazard ratio was attenuated but remained statistically significant (1.78; 95% CI, 1.15-2.75; P\u2009=\u2009.009). Conclusions and Relevance: This study found that having 3 or more adverse childhood experiences was associated with increased dementia risk among older Japanese adults. ",
        "Association of Dual Decline in Memory and Gait Speed With Risk for Dementia Among Adults Older Than 60 Years: A Multicohort Individual-Level Meta-analysis. Importance: Dual decline in both memory and gait speed may characterize a group of older individuals at high risk for future dementia. Objective: To assess the risk of dementia in older persons who experience parallel declines in memory and gait speed compared with those who experience no decline or decline in either memory or gait speed only. Design, Setting, and Participants: A multicohort meta-analysis was performed of 6 prospective cohort studies conducted between 1997 and 2018 in the United States and Europe. Participants were 60 years or older, had an initial gait speed of more than 0.6 m/s (ie, free of overt dismobility), with repeated measures of memory and gait speed before dementia diagnosis during a mean follow-up of 6.6 to 14.5 years. Within each study, participants were divided into 4 groups: memory decline only, gait speed decline only, dual decline, or no decline (hereafter referred to as usual agers). Gait decline was defined as a loss of 0.05 m/s or more per year; memory decline was defined as being in the cohort-specific lowest tertile of annualized change. Main Outcomes and Measures: Risk of incident dementia according to group membership was examined by Cox proportional hazards regression with usual agers as the reference, adjusted for baseline age, sex, race/ethnicity, educational level, study site, and baseline gait speed and memory. Results: Across the 6 studies of 8699 participants, mean age ranged between 70 and 74 years and mean gait speed ranged between 1.05 and 1.26 m/s. Incident dementia ranged from 5 to 21 per 1000 person-years. Compared with usual agers, participants with only memory decline had 2.2 to 4.6 times higher risk for developing dementia (pooled hazard ratio, 3.45 [95% CI, 2.45-4.86]). Those with only gait decline had 2.1 to 3.6 times higher risk (pooled hazard ratio, 2.24 [95% CI, 1.62-3.09]). Those with dual decline had 5.2 to 11.7 times the risk (pooled hazard ratio, 6.28 [95% CI, 4.56-8.64]). Conclusions and Relevance: In this study, dual decline of memory and gait speed was associated with increased risk of developing dementia among older individuals, which might be a potentially valuable group for preventive or therapeutic interventions. Why dual decline is associated with an elevated risk of dementia and whether these individuals progress to dementia through specific mechanisms should be investigated by future studies. ",
        "Randomized placebo-controlled trial of the effects of aspirin on dementia and cognitive decline. OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of low-dose aspirin vs placebo on incident all-cause dementia, incident Alzheimer disease (AD), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and cognitive decline in older individuals. METHODS: Aspirin in Reducing Events in the Elderly (ASPREE) was a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of low-dose aspirin. In the United States and Australia, community-dwelling individuals aged \u226570 years (US minorities \u226565 years) and free of cardiovascular disease, physical disability, and diagnosed dementia were enrolled. Participants were randomized 1:1-100 mg daily aspirin or placebo. The Modified Mini-Mental State Examination, Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-Revised, Symbol Digit Modalities Test, and Controlled Oral Word Association Test assessed cognition at baseline and over follow-up. Additional cognitive testing was performed in participants with suspected dementia (\"trigger\") based on within-study assessments or clinical history. Dementia was adjudicated according to DSM-IV criteria. National Institute on Aging-Alzheimer's Association criteria were used for AD and MCI subclassification. RESULTS: A total of 19,114 participants were followed over a median 4.7 years and 964 triggered further dementia assessments. There were 575 adjudicated dementia cases, and 41% were classified as clinically probable AD. There was no substantial difference in the risk of all dementia triggers (hazard ratio [HR], 1.03; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.91-1.17), probable AD (HR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.74-1.24), or MCI (HR, 1.12; 95% CI, 0.92-1.37) between aspirin and placebo. Cognitive change over time was similar in the aspirin and placebo groups. CONCLUSIONS: There was no evidence that aspirin was effective in reducing risk of dementia, MCI, or cognitive decline. Follow-up of these outcomes after initial exposure is ongoing. CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE: This study provides Class II evidence that for healthy older individuals, low-dose aspirin does not significantly reduce the incidence of dementia, probable AD, MCI, or cognitive decline.

        "Association Between Cardiovascular Disease and Long-term Exposure to Air Pollution With the Risk of Dementia. Importance: Emerging yet contrasting evidence associates air pollution with incident dementia, and the potential role of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in this association is unclear. Objective: To investigate the association between long-term exposure to air pollution and dementia and to assess the role of CVD in that association. Design, Setting, and Participants: Data for this cohort study were extracted from the ongoing Swedish National Study on Aging and Care in Kungsholmen (SNAC-K), a longitudinal population-based study with baseline assessments from March 21, 2001, through August 30, 2004. Of the 5111 randomly selected residents in the Kungsholmen district of Stockholm 60 years or older and living at home or in institutions, 521 were not eligible (eg, due to death before the start of the study or no contact information). Among the remaining 4590 individuals, 3363 (73.3%) were assessed. For the current analysis, 2927 participants who did not have dementia at baseline were examined, with follow-up to 2013 (mean [SD] follow-up time, 6.01\u2009[2.56] years). Follow-up was completed February 18, 2013, and data were analyzed from June 26, 2018, through June 20, 2019. Exposures: Two major air pollutants (particulate matter \u22642.5 \u03bcm [PM2.5] and nitrogen oxide [NOx]) were assessed yearly from 1990, using dispersion models for outdoor levels at residential addresses. Main Outcomes and Measures: The hazard of dementia was estimated using Cox proportional hazards regression models. The potential of CVD (ie, atrial fibrillation, ischemic heart disease, heart failure, and stroke) to modify and mediate the association between long-term exposure to air pollution and dementia was tested using stratified analyses and generalized structural equation modeling. Results: At baseline, the mean (SD) age of the 2927 participants was 74.1 (10.7) years, and 1845 (63.0%) were female. Three hundred sixty-four participants with incident dementia were identified. The hazard of dementia increased by as much as 50% per interquartile range difference in mean pollutant levels during the previous 5 years at the residential address (hazard ratio [HR] for difference of 0.88 \u03bcg/m3 PM2.5, 1.54 [95% CI, 1.33-1.78]; HR for difference of 8.35 \u03bcg/m3 NOx, 1.14 [95% CI, 1.01-1.29]). Heart failure (HR for PM2.5, 1.93 [95% CI, 1.54-2.43]; HR for NOx, 1.43 [95% CI, 1.17-1.75]) and ischemic heart disease (HR for PM2.5, 1.67 [95% CI, 1.32-2.12]; HR for NOx, 1.36 [95% CI, 1.07-1.71]) enhanced the dementia risk, whereas stroke appeared to be the most important intermediate condition, explaining 49.4% of air pollution-related dementia cases. Conclusions and Relevance: This study found that long-term exposure to air pollution was associated with a higher risk of dementia. Heart failure and ischemic heart disease appeared to enhance the association between air pollution and dementia, whereas stroke seemed to be an important intermediate condition between the association of air pollution exposure with dementia.

        "Association Between Neurological Disorders and Death by Suicide in Denmark. Importance: Neurological disorders have been linked to suicide, but the risk across a broad spectrum of neurological disorders remains to be assessed. Objectives: To examine whether people with neurological disorders die by suicide more often than other people and to assess for temporal associations. Design, Setting, and Participants: Nationwide, retrospective cohort study on all persons 15 years or older living in Denmark, from 1980 through 2016 (N\u2009=\u20097\u202f300\u202f395). Exposures: Medical contact for head injury, stroke, epilepsy, polyneuropathy, diseases of myoneural junction, Parkinson disease, multiple sclerosis, central nervous system infections, meningitis, encephalitis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Huntington disease, dementia, intellectual disability, and other brain diseases from 1977 through 2016 (n\u2009=\u20091\u202f248\u202f252). Main Outcomes and Measures: Death by suicide during 1980-2016. Adjusted incidence rate ratio (IRRs) were estimated using Poisson regressions, adjusted for sociodemographics, comorbidity, psychiatric diagnoses, and self-harm. Results: Of the more than 7.3 million individuals observed over 161\u202f935\u202f233 person-years (49.1% males), 35\u202f483 died by suicide (median duration of follow-up, 23.6 years; interquartile range, 10.0-37.0 years; mean age, 51.9 years; SD, 17.9 years). Of those, 77.4% were males, and 14.7% (n\u2009=\u20095141) were diagnosed with a neurological disorder, equivalent to a suicide rate of 44.0 per 100\u202f000 person-years compared with 20.1 per 100\u202f000 person-years among individuals not diagnosed with a neurological disorder. People diagnosed with a neurological disorder had an adjusted IRR of 1.8 (95% CI, 1.7-1.8) compared with those not diagnosed. The excess adjusted IRRs were 4.9 (95% CI, 3.5-6.9) for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, 4.9 (95% CI, 3.1-7.7) for Huntington disease, 2.2 (95% CI, 1.9-2.6) for multiple sclerosis, 1.7 (95% CI, 1.6-1.7) for head injury, 1.3 (95% CI, 1.2-1.3) for stroke, and 1.7 (95% CI, 1.6-1.8) for epilepsy. The association varied according to time since diagnosis with an adjusted IRR for 1 to 3 months of 3.1 (95% CI, 2.7-3.6) and for 10 or more years, 1.5 (95% CI, 1.4 to 1.6, P\u2009<\u2009.001). Compared with those who were not diagnosed with a neurological disorder, those with dementia had a lower overall adjusted IRR of 0.8 (95% CI, 0.7-0.9), which was elevated during the first month after diagnosis to 3.0 (95% CI, 1.9-4.6; P\u2009<\u2009.001). The absolute risk of suicide for people with Huntington disease was 1.6% (95% CI, 1.0%-2.5%). Conclusions and Relevance: In Denmark from 1980 through 2016, there was a significantly higher rate of suicide among those with a diagnosed neurological disorder than persons not diagnosed with a neurological disorder. However, the absolute risk difference was small. ",
        "Association of out-of-pocket costs on adherence to common neurologic medications. OBJECTIVE: To determine the association between out-of-pocket costs and medication adherence in 3 common neurologic diseases. METHODS: Utilizing privately insured claims from 2001 to 2016, we identified patients with incident neuropathy, dementia, or Parkinson disease (PD). We selected patients who were prescribed medications with similar efficacy and tolerability, but differential out-of-pocket costs (neuropathy with gabapentinoids or mixed serotonin/norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors [SNRIs], dementia with cholinesterase inhibitors, PD with dopamine agonists). Medication adherence was defined as the number of days supplied in the first 6 months. Instrumental variable analysis was used to estimate the association of out-of-pocket costs and other patient factors on medication adherence. RESULTS: We identified 52,249 patients with neuropathy on gabapentinoids, 5,246 patients with neuropathy on SNRIs, 19,820 patients with dementia on cholinesterase inhibitors, and 3,130 patients with PD on dopamine agonists. Increasing out-of-pocket costs by $50 was associated with significantly lower medication adherence for patients with neuropathy on gabapentinoids (adjusted incidence rate ratio [IRR] 0.91, 0.89-0.93) and dementia (adjusted IRR 0.88, 0.86-0.91). Increased out-of-pocket costs for patients with neuropathy on SNRIs (adjusted IRR 0.97, 0.88-1.08) and patients with PD (adjusted IRR 0.90, 0.81-1.00) were not significantly associated with medication adherence. Minority populations had lower adherence with gabapentinoids and cholinesterase inhibitors compared to white patients. CONCLUSIONS: Higher out-of-pocket costs were associated with lower medication adherence in 3 common neurologic conditions. When prescribing medications, physicians should consider these costs in order to increase adherence, especially as out-of-pocket costs continue to rise. Racial/ethnic disparities were also observed; therefore, minority populations should receive additional focus in future intervention efforts to improve adherence. ",
        "Neoantigen responses, immune correlates, and favorable outcomes after ipilimumab treatment of patients with prostate cancer. Tumors with high mutational burden (TMB) tend to be responsive to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) because there are neoantigens available for targeting by reinvigorated T cells, whereas those with low TMB demonstrate limited clinical responses. To determine whether antigen-specific T cell responses can be elicited after treatment with ICB in cancers that have a low TMB, we conducted a clinical trial with ipilimumab in 30 patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. We identified two distinct cohorts by survival and progression times: \"favorable\" (n = 9) and \"unfavorable\" (n = 10). Patients in the favorable cohort had high intratumoral CD8 T cell density and IFN-\u03b3 response gene signature and/or antigen-specific T cell responses. Two patients with a relatively low TMB had T cell responses against unique neoantigens. Moreover, six of nine patients in the favorable group are still alive at the time of analysis, with survival ranging from 33 to 54 months after treatment. All 10 patients in the unfavorable cohort have succumbed to their disease and had survival ranging from 0.6 to 10.3 months. Collectively, our data indicate that immunological correlates associated with effector T cell responses are observed in patients with metastatic prostate cancer who benefit from ICB. ",
        "Associations of Apolipoprotein E \u03b54 Genotype and Ball Heading With Verbal Memory in Amateur Soccer Players. Importance: Emerging evidence suggests that long-term exposure to ball heading in soccer, the most popular sport in the world, confers risk for adverse cognitive outcomes. However, the extent to which the apolipoprotein E \u03b54 (APOE \u03b54) allele, a common risk factor for neurodegeneration, and ball heading are associated with cognition in soccer players remains unknown. Objective: To determine whether the APOE \u03b54 allele and 12-month ball heading exposure are associated with verbal memory in a cohort of adult amateur soccer players. Design, Settings, and Participants: A total of 379 amateur soccer players were enrolled in the longitudinal Einstein Soccer Study from November 11, 2013, through January 23, 2018. Selection criteria included participation in soccer for more than 5 years and for more than 6 months per year. Of the 379 individuals enrolled in the study, 355 were genotyped. Three players were excluded for reporting extreme levels of heading. Generalized estimating equation linear regression models were employed to combine data across visits for a cross-sectional analysis of the data. Exposures: At each study visit every 3 to 6 months, players completed the HeadCount 12-Month Questionnaire, a validated, computer-based questionnaire to estimate 12-month heading exposure that was categorized as low (quartiles 1 and 2), moderate (quartile 3), and high (quartile 4). Main Outcome and Measures: Verbal memory was assessed at each study visit using the International Shopping List Delayed Recall task from CogState. Results: A total of 352 soccer players (256 men and 96 women; median age, 23 years [interquartile range, 21-28 years]) across a total of 1204 visits were analyzed. High levels of heading were associated with worse verbal memory performance (\u03b2\u2009=\u2009-0.59; 95% CI, -0.93 to -0.25; P\u2009=\u2009.001). There was no main association of APOE \u03b54 with verbal memory (\u03b2\u2009=\u20090.09; 95% CI, -0.24 to 0.42; P\u2009=\u2009.58). However, there was a significant association of APOE \u03b54 and heading with performance on the ISRL task (\u03c72\u2009=\u20097.22; P\u2009=\u2009.03 for overall interaction). In APOE \u03b54-positive players, poorer verbal memory associated with high vs low heading exposure was 4.1-fold greater (APOE \u03b54 negative, \u03b2\u2009=\u2009-0.36; 95% CI, -0.75 to 0.03; APOE \u03b54 positive, \u03b2\u2009=\u2009-1.49; 95% CI, -2.05 to -0.93), and poorer verbal memory associated with high vs moderate heading exposure was 8.5-fold greater (APOE \u03b54 negative, \u03b2\u2009=\u2009-0.13; 95% CI, -0.54 to 0.29; APOE \u03b54 positive, \u03b2\u2009=\u2009-1.11, 95% CI, -1.70 to -0.53) compared with that in APOE \u03b54-negative players. Conclusions and Relevance: This study suggests that the APOE \u03b54 allele is a risk factor for worse memory performance associated with higher heading exposure in the prior year, which highlights that assessing genetic risks may ultimately play a role in promoting safer soccer play.

        "Race, ethnicity, and cognition in persons newly diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether black or Hispanic patients with newly diagnosed multiple sclerosis (MS) are more likely to have cognitive impairment than white patients when compared to controls matched on age, sex, and race/ethnicity. Whether black or Hispanic patients have a more aggressive MS disease course than white patients remains unclear. No prior studies have examined differences in early cognitive impairment. The oral Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT) is sensitive to early cognitive impairment in MS but normative data in nonwhite patients are limited. METHODS: We studied 1,174 adults who enrolled in the MS Sunshine Study. SDMT and verbal fluency were measured in 554 incident cases of MS or clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) and 620 matched controls. Multivariable regression was used to examine correlates of abnormal SDMT in the entire cohort. RESULTS: The strongest independent predictors of lower oral SDMT scores in rank order were having MS/CIS, lower educational attainment, and being black or Hispanic. Black and Hispanic patients and controls had lower SDMT scores than white participants even after controlling for age, sex, and education. However, no interaction between race/ethnicity and MS case status on SDMT scores was detected. Easy-to-use reference scores stratified by age and educational attainment for black and Hispanic patients are provided. CONCLUSION: Persons with newly diagnosed MS/CIS are more likely to have subtly impaired cognitive function than controls regardless of race/ethnicity. Lower absolute SDMT scores among black and Hispanic patients compared to white patients highlight underlying US population differences rather than differences in MS disease severity. ",

        "Comparison of Integrated Outpatient Palliative Care With Standard Care in Patients With Parkinson Disease and Related Disorders: A Randomized Clinical Trial. Importance: Parkinson disease and related disorders (PDRD) have consequences for quality of life (QoL) and are the 14th leading cause of death in the United States. Despite growing interest in palliative care (PC) for persons with PDRD, few studies are available supporting its effectiveness. Objective: To determine if outpatient PC is associated with improvements in patient-centered outcomes compared with standard care among patients with PDRD and their caregivers. Design, Setting, and Participants: This randomized clinical trial enrolled participants at 3 academic tertiary care centers between November 1, 2015, and September 30, 2017, and followed them up for 1 year. A total of 584 persons with PDRD were referred to the study. Of those, 351 persons were excluded by phone and 23 were excluded during in-person screenings. Patients were eligible to participate if they had PDRD and moderate to high PC needs. Patients were excluded if they had urgent PC needs, another diagnosis meriting PC, were already receiving PC, or were unable or unwilling to follow the study protocol. Enrolled participants were assigned to receive standard care plus outpatient integrated PC or standard care alone. Data were analyzed between November 1, 2018, and December 9, 2019. Interventions: Outpatient integrated PC administered by a neurologist, social worker, chaplain, and nurse using PC checklists, with guidance and selective involvement from a palliative medicine specialist. Standard care was provided by a neurologist and a primary care practitioner. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcomes were the differences in patient quality of life (QoL; measured by the Quality of Life in Alzheimer Disease scale) and caregiver burden (measured by the Zarit Burden Interview) between the PC intervention and standard care groups at 6 months. Results: A total of 210 patients with PDRD (135 men [64.3%]; mean [SD] age, 70.1\u2009[8.2] years) and 175 caregivers (128 women [73.1%]; mean [SD] age, 66.1 [11.1] years) were enrolled in the study; 193 participants (91.9%) were white and non-Hispanic. Compared with participants receiving standard care alone at 6 months, participants receiving the PC intervention had better QoL (mean [SD], 0.66\u2009[5.5] improvement vs 0.84\u2009[4.2] worsening; treatment effect estimate, 1.87; 95% CI, 0.47-3.27; P\u2009=\u2009.009). No significant difference was observed in caregiver burden (mean [SD], 2.3\u2009[5.0] improvement vs 1.2\u2009[5.6] improvement in the standard care group; treatment effect estimate, -1.62; 95% CI, -3.32 to 0.09; P\u2009=\u2009.06). Other significant differences favoring the PC intervention included nonmotor symptom burden, motor symptom severity, completion of advance directives, caregiver anxiety, and caregiver burden at 12 months. No outcomes favored standard care alone. Secondary analyses suggested that benefits were greater for persons with higher PC needs. Conclusions and Relevance: Outpatient PC is associated with benefits among patients with PDRD compared with standard care alone. This study supports efforts to integrate PC into PDRD care. The lack of diversity and implementation of PC at experienced centers suggests a need for implementation research in other populations and care settings.

        "Elagolix for Heavy Menstrual Bleeding in Women with Uterine Fibroids. BACKGROUND: Uterine fibroids are hormone-responsive neoplasms that are associated with heavy menstrual bleeding. Elagolix, an oral gonadotropin-releasing hormone antagonist resulting in rapid, reversible suppression of ovarian sex hormones, may reduce fibroid-associated bleeding. METHODS: We conducted two identical, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, 6-month phase 3 trials (Elaris Uterine Fibroids 1 and 2 [UF-1 and UF-2]) to evaluate the efficacy and safety of elagolix at a dose of 300 mg twice daily with hormonal \"add-back\" therapy (to replace reduced levels of endogenous hormones; in this case, estradiol, 1 mg, and norethindrone acetate, 0.5 mg, once daily) in women with fibroid-associated bleeding. An elagolix-alone group was included to assess the impact of add-back therapy on the hypoestrogenic effects of elagolix. The primary end point was menstrual blood loss of less than 80 ml during the final month of treatment and at least a 50% reduction in menstrual blood loss from baseline to the final month; missing data were imputed with the use of multiple imputation. RESULTS: A total of 412 women in UF-1 and 378 women in UF-2 underwent randomization, received elagolix or placebo, and were included in the analyses. Criteria for the primary end point were met in 68.5% of 206 women in UF-1 and in 76.5% of 189 women in UF-2 who received elagolix plus add-back therapy, as compared with 8.7% of 102 women and 10% of 94 women, respectively, who received placebo (P<0.001 for both trials). Among the women who received elagolix alone, the primary end point was met in 84.1% of 104 women in UF-1 and in 77% of 95 women in UF-2. Hot flushes (in both trials) and metrorrhagia (in UF-1) occurred significantly more commonly with elagolix plus add-back therapy than with placebo. Hypoestrogenic effects of elagolix, especially decreases in bone mineral density, were attenuated with add-back therapy.

        "Long-term Device Outcomes of Mesh Implants in Pelvic Organ Prolapse Repairs. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the longer-term safety and reintervention outcomes of mesh implants in pelvic organ prolapse (POP) repairs. METHODS: We conducted a population-based cohort study of women undergoing POP repairs in inpatient and outpatient surgical settings between 2008 and 2016 in New York State. Multivariable logistic regression was used based on patient and procedural characteristics and hospital volume between mesh and nonmesh groups to obtain propensity scores for each individual. Long-term safety events and reinterventions were assessed using time-to-event analysis. RESULTS: We identified 54,194 women undergoing POP repairs (12,989 with mesh, and 41,205 without mesh). Mean age was 59.8 (\u00b113.1) years, and median follow-up was 4.7 years (interquartile range, 2.4-6.8 years). In the propensity score-matched 12,284 pairs of women, POP repair with mesh was associated with a higher risk of reintervention when compared with POP repair without transvaginal mesh (hazard ratio 1.40, 95% CI 1.27-1.54, P<.001). The estimated risk of undergoing a reintervention at 5 years was 8.8% (95% CI 8.2-9.3%) in the mesh group and 6.3% (5.9-6.8%) in the nonmesh group. Among patients who had reinterventions, 18.5% of those operated with mesh had a reintervention related to mesh-related complications. CONCLUSION: Even though transvaginal mesh has been removed from the market, the risk of mesh complications did not diminish over time and these women warrant close follow-up. Continued surveillance of mesh in POP repairs is essential to ensure safety for the women who have already been implanted. ",
        "Heart fat and carotid artery atherosclerosis progression in recently menopausal women: impact of menopausal hormone therapy: The KEEPS trial. OBJECTIVE: Heart fat deposition has been linked to atherosclerosis, and both accelerate after menopause. Hormone therapy (HT) may differentially slow heart fat deposition and progression of atherosclerosis, depending on the specific HT agent or its route of administration. Our objective was to evaluate the effects of different HT agents, oral and transdermal, on associations between heart fat accumulation and atherosclerosis progression, measured by carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT), in recently menopausal women from the Kronos Early Estrogen Prevention Study (KEEPS) trial. METHODS: KEEPS was a randomized, placebo-controlled trial of the effects of 0.45\u200amg/d oral conjugated equine estrogens (o-CEE) or 50\u200amcg/d transdermal 17\u03b2-estradiol (t-E2), compared with placebo, on 48 months progression of CIMT. Epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) and paracardial adipose tissue (PAT) volumes were quantified by computed tomography. RESULTS: In all, 467 women (mean age [SD] 52.7 [2.5]; 78.2% White; 30% on o-CEE, 30.8% t-E2, 39.2% placebo) with heart fat volumes and CIMT at baseline and 48 months were included. EAT and PAT changes were not associated with CIMT progression; however, the assigned treatment significantly modified the association between PAT (but not EAT) change and CIMT progression. In the o-CEE group, adjusted CIMT progression was 12.66\u200a\u03bcm (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.80, 23.52) lower than in t-E2 group (P\u200a=\u200a0.02), and 10.09\u200a\u03bcm (95% CI 0.79, 19.39) lower than in placebo group (P\u200a=\u200a0.03), as per 1-SD increase in PAT. CONCLUSION: Compared with t-E2, o-CEE appears to slow down the adverse effect of increasing PAT on progression of atherosclerosis. Whether this beneficial association is specific to CEE or to the oral route of CEE administration is unclear and should be assessed further. ",
        "Associations between macrolide antibiotics prescribing during pregnancy and adverse child outcomes in the UK: population based cohort study. OBJECTIVE: To assess the association between macrolide antibiotics prescribing during pregnancy and major malformations, cerebral palsy, epilepsy, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and autism spectrum disorder in children. DESIGN: Population based cohort study. SETTING: The UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink. PARTICIPANTS: The study cohort included 104\u2009605 children born from 1990 to 2016 whose mothers were prescribed one macrolide monotherapy (erythromycin, clarithromycin, or azithromycin) or one penicillin monotherapy from the fourth gestational week to delivery. Two negative control cohorts consisted of 82\u2009314 children whose mothers were prescribed macrolides or penicillins before conception, and 53\u2009735 children who were siblings of the children in the study cohort. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Risks of any major malformations and system specific major malformations (nervous, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, genital, and urinary) after macrolide or penicillin prescribing during the first trimester (four to 13 gestational weeks), second to third trimester (14 gestational weeks to birth), or any trimester of pregnancy. Additionally, risks of cerebral palsy, epilepsy, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and autism spectrum disorder. RESULTS: Major malformations were recorded in 186 of 8632 children (21.55 per 1000) whose mothers were prescribed macrolides and 1666 of 95\u2009973 children (17.36 per 1000) whose mothers were prescribed penicillins during pregnancy. Macrolide prescribing during the first trimester was associated with an increased risk of any major malformation compared with penicillin (27.65 v 17.65 per 1000, adjusted risk ratio 1.55, 95% confidence interval 1.19 to 2.03) and specifically cardiovascular malformations (10.60 v 6.61 per 1000, 1.62, 1.05 to 2.51). Macrolide prescribing in any trimester was associated with an increased risk of genital malformations (4.75 v 3.07 per 1000, 1.58, 1.14 to 2.19, mainly hypospadias). Erythromycin in the first trimester was associated with an increased risk of any major malformation (27.39 v 17.65 per 1000, 1.50, 1.13 to 1.99). No statistically significant associations were found for other system specific malformations or for neurodevelopmental disorders. Findings were robust to sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSIONS: Prescribing macrolide antibiotics during the first trimester of pregnancy was associated with an increased risk of any major malformation and specifically cardiovascular malformations compared with penicillin antibiotics. Macrolide prescribing in any trimester was associated with an increased risk of genital malformations. These findings show that macrolides should be used with caution during pregnancy and if feasible alternative antibiotics should be prescribed until further research is available.

        "Clinical Influence of Nonadherence With Prophylactic Aspirin in Preventing Preeclampsia in High-Risk Pregnancies: A Multicenter, Prospective, Observational Cohort Study. Aspirin nonadherence and its associated increase in cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events is well described; however, the prevalence of aspirin nonadherence among high-risk pregnant women at risk of preeclampsia and its influence on clinical outcomes remains unclear. Our study examined the prevalence of aspirin nonadherence and resistance among high-risk pregnant women quantitatively (platelet function analyzer 100 and plasma salicylic acid) and clinical outcomes relative to adherence. High-risk pregnant women were recruited across 3 centers in the South West Sydney Local Health District. Simultaneous clinic data, blood sample, and self-reported adherence assessment were prospectively collected at 4-week intervals from 12 to 36 weeks of gestation. Nonadherence was defined as normal platelet function analyzer 100 and nondetectable plasma salicylic acid in <90% of time points. Value of <90% is based on current data. Two hundred twenty women were recruited over 25 months. No woman was aspirin resistant, and 63 (44%) women demonstrated inadequate adherence. Women with inadequate adherence had higher incidence of early-onset preeclampsia (17% versus 2%; odds ratio [OR], 1.9 [95% CI, 1.1-8.7]; P=0.04), late-onset preeclampsia (41% versus 5%; OR, 4.2 [95% CI, 1.4-19.8]; P=0.04), intrauterine growth restriction (29% versus 5%; OR, 5.8; [95% CI, 1.2-8.3]; P=0.001), preterm delivery (27% versus 10%; OR, 5.2 [95% CI, 1.5-8.7]; P=0.008), and higher likelihood of increase in antihypertensives antenatally (60% versus 10%; OR, 4.6 [95% CI, 1.2-10.5]; P=0.003). Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated lower incidence of premature delivery in the \u226590% adherent group (HR, 0.3 [95% CI, 0.2-0.5]; P<0.001).Kappa coefficient agreement between qualitative and quantitative assessment of adherence was moderate (\u03ba=0.48; SE=0.029; P<0.0001). Our data demonstrates that aspirin is an effective prophylactic agent with an absolute risk reduction of 51% (number needed to treat, 2) when adherence is \u226590%, compared with women with inadequate adherence. Women who were <90% adherent had higher rates of preeclampsia, intrauterine growth restriction, preterm delivery, and increase in antenatal antihypertensive requirements. Self-reported adherence does not accurately reflect actual adherence. ",
        "Lifestyle Changes in Relation to Initiation of Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Medication: A Cohort Study. Background Lifestyle modification is a key component of cardiovascular disease prevention before and concurrently with pharmacologic interventions. We evaluated whether lifestyle factors change in relation to the initiation of antihypertensive or lipid-lowering medication (statins). Methods and Results The study population comprised 41\u00a0225 participants of the FPS (Finnish Public Sector) study aged \u226540\u00a0years who were free of cardiovascular disease at baseline and responded to \u22652 consecutive surveys administered in 4-year intervals in 2000-2013. Medication use was ascertained through pharmacy-claims data. Using a series of pre-post data sets, we compared changes in body mass index, physical activity, alcohol consumption, and smoking between 8837 initiators and 46\u00a0021 noninitiators of antihypertensive medications or statins. In participants who initiated medication use, body mass index increased more (difference in change 0.19; 95% CI, 0.16-0.22) and physical activity declined (-0.09 metabolic equivalent of task hour/day; 95% CI, -0.16 to -0.02) compared with noninitiators. The likelihood of becoming obese (odds ratio: 1.82; 95% CI, 1.63-2.03) and physically inactive (odds ratio: 1.08; 95% CI, 1.01-1.17) was higher in initiators. However, medication initiation was associated with greater decline in average alcohol consumption (-1.85\u00a0g/week; 95% CI, -3.67 to -0.14) and higher odds of quitting smoking (odds ratio for current smoking in the second survey: 0.74; 95% CI, 0.64-0.85). Conclusions These findings suggest that initiation of antihypertensive and statin medication is associated with lifestyle changes, some favorable and others unfavorable. Weight management and physical activity should be encouraged in individuals prescribed these medications. ",
        "Conservative versus Interventional Treatment for Spontaneous Pneumothorax. BACKGROUND: Whether conservative management is an acceptable alternative to interventional management for uncomplicated, moderate-to-large primary spontaneous pneumothorax is unknown. METHODS: In this open-label, multicenter, noninferiority trial, we recruited patients 14 to 50 years of age with a first-known, unilateral, moderate-to-large primary spontaneous pneumothorax. Patients were randomly assigned to immediate interventional management of the pneumothorax (intervention group) or a conservative observational approach (conservative-management group) and were followed for 12 months. The primary outcome was lung reexpansion within 8 weeks. RESULTS: A total of 316 patients underwent randomization (154 patients to the intervention group and 162 to the conservative-management group). In the conservative-management group, 25 patients (15.4%) underwent interventions to manage the pneumothorax, for reasons prespecified in the protocol, and 137 (84.6%) did not undergo interventions. In a complete-case analysis in which data were not available for 23 patients in the intervention group and 37 in the conservative-management group, reexpansion within 8 weeks occurred in 129 of 131 patients (98.5%) with interventional management and in 118 of 125 (94.4%) with conservative management (risk difference, -4.1 percentage points; 95% confidence interval [CI], -8.6 to 0.5; P\u2009=\u20090.02 for noninferiority); the lower boundary of the 95% confidence interval was within the prespecified noninferiority margin of -9 percentage points. In a sensitivity analysis in which all missing data after 56 days were imputed as treatment failure (with reexpansion in 129 of 138 patients [93.5%] in the intervention group and in 118 of 143 [82.5%] in the conservative-management group), the risk difference of -11.0 percentage points (95% CI, -18.4 to -3.5) was outside the prespecified noninferiority margin. Conservative management resulted in a lower risk of serious adverse events or pneumothorax recurrence than interventional management. CONCLUSIONS: Although the primary outcome was not statistically robust to conservative assumptions about missing data, the trial provides modest evidence that conservative management of primary spontaneous pneumothorax was noninferior to interventional management, with a lower risk of serious adverse events.

        "Association of Gestational Age at Birth With Risk of Perinatal Mortality and Special Educational Need Among Twins. Importance: Twin pregnancies account for 3% of live births but experience substantially more perinatal morbidity and mortality than singleton pregnancies. Optimizing the timing of birth is a key strategy in improving twin pregnancy outcomes. Current UK and US policies are based on observational studies of perinatal mortality and not on longer-term effects. The association of timing of birth with long-term childhood outcomes among twins is uncertain. Objective: To identify the optimal gestation week for birth of twin infants by calculating the week of birth associated with the lowest risk of short-term and long-term adverse outcomes (perinatal mortality and special educational need [SEN] at school). Design, Setting, and Participants: This population-based, data-linkage cohort study included 43 133 twin infants born at a gestational age of 34 weeks onward between January 1, 1980, and December 31, 2015, in Scotland. The data were analyzed from June 1, 2017, to March 1, 2019. Exposures: Gestational age (in weeks) at the time of birth. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcomes were extended perinatal mortality and a record of SEN (\u22651 of intellectual disabilities, dyslexia, physical or motor impairment, language or speech disorder, autistic spectrum disorder, and social, emotional, or behavioral difficulties) at school (children aged 4-18 years). To infer the consequence of the gestational age at birth, clinical outcomes of twin infants born at each week of gestation from 34 weeks onward were compared with those of twin infants remaining in utero thereafter. Results: Of the total 43 133 twin infants included in the study, 21 696 (50.3%) were females. Although maternity records were available for all infants, 9519 sex-discordant twin children were linked to their educational data, of whom 1069 (13.8%) had a record of SEN. Compared with twins remaining in utero (n\u2009=\u200926\u202f172), birth at any gestational age from 34 to 37 weeks was associated with increased odds of perinatal death (ie, adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 1.99; 95% CI, 1.53-2.69 at 36 weeks [n\u2009=\u20098056]) and increased risk of SEN at school (AOR, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.11-1.74, for birth at 36 weeks compared with 37 weeks). In a competing risk analysis, the risks of stillbirth and neonatal death were balanced at 37 weeks (risk difference, 2.05; 95% CI, 0.8-3.3). Conclusions and Relevance: The findings of this study suggest that, in the absence of a medical complication, twins should not be routinely delivered before 37 completed weeks of gestation. These findings may help optimize shared decision-making around the timing of twin birth. ",
        "Glaucoma Care of Prison Inmates at an Academic Hospital. Importance: Glaucoma care for prison inmates is underrepresented in the literature even though managing the treatment of such patients may provide unique challenges. Objectives: To evaluate the glaucoma profile of prison inmates treated at an academic ophthalmology center and to report on the medical and surgical management and follow-up metrics. Design, Setting, and Participants: This retrospective cohort study assessed data from 82 incarcerated patients treated at the glaucoma clinic, an academic referral center at the University of Illinois at Chicago, between January 2013 and December 2017. Main Outcomes and Measures: Diagnosis, glaucoma severity, medical and surgical interventions, and patient-reported medication adherence were recorded for each visit. Recommended and actual follow-up times were recorded and compared. Data analyses were conducted from January 2013 to December 2018. Results: In total, 82 patients (161 eyes) had 375 visits during the study period. All patients were male and ranged from 20 to 75 years of age (mean [SD] age, 50.8 [11.9] years). Most participants were black patients (65 [79.3%]). The most common diagnoses were primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG; 53 eyes [32.9%]) and POAG suspect (52 eyes [32.3%]). Glaucoma severity ranged from mild (25 of 77 eyes [32.5%]) to advanced (41 of 77 eyes [53.2%]). Overall, 59 patients (73.2%) were treated medically with up to 4 topical agents (40.0%). Of those treated, 70.0% of patients (95% CI, 57.7%-81.2%) reported medication nonadherence during at least 1 visit. Medication nonadherence was more common among those taking 4 different topical medications (21 of 24 [87.5%]) compared with others taking fewer medications (20 of 35 [57.1%]), for a difference of 30.4% (95% CI, 7.0%-53.6%; P\u2009=\u2009.02), and among those with advanced disease (22 of 26 [84.6%]) compared with glaucoma suspect (6 of 13 [46.2%]), for a difference of 38.4% (95% CI, 9.3%-67.5%; P\u2009=\u2009.02). Nineteen office procedures, including laser peripheral iridotomy and laser trabeculoplasty, were performed on 14 eyes. Seventeen incisional glaucoma procedures were performed on 15 eyes, including glaucoma drainage device implant (11 procedures [64.7%]) and trabeculectomy (3 procedures [17.6%]). Only 26.6% of return office visits (95% CI, 21.3%-32.3%) occurred within the recommended follow-up time frame. Furthermore, 93 patients (34.8%; 95% CI, 28.2%-40.0%) were seen more than 1 month after the recommended follow-up. Conclusions and Relevance: Despite incarceration in prison, where medication administration and appointment attendance are theoretically controlled, the results of this study suggested that substantial medication and follow-up nonadherence exists among inmates.

        "Familial Coaggregation of Asthma and Type 1 Diabetes in Children. Importance: The association between atopic and autoimmune disease, particularly asthma and type 1 diabetes, has been debated. Further understanding of the underlying factors associated with the comorbidity in children is warranted. Objectives: To assess the bidirectional association between asthma and type 1 diabetes and examine the possibility of a shared risk for the diseases by studying their pattern of familial coaggregation. Design, Setting, and Participants: A birth cohort study of children born from January 1, 2001, and followed up until December 31, 2015, was performed. Population data were obtained from multiple national Swedish registers. A total of 1 347 901 singleton children, live-born in Sweden between January 1, 2001, and December 31, 2013, were identified, and children with incomplete data were excluded. The remaining 1 284 748 children were linked to their biological full siblings, maternal and paternal half-siblings, cousins, and half-cousins. Data analysis was conducted from April 1, 2019, to January 17, 2020. Main Outcomes and Measures: Cases of asthma and type 1 diabetes were defined using a combination of diagnoses and medication prescriptions found in the registers. Results: In the cohort of 1 284 748 children, 660 738 children (51.4%) were boys; 121 809 children (9.5%) had asthma, 3812 children (0.3%) had type 1 diabetes, and 494 children had both asthma and type 1 diabetes, representing 0.4% of all asthma or 13% of all type 1 diabetes. Mean (SD) age at diagnosis was 3.0 (2.8) years for children with asthma, and 5.9 (3.3) years for those with type 1 diabetes. Asthma and type 1 diabetes were associated within individuals (odds ratio, 1.15; 95% CI, 1.05-1.27). Children with asthma had an increased risk of subsequent type 1 diabetes (hazard ratio, 1.16; 95% CI, 1.06-1.27); however, subsequent asthma risk did not differ substantially among children with type 1 diabetes (hazard ratio, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.75-1.12). Siblings of individuals with asthma were at an increased risk of type 1 diabetes (odds ratio, 1.27; 95% CI, 1.13-1.42) and vice versa. The results remained positive after controlling for the direct association of one disease with the other. Conclusions and Relevance: This study appears to provide evidence for co-occurrence, importance of sequential appearance, and coaggregation of asthma and type 1 diabetes in children and their siblings. The findings may suggest shared familial factors contributing to the associations. Knowledge of the nature of the association could be of importance in future clinical practice. ",
        "Lower versus Traditional Treatment Threshold for Neonatal Hypoglycemia. BACKGROUND: Worldwide, many newborns who are preterm, small or large for gestational age, or born to mothers with diabetes are screened for hypoglycemia, with a goal of preventing brain injury. However, there is no consensus on a treatment threshold that is safe but also avoids overtreatment. METHODS: In a multicenter, randomized, noninferiority trial involving 689 otherwise healthy newborns born at 35 weeks of gestation or later and identified as being at risk for hypoglycemia, we compared two threshold values for treatment of asymptomatic moderate hypoglycemia. We sought to determine whether a management strategy that used a lower threshold (treatment administered at a glucose concentration of <36 mg per deciliter [2.0 mmol per liter]) would be noninferior to a traditional threshold (treatment at a glucose concentration of <47 mg per deciliter [2.6 mmol per liter]) with respect to psychomotor development at 18 months, assessed with the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development, third edition, Dutch version (Bayley-III-NL; scores range from 50 to 150 [mean {\u00b1SD}, 100\u00b115]), with higher scores indicating more advanced development and 7.5 points (one half the SD) representing a clinically important difference). The lower threshold would be considered noninferior if scores were less than 7.5 points lower than scores in the traditional-threshold group. RESULTS: Bayley-III-NL scores were assessed in 287 of the 348 children (82.5%) in the lower-threshold group and in 295 of the 341 children (86.5%) in the traditional-threshold group. Cognitive and motor outcome scores were similar in the two groups (mean scores [\u00b1SE], 102.9\u00b10.7 [cognitive] and 104.6\u00b10.7 [motor] in the lower-threshold group and 102.2\u00b10.7 [cognitive] and 104.9\u00b10.7 [motor] in the traditional-threshold group). The prespecified inferiority limit was not crossed. The mean glucose concentration was 57\u00b10.4 mg per deciliter (3.2\u00b10.02 mmol per liter) in the lower-threshold group and 61\u00b10.5 mg per deciliter (3.4\u00b10.03 mmol per liter) in the traditional-threshold group. Fewer and less severe hypoglycemic episodes occurred in the traditional-threshold group, but that group had more invasive diagnostic and treatment interventions. Serious adverse events in the lower-threshold group included convulsions (during normoglycemia) in one newborn and one death. CONCLUSIONS: In otherwise healthy newborns with asymptomatic moderate hypoglycemia, a lower glucose treatment threshold (36 mg per deciliter) was noninferior to a traditional threshold (47 mg per deciliter) with regard to psychomotor development at 18 months.

        "Transgender Youth's Disclosure of Gender Identity to Providers Outside of Specialized Gender Centers. PURPOSE: Transgender youth face significant health disparities and multiple barriers to receiving quality health care. Gender identity disclosure to health care providers (HCPs) is an important step in creating affirming relationships for transgender youth. The objectives of this study were to (1)\u00a0determine the prevalence of voluntary disclosure and intentional avoidance to HCPs outside of gender clinics, (2) identify factors associated with voluntary disclosure and intentional avoidance, and (3) elucidate strategies to increase comfort with disclosure. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was administered to transgender youth aged 12-26\u00a0years. Bivariate analyses were conducted using \u03c72 or Fisher's exact tests. Two logistic regression models for each outcome variable were used to examine factors associated with voluntary disclosure and intentional avoidance. RESULTS: Two thirds (65%) of youth (N\u00a0= 153) identified as transmasculine, and 57% were under 18\u00a0years. Three-quarters (78%) had voluntarily disclosed their gender identity to an HCP outside of gender clinic, whereas 46% had intentionally avoided disclosure. Odds ratios (ORs) of ever having disclosed were lower for participants \u226518 years (OR\u00a0= .33; 95% confidence interval [CI]: .11-.98), those out to fewer people (OR\u00a0= .12; 95% CI: .02-.81) and out for <1\u00a0year (OR\u00a0= .03; 95% CI: .004-.31). Odds of intentional avoidance were lower among youth with higher perceived parental support (OR\u00a0= .83; 95% CI: .70-.98). CONCLUSION: A majority of transgender youth reported having voluntarily disclosed their gender identity to an HCP outside of gender clinic, but almost half reported having intentionally avoided disclosure when they felt it was important. Parental support may play a protective role in mitigating avoidance. ",
        "Adherence to Timely Vaccinations in the United States. OBJECTIVES: To estimate (1) the proportion of children not adhering to the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommended early childhood immunization schedule and (2) associations between schedule adherence, sociodemographic characteristics, and up-to-date immunization status by 19 to 35 months of age. METHODS: We used 2014 National Immunization Survey provider-verified vaccination data to classify vaccination patterns as \"recommended\" (ie, in line with ACIP dose- and age-specific recommendations), \"alternate\" (ie, in line with either limiting the number of shots per visit or skipping at least 1 vaccine series), or \"unknown or unclassifiable\" (ie, not in line with ACIP recommendations or clearly limiting shots per visit or vaccine series). We evaluated the association between vaccination patterns and up-to-date status for all ACIP-recommended vaccinations (including rotavirus and hepatitis A vaccines) using Poisson regression. RESULTS: The majority of children's patterns were classified as \"recommended\" (63%), with 23% and 14% following alternate or unknown or unclassifiable patterns, respectively; 58% of children were up-to-date with all ACIP-recommended immunizations by 19 to 35 months. Not being up-to-date was associated with alternate (prevalence ratio = 4.2, 95% confidence interval: 3.9-4.5) and unknown or unclassifiable (prevalence ratio = 2.4, 95% confidence interval: 2.2-2.7) patterns. CONCLUSIONS: High vaccine coverage by 19 to 35 months of age may miss nonadherence to the recommended immunization schedule in the first 18 months of life, leaving children vulnerable to preventable diseases. With more than one-third of US children not following the ACIP schedule, targeted interventions are needed to minimize vaccine delays and disease susceptibility. ",
        "SGLT2 Inhibitor-Induced Sympathoinhibition: A Novel Mechanism for Cardiorenal Protection. Recent clinical trial data suggest a cardiorenal protective effect of sodium glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibition. We demonstrate that chemical denervation in neurogenic hypertensive Schlager (BPH/2J) mice reduced blood pressure, improved glucose homeostasis, and reduced renal SGLT2 protein expression. Inhibition of SGLT2 prevented weight gain, reduced blood pressure, significantly reduced elevations of tyrosine hydroxylase and norepinephrine, and protects against endothelial dysfunction. These findings provide evidence for significant crosstalk between activation of the sympathetic nervous system and SGLT2 regulation and possible ancillary effects on endothelial function, which may contribute to the observed cardiorenal protective effects of SGLT2 inhibition.

        "Out-of-Network Bills for Privately Insured Patients Undergoing Elective Surgery With In-Network Primary Surgeons and Facilities. Importance: Privately insured patients who receive care from in-network physicians may receive unexpected out-of-network bills (\"surprise bills\") from out-of-network clinicians they did not choose. In elective surgery, this can occur if patients choose in-network surgeons and hospitals but receive out-of-network bills from other involved clinicians. Objective: To evaluate out-of-network billing across common elective operations performed with in-network primary surgeons and facilities. Design, Setting, and Participants: Retrospective analysis of claims data from a large US commercial insurer, representing 347\u202f356 patients who had undergone 1 of 7 common elective operations (arthroscopic meniscal repair [116\u202f749]; laparoscopic cholecystectomy [82\u202f372]; hysterectomy [67\u202f452]; total knee replacement [42\u202f313]; breast lumpectomy [18\u202f018]; colectomy [14\u202f074]; coronary artery bypass graft surgery [6378]) by an in-network primary surgeon at an in-network facility between January 1, 2012, and September 30, 2017. Follow-up ended November 8, 2017. Exposure: Patient, clinician, and insurance factors potentially related to out-of-network bills. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was the proportion of episodes with out-of-network bills. The secondary outcome was the estimated potential balance bill associated with out-of-network bills from each surgical procedure, calculated as total out-of-network charges less the typical in-network price for the same service. Results: Among 347\u202f356 patients (mean age, 48 [SD, 11] years; 66% women) who underwent surgery with in-network primary surgeons and facilities, 20.5% of episodes (95% CI, 19.4%-21.7%) had an out-of-network bill. In these episodes, the mean potential balance bill per episode was $2011 (95% CI, $1866-$2157) when present. Out-of-network bills were associated with surgical assistants in 37% of these episodes; when present, the mean potential balance bill was $3633 (95% CI, $3384-$3883). Out-of-network bills were associated with anesthesiologists in 37% of episodes; when present, the mean potential balance bill was $1219 (95% CI, $1049-$1388). Membership in health insurance exchange plans, compared with nonexchange plans, was associated with a significantly higher risk of out-of-network bills (27% vs 20%, respectively; risk difference, 6% [95% CI, 3.9%-8.9%]; P\u2009<\u2009.001). Surgical complications were associated with a significantly higher risk of out-of-network bills, compared with episodes with no complications (28% vs 20%, respectively; risk difference, 7% [95% CI, 5.8%-8.8%]; P\u2009<\u2009.001). Among 83\u202f021 procedures performed at ambulatory surgery centers with in-network primary surgeons, 6.7% (95% CI, 5.8%-7.7%) included an out-of-network facility bill and 17.2% (95% CI, 15.7%-18.8%) included an out-of-network professional bill. Conclusions and Relevance: In this retrospective analysis of commercially insured patients who had undergone elective surgery at in-network facilities with in-network primary surgeons, a substantial proportion of operations were associated with out-of-network bills.

        "Prevalence of Diabetes Medication Intensifications in Older Adults Discharged From US Veterans Health Administration Hospitals. Importance: Elevated blood glucose levels are common in hospitalized older adults and may lead clinicians to intensify outpatient diabetes medications at discharge, risking potential overtreatment when patients return home. Objective: To assess how often hospitalized older adults are discharged with intensified diabetes medications and the likelihood of benefit associated with these intensifications. Design, Setting, and Participants: This retrospective cohort study examined patients aged 65 years and older with diabetes not previously requiring insulin. The study included patients who were hospitalized in a Veterans Health Administration hospital for common medical conditions between 2012 and 2013. Main Outcomes and Measures: Intensification of outpatient diabetes medications, defined as receiving a new or higher-dose medication at discharge than was being taken prior to hospitalization. Mixed-effect logistic regression models were used to control for patient and hospitalization characteristics. Results: Of 16\u202f178 patients (mean [SD] age, 73 [8] years; 15\u202f895 [98%] men), 8535 (53%) had a preadmission hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) level less than 7.0%, and 1044 (6%) had an HbA1c level greater than 9.0%. Overall, 1626 patients (10%) were discharged with intensified diabetes medications including 781 (5%) with new insulins and 557 (3%) with intensified sulfonylureas. Nearly half of patients receiving intensifications (49% [791 of 1626]) were classified as being unlikely to benefit owing to limited life expectancy or already being at goal HbA1c, while 20% (329 of 1626) were classified as having potential to benefit. Both preadmission HbA1c level and inpatient blood glucose recordings were associated with discharge with intensified diabetes medications. Among patients with a preadmission HbA1c level less than 7.0%, the predicted probability of receiving an intensification was 4% (95% CI, 3%-4%) for patients without elevated inpatient blood glucose levels and 21% (95% CI, 15%-26%) for patients with severely elevated inpatient blood glucose levels. Conclusions and Relevance: In this study, 1 in 10 older adults with diabetes hospitalized for common medical conditions was discharged with intensified diabetes medications. Nearly half of these individuals were unlikely to benefit owing to limited life expectancy or already being at their HbA1c goal. ",
        "Association of Low-Carbohydrate and Low-Fat Diets With Mortality Among US Adults. Importance: It is crucial to incorporate quality and types of carbohydrate and fat when investigating the associations of low-fat and low-carbohydrate diets with mortality. Objective: To investigate the associations of low-carbohydrate and low-fat diets with total and cause-specific mortality among US adults. Design, Setting, and Participants: This prospective cohort study used data from the US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey from 1999 to 2014 from 37 233 adults 20 years or older with 24-hour dietary recall data. Data were analyzed from July 5 to August 27, 2019. Exposures: Overall, unhealthy, and healthy low-carbohydrate-diet and low-fat-diet scores based on the percentage of energy as total and subtypes of carbohydrate, fat, and protein. Main Outcomes and Measures: All-cause mortality from baseline until December 31, 2015, linked to National Death Index mortality data. Results: A total of 37 233 US adults (mean [SD] age, 49.7 [18.3] years; 19 598 [52.6%] female) were included in the present analysis. During 297 768 person-years of follow-up, 4866 total deaths occurred. Overall low-carbohydrate-diet and low-fat-diet scores were not associated with total mortality. The multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios for total mortality per 20-percentile increase in dietary scores were 1.07 (95% CI, 1.02-1.11; P\u2009=\u2009.01 for trend) for unhealthy low-carbohydrate-diet score, 0.91 (95% CI, 0.87-0.95; P\u2009<\u2009.001 for trend) for healthy low-carbohydrate-diet score, 1.06 (95% CI, 1.01-1.12; P\u2009=\u2009.04 for trend) for unhealthy low-fat-diet score, and 0.89 (95% CI, 0.85-0.93; P\u2009<\u2009.001 for trend) for healthy low-fat-diet score. The associations remained similar in the stratification and sensitivity analyses. Conclusions and Relevance: In this study, overall low-carbohydrate-diet and low-fat-diet scores were not associated with total mortality. Unhealthy low-carbohydrate-diet and low-fat-diet scores were associated with higher total mortality, whereas healthy low-carbohydrate-diet and low-fat-diet scores were associated with lower total mortality. These findings suggest that the associations of low-carbohydrate and low-fat diets with mortality may depend on the quality and food sources of macronutrients. ",
        "Clinical Characteristics of Coronavirus Disease 2019 in China. BACKGROUND: Since December 2019, when coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) emerged in Wuhan city and rapidly spread throughout China, data have been needed on the clinical characteristics of the affected patients. METHODS: We extracted data regarding 1099 patients with laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 from 552 hospitals in 30 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities in mainland China through January 29, 2020. The primary composite end point was admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), the use of mechanical ventilation, or death. RESULTS: The median age of the patients was 47 years; 41.9% of the patients were female. The primary composite end point occurred in 67 patients (6.1%), including 5.0% who were admitted to the ICU, 2.3% who underwent invasive mechanical ventilation, and 1.4% who died. Only 1.9% of the patients had a history of direct contact with wildlife. Among nonresidents of Wuhan, 72.3% had contact with residents of Wuhan, including 31.3% who had visited the city. The most common symptoms were fever (43.8% on admission and 88.7% during hospitalization) and cough (67.8%). Diarrhea was uncommon (3.8%). The median incubation period was 4 days (interquartile range, 2 to 7). On admission, ground-glass opacity was the most common radiologic finding on chest computed tomography (CT) (56.4%). No radiographic or CT abnormality was found in 157 of 877 patients (17.9%) with nonsevere disease and in 5 of 173 patients (2.9%) with severe disease. Lymphocytopenia was present in 83.2% of the patients on admission. CONCLUSIONS: During the first 2 months of the current outbreak, Covid-19 spread rapidly throughout China and caused varying degrees of illness. Patients often presented without fever, and many did not have abnormal radiologic findings. (Funded by the National Health Commission of China and others.). ",
        "Associations of Processed Meat, Unprocessed Red Meat, Poultry, or Fish Intake With Incident Cardiovascular Disease and All-Cause Mortality. Importance: Although the associations between processed meat intake and cardiovascular disease (CVD) and all-cause mortality have been established, the associations of unprocessed red meat, poultry, or fish consumption with CVD and all-cause mortality are still uncertain. Objective: To identify the associations of processed meat, unprocessed red meat, poultry, or fish intake with incident CVD and all-cause mortality. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study analyzed individual-level data of adult participants in 6 prospective cohort studies in the United States. Baseline diet data from 1985 to 2002 were collected. Participants were followed up until August 31, 2016. Data analyses were performed from March 25, 2019, to November 17, 2019. Exposures: Processed meat, unprocessed red meat, poultry, or fish intake as continuous variables. Main Outcomes and Measures: Hazard ratio (HR) and 30-year absolute risk difference (ARD) for incident CVD (composite end point of coronary heart disease, stroke, heart failure, and CVD deaths) and all-cause mortality, based on each additional intake of 2 servings per week for monotonic associations or 2 vs 0 servings per week for nonmonotonic associations. Results: Among the 29 682 participants (mean [SD] age at baseline, 53.7 [15.7] years; 13 168 [44.4%] men; and 9101 [30.7%] self-identified as non-white), 6963 incident CVD events and 8875 all-cause deaths were adjudicated during a median (interquartile range) follow-up of 19.0 (14.1-23.7) years. The associations of processed meat, unprocessed red meat, poultry, or fish intake with incident CVD and all-cause mortality were monotonic (P for nonlinearity\u2009\u2265\u2009.25), except for the nonmonotonic association between processed meat intake and incident CVD (P for nonlinearity\u2009=\u2009.006). Intake of processed meat (adjusted HR, 1.07 [95% CI, 1.04-1.11]; adjusted ARD, 1.74% [95% CI, 0.85%-2.63%]), unprocessed red meat (adjusted HR, 1.03 [95% CI, 1.01-1.06]; adjusted ARD, 0.62% [95% CI, 0.07%-1.16%]), or poultry (adjusted HR, 1.04 [95% CI, 1.01-1.06]; adjusted ARD, 1.03% [95% CI, 0.36%-1.70%]) was significantly associated with incident CVD. Fish intake was not significantly associated with incident CVD (adjusted HR, 1.00 [95% CI, 0.98-1.02]; adjusted ARD, 0.12% [95% CI, -0.40% to 0.65%]). Intake of processed meat (adjusted HR, 1.03 [95% CI, 1.02-1.05]; adjusted ARD, 0.90% [95% CI, 0.43%-1.38%]) or unprocessed red meat (adjusted HR, 1.03 [95% CI, 1.01-1.05]; adjusted ARD, 0.76% [95% CI, 0.19%-1.33%]) was significantly associated with all-cause mortality. Intake of poultry (adjusted HR, 0.99 [95% CI, 0.97-1.02]; adjusted ARD, -0.28% [95% CI, -1.00% to 0.44%]) or fish (adjusted HR, 0.99 [95% CI, 0.97-1.01]; adjusted ARD, -0.34% [95% CI, -0.88% to 0.20%]) was not significantly associated with all-cause mortality. Conclusions and Relevance: These findings suggest that, among US adults, higher intake of processed meat, unprocessed red meat, or poultry, but not fish, was significantly associated with a small increased risk of incident CVD, whereas higher intake of processed meat or unprocessed red meat, but not poultry or fish, was significantly associated with a small increased risk of all-cause mortality. These findings have important public health implications and should warrant further investigations. ",
        "Association of Fish Consumption and Mercury Exposure During Pregnancy With Metabolic Health and Inflammatory Biomarkers in Children. Importance: The balance of mercury risk and nutritional benefit from fish intake during pregnancy for the metabolic health of offspring to date is unknown. Objective: To assess the associations of fish intake and mercury exposure during pregnancy with metabolic syndrome in children and alterations in biomarkers of inflammation in children. Design, Setting, and Participants: This population-based prospective birth cohort study used data from studies performed in 5 European countries (France, Greece, Norway, Spain, and the UK) between April 1, 2003, and February 26, 2016, as part of the Human Early Life Exposome (HELIX) project. Mothers and their singleton offspring were followed up until the children were aged 6 to 12 years. Data were analyzed between March 1 and August 2, 2019. Exposures: Maternal fish intake during pregnancy (measured in times per week) was assessed using validated food frequency questionnaires, and maternal mercury concentration (measured in micrograms per liter) was assessed using maternal whole blood and cord blood samples. Main Outcomes and Measures: An aggregate metabolic syndrome score for children was calculated using the z scores of waist circumference, systolic and diastolic blood pressures, and levels of triglyceride, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and insulin. A higher metabolic syndrome score (score range, -4.9 to 7.5) indicated a poorer metabolic profile. Three protein panels were used to measure several cytokines and adipokines in the plasma of children. Results: The study included 805 mothers and their singleton children. Among mothers, the mean (SD) age at cohort inclusion or delivery of their infant was 31.3 (4.6) years. A total of 400 women (49.7%) had a high educational level, and 432 women (53.7%) were multiparous. Among children, the mean (SD) age was 8.4 (1.5) years (age range, 6-12 years). A total of 453 children (56.3%) were boys, and 734 children (91.2%) were of white race/ethnicity. Fish intake consistent with health recommendations (1 to 3 times per week) during pregnancy was associated with a 1-U decrease in metabolic syndrome score in children (\u03b2\u2009=\u2009-0.96; 95% CI, -1.49 to -0.42) compared with low fish consumption (<1 time per week) after adjusting for maternal mercury levels and other covariates. No further benefit was observed with fish intake of more than 3 times per week. A higher maternal mercury concentration was independently associated with an increase in the metabolic syndrome score of their offspring (\u03b2 per 2-fold increase in mercury concentration\u2009=\u20090.18; 95% CI, 0.01-0.34). Compared with low fish intake, moderate and high fish intake during pregnancy were associated with reduced levels of proinflammatory cytokines and adipokines in children. An integrated analysis identified a cluster of children with increased susceptibility to metabolic disease, which was characterized by low fish consumption during pregnancy, high maternal mercury levels, decreased levels of adiponectin in children, and increased levels of leptin, tumor necrosis factor \u03b1, and the cytokines interleukin 6 and interleukin 1\u03b2 in children. Conclusions and Relevance: Results of this study suggest that moderate fish intake consistent with current health recommendations during pregnancy was associated with improvements in the metabolic health of children, while high maternal mercury exposure was associated with an unfavorable metabolic profile in children.

        "Trends in Diet Quality Among Youth in the United States, 1999-2016. Importance: Prior studies of dietary trends among US youth have evaluated major macronutrients or only a few foods or have used older data. Objective: To characterize trends in diet quality among US youth. Design, Setting, and Participants: Serial cross-sectional investigation using 24-hour dietary recalls from youth aged 2 to 19 years from 9 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) cycles (1999-2016). Exposures: Calendar year and population sociodemographic characteristics. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcomes were the survey-weighted, energy-adjusted mean consumption of dietary components and proportion meeting targets of the American Heart Association (AHA) 2020 continuous diet score (range, 0-50; based on total fruits and vegetables, whole grains, fish and shellfish, sugar-sweetened beverages, and sodium). Additional outcomes were the AHA secondary score (range, 0-80; adding nuts, seeds, and legumes; processed meat; and saturated fat) and Healthy Eating Index (HEI) 2015 score (range, 0-100). Poor diet was defined as less than 40% adherence (scores, <20 for primary and <32 for secondary AHA scores); intermediate as 40% to 79.9% adherence (scores, 20-39.9 and 32-63.9, respectively); and ideal, as at least 80% adherence (scores, \u226540 and \u226564, respectively). Higher diet scores indicate better diet quality; a minimal clinically important difference has not been quantified. Results: Of 31\u202f420 youth aged 2 to 19 years included, the mean age was 10.6 years; 49.1% were female. From 1999 to 2016, the estimated AHA primary diet score significantly increased from 14.8 (95% CI, 14.1-15.4) to 18.8 (95% CI, 18.1-19.6) (27.0% improvement), the estimated AHA secondary diet score from 29.2 (95% CI, 28.1-30.4) to 33.0 (95% CI, 32.0-33.9) (13.0% improvement), and the estimated HEI-2015 score from 44.6 (95% CI, 43.5-45.8) to 49.6 (95% CI, 48.5-50.8) (11.2% improvement) (P\u2009<\u2009.001 for trend for each). Based on the AHA primary diet score, the estimated proportion of youth with poor diets significantly declined from 76.8% (95% CI, 72.9%-80.2%) to 56.1% (95% CI, 51.4%-60.7%) and with intermediate diets significantly increased from 23.2% (95% CI, 19.8%-26.9%) to 43.7% (95% CI, 39.1%-48.3%) (P\u2009<\u2009.001 for trend for each). The estimated proportion meeting ideal quality significantly increased but remained low, from 0.07% (95% CI, 0.01%-0.49%) to 0.25% (95% CI, 0.10%-0.62%) (P\u2009=\u2009.03 for trend). Persistent dietary variations were identified across multiple sociodemographic groups. The estimated proportion of youth with a poor diet in 2015-2016 was 39.8% (95% CI, 35.1%-44.5%) for ages 2 to 5 years (unweighted n\u2009=\u2009666), 52.5% (95% CI, 46.4%-58.5%) for ages 6 to 11 years (unweighted n\u2009=\u20091040), and 66.6% (95% CI, 61.4%-71.4%) for ages 12 to 19 years (unweighted n\u2009=\u20091195), with persistent differences across levels of parental education, household income, and household food security status. Conclusions and Relevance: Based on serial NHANES surveys from 1999 to 2016, the estimated overall diet quality of US youth showed modest improvement, but more than half of youth still had poor-quality diets.

        "Comparison of dietary macronutrient patterns of 14 popular named dietary programmes for weight and cardiovascular risk factor reduction in adults: systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomised trials. OBJECTIVE: To determine the relative effectiveness of dietary macronutrient patterns and popular named diet programmes for weight loss and cardiovascular risk factor improvement among adults who are overweight or obese. DESIGN: Systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomised trials. DATA SOURCES: Medline, Embase, CINAHL, AMED, and CENTRAL from database inception until September 2018, reference lists of eligible trials, and related reviews. STUDY SELECTION: Randomised trials that enrolled adults (\u226518 years) who were overweight (body mass index 25-29) or obese (\u226530) to a popular named diet or an alternative diet. OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Change in body weight, low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and C reactive protein at the six and 12 month follow-up. REVIEW METHODS: Two reviewers independently extracted data on study participants, interventions, and outcomes and assessed risk of bias, and the certainty of evidence using the GRADE (grading of recommendations, assessment, development, and evaluation) approach. A bayesian framework informed a series of random effects network meta-analyses to estimate the relative effectiveness of the diets. RESULTS: 121 eligible trials with 21\u2009942 patients were included and reported on 14 named diets and three control diets. Compared with usual diet, low carbohydrate and low fat diets had a similar effect at six months on weight loss (4.63 v 4.37 kg, both moderate certainty) and reduction in systolic blood pressure (5.14 mm Hg, moderate certainty v 5.05 mm Hg, low certainty) and diastolic blood pressure (3.21 v 2.85 mm Hg, both low certainty). Moderate macronutrient diets resulted in slightly less weight loss and blood pressure reductions. Low carbohydrate diets had less effect than low fat diets and moderate macronutrient diets on reduction in LDL cholesterol (1.01 mg/dL, low certainty v 7.08 mg/dL, moderate certainty v 5.22 mg/dL, moderate certainty, respectively) but an increase in HDL cholesterol (2.31 mg/dL, low certainty), whereas low fat (-1.88 mg/dL, moderate certainty) and moderate macronutrient (-0.89 mg/dL, moderate certainty) did not. Among popular named diets, those with the largest effect on weight reduction and blood pressure in comparison with usual diet were Atkins (weight 5.5 kg, systolic blood pressure 5.1 mm Hg, diastolic blood pressure 3.3 mm Hg), DASH (3.6 kg, 4.7 mm Hg, 2.9 mm Hg, respectively), and Zone (4.1 kg, 3.5 mm Hg, 2.3 mm Hg, respectively) at six months (all moderate certainty). No diets significantly improved levels of HDL cholesterol or C reactive protein at six months. Overall, weight loss diminished at 12 months among all macronutrient patterns and popular named diets, while the benefits for cardiovascular risk factors of all interventions, except the Mediterranean diet, essentially disappeared. CONCLUSIONS: Moderate certainty evidence shows that most macronutrient diets, over six months, result in modest weight loss and substantial improvements in cardiovascular risk factors, particularly blood pressure. At 12 months the effects on weight reduction and improvements in cardiovascular risk factors largely disappear. SYSTEMATIC REVIEW REGISTRATION: PROSPERO CRD42015027929. ",
        "Lung Parenchymal and Tracheal CT Morphology: Evaluation before and after Bariatric Surgery. Background There is significant pulmonary functional deficit related to obesity, but no prospective CT studies have evaluated the effects of obesity on the lungs and trachea. Purpose To evaluate lung parenchymal and tracheal CT morphology before and 6 months after bariatric surgery, with functional and symptomatic correlation. Materials and Methods A prospective longitudinal study of 51 consecutive individuals referred for bariatric surgery was performed (from November 2011 to November 2013). All individuals had undergone limited (three-location) inspiratory and end-expiratory thoracic CT before and after surgery, with concurrent pulmonary function testing, body mass index calculation, and modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) dyspnea scale and Epworth scoring. Two thoracic radiologists scored the CT extent of mosaic attenuation, end-expiratory air trapping, and tracheal shape. The inspiratory and end-expiratory cross-sectional areas of the trachea were measured. The paired t test or Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used for pre- and postsurgical comparisons. Spearman correlation and logistic regression were used to evaluate correlations between CT findings and functional and symptom indexes. Results A total of 51 participants (mean age, 52 years \u00b1 8 [standard deviation]; 20 men) were evaluated. Before surgery, air trapping extent correlated most strongly with decreased total lung capacity (Spearman rank correlation coefficient [rs] = -0.40, P = .004). After surgery, there were decreases in percentage mosaic attenuation (0% [interquartile range {IQR}: 0%-2.5%] vs 0% [IQR: 0%-0%], P < .001), air trapping (9.6% [IQR: 5.8%-15.8%] vs 2.5% [IQR: 0%-6.7%], P < .001), and tracheal collapse (201 mm2 [IQR: 181-239 mm2] vs 229 mm2 [186-284 mm2], P < .001). After surgery, mMRC dyspnea score change correlated positively with air trapping extent change (rs = 0.46, P = .001) and end-expiratory tracheal shape change (rs = 0.40, P = .01). At multivariable analysis, air trapping was the main determinant for decreased dyspnea after surgery (odds ratio, 1.2; 95% confidence interval: 1.1, 1.2; P = .03). Conclusion Dyspnea improved in obese participants after weight reduction, which correlated with less tracheal collapse and air trapping at end-expiration chest CT. \u00a9 RSNA, 2020 Online supplemental material is available for this article.

        "Changes in Smoking Behavior Before and After Gastric Bypass: A 7-year Study. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate smoking history and change in smoking behavior, from 1 year before through 7 years after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery, and to identify risk factors for post-surgery smoking. BACKGROUND: Smoking behavior in the context of bariatric surgery is poorly described. METHODS: Adults undergoing RYGB surgery entered a prospective cohort study between 2006 and 2009 and were followed up to 7 years until \u22642015. Participants (N = 1770; 80% female, median age 45 years, median body mass index 47\u200akg/m) self-reported smoking history pre-surgery, and current smoking behavior annually. RESULTS: Almost half of participants (45.2%) reported a pre-surgery history of smoking. Modeled prevalence of current smoking decreased in the year before surgery from 13.7% [95% confidence interval (CI) = 12.1-15.4] to 2.2% (95% CI = 1.5-2.9) at surgery, then increased to 9.6% (95% CI = 8.1-11.2) 1-year post-surgery and continued to increase to 14.0% (95% CI = 11.8-16.0) 7-years post-surgery. Among smokers, mean packs/day was 0.60 (95% CI = 0.44-0.77) at surgery, 0.70 (95% CI = 0.62-0.78) 1-year post-surgery and 0.77 (95% CI = 0.68-0.88) 7-years post-surgery. At 7-years, smoking was reported by 61.7% (95% CI = 51.9-70.8) of participants who smoked 1-year pre-surgery (n = 221), 12.3% (95% CI = 8.5-15.7) of participants who formerly smoked but quit >1 year pre-surgery (n = 507), and 3.8% (95% CI = 2.1-4.9) of participants who reported no smoking history (n = 887). Along with smoking history (ie, less time since smoked), younger age, household income <$25,000, being married or living as married, and illicit drug use were independently associated with increased risk of post-surgery smoking. CONCLUSION: Although most adults who smoked 1-year before RYGB quit pre-surgery, smoking prevalence rebounded across 7-years, primarily due to relapse. ",
        "Improved oral hygiene is associated with decreased risk of new-onset diabetes: a nationwide population-based cohort study. AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Inflammation plays an important role in the development of diabetes, a major global health problem. Periodontal disease is also common in the general population. Because periodontal disease and poor oral hygiene can provoke transient bacteraemia and systemic inflammation, we hypothesised that periodontal disease and oral hygiene indicators would be associated with the occurrence of new-onset diabetes. METHODS: In this study we analysed data collected between 2003 and 2006 on 188,013 subjects from the National Health Insurance System-Health Screening Cohort (NHIS-HEALS) in Korea who had no missing data for demographics, past medical history, oral hygiene indicators or laboratory findings. The presence of periodontal disease was defined on the basis of a modified version of ICD-10 codes (Korean Classification of Disease, sixth edition), if claims for treatment for acute periodontitis (K052), chronic periodontitis (K053) and periodontosis (K054) were made more than two times by a dentist, or if, according to medical records, subjects received treatment by a dentist for periodontal disease with ICD-10 codes K052, K053 or K054. Oral hygiene behaviours (number of tooth brushings, a dental visit for any reason and professional dental cleaning) were collected as self-reported data of dental health check-ups. Number of missing teeth was ascertained by dentists during oral health examination. The incidence of new-onset diabetes was defined according to ICD-10 codes E10-E14. The criterial included at least one claim per year for both visiting an outpatient clinic and admission accompanying prescription records for any glucose-lowering agent, or was based on a fasting plasma glucose \u22657\u00a0mmol/l from NHIS-HEALS. RESULTS: Of the included subjects, 17.5% had periodontal disease. After a median follow-up of 10.0\u00a0years, diabetes developed in 31,545 (event rate: 16.1%, 95% CI 15.9%, 16.3%) subjects. In multivariable models, after adjusting for demographics, regular exercise, alcohol consumption, smoking status, vascular risk factors, history of malignancy and laboratory findings, the presence of periodontal disease (HR 1.09, 95% CI 1.07, 1.12, p\u2009<\u20090.001) and number of missing teeth (\u226515 teeth) remained positively associated with occurrence of new-onset diabetes (HR 1.21, 95% CI 1.09, 1.33, p\u2009<\u20090.001, p for trend <0.001). Frequent tooth brushing (\u22653 times/day) was negatively associated with occurrence of new-onset diabetes (HR 0.92, 95% CI 0.89, 0.95, p\u2009<\u20090.001, p for trend <0.001). CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Frequent tooth brushing may be an attenuating factor and the presence of periodontal disease and an increased number of missing teeth may be augmenting factors for the occurrence of new-onset diabetes. Improving oral hygiene may be associated with a decreased risk of occurrence of new-onset diabetes. ",
        "Efficacy of Gabapentin for the Treatment of Alcohol Use Disorder in Patients With Alcohol Withdrawal Symptoms: A Randomized Clinical Trial. Importance: Although an estimated 30 million people meet criteria for alcohol use disorder (AUD), few receive appropriate pharmacotherapy. A more personalized, symptom-specific, approach might improve efficacy and acceptance. Objective: To examine whether gabapentin would be useful in the treatment of AUD, especially in those with the most alcohol withdrawal symptoms. Design, Setting, and Participants: This double-blind randomized clinical trial conducted between November 2014 and June 2018 evaluated gabapentin vs placebo in community-recruited participants screened and treated in an academic outpatient setting over a 16-week treatment period. A total of 145 treatment-seeking individuals who met Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Fifth Edition) criteria for AUD and were not receiving other AUD intervention were screened, and 96 who also met recent alcohol withdrawal criteria were randomized to treatment after 3 abstinent days. Daily drinking was recorded, and percentage of disialo carbohydrate-deficient transferrin in the blood, a heavy drinking marker, was collected at baseline and monthly during treatment. Interventions: Gabapentin up to 1200 mg/d, orally, vs placebo along with 9 medical management visits (20 minutes each). Main Outcomes and Measures: The percentage of individuals with no heavy drinking days and those with total abstinence were compared between treatment groups and further evaluated based on prestudy alcohol withdrawal symptoms. Results: Of 96 randomized individuals, 90 were evaluable (44 in the gabapentin arm and 46 in the placebo arm), with a mean (SD) age of 49.6 (10.1) years; 69 were men (77%) and 85 were white (94%). The evaluable participants had 83% baseline heavy drinking days (4 or more drinks/day for women, 5 or more for men) and met 4.5 alcohol withdrawal criteria from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Fifth Edition). More gabapentin-treated individuals had no heavy drinking days (12 of 44 participants [27%]) compared with placebo (4 of 46 participants [9%]), a difference of 18.6% (95% CI, 3.1-34.1; P\u2009=\u2009.02; number needed to treat [NNT], 5.4), and more total abstinence (8 of 44 [18%]) compared with placebo (2 of 46 [4%]), a difference of 13.8% (95% CI, 1.0-26.7; P\u2009=\u2009.04; NNT, 6.2). The prestudy high-alcohol withdrawal group had positive gabapentin effects on no heavy drinking days (P\u2009<\u2009.02; NNT, 3.1) and total abstinence (P\u2009=\u2009.003; NNT, 2.7) compared with placebo, while within the low-alcohol withdrawal group, there were no significant differences. These findings were similar for other drinking variables, where gabapentin was more efficacious than placebo in the high-alcohol withdrawal group only. Gabapentin caused more dizziness, but this did not affect efficacy. Conclusions and Relevance: These data, combined with others, suggest gabapentin might be most efficacious in people with AUD and a history of alcohol withdrawal symptoms. Future studies should evaluate sleep changes and mood during early recovery as mediators of gabapentin efficacy. Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02349477. ",
        "Association Between Maternal Exposure to Magnetic Field Nonionizing Radiation During Pregnancy and Risk of Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder in Offspring in a Longitudinal Birth Cohort. Importance: An association between maternal exposure to magnetic field (MF) nonionizing radiation during pregnancy and the risk of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) has been reported in both animal and human studies. Objectives: To determine whether maternal exposure to high levels of MF nonionizing radiation is associated with an increased risk of ADHD in offspring by using more accurate measurements of MF nonionizing radiation levels and physician-diagnosed ADHD, rather than self-reports, and to determine whether the association differs for the subtypes of ADHD with or without immune-related comorbidities. Design, Setting, and Participants: A longitudinal birth cohort study was conducted at Kaiser Permanente Northern California among 1482 mother-child pairs whose mothers were participants of an existing birth cohort and whose level of exposure to MF nonionizing radiation was captured during pregnancy in 2 studies conducted from October 1, 1996, to October 31, 1998, and from May 1, 2006, to February 29, 2012. The offspring were followed up from May 1, 1997, to December 31, 2017. Exposure: All participating women wore a monitoring meter for 24 hours during pregnancy to capture the level of exposure to MF nonionizing radiation from any sources. Main Outcomes and Measures: Physician-diagnosed ADHD and immune-related comorbidities of asthma or atopic dermatitis up to 20 years of age in offspring captured in the Kaiser Permanente Northern California electronic medical record from May 1, 1997, to December 31, 2017. Confounders were ascertained during in-person interviews during pregnancy. Results: Among the 1454 mother-child pairs (548 white [37.7%], 110 African American [7.6%], 325 Hispanic [22.4%], 376 Asian or Pacific Islander [25.9%], and 95 other or unknown [6.5%]; mean [SD] maternal age, 31.4 [5.4] years]), 61 children (4.2%) had physician-diagnosed ADHD. Using Cox proportional hazards regression to account for follow-up time and confounders, compared with children whose mothers had a low level of exposure to MF nonionizing radiation during pregnancy, children whose mothers were exposed to higher levels of MF nonionizing radiation had more than twice the risk of ADHD (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 2.01; 95% CI, 1.06-3.81). The association was stronger for ADHD that persisted into adolescence (\u226512 years of age), with an aHR of 3.38 (95% CI, 1.43-8.02). When the subtypes of ADHD were examined, the association existed primarily for ADHD with immune-related comorbidities (asthma or atopic dermatitis), with an aHR of 4.57 (95% CI, 1.61-12.99) for all ADHD cases and an aHR of 8.27 (95% CI, 1.96-34.79) for persistent cases of ADHD. Conclusions and Relevance: Consistent with the emerging literature, this study suggests that in utero exposure to high levels of MF nonionizing radiation was associated with an increased risk of ADHD, especially ADHD with immune-related comorbidity. The findings should spur more research to examine the biological association of in utero MF exposure with risk of ADHD in offspring, given that almost everyone is exposed to it. ",
        "Effects of Antipsychotic Medication on Brain Structure in Patients With Major Depressive Disorder and Psychotic Features: Neuroimaging Findings in the Context of a Randomized Placebo-Controlled Clinical Trial. Importance: Prescriptions for antipsychotic medications continue to increase across many brain disorders, including off-label use in children and elderly individuals. Concerning animal and uncontrolled human data suggest antipsychotics are associated with change in brain structure, but to our knowledge, there are no controlled human studies that have yet addressed this question. Objective: To assess the effects of antipsychotics on brain structure in humans. Design, Setting, and Participants: Prespecified secondary analysis of a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial over a 36-week period at 5 academic centers. All participants, aged 18 to 85 years, were recruited from the multicenter Study of the Pharmacotherapy of Psychotic Depression II (STOP-PD II). All participants had major depressive disorder with psychotic features (psychotic depression) and were prescribed olanzapine and sertraline for a period of 12 to 20 weeks, which included 8 weeks of remission of psychosis and remission/near remission of depression. Participants were then were randomized to continue receiving this regimen or to be switched to placebo and sertraline for a subsequent 36-week period. Data were analyzed between October 2018 and February 2019. Interventions: Those who consented to the imaging study completed a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan at the time of randomization and a second MRI scan at the end of the 36-week period or at time of relapse. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome measure was cortical thickness in gray matter and the secondary outcome measure was microstructural integrity of white matter. Results: Eighty-eight participants (age range, 18-85 years) completed a baseline scan; 75 completed a follow-up scan, of which 72 (32 men and 40 women) were useable for final analyses. There was a significant treatment-group by time interaction in cortical thickness (left, t\u2009=\u20093.3; P\u2009=\u2009.001; right, t\u2009=\u20093.6; P\u2009<\u2009.001) but not surface area. No significant interaction was found for fractional anisotropy, but one for mean diffusivity of the white matter skeleton was present (t\u2009=\u2009-2.6, P\u2009=\u2009.01). When the analysis was restricted to those who sustained remission, exposure to olanzapine compared with placebo was associated with significant decreases in cortical thickness in the left hemisphere (\u03b2 [SE], 0.04 [0.009]; t34.4\u2009=\u20094.7; P\u2009<.001), and the right hemisphere (\u03b2 [SE], 0.03 [0.009]; t35.1\u2009=\u20093.6; P\u2009<.001). Post hoc analyses showed that those who relapsed receiving placebo experienced decreases in cortical thickness compared with those who sustained remission. Conclusions and Relevance: In this secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial, antipsychotic medication was shown to change brain structure. This information is important for prescribing in psychiatric conditions where alternatives are present. However, adverse effects of relapse on brain structure support antipsychotic treatment during active illness. Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01427608. ",
        "Escalating infection control response to the rapidly evolving epidemiology of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) due to SARS-CoV-2 in Hong Kong. OBJECTIVE: To describe the infection control preparedness measures undertaken for coronavirus disease (COVID-19) due to SARS-CoV-2 (previously known as 2019 novel coronavirus) in the first 42 days after announcement of a cluster of pneumonia in China, on December 31, 2019 (day 1) in Hong Kong. METHODS: A bundled approach of active and enhanced laboratory surveillance, early airborne infection isolation, rapid molecular diagnostic testing, and contact tracing for healthcare workers (HCWs) with unprotected exposure in the hospitals was implemented. Epidemiological characteristics of confirmed cases, environmental samples, and air samples were collected and analyzed. RESULTS: From day 1 to day 42, 42 of 1,275 patients (3.3%) fulfilling active (n = 29) and enhanced laboratory surveillance (n = 13) were confirmed to have the SARS-CoV-2 infection. The number of locally acquired case significantly increased from 1 of 13 confirmed cases (7.7%, day 22 to day 32) to 27 of 29 confirmed cases (93.1%, day 33 to day 42; P < .001). Among them, 28 patients (66.6%) came from 8 family clusters. Of 413 HCWs caring for these confirmed cases, 11 (2.7%) had unprotected exposure requiring quarantine for 14 days. None of these was infected, and nosocomial transmission of SARS-CoV-2 was not observed. Environmental surveillance was performed in the room of a patient with viral load of 3.3 \u00d7 106 copies/mL (pooled nasopharyngeal and throat swabs) and 5.9 \u00d7 106 copies/mL (saliva), respectively. SARS-CoV-2 was identified in 1 of 13 environmental samples (7.7%) but not in 8 air samples collected at a distance of 10 cm from the patient's chin with or without wearing a surgical mask. CONCLUSION: Appropriate hospital infection control measures was able to prevent nosocomial transmission of SARS-CoV-2. ",
        "Associations of habitual fish oil supplementation with cardiovascular outcomes and all cause mortality: evidence from a large population based cohort study. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the associations of habitual fish oil supplementation with cardiovascular disease (CVD) and mortality in a large prospective cohort. DESIGN: Population based, prospective cohort study. SETTING: UK Biobank. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 427\u2009678 men and women aged between 40 and 69 who had no CVD or cancer at baseline were enrolled between 2006 and 2010 and followed up to the end of 2018. MAIN EXPOSURE: All participants answered questions on the habitual use of supplements, including fish oil. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: All cause mortality, CVD mortality, and CVD events. RESULTS: At baseline, 133\u2009438 (31.2%) of the 427\u2009678 participants reported habitual use of fish oil supplements. The multivariable adjusted hazard ratios for habitual users of fish oil versus non-users were 0.87 (95% confidence interval 0.83 to 0.90) for all cause mortality, 0.84 (0.78 to 0.91) for CVD mortality, and 0.93 (0.90 to 0.96) for incident CVD events. For CVD events, the association seemed to be stronger among those with prevalent hypertension (P for interaction=0.005). CONCLUSIONS: Habitual use of fish oil seems to be associated with a lower risk of all cause and CVD mortality and to provide a marginal benefit against CVD events among the general population. ",
        "Association of Family Member Detention or Deportation With Latino or Latina Adolescents' Later Risks of Suicidal Ideation, Alcohol Use, and Externalizing Problems. Importance: Policy changes since early 2017 have resulted in a substantial expansion of Latino or Latina immigrants prioritized for deportation and detention. Professional organizations, including the American Academy of Pediatrics, American Medical Association, and Society for Research in Child Development, have raised concerns about the potentially irreversible mental health effects of deportations and detentions on Latino or Latina youths. Objective: To examine how family member detention or deportation is associated with Latino or Latina adolescents' later mental health problems and risk behaviors. Design, Setting, and Participants: Survey data were collected between February 14 and April 26, 2018, and between September 17, 2018, and January 13, 2019, and at a 6-month follow-up from 547 Latino or Latina adolescents who were randomly selected from grade and sex strata in middle schools in a suburban Atlanta, Georgia, school district. Prospective data were analyzed using multivariable, multivariate logistic models within a structural equation modeling framework. Models examined how family member detention or deportation within the prior 12 months was associated with later changes in suicidal ideation, alcohol use, and clinical externalizing symptoms, controlling for initial mental health and risk behaviors. Exposure: Past-year family member detention or deportation. Main Outcomes and Measures: Follow-up reports of suicidal ideation in the past 6 months, alcohol use since the prior survey, and clinical level of externalizing symptoms in the past 6 months. Results: A total of 547 adolescents (303 girls; mean [SD] age, 12.8 [1.0] years) participated in this prospective survey. Response rates were 65.2% (547 of 839) among contacted parents and 95.3% (547 of 574) among contacted adolescents whose parents provided permission. The 6-month follow-up retention rate was 81.5% (446 of 547). A total of 136 adolescents (24.9%) had a family member detained or deported in the prior year. Family member detention or deportation was associated with higher odds of suicidal ideation (38 of 136 [27.9%] vs 66 of 411 [16.1%]; adjusted odds ratio, 2.37; 95% CI, 1.06-5.29), alcohol use (25 of 136 [18.4%] vs 30 of 411 [7.3%]; adjusted odds ratio, 2.98; 95% CI, 1.26-7.04), and clinical externalizing behaviors (31 of 136 [22.8%] vs 47 of 411 [11.4%]; adjusted odds ratio, 2.76; 95% CI, 1.11-6.84) at follow-up, controlling for baseline variables. Conclusion and Relevance: This study suggests that recent immigration policy changes may be associated with critical outcomes jeopardizing the health of Latino or Latina adolescents. Since 95% of US Latino or Latina adolescents are citizens, compromised mental health and risk behavior tied to family member detention or deportation raises concerns regarding the association of current immigration policies with the mental health of Latino and Latina adolescents in the United States.

        "Association of Preeclampsia in Term Births With Neurodevelopmental Disorders in Offspring. Importance: Preeclampsia during pregnancy has been linked to an increased risk of cerebral palsy in offspring. Less is known about the role of preeclampsia in other neurodevelopmental disorders. Objective: To determine the association between preeclampsia and a range of adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes in offspring after excluding preterm births. Design, Setting, and Participants: This prospective, population-based cohort study included singleton children born at term from January 1, 1991, through December 31, 2009, and followed up through December 31, 2014 (to 5 years of age), using Norway's Medical Birth Registry and linked to other demographic, social, and health information by Statistics Norway. Data were analyzed from May 30, 2018, to November 17, 2019. Exposures: Maternal preeclampsia. Main Outcomes and Measures: Associations between preeclampsia in term pregnancies and cerebral palsy, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism spectrum disorder (ASD), epilepsy, intellectual disability, and vision or hearing loss using multivariable logistic regression. Results: The cohort consisted of 980\u202f560 children born at term (48.8% female and 51.2% male; mean [SD] gestational age, 39.8 [1.4] weeks) with a mean (SD) follow-up of 14.0 (5.6) years. Among these children, 28\u202f068 (2.9%) were exposed to preeclampsia. Exposed children were at increased risk of ADHD (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 1.18; 95% CI, 1.05-1.33), ASD (adjusted OR, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.08-1.54), epilepsy (adjusted OR, 1.50; 95% CI, 1.16-1.93), and intellectual disability (adjusted OR, 1.50; 95% CI, 1.13-1.97); there was also an apparent association between preeclampsia exposure and cerebral palsy (adjusted OR, 1.30; 95% CI, 0.94-1.80). Conclusions and Relevance: Preeclampsia is a well-established threat to the mother. Other than the hazards associated with preterm delivery, the risks to offspring from preeclampsia are usually regarded as less important. This study's findings suggest that preeclampsia at term may have lasting effects on neurodevelopment of the child. ",
        "Association of Hospital Inpatient Percutaneous Coronary Intervention Volume With Clinical Outcomes After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement and Transcatheter Mitral Valve Repair. Importance: The US Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services recently released an updated national coverage determination proposal for transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) that maintains a focus on hospital TAVR volume and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) volume, and the national coverage determination for transcatheter mitral valve repair (TMVr) also has PCI volume requirements. However, the associations between hospital PCI volume and TAVR and TMVr outcomes are unknown. Objective: To investigate whether hospital inpatient PCI volume is associated with rates of risk-adjusted in-hospital mortality and 30-day hospital readmission after TAVR and TMVr. Design, Setting, and Participants: This population-based cross-sectional study of the 2016 Nationwide Readmissions Database included procedures completed in hospitals with a minimum of 5 TAVR or 5 TMVr procedures between January 1, 2016, and November 30, 2016. Exposures: Hospitals were divided into quartiles based on annual inpatient PCI volumes. Main Outcomes and Measures: Primary outcomes were in-hospital mortality and 30-day readmission rates. The associations between hospital inpatient PCI quartile and outcomes were evaluated using Kruskal-Wallis tests. Risk adjustment for in-hospital mortality rates was done through inclusion of variables based on the Elixhauser comorbidity classification, and risk adjustment for 30-day readmission rates was done in accordance with the Hospital-Wide Readmission Measure methodology used by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services for public reporting. Results: There were 283 hospitals that performed at least 5 TAVRs, with a median inpatient PCI volume of 386 (interquartile range, 299-571) procedures, and 125 hospitals that performed at least 5 TMVr procedures, with a median inpatient PCI volume of 451 (interquartile range, 326-651) procedures. There was no association between hospital inpatient PCI volume and median TAVR risk-standardized in-hospital mortality (median [IQR] rates: bottom quartile, 1.82% [1.77%-1.90%]; second quartile, 1.81% [1.76%-1.86%]; third quartile, 1.81% [1.75%-1.90%]; top quartile, 1.82% [1.76%-1.91%]; P\u2009=\u2009.75) or the 30-day readmission (median [IQR] rates: bottom quartile, 13.6% [13.2%-14.3%]; second quartile, 13.3% [12.7%-14.0%]; third quartile, 13.5% [12.7%-14.3%]; top quartile, 13.8% [12.8%-14.3%]; P\u2009=\u2009.10) rates. Similarly, there was no association between hospital inpatient PCI volume and median TMVr risk-standardized in-hospital mortality rates (median [IQR] rates: bottom quartile, 1.84% [1.47%-2.53%]; second quartile, 1.65% [1.21%-3.02%]; third quartile, 1.80% [1.52%-3.58%]; top quartile, 1.76% [1.33%-4.20%]; P\u2009=\u2009.71) or 30-day readmission rates (median [IQR] rates: bottom quartile, 13.4% [13.1%-13.6%]; second quartile, 13.1% [12.9%-13.5%]; third quartile, 13.1% [12.9%-13.5%]; top quartile, 13.3% [12.8%-13.6%]; P\u2009=\u2009.30). Conclusions and Relevance: In this study, there was no association between inpatient PCI volume and TAVR or TMVr outcomes. Further evidence is needed to support inclusion of PCI volume minimums in national coverage determination requirements for hospital TAVR and TMVr programs. ",
        "Association of Default Electronic Medical Record Settings With Health Care Professional Patterns of Opioid Prescribing in Emergency Departments: A Randomized Quality Improvement Study. Importance: Prescription opioids play a significant role in the ongoing opioid crisis. Guidelines and physician education have had mixed success in curbing opioid prescriptions, highlighting the need for other tools that can change prescriber behavior, including nudges based in behavioral economics. Objective: To determine whether and to what extent changes in the default settings in the electronic medical record (EMR) are associated with opioid prescriptions for patients discharged from emergency departments (EDs). Design, Setting, and Participants: This quality improvement study randomly altered, during a series of five 4-week blocks, the prepopulated dispense quantities of discharge prescriptions for commonly prescribed opioids at 2 large, urban EDs. These changes were made without announcement, and prescribers were not informed of the study itself. Participants included all health care professionals (physicians, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants) working clinically in either of the 2 EDs. Data were collected from November 28, 2016, through July 9, 2017, and analyzed from July 16, 2017, through May 14, 2018. Interventions: Default quantities for opioids were changed from status quo quantities of 12 and 20 tablets to null, 5, 10, and 15 tablets according to a block randomization scheme. Regardless of the default quantity, each health care professional decided for whom to prescribe opioids and could modify the quantity prescribed without restriction. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was the number of tablets of opioid-containing medications prescribed under each default setting. Results: A total of 104 health care professionals wrote 4320 prescriptions for opioids during the study period. Using linear regression, an increase of 0.19 tablets prescribed (95% CI, 0.15-0.22) was found for each tablet increase in default quantity. When evaluating each of the 15 pairwise comparisons of default quantities (eg, 5 vs 15 tablets), a lower default was associated with a lower number of pills prescribed in more than half (8 of the 15) of the pairwise comparisons; there was a higher quantity in 1 and no difference in 6 comparisons. Conclusions and Relevance: These findings suggest that default settings in the EMR may influence the quantity of opioids prescribed by health care professionals. This low-cost, easily implementable, EMR-based intervention could have far-reaching implications for opioid prescribing and could be used as a tool to help combat the opioid epidemic.

        "Robot-assisted bronchoscopy for pulmonary lesion diagnosis: results from the initial multicenter experience. BACKGROUND: The Robotic Endoscopic System (Auris Health, Inc., Redwood City, CA) has the potential to overcome several limitations of contemporary guided-bronchoscopic technologies for the diagnosis of lung lesions. Our objective is to report on the initial post-marketing feasibility, safety and diagnostic yield of this technology. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed data on consecutive cases in which robot-assisted bronchoscopy was used to sample lung lesions at four centers in the US (academic and community) from June 15th, 2018 to December 15th, 2018. RESULTS: One hundred and sixty-seven lesions in 165 patients were included in the analysis, with an average follow-up of 185\u2009\u00b1\u200955\u2009days. The average size of target lesions was 25.0\u2009\u00b1\u200915.0\u2009mm. Seventy-one percent were located in the peripheral third of the lung. Pneumothorax and airway bleeding occurred in 3.6 and 2.4% cases, respectively. Navigation was successful in 88.6% of cases. Tissue samples were successfully obtained in 98.8%. The diagnostic yield estimates ranged from 69.1 to 77% assuming the cases of biopsy-proven inflammation without any follow-up information (N\u2009=\u200913) were non-diagnostic and diagnostic, respectively. The yield was 81.5, 71.7 and 26.9% for concentric, eccentric and absent r-EBUS views, respectively. Diagnostic yield was not affected by lesion size, density, lobar location or centrality. CONCLUSIONS: RAB implementation in community and academic centers is safe and feasible, with an initial diagnostic yield of 69.1-77% in patients with lung lesions that require diagnostic bronchoscopy. Comparative trials with the existing bronchoscopic technologies are needed to determine cost-effectiveness of this technology. ",
        "Reduced progression of bone erosion in cytomegalovirus seropositive rheumatoid arthritis patients. BACKGROUND: Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) seropositivity has been associated with higher inflammation during rheumatoid arthritis (RA). However, no data are available on the impact of HCMV seropositivity on bone erosion progression during RA. METHODS: We selected 487 individuals of ESPOIR cohort who fulfilled the 2010 ACR/EULAR criteria for RA. HCMV serology for these patients was determined using Architect CMV IgG assay. Baseline and 1-year central X-ray reading using modified Total Sharp Score (mTSS), Erosion Sharp Score, and joint space narrowing Sharp score were used to quantify structural damage progression. We performed univariate and multivariate analyses to investigate the association between HCMV status and bone erosion progression. RESULTS: We analyzed 273 HCMV seropositive (HCMV+) and 214 HCMV seronegative (HCMV-) RA patients. At inclusion, HCMV+ patients were less frequently ACPA+ (49.8% versus 58.9%, p\u2009<\u20090.0465) and had a higher DAS28-ESR (5.55\u2009\u00b1\u20091.24 versus 5.20\u2009\u00b1\u20091.14, p\u2009<\u20090.0013) in comparison with HCMV-. At 1\u2009year, bone erosion progression (delta erosion Sharp score\u2009>\u20091 point) was lower in HCMV+ patients (16.1% versus 25.2%, p\u2009=\u20090.0128) in comparison with HCMV-. HCMV+ status remained independently associated with lower bone erosion progression in multivariate analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that, independently of other confounding factors, HCMV seropositivity is associated with a lower progression of bone erosion during RA. ",
        "Effect of bariatric surgery on long-term cardiovascular outcomes: a nationwide nested cohort study. AIMS: This study aims to evaluate the long-term effect of bariatric surgery on cardiovascular outcomes of patients with obesity. METHODS AND RESULTS: A nested cohort study was carried out within the Clinical Practice Research Datalink. The study cohort included the 3701 patients on the database who had undergone bariatric surgery and 3701 age, gender, and body mass index-matched controls. The primary endpoint was the composite of fatal or non-fatal myocardial infarction and fatal or non-fatal ischaemic stroke. Secondary endpoints included fatal or non-fatal myocardial infarction alone, fatal or non-fatal ischaemic stroke alone, incident heart failure, and mortality. The median follow-up achieved was 11.2\u2009years. Patients who had undergone bariatric surgery had a significantly lower occurrence of major adverse cardiovascular events [hazard ratio (HR) 0.410, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.274-0.615; P\u2009<\u20090.001]. This was mainly driven by a reduction in myocardial infarction (HR 0.412, 95% CI 0.280-0.606; P\u2009<\u20090.001) and not in acute ischaemic stroke (HR 0.536, 95% CI 0.164-1.748; P\u2009=\u20090.301). A reduction was also observed in new diagnoses of heart failure (HR 0.403, 95% CI 0.181-0.897; P\u2009=\u20090.026) and mortality (HR 0.254, 95% CI 0.183-0.353; P\u2009<\u20090.001). CONCLUSION: The results of this large, nationwide cohort study support the association of bariatric surgery with lower long-term risk of major cardiovascular events and incident heart failure in patients with obesity.

        "Pragmatic randomised controlled trial of very early etanercept and MTX versus MTX with delayed etanercept in RA: the VEDERA trial. OBJECTIVES: We sought to confirm in very early rheumatoid arthritis (ERA) a much greater superiority (30%) of first-line etanercept+methotrexate (ETN+MTX) over treat-to-target MTX (MTX-TT) than previously reported in ERA (14%); and explore whether ETN following initial MTX secures a comparable response to first-line ETN+MTX. METHODS: Pragmatic, open-label, randomised controlled trial of treatment-na\u00efve ERA (\u226412\u2009months symptom), Disease Activity Score 28 joint (DAS28)-erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) \u22653.2, rheumatoid factor (RF)+/-anticitrullinated peptide antibody (ACPA) positive or ultrasound power Doppler (PD) if RF and ACPA negative. Subjects were randomised 1:1 to ETN+MTX; or MTX-TT, escalated to ETN if week 24 DAS28-ESR \u22652.6 and intramuscular corticosteroid at protocolised time points. Primary endpoint of week 48 DAS28ESR remission with clinical and imaging secondary endpoints. RESULTS: We randomised 120 patients, 60 to each arm (71% female, 73% RF/84% ACPA positive, median (IQR) symptom duration 20.3 (13.1, 30.8) weeks; mean (SD) DAS28 5.1 (1.1)). Remission rates with ETN+MTX\u2009and MTX-TT, respectively, were 38% vs 33% at week 24; 52% vs 38% at week 48 (ORs 1.6, 95%\u2009CI 0.8 to 3.5, p=0.211). Greater, sustained DAS28-ESR remission observed with ETN+MTX\u2009versus MTX-TT (42% and 27%, respectively; p=0.035). PD was fully suppressed by week 48 in over 90% in each arm. Planned exploratory analysis revealed OR 2.84, 95%\u2009CI 0.8 to 9.6) of achieving remission after 24 weeks of ETN administered first line compared with administered post-MTX. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with remission rates typically reported with first-line tumour necrosis factor inhabitor+MTX versus MTX-TT, we did not demonstrate a larger effect in very ERA. Neither strategy conferred remission in the majority of patients although ultrasound confirmed local inflammation suppression. Poorer ETN response following failure of MTX-TT is also suggested.

        "No evidence of abnormal metabolic or inflammatory activity in the brains of patients with rheumatoid arthritis: results from a preliminary study using whole-brain magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI). INTRODUCTION/OBJECTIVES: Many individuals with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) report persistent fatigue even after management of peripheral disease activity. This study used whole-brain magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) to investigate whether abnormal inflammatory activity in the central nervous system may be associated with such symptoms. We hypothesized that RA patients would show higher brain choline (CHO), myo-inositol (MI), and lactate (LAC), and higher brain temperature than healthy controls. We further hypothesized that the metabolite levels would be positively correlated with self-reported fatigue. METHOD: Thirteen women with RA provided fatigue severity ratings and underwent whole-brain MRSI and a joint examination. Thirteen healthy controls (HC) provided comparison imaging and fatigue data. CHO, MI, LAC, and brain temperature in 47 brain regions were contrasted between groups using independent-samples t tests. Significant differences were determined using a false discovery rate (FDR)-adjusted p value threshold of \u2264\u20090.0023. Secondary analyses obtained correlations between imaging and clinical outcomes in the RA group. RESULTS: No brain metabolic differences were identified between the groups. In the RA group, fatigue severity was positively correlated with CHO in several brain regions-most strongly the right frontal lobe (rs\u2009=\u20090.823, p\u2009<\u20090.001). MI was similarly correlated with fatigue, particularly in the right calcarine fissure (rs\u2009=\u20090.829, p\u2009<\u20090.001). CHO in several regions was positively correlated with joint swelling and tenderness. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that abnormal brain metabolites are not a common feature of RA, but may been seen in patients with persistent fatigue or disease activity after conventional treatment.Key Points\u2022 Whole-brain magnetic resonance spectroscopy revealed no metabolic abnormalities in the brain in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.\u2022 Brain choline levels were correlated with fatigue severity reported by RA patients and with peripheral joint swelling and tenderness.\u2022 Brain myo-inositol levels were similarly correlated with fatigue severity in RA patients.

        "A New Equation for Calculation of Low-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol in Patients With Normolipidemia and/or Hypertriglyceridemia. Importance: Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), a key cardiovascular disease marker, is often estimated by the Friedewald or Martin equation, but calculating LDL-C is less accurate in patients with a low LDL-C level or hypertriglyceridemia (triglyceride [TG] levels \u2265400 mg/dL). Objective: To design a more accurate LDL-C equation for patients with a low LDL-C level and/or hypertriglyceridemia. Design, Setting, and Participants: Data on LDL-C levels and other lipid measures from 8656 patients seen at the National Institutes of Health Clinical Center between January 1, 1976, and June 2, 1999, were analyzed by the \u03b2-quantification reference method (18\u202f715 LDL-C test results) and were randomly divided into equally sized training and validation data sets. Using TG and non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol as independent variables, multiple least squares regression was used to develop an equation for very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, which was then used in a second equation for LDL-C. Equations were tested against the internal validation data set and multiple external data sets of either \u03b2-quantification LDL-C results (n\u2009=\u200928\u202f891) or direct LDL-C test results (n\u2009=\u2009252\u202f888). Statistical analysis was performed from August 7, 2018, to July 18, 2019. Main Outcomes and Measures: Concordance between calculated and measured LDL-C levels by \u03b2-quantification, as assessed by various measures of test accuracy (correlation coefficient [R2], root mean square error [RMSE], mean absolute difference [MAD]), and percentage of patients misclassified at LDL-C treatment thresholds of 70, 100, and 190 mg/dL. Results: Compared with \u03b2-quantification, the new equation was more accurate than other LDL-C equations (slope, 0.964; RMSE\u2009=\u200915.2 mg/dL; R2\u2009=\u20090.9648; vs Friedewald equation: slope, 1.056; RMSE\u2009=\u200932 mg/dL; R2\u2009=\u20090.8808; vs Martin equation: slope, 0.945; RMSE\u2009=\u200925.7 mg/dL; R2\u2009=\u20090.9022), particularly for patients with hypertriglyceridemia (MAD\u2009=\u200924.9 mg/dL; vs Friedewald equation: MAD\u2009=\u200956.4 mg/dL; vs Martin equation: MAD\u2009=\u200944.8 mg/dL). The new equation calculates the LDL-C level in patients with TG levels up to 800 mg/dL as accurately as the Friedewald equation does for TG levels less than 400 mg/dL and was associated with 35% fewer misclassifications when patients with hypertriglyceridemia (TG levels, 400-800 mg/dL) were categorized into different LDL-C treatment groups. Conclusions and Relevance: The new equation can be readily implemented by clinical laboratories with no additional costs compared with the standard lipid panel. It will allow for more accurate calculation of LDL-C level in patients with low LDL-C levels and/or hypertriglyceridemia (TG levels, \u2264800 mg/dL) and thus should improve the use of LDL-C level in cardiovascular disease risk management.

        "Is the epidemiology of rheumatoid arthritis changing? Results from a population-based incidence study, 1985-2014. OBJECTIVES: To examine trends in the incidence of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) from 2005 to 2014 overall and by serological status as compared with 1995-2004 and 1985-1994. METHODS: We evaluated RA incidence trends in a population-based inception cohort of individuals aged \u226518 years who first fulfilled the 1987 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria for RA between 1 January 1985 and 31 December 2014. Incidence rates were estimated and were age-adjusted and sex-adjusted to the white population in the USA in 2010. Trends in incidence were examined using Poisson regression methods. RESULTS: The 2005-2014 incidence cohort comprised 427 patients: mean age 55.4 years, 68% female, 51% rheumatoid factor (RF) positive and 50% anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibody positive. The overall age-adjusted and sex-adjusted annual RA incidence in 2005-2014 was 41/100 000 population (age-adjusted incidence: 53/100 000 in women and 29/100 000 in men). While these estimates were similar to the 1995-2004 decade, there was a decline in the incidence of RF-positive RA in 2005-2014 compared with the previous two decades (p=0.004), with a corresponding increase in RF-negative cases (p<0.001). Smoking rates declined and obesity rates increased from earlier decades to more recent years. CONCLUSIONS: Significant increase in incidence of RF-negative RA and decrease in RF-positive RA in 2005-2014 compared with previous decades was found using 1987 ACR criteria. The incidence of RA overall during this period remained similar to the previous decade. The changing prevalence of environmental factors, such as smoking, obesity and others, may have contributed to these trends. Whether these trends represent a changing serological profile of RA requires further investigation. ",
        "Risk of neuroinflammatory events in arthritis patients treated with tumour necrosis factor alpha inhibitors: a collaborative population-based cohort study from Denmark and Sweden. OBJECTIVES: To investigate whether tumour necrosis factor alpha inhibitors (TNFis) are associated with an increased risk of neuroinflammatory diseases among patients with arthritic diseases. METHODS: Cohorts of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA, n=25\u2009796), psoriatic arthritis (PsA, n=8586) and ankylosing spondylitis (AS, n=9527) who initiated a TNFi treatment year 2000-2017 were identified from nationwide clinical rheumatology registers in Sweden and Denmark. Information on demyelinating disease and inflammatory neuropathy diagnoses was retrieved from prospective linkage to National Patients Register. A Cox proportional hazard model was used to estimate HRs and 95%\u2009CI comparing TNFi exposed and non-exposed, by disease and country. RESULTS: Among 111\u2009455 patients with RA, we identified 270 (Sweden) and 51 (Denmark) events (all types of neuroinflammatory diseases combined), corresponding to crude incidence rates (per 1000 person-years) of 0.37 (Sweden) and 0.39 (Denmark) in TNFi-treated patients vs 0.39 (Sweden) and 0.28 (Denmark) in unexposed patients, and an age-sex-calendar-period-adjusted HR (95%\u2009CI) of 0.97 (0.72 to 1.33) (Sweden) and 1.45 (0.74 to 2.81) (Denmark) in TNFi exposed compared with non-exposed patients. For a total of 64\u2009065 AS/PsA patients, the corresponding numbers were: 196 and 32 events, crude incidence rates of 0.59 and 0.87 in TNFi-treated patients vs 0.40 and 0.19 in unexposed patients, and HRs of 1.50 (1.07 to 2.11) and 3.41 (1.30 to 8.96), for Sweden and Denmark, respectively. For multiple sclerosis, the patterns of HRs were similar. CONCLUSIONS: Use of TNFi in AS/PsA, but not in RA, was associated with increased risk of incident neuroinflammatory disease, though the absolute risk was below one in 1000 patients/year. ",
        "Immunosuppression and the risk of readmission and mortality in patients with rheumatoid arthritis undergoing hip fracture, abdominopelvic and cardiac surgery. OBJECTIVES: The impact of immunosuppression on postoperative outcomes has primarily been studied in patients undergoing joint replacement surgery. We aimed to evaluate the impact of biologics and glucocorticoids on outcomes after other major surgeries. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study used Medicare data 2006-2015 to identified adults with rheumatoid arthritis undergoing hip fracture repair, abdominopelvic surgery (cholecystectomy, hysterectomy, hernia, appendectomy, colectomy) or cardiac surgery (coronary artery bypass graft, mitral/aortic valve). Logistic regression with propensity-score-based inverse probability weighting compared 90-day mortality and 30-day readmission in patients receiving methotrexate (without a biologic or targeted synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (tsDMARD)), a tumour necrosis factor inhibitor (TNFi) or a non-TNFi biologic/tsDMARD <8 weeks before surgery. Similar analyses evaluated associations between glucocorticoids and outcomes. RESULTS: We identified 10\u2009777 eligible surgeries: 3585 hip fracture, 5025 abdominopelvic and 2167 cardiac surgeries. Compared with patients receiving methotrexate, there was no increase in the risk of 90-day mortality or 30-day readmission among patients receiving a TNFi (mortality adjusted OR (aOR) 0.83 (0.67 to 1.02), readmission aOR 0.86 (0.75 to 0.993)) or non-TNFi biologic/tsDMARD (mortality aOR 0.78 (0.49 to 1.22), readmission aOR 1.02 (0.78 to 1.33)). Analyses stratified by surgery category were similar. Risk of mortality and readmission was higher with 5-10\u2009mg/day of glucocorticoids (mortality aOR 1.41 (1.08 to 1.82), readmission aOR 1.26 (1.05 to 1.52)) or >10\u2009mg/day (mortality aOR 1.64 (1.02 to 2.64), readmission aOR 1.60 (1.15 to 2.24)) versus no glucocorticoids, although results varied when stratifying by surgery category. CONCLUSIONS: Recent biologic or tsDMARD use was not associated with a greater risk of mortality or readmission after hip fracture, abdominopelvic or cardiac surgery compared with methotrexate. Higher dose glucocorticoids were associated with greater risk. ",
        "Subcutaneous tanezumab for osteoarthritis of the hip or knee: efficacy and safety results from a 24-week randomised phase III study with a 24-week follow-up period. OBJECTIVE: Tanezumab, a nerve growth factor inhibitor, was investigated for osteoarthritis (OA) of the hip or knee in a study with 24-week treatment and 24-week safety follow-up. METHODS: This double-blind, randomised, phase III study enrolled adults in Europe and Japan with moderate-to-severe OA who had not responded to or could not tolerate standard-of-care analgesics. Patients were randomised to tanezumab 2.5 mg or 5\u2009mg subcutaneously or matching placebo every 8 weeks (three doses). Co-primary end points were change from baseline to week 24 in Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) Pain and Physical Function, and Patient's Global Assessment of OA (PGA-OA). Joint safety and neurological assessments continued throughout the 48-week study. RESULTS: From March 2016 to December 2017, 849 patients were randomised and evaluated (placebo n=282, tanezumab 2.5\u2009mg n=283, tanezumab 5\u2009mg n=284). At week 24, there was a statistically significant improvement from baseline for tanezumab 5\u2009mg compared with placebo for WOMAC Pain (least squares mean difference\u00b1SE -0.62\u00b10.18, p=0.0006), WOMAC Physical Function (-0.71\u00b10.17, p<0.0001) and PGA-OA (-0.19\u00b10.07, p=0.0051). For tanezumab 2.5\u2009mg, there was a statistically significant improvement in WOMAC Pain and Physical Function, but not PGA-OA. Rapidly progressive osteoarthritis (RPOA) was observed in 1.4% (4/283) and 2.8% (8/284) of patients in the tanezumab 2.5\u2009mg and tanezumab 5\u2009mg groups, respectively and none receiving placebo. Total joint replacements (TJRs) were similarly distributed across all three treatment groups (6.7%-7.8%). Tanezumab-treated patients experienced more paraesthesia (5\u2009mg) and hypoaesthesia (both doses) than placebo. CONCLUSION: Tanezumab 5\u2009mg statistically significantly improved pain, physical function and PGA-OA, but tanezumab 2.5\u2009mg only achieved two co-primary end points. RPOA occurred more frequently with tanezumab 5\u2009mg than tanezumab 2.5\u2009mg. TJRs were similarly distributed across all three groups. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT02709486. ",
        "Methotrexate effect on immunogenicity and long-term maintenance of adalimumab in axial spondyloarthritis: a multicentric randomised trial. OBJECTIVES: Anti-drug antibodies (ADA) are responsible for decreased adalimumab efficacy in axial spondyloarthritis (SpA). We aimed to evaluate the ability of methotrexate (MTX) to decrease adalimumab immunisation. METHODS: A total of 110 patients eligible to receive adalimumab 40\u2009mg subcutaneously (s.c.) every other week were randomised (1:1 ratio) to receive, 2 weeks before adalimumab (W-2) and weekly, MTX 10\u2009mg s.c. (MTX+) or not (MTX-). ADA detection and adalimumab serum concentration were assessed at weeks 4 (W4), 8 (W8), 12 (W12) and 26 (W26) after starting adalimumab (W0). The primary outcome was the proportion of patients with ADA at W26. Four years after the study completion, we retrospectively analysed adalimumab maintenance in relation with MTX co-treatment duration. RESULTS: We analysed data for 107 patients (MTX+; n=52; MTX-; n=55). ADA were detected at W26 in 39/107 (36.4%) patients: 13/52 (25%) in the MTX+ group\u2009and 26/55 (47.3%) in the MTX- group (p=0.03). Adalimumab concentration was significantly higher in the MTX+ than MTX- group at W4, W8, W12 and W26. The two groups did not differ in adverse events or efficacy. In the follow-up study, MTX co-treatment >W26 versus no MTX or \u2264W26 was significantly associated with adalimumab long-term maintenance (p=0.04). CONCLUSION: MTX reduces the immunogenicity and ameliorate the pharmacokinetics of adalimumab in axial SpA. A prolonged co-treatment of MTX>W26 seems to increase adalimumab long-term maintenance. ",
        "Does vitamin D status influence lumbar disc degeneration and low back pain in postmenopausal women? A retrospective single-center study. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship between serum vitamin D concentration and lumbar disc degeneration (LDD) in postmenopausal women and the epidemiologic factors affecting low back pain (LBP). METHODS: Between July 2017 and December 2018, 232 participants were retrospectively enrolled. Serum concentrations of bone turnover markers were measured using electrochemiluminescence assays. Disc degeneration was evaluated using the Pfirrmann grading system. Other variables were assessed using relevant questionnaires. RESULTS: The mean age of the women was 65.6\u200a\u00b1\u200a10.1 and their serum 25(OH)D concentrations were 19.38\u200a\u00b1\u200a9.21\u200ang/mL. The prevalences of severe vitamin D deficiency (<10\u200ang/mL) and normal status (>30\u200ang/mL) were 12.9% and 12.5%, respectively. The severely deficient group had higher visual analog scale (VAS) scores for LBP (P\u200a=\u200a0.002) and lower bone mineral density T scores (P\u200a=\u200a0.004) than the other groups. Lower 25(OH)D concentration (<10\u200ang/mL) was significantly associated with more severe LDD in the lumbosacral region (L4-S1, L1-S1, P\u200a<\u200a0.05), but less so in the upper lumbar region. There was an inverse relationship between vitamin D concentration and the severity of disc degeneration (L2-L3, L4-S1, L1-S1, P\u200a<\u200a0.05). After adjustment for confounding factors, smoking, vitamin D deficiency, lack of vitamin D supplementation, high body mass index, and low bone mineral density T score were associated with higher incidence of moderate-to-severe pain in postmenopausal women (P\u200a<\u200a0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Vitamin D deficiency is associated with LDD and LBP in postmenopausal women. Specifically, a serum vitamin D concentration\u200a<\u200a10\u200ang/mL is a marker of severe LDD and LBP. Smoking, severe vitamin D deficiency, lack of vitamin D supplementation, high body mass index, and osteoporosis are associated with a higher prevalence of moderate-to-severe pain. ",
        "Hypersensitivity reactions with allopurinol and febuxostat: a study using the Medicare claims data. OBJECTIVE: To assess the risk of hypersensitivity reactions (HSRs) with allopurinol and febuxostat in a population-based study. METHODS: We used the 5% Medicare beneficiary sample (\u226565 years) from 2006 to 2012 to identify people with a newly filled prescription for allopurinol, febuxostat or colchicine. We used multivariable-adjusted Cox regression analyses to compare the hazard ratio (HR) of incident HSRs with allopurinol or febuxostat use versus colchicine use; separate analyses were done in people exposed to allopurinol. Propensity-matched analyses (5:1) compared hazards with allopurinol versus febuxostat. RESULTS: Crude incidence rates of HSRs were as follows: allopurinol, 23.7; febuxostat, 30.7; and colchicine, 25.6 per 1000 person-years. Compared with colchicine, allopurinol, febuxostat and febuxostat+colchicine were associated with significantly higher HRs of HSRs, 1.32 (95% CI: 1.10 to 1.60) and 1.54 (95% CI: 1.12 to 2.12) and 2.17 (95% CI: 1.18 to 3.99), respectively. In propensity-matched analyses, febuxostat did not significantly differ from allopurinol; HR for HSRs was 1.25 (95% CI: 0.93 to 1.67). Compared with allopurinol start dose <200\u2009mg/day, allopurinol start dose \u2265300\u2009mg/day, diabetes and female sex were associated with significantly higher hazard of HSRs, 1.27 (95% CI: 1.12 to 1.44), 1.21 (95% CI: 1.00 to 1.45) and 1.32 (95% CI: 1.17 to 1.48), respectively. The majority (69%) of HSRs occurred in the outpatient setting. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with colchicine, allopurinol and febuxostat similarly increased the risk of HSRs. Allopurinol and febuxostat did not differ from each other. In allopurinol users, starting dose, female sex and diabetes increased this risk, findings that need further study. ",
        "Plasma Exchange and Glucocorticoids in Severe ANCA-Associated Vasculitis. BACKGROUND: More effective and safer treatments are needed for antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis. METHODS: We conducted a randomized trial with a 2-by-2 factorial design to evaluate the use of plasma exchange and two regimens of oral glucocorticoids in patients with severe ANCA-associated vasculitis (defined by an estimated glomerular filtration rate of <50 ml per minute per 1.73 m2 of body-surface area or diffuse pulmonary hemorrhage). Patients were randomly assigned to undergo plasma exchange (seven plasma exchanges within 14 days after randomization) or no plasma exchange (control group). Patients were also randomly assigned to follow either a standard-dose regimen or a reduced-dose regimen of oral glucocorticoids. Patients were followed for up to 7 years for the primary composite outcome of death from any cause or end-stage kidney disease (ESKD). RESULTS: Death from any cause or ESKD occurred in 100 of 352 patients (28.4%) in the plasma-exchange group and in 109 of 352 patients (31.0%) in the control group (hazard ratio, 0.86; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.65 to 1.13; P\u2009=\u20090.27). The results were similar in subgroup analyses and in analyses of secondary outcomes. We also assessed the noninferiority of a reduced-dose regimen of glucocorticoids to a standard-dose regimen, using a noninferiority margin of 11 percentage points. Death from any cause or ESKD occurred in 92 of 330 patients (27.9%) in the reduced-dose group and in 83 of 325 patients (25.5%) in the standard-dose group (absolute risk difference, 2.3 percentage points; 90% CI, -3.4 to 8.0), which met the criterion for noninferiority. Serious infections at 1 year were less common in the reduced-dose group than in the standard-dose group (incidence rate ratio, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.52 to 0.93), but other secondary outcomes were similar in the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with severe ANCA-associated vasculitis, the use of plasma exchange did not reduce the incidence of death or ESKD. A reduced-dose regimen of glucocorticoids was noninferior to a standard-dose regimen with respect to death or ESKD.

        "Adverse events during oral colchicine use: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials. BACKGROUND: Colchicine is a widely used drug to treat inflammatory diseases. Due to its long historical use in medicine, controlled clinical trials have been small and there remains some caution with the use of this drug in patients with co-morbidities. The aim of the study is to systematically examine the side effect profile of colchicine in controlled clinical trials across all published indications. METHODS: A systematic review was conducted in accordance with PRISMA methodology. The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE and EMBASE were searched for double-blind controlled trials of oral colchicine in adult patients that reported adverse event data. Meta-analyses were used to determine the relative risk (RR) of adverse events in colchicine users compared to comparator groups. RESULTS: A total of 4915 studies were initially identified and after exclusions, 35 randomised controlled trials with placebo (n\u00a0=\u200935) or active comparators (n\u00a0=\u20095) were included. The most common diseases studied were gout, liver cirrhosis and pericarditis. There were a total of 8659 pooled participants, 4225 participants were randomised to receive colchicine, 3956 to placebo and 411 to an active comparator. Diarrhoea was reported in 17.9% of colchicine users versus 13.1% in comparator groups (RR 2.4, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.6, 3.7). Any gastrointestinal event was reported in 17.6% of colchicine users and 13.1% of comparators (RR 1.7, 95% CI 1.3, 2.3). Adverse liver events were reported in 1.9% of colchicine users versus 1.1% in the comparator groups (RR 1.6, 95% CI 0.9, 3.0). Muscle events were reported in 4.2% of colchicine users and 3.3% in the comparator groups (RR 1.3, 95% CI 0.8, 1.9). Haematology events were reported in 0.6% of colchicine users and 0.4% of comparator groups (RR 1.34 (0.64, 2.82). No study reported neuropathy events. Other sensory events were reported in 1.1% of colchicine users and 1.5% of comparator groups (RR 1.4, 95% CI 0.3, 6.7). Infectious events were reported in 0.4% of colchicine users and 2.1% of comparator groups (RR 1.0, 95% CI 0.7, 1.5). No study reported death as an adverse event. CONCLUSION: Colchicine increases the rate of diarrhoea and gastrointestinal adverse events but does not increase the rate of liver, sensory, muscle, infectious or haematology adverse events or death.

        "Association between serum level of urate and subclinical atherosclerosis: results from the SCAPIS Pilot. BACKGROUND: Hyperuricemia is closely associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD). However, it has not been definitively established whether this association is independent of traditional cardiovascular risk factors (CVRFs) and whether it is gender-dependent. The aim of this study was to investigate in a population-based cohort (age range, 50-64\u2009years) stratified by sex the association between the serum urate (SU) concentration and subclinical atherosclerosis, as reflected in the coronary artery calcification (CAC) score, common carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT), and carotid plaque score. METHODS: The study involved participants in the Swedish CArdioPulmonary bioImage Study (SCAPIS) Pilot cohort (N\u2009=\u20091040; 48.8% males). This pilot cohort is part of the large population-based SCAPIS with 30,000 participants in the age range of 50-64\u2009years, aimed at improving risk prediction for CVD. Subjects with a self-reported previous history of CVD (N\u2009=\u200968) or gout (N\u2009=\u20093) were excluded. The CAC score was assessed with the Agatston method using computed tomography. CIMT and carotid plaques were quantified by ultrasound. The associations between the SU quartiles and different levels of CAC, CIMT, and carotid plaques were assessed by multivariable logistic regression. RESULTS: Age, BMI, education level, smoking, physical activity, hs-CRP, hypertension, and dyslipidemia showed no differences between males and females, while CAC (score >\u20090) and diabetes were both twice as common in men than in women (58% vs 26% and 8% vs 4%, respectively). Higher SU quartiles were in both sexes associated with BMI, hs-CRP, and the prevalence of hypertension, and in women, they were also associated with the prevalence of dyslipidemia. The three upper quartiles of SU (>308\u03bcmol/L) were linked to higher CAC scores in men, when adjusting for CVRFs, but not in women. CIMT and carotid plaques showed no correlation to SU in either sex. CONCLUSIONS: Higher levels of SU are associated with the presence of CAC in men but not in women, whereas SU is not associated with CIMT or carotid plaques in either men or women. This implies that the biological effects of SU differ in men and women or that SU has varying effects on different vascular beds or during the different stages of the atherosclerotic process. ",
        "Substantial undocumented infection facilitates the rapid dissemination of novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). Estimation of the prevalence and contagiousness of undocumented novel coronavirus [severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)] infections is critical for understanding the overall prevalence and pandemic potential of this disease. Here, we use observations of reported infection within China, in conjunction with mobility data, a networked dynamic metapopulation model, and Bayesian inference, to infer critical epidemiological characteristics associated with SARS-CoV-2, including the fraction of undocumented infections and their contagiousness. We estimate that 86% of all infections were undocumented [95% credible interval (CI): 82-90%] before the 23 January 2020 travel restrictions. The transmission rate of undocumented infections per person was 55% the transmission rate of documented infections (95% CI: 46-62%), yet, because of their greater numbers, undocumented infections were the source of 79% of the documented cases. These findings explain the rapid geographic spread of SARS-CoV-2 and indicate that containment of this virus will be particularly challenging. ",
        "Seasonal effect on fatigue, pain and dryness in primary Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome. BACKGROUND: To assess the presence of a seasonal effect on fatigue, pain and dryness in primary Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome (pSS). METHODS: Data (date; visual analogue scales (VAS) for pain, fatigue and dryness) were extracted from three randomised placebo-controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating infliximab (TRIPSS; n\u2009=\u2009103 patients), hydroxychloroquine (JOQUER; n\u2009=\u2009120 patients) and rituximab (TEARS; n\u2009=\u2009120 patients) and from the 5-year follow-up of the ASSESS prospective cohort (n\u2009=\u2009395 patients). Data were analysed at each visit for each patient, according to the day, the month of the year and the season. Linear mixed models were used to take into account the repeated structure of the data and to analyse a potential cyclic effect. RESULTS: A total of 744, 584, 848 and 682 pain, fatigue and dryness VASs were collected on 632 subjects in spring, summer, fall and winter, respectively. No significant difference was observed in pain, fatigue and dryness, according to the month of the year or the season (all p values >\u20090.05). CONCLUSION: In pSS, seasonality does not affect patient-reported outcomes (PROs) on fatigue, pain and dryness. ",
        "Clinical Effectiveness and Safety of Aspirin for Venous Thromboembolism Prophylaxis After Total Hip and Knee Replacement: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of Randomized Clinical Trials. Importance: Patients undergoing total hip replacement (THR) and total knee replacement (TKR) receive venous thromboembolism (VTE) pharmacoprophylaxis. It is unclear which anticoagulant is preferable. Observational data suggest aspirin provides effective VTE prophylaxis. Objective: To assess the effectiveness and safety of aspirin for VTE prophylaxis after THR and TKR. Data Sources: A systematic review and meta-analysis was performed of randomized clinical trials (RCTs), with no language restrictions, from inception to September 19, 2019, using MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and bibliographic searches. The computer-based searches combined terms and combinations of keywords related to the population (eg, hip replacement, knee replacement, hip arthroplasty, and knee arthroplasty), drug intervention (eg, aspirin, heparin, clexane, dabigatran, rivaroxaban, and warfarin), and outcome (eg, venous thromboembolism, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and bleeding) in humans. Study Selection: This study included RCTs assessing the effectiveness and safety of aspirin for VTE prophylaxis compared with other anticoagulants in adults undergoing THR and TKR. The RCTs with a placebo control group were excluded. The searches and study selection were independently performed. Data Extraction and Synthesis: This study followed PRISMA recommendations and used the Cochrane Collaboration's risk of bias tool. Data were screened and extracted independently by both reviewers. Study-specific relative risks (RRs) were aggregated using random-effects models. Quality of evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was any postoperative VTE (asymptomatic or symptomatic). Secondary outcomes were adverse events associated with therapy, including bleeding. Results: Of 437 identified articles, 13 RCTs were included (6060 participants; 3466 [57.2%] women; mean age, 63.0 years). The RR of VTE after THR and TKR was 1.12 (95% CI, 0.78-1.62) for aspirin compared with other anticoagulants. Comparable findings were observed for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) (RR, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.72-1.51) and pulmonary embolism (PE) (RR, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.68-1.48). The risk of adverse events, including major bleeding, wound hematoma, and wound infection, was not statistically significantly different in patients receiving aspirin vs other anticoagulants. When analyzing THRs and TKRs separately, there was no statistically significant difference in the risk of VTE, DVT, and PE between aspirin and other anticoagulants. Aspirin had a VTE risk not statistically significantly different from low-molecular-weight heparin (RR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.37-1.56) or rivaroxaban (RR, 1.52; 95% CI, 0.56-4.12). The quality of the evidence ranged from low to high. Conclusions and Relevance: In terms of clinical effectiveness and safety profile, aspirin did not differ statistically significantly from other anticoagulants used for VTE prophylaxis after THR and TKR. Future trials should focus on noninferiority analysis of aspirin compared with alternative anticoagulants and cost-effectiveness. ",
        "Impact of fatigue on health-related quality of life and illness perception in a monocentric cohort of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus. BACKGROUND: Fatigue is a very common and debilitating symptom in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), even among those with a mild or inactive disease. The objective of this study is to define fatigue determinants and describe the impact of fatigue on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and illness perception in a monocentric cohort of patients with SLE. METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study. Adult patients with SLE were included. For each patient, demographics, medications, comorbidities, organ damage (Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics Damage Index), active disease manifestations and Systemic Lupus Disease Activity Index scores were collected. It was evaluated if each patient met the definitions of remission and low disease activity. At enrolment, each patient completed the Short Form-36 (SF-36), Functional Assessment Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue (FACIT-F), Lupus Impact Tracker (LIT), Systemic Lupus Activity Questionnaire (SLAQ) and Brief Index of Lupus Damage (BILD). The FACIT-F questionnaire was also administered to a group of healthy controls. RESULTS: 223 patients were included (mean age 44.9\u00b113.2 years, median disease duration 13 years). 18.2% had an active disease, 43.5% met the definition of remission on treatment, and 11.8% had a concomitant fibromyalgia. The median FACIT-F score of our cohort was significantly lower compared with that of healthy controls (40 vs 47; p<0.001). FACIT-F scores were irrespective of age, disease duration, disease activity and damage. FACIT-F score was significantly lower in patients with fibromyalgia (p<0.01). FACIT-F scores demonstrated a significant correlation with all other patient-reported outcomes: SF-36 (r=0.53-0.77), LIT (r=-0.78), SLAQ (r=-0.72) and BILD (r=-0.28). CONCLUSIONS: Fatigue in patients with SLE has a strong negative impact on HRQoL and patient perception of the disease burden. Fatigue seems irrespective of disease activity but significantly influenced by the presence of fibromyalgia. ",
        "Impact of the new American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association definition of hypertension on atherosclerotic vascular events in systemic lupus erythematosus. BACKGROUND: The 2017 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines defined hypertension at \u2265130/80\u2009mm Hg. Studies on patients with connective tissue diseases were not considered. Our aim was to assess the impact of this definition on atherosclerotic vascular events (AVEs) in systemic lupus erythematosus. PATIENTS METHODS: Individuals from the Toronto Lupus Clinic with at least 2\u2009years of follow-up and no prior AVE were divided in three groups according to their mean blood pressure (BP) over that period (\u2265140/90\u2009mm Hg, 130-139/80-89 mm Hg and <130/80\u2009mm Hg). They were followed until the first occurrence of an AVE (fatal or non-fatal coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular event and peripheral vascular disease) or last visit. Groups were compared as per the baseline atherosclerotic risk factors. A multivariable time-dependent analysis was performed to adjust for the presence of other risk factors. RESULTS: Of 1532 patients satisfying the inclusion criteria, 155 (10.1%) had a BP \u2265140/90\u2009mm Hg, 316 (20.6%) 130-139/80-89 mm Hg and 1061 (69.3%) were normotensives. After a mean follow-up of 10.8 years, 124 AVEs were documented. The incidence rates were 18.9, 11.5 and 4.5 per 1000 patient-years for the three groups, respectively (p=0.0007 between the 130-139/80-89 mm Hg group and the normotensives). A mean BP of 130-139/80-89 mm Hg over the first 2\u2009years was independently associated with the occurrence of AVEs (HR 1.73, 95% CI 1.13 to 2.65, p=0.011). CONCLUSION: Patients with lupus with a sustained mean BP of 130-139/80-89 mm Hg over 2\u2009years had a significantly higher incidence of AVEs compared with normotensive individuals. This BP level should be the target for antihypertensive therapy to minimise their cardiovascular risk. ",
        "Utility of the AVISE Connective Tissue Disease test in predicting lupus diagnosis and progression. Background: The AVISE Connective Tissue Disease (CTD) test uses autoantibody, erythrocyte-bound C4d (EC4d) and B-cell-bound C4d (BC4d) levels to aid in diagnoses of SLE, other CTDs and fibromyalgia. We evaluated the utility of the AVISE CTD test in predicting SLE disease development and damage progression. Methods: Patients who had undergone AVISE CTD testing were assessed for SLE diagnosis by the Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics (SLICC) and American College of Rheumatology criteria and for SLE damage by the Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics Damage Index (SDI) at the time of AVISE testing (t=0) and 2\u2009years later (t=2). Results: Among 117 patients without a previous diagnosis of SLE, 65% of patients who tested positive developed SLE at t=2, compared with 10.3% of patients who tested non-positive (p<0.0001). AVISE-positive patients fulfilled significantly more SLICC diagnostic criteria than AVISE-non-positive patients at both t=0 (3.8\u00b12.1 vs 1.9\u00b11.1, p=0.001) and t=2 (4.5\u00b12.2 vs 2.1\u00b11.2, p<0.0001). AVISE-positive patients also had had significantly higher SDI at t=2 (1.9\u00b11.3 vs 1.03\u00b11.3, p=0.01). BC4d levels correlated with the number of SLICC criteria at t=0 (r=0.33, p<0.0001) and t=2 (r=0.34, p<0.0001), as well as SDI at t=0 (r=0.25, p=0.003) and t=2 (r=0.26, p=0.002). Conclusions: The AVISE CTD test can aid in SLE evaluation by predicting SLE disease development and future damage progression. ",
        "Assessment of 3-Dimensional vs 2-Dimensional Imaging and Technical Performance Using a Multiport Intraoperative Data Capture and Analytic System for Patients Undergoing Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass Surgery. Importance: Errors and adverse events occur frequently in health care. Three-dimensional (3-D) laparoscopic systems claim to provide more realistic depth perception and better spatial orientation compared with their 2-D counterparts. Objective: To compare the association of 3-D vs 2-D systems with technical performance during laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB) procedures using a multiport intraoperative data capture system. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study was performed between May and December 2018, with a total of 50 LRYGB procedures performed in an academic tertiary care center; recordings of the operations were evaluated with a 30-day follow-up. All procedures were performed by the same surgical team. Exposure: Surgical teams used 2-D or 3-D laparoscopic systems. Main Outcomes and Measures: Technical performance was evaluated using the Objective Structured Assessment of Technical Skill and surgical errors and events using the Generic Error Rating Tool. Results: Of the 50 patients who underwent LRYGB procedures, 42 (86%) were women, with a median (interquartile range) age of 42 (35-47) years and a median (interquartile range) body mass index of 46 (42-48), with no significant demographic differences between the groups whose operations were performed using the 2-D and 3-D systems. The mean (SD) number of errors per case was significantly lower in procedures using the 3-D laparoscopic system than in those using the 2-D system (17 [6] vs 33 [2]; P\u2009<\u2009.001). The mean (SD) number of error-related events was significantly lower in procedures using the 3-D system than in those using the 2-D system (6 [2] vs 11 [4]; P\u2009<\u2009.001). Mean (SD) Objective Structured Assessment of Technical Skill scores were significantly higher when the 3-D system was used than when the 2-D system was used (28 [4] vs 22 [3]; P\u2009<\u2009.001). Conclusions and Relevance: In this limited sample of LRYGB procedures, the use of a 3-D laparoscopic system was associated with a statistically significant reduction in errors and events as well as higher Objective Structured Assessment of Technical Skill scores compared with 2-D systems.

        "Association of Surgical Jacket and Bouffant Use With Surgical Site Infection Risk. Importance: Surgical site infections (SSIs) are associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Various measures have been enacted decrease the occurrence of SSIs involving the regulation of the attire worn by the operating room staff, at times without sufficient peer-reviewed literature to support their implementation. Objective: To evaluate whether the combination of mandated surgical jackets and bouffants in the operating room is associated with the risk of surgical site infection. Design, Setting, and Participants: A retrospective cohort study of 34\u202f042 inpatient surgical encounters at a large academic tertiary care hospital was performed. Three periods between January 2017 and October 2018 were compared, corresponding with implementation of surgical jackets and the subsequent mandate of surgical jackets plus bouffant head covers. All inpatient surgical cases were included from University of Alabama at Birmingham University Hospital, a single-center, large academic tertiary care hospital. The study comprised a consecutive sample of all inpatient surgical cases over a 22-month period. Exposures: No surgical jackets or bouffants mandated (8 months), surgical jackets mandated (6 months), both surgical jackets and bouffants mandated (8 months). Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary study outcome was SSIs, which were collected from institutional infection control monthly summary reports, according to the National Healthcare Safety Network definitions for superficial incisional, deep incisional, and organ/space SSIs. Secondary outcomes included wound dehiscence, postoperative sepsis, death, and cost of interventions. Results: A total of 34\u202f042 inpatient surgical encounters cases were included in the analysis over the 22-month study period. Of the total patients, 16\u202f380 were women (48%) and 17\u202f638 were men (52%). There was no significant difference in the risk of SSI (1.01% vs 0.99% vs 0.83%; P\u2009=\u2009.28), mortality (1.83% vs 2.05% vs 1.92%; P\u2009=\u2009.54), postoperative sepsis (6.60% vs 6.24% vs 6.54%; P\u2009=\u2009.54), or wound dehiscence (1.07% vs 0.84% vs 1.06%; P\u2009=\u2009.20) between the 3 groups. Receipts from the first 6 months of the 2018/2019 fiscal year provided an estimated expenditure of more than $300\u202f000 annually on surgical jackets. Bouffants were found to be less expensive than surgical skull caps. Conclusions and Relevance: The results of this study suggest that surgical jackets and bouffants are neither beneficial nor cost-effective in preventing SSIs. Institutions should evaluate their own data to determine whether recommendations by outside governing organizations are beneficial and cost-effective. ",
        "Surgery versus Conservative Care for Persistent Sciatica Lasting 4 to 12 Months. BACKGROUND: The treatment of chronic sciatica caused by herniation of a lumbar disk has not been well studied in comparison with acute disk herniation. Data are needed on whether diskectomy or a conservative approach is better for sciatica that has persisted for several months. METHODS: In a single-center trial, we randomly assigned patients with sciatica that had lasted for 4 to 12 months and lumbar disk herniation at the L4-L5 or L5-S1 level in a 1:1 ratio to undergo microdiskectomy or to receive 6 months of standardized nonoperative care followed by surgery if needed. Surgery was performed by spine surgeons who used conventional microdiskectomy techniques. The primary outcome was the intensity of leg pain on a visual analogue scale (ranging from 0 to 10, with higher scores indicating more severe pain) at 6 months after enrollment. Secondary outcomes were the score on the Oswestry Disability Index, back and leg pain, and quality-of-life scores at 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year. RESULTS: From 2010 through 2016, a total of 790 patients were screened; of those patients, 128 were enrolled, with 64 in each group. Among the patients assigned to undergo surgery, the median time from randomization to surgery was 3.1 weeks; of the 64 patients in the nonsurgical group, 22 (34%) crossed over to undergo surgery at a median of 11 months after enrollment. At baseline, the mean score for leg-pain intensity was 7.7 in the surgical group and 8.0 in the nonsurgical group. The primary outcome of the leg-pain intensity score at 6 months was 2.8 in the surgical group and 5.2 in the nonsurgical group (adjusted mean difference, 2.4; 95% confidence interval, 1.4 to 3.4; P<0.001). Secondary outcomes including the score on the Owestry Disability Index and pain at 12 months were in the same direction as the primary outcome. Nine patients had adverse events associated with surgery, and one patient underwent repeat surgery for recurrent disk herniation. CONCLUSIONS: In this single-center trial involving patients with sciatica lasting more than 4 months and caused by lumbar disk herniation, microdiskectomy was superior to nonsurgical care with respect to pain intensity at 6 months of follow-up.

        "The Nonsurgical Rhinoplasty: A Retrospective Review of 5000 Treatments. BACKGROUND: Nonsurgical rhinoplasty with injectable dermal fillers has become an increasingly popular alternative to surgical procedures, in view of its relative low cost, convenience and rapid recovery, and low risk profile. The safety and efficacy of nonsurgical rhinoplasty remains a relatively contentious and ambiguous matter, given that there are few large-scale series reporting results or complications. This study reports the experience of a single clinician performing nonsurgical rhinoplasty in the largest cohort to date. METHODS: Patient demographics, indications, treatment details, and outcomes of patients treated between March of 2016 and January of 2019 were reviewed. The nonsurgical rhinoplasty technique described previously by Harb was used using hyaluronic acid dermal filler. RESULTS: Nonsurgical rhinoplasty was performed in 5000 patients. The commonest indication was dorsal hump (44 percent). Swelling and erythema were self-limiting side effects encountered in approximately half of patients. Infection was seen in two patients, and localized skin necrosis was observed in three patients. CONCLUSIONS: Nonsurgical rhinoplasty is a safe procedure with positive aesthetic results when performed by an experienced clinician. Knowledge of nasal anatomy, comprehensive training, and use of appropriate materials are key in ensuring safety and results. CLINICAL QUESTION/LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic, IV. ",
        "Effectiveness and Safety of Apixaban Compared With Rivaroxaban for Patients With Atrial Fibrillation in Routine Practice: A Cohort Study. Background: Apixaban and rivaroxaban are the most commonly prescribed direct oral anticoagulants for adults with atrial fibrillation, but head-to-head data comparing their safety and effectiveness are lacking. Objective: To compare the safety and effectiveness of apixaban versus rivaroxaban for patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation. Design: New-user, active-comparator, retrospective cohort study. Setting: A U.S. nationwide commercial health care claims database from 28 December 2012 to 1 January 2019. Patients: Adults newly prescribed apixaban (n\u00a0= 59\u00a0172) or rivaroxaban (n\u00a0= 40\u00a0706). Measurements: The primary effectiveness outcome was a composite of ischemic stroke or systemic embolism. The primary safety outcome was a composite of intracranial hemorrhage or gastrointestinal bleeding. Results: 39\u00a0351 patients newly prescribed apixaban were propensity score matched to 39\u00a0351 patients newly prescribed rivaroxaban. Mean age was 69 years, 40% of patients were women, and mean follow-up was 288 days for new apixaban users and 291 days for new rivaroxaban users. The incidence rate of ischemic stroke or systemic embolism was 6.6 per 1000 person-years for adults prescribed apixaban compared with 8.0 per 1000 person-years for those prescribed rivaroxaban (hazard ratio [HR], 0.82 [95% CI, 0.68 to 0.98]; rate difference, 1.4 fewer events per 1000 person-years [CI, 0.0 to 2.7]). Adults prescribed apixaban also had a lower rate of gastrointestinal bleeding or intracranial hemorrhage (12.9 per 1000 person-years) compared with those prescribed rivaroxaban (21.9 per 1000 person-years), corresponding to an HR of 0.58 (CI, 0.52 to 0.66) and a rate difference of 9.0 fewer events per 1000 person-years (CI, 6.9 to 11.1). Limitation: Unmeasured confounding, incomplete laboratory data. Conclusion: In routine care, adults with atrial fibrillation prescribed apixaban had a lower rate of both ischemic stroke or systemic embolism and bleeding compared with those prescribed rivaroxaban.

        "Prevalence and Severity of Sesame Allergy in the United States. Importance: Sesame allergy is of growing concern in the United States. The US Food and Drug Administration recently issued a request for epidemiological data on the prevalence and severity of sesame allergies in the United States to inform possible regulatory action requiring sesame to be labeled as an allergen on packaged foods. Objective: To provide current estimates of the prevalence, severity, distribution, and clinical characteristics of sesame allergy in the United States. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cross-sectional study assessed findings of web- and telephone-based food allergy questionnaires. Study participants were first recruited from NORC (National Opinion Research Center) at the University of Chicago's probability-based AmeriSpeak panel, and additional participants were recruited through Survey Sampling International. Surveys were administered to a nationally representative sample of 51\u202f819 US households from October 1, 2015, through September 31, 2016. Responses for 40\u202f453 adults and 38\u202f408 children were included in the analysis. Data were analyzed from January 1, 2017, through May 1, 2019. Exposures: Demographic and allergic characteristics of participants. Main Outcomes and Measures: Self-reported sesame allergy was the main outcome and was considered convincing if reported symptoms to sesame-allergic reactions were consistent with an IgE-mediated reaction. Diagnostic history of specific allergens and use of food allergy-related health care services were also primary outcomes. Results: Using survey responses from 78 851 individuals, an estimated 0.49% (95% CI, 0.40%-0.58%) of the US population reported a current sesame allergy, whereas 0.23% (95% CI, 0.19%-0.28%) met symptom-report criteria for convincing IgE-mediated allergy. An additional 0.11% (95% CI, 0.08%-0.16%) had a sesame allergy reported as physician diagnosed but did not report reactions fulfilling survey-specified convincing reaction symptoms. Among individuals with convincing IgE-mediated sesame allergy, an estimated 23.6% (95% CI, 16.9%-32.0%) to 37.2% (95% CI, 29.2%-45.9%) had previously experienced a severe sesame-allergic reaction, depending on the definition used, and 81.6% (95% CI, 71.0%-88.9%) of patients with convincing sesame allergy had at least 1 additional convincing food allergy. Roughly one-third of patients with convincing sesame allergy (33.7%; 95% CI, 26.3%-42.0%) reported previous epinephrine use for sesame allergy treatment. Conclusions and Relevance: These data indicate a substantial burden of sesame allergy and provide valuable context to physicians and policy makers in their efforts to evaluate and reduce the public health burden of sesame allergy. Moreover, the relatively low rates of physician diagnosis observed among individuals with convincing IgE-mediated sesame allergy seem to indicate the need for clear diagnosis and appropriate management.

Search terms were psoriasis and sexual or sexual dysfunction, and the search was limited to epidemiologic studies published in English answering any of the 4 research questions. Quality was assessed according to the Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine. Findings: Twenty-eight studies representing 52 520 cases of psoriasis and 1 806 022 controls were included for review. Of the 28 studies, 19 were cross-sectional, 3 were clinical trials, 3 were quasi-experimental, 2 were population-based cohort, and 1 was population-based case-control. Prevalence of SD and ED ranged from 40.0% to 55.6% and 34.2% to 81.1%, respectively. Two of 2 studies observed an association between psoriasis and SD after adjusting for physical and psychological comorbidities. Five of 8 studies observed an independent association between ED and psoriasis. Among patients with psoriasis, the features that showed the strongest association with SD were anxiety and depression (5 of 5 studies), psoriatic arthritis (3 of 4 studies), and genital psoriasis (5 of 7 studies). Regarding ED, anxiety and depression (2 of 2 studies) and increasing age (3 of 3 studies) showed the strongest association. All 3 clinical trials using biologic drugs showed an improvement in SD compared with placebo. Conclusions and Relevance: Patients with psoriasis have physical and psychological comorbidities that have been associated with a higher risk of SD. In addition, psoriasis may play a role in its development. The presence of anxiety, depression, psoriatic arthritis, genital lesions, and increasing age should raise the awareness of SD. Biologic drugs have demonstrated the improvement of SD in patients with psoriasis. ",
        "Neural-Tube Defects and Antiretroviral Treatment Regimens in Botswana. BACKGROUND: A preliminary safety signal for neural-tube defects was previously reported in association with dolutegravir exposure from the time of conception, which has affected choices of antiretroviral treatment (ART) for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected women of reproductive potential. The signal can now be evaluated with data from follow-up of additional pregnancies. METHODS: We conducted birth-outcomes surveillance at hospitals throughout Botswana, expanding from 8 to 18 sites in 2018. Trained midwives performed surface examinations of all live-born and stillborn infants. Research assistants photographed abnormalities after maternal consent was obtained. The prevalence of neural-tube defects and major external structural defects according to maternal HIV infection and ART exposure status was determined. In the primary analyses, we used the Newcombe method to evaluate differences in prevalence with 95% confidence intervals. RESULTS: From August 2014 through March 2019, surveillance captured 119,477 deliveries; 119,033 (99.6%) had an infant surface examination that could be evaluated, and 98 neural-tube defects were identified (0.08% of deliveries). Among 1683 deliveries in which the mother was taking dolutegravir at conception, 5 neural-tube defects were found (0.30% of deliveries); the defects included two instances of myelomeningocele, one of anencephaly, one of encephalocele, and one of iniencephaly. In comparison, 15 neural-tube defects were found among 14,792 deliveries (0.10%) in which the mother was taking any non-dolutegravir ART at conception, 3 among 7959 (0.04%) in which the mother was taking efavirenz at conception, 1 among 3840 (0.03%) in which the mother started dolutegravir treatment during pregnancy, and 70 among 89,372 (0.08%) in HIV-uninfected mothers. The prevalence of neural-tube defects was higher in association with dolutegravir treatment at conception than with non-dolutegravir ART at conception (difference, 0.20 percentage points; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.01 to 0.59) or with other types of ART exposure. Major external structural defects were found in 0.95% of deliveries among women exposed to dolutegravir at conception and 0.68% of those among women exposed to non-dolutegravir ART at conception (difference, 0.27 percentage points; 95% CI, -0.13 to 0.87). CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of neural-tube defects was slightly higher in association with dolutegravir exposure at conception than with other types of ART exposure at conception (3 per 1000 deliveries vs. 1 per 1000 deliveries).

        "Pioglitazone Therapy in Patients With Stroke and Prediabetes: A Post Hoc Analysis of the IRIS Randomized Clinical Trial. Importance: In the Insulin Resistance Intervention After Stroke (IRIS) randomized clinical trial, pioglitazone, an insulin-sensitizing agent, reduced the risk for recurrent stroke or myocardial infarction (MI) among patients with insulin resistance. However, insulin resistance is not commonly measured in clinical practice. Objective: To analyze the effects of pioglitazone in patients with good adherence as well as intention-to-treat effects of pioglitazone in patients with prediabetes in the IRIS trial. Design, Setting, and Participants: The IRIS trial was a randomized multicenter clinical trial in patients with prior stroke or transient ischemic attack as well as insulin resistance but not diabetes. Patients were enrolled from February 2005 to January 2013, and the median follow-up was 4.8 years. The post hoc analyses reported here were performed from June to September 2018. Per American Diabetes Association criteria, prediabetes was defined as having a hemoglobin A1c level of 5.7% to 6.4% or fasting plasma glucose level of 100 mg/dL to 125 mg/dL (to convert to mmol/L, multiply by 0.0555). Good adherence was defined as taking 80% or more of the protocol dose. Fasting glucose and hemoglobin A1c, used to define prediabetes, and adherence of 80% or higher, stipulated in the protocol as defining good adherence, were prespecified subgroups in the analysis plan. Interventions: Participants were randomized to 15 mg of pioglitazone, with dose titrated to target of 45 mg daily, or matching placebo. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was recurrent stroke or MI. Secondary outcomes included stroke, acute coronary syndrome, stroke/MI/hospitalization for heart failure, and progression to diabetes. Results: Among 3876 participants analyzed in the IRIS trial, 2885 were included in this analysis (1456 in the pioglitazone cohort and 1429 in the placebo cohort). The mean (SD) age of patients was 64 (11) years, and 974 (66.9%) and 908 (63.5%) of patients were men in the pioglitazone and placebo cohort, respectively. In the prediabetic population with good adherence (644 of 1456 individuals [44.2%] in the pioglitazone group and 810 of 1429 [56.7%] in the placebo group), the hazard ratios (95% CI) were 0.57 (0.39-0.84) for stroke/MI, 0.64 (0.42-0.99) for stroke, 0.47 (0.26-0.85) for acute coronary syndrome, 0.61 (0.42-0.88) for stroke/MI/hospitalization for heart failure, and 0.18 (0.10-0.33) for progression to diabetes. There was a nonsignificant reduction in overall mortality, cancer, and hospitalization, a slight increase in serious bone fractures, and an increase in weight gain and edema. Intention-to-treat results also showed significant reduction of events but to a lesser degree. Hazard ratios (95% CI) were 0.70 (0.56-0.88) for stroke/MI, 0.72 (0.56-0.92) for stroke, 0.72 (0.52-1.00) for acute coronary syndrome, 0.78 (0.63-0.96), for stroke/MI/hospitalization for heart failure, and 0.46 (0.35 to 0.61) for progression to diabetes. Conclusions and Relevance: Pioglitazone may be effective for secondary prevention in patients with stroke/transient ischemic attack and with prediabetes, particularly in those with good adherence.

        "Liraglutide in Children and Adolescents with Type 2 Diabetes. BACKGROUND: Metformin is the regulatory-approved treatment of choice for most youth with type 2 diabetes early in the disease. However, early loss of glycemic control has been observed with metformin monotherapy. Whether liraglutide added to metformin (with or without basal insulin treatment) is safe and effective in youth with type 2 diabetes is unknown. METHODS: Patients who were 10 to less than 17 years of age were randomly assigned, in a 1:1 ratio, to receive subcutaneous liraglutide (up to 1.8 mg per day) or placebo for a 26-week double-blind period, followed by a 26-week open-label extension period. Inclusion criteria were a body-mass index greater than the 85th percentile and a glycated hemoglobin level between 7.0 and 11.0% if the patients were being treated with diet and exercise alone or between 6.5 and 11.0% if they were being treated with metformin (with or without insulin). All the patients received metformin during the trial. The primary end point was the change from baseline in the glycated hemoglobin level after 26 weeks. Secondary end points included the change in fasting plasma glucose level. Safety was assessed throughout the course of the trial. RESULTS: Of 135 patients who underwent randomization, 134 received at least one dose of liraglutide (66 patients) or placebo (68 patients). Demographic characteristics were similar in the two groups (mean age, 14.6 years). At the 26-week analysis of the primary efficacy end point, the mean glycated hemoglobin level had decreased by 0.64 percentage points with liraglutide and increased by 0.42 percentage points with placebo, for an estimated treatment difference of -1.06 percentage points (P<0.001); the difference increased to -1.30 percentage points by 52 weeks. The fasting plasma glucose level had decreased at both time points in the liraglutide group but had increased in the placebo group. The number of patients who reported adverse events was similar in the two groups (56 [84.8%] with liraglutide and 55 [80.9%] with placebo), but the overall rates of adverse events and gastrointestinal adverse events were higher with liraglutide. CONCLUSIONS: In children and adolescents with type 2 diabetes, liraglutide, at a dose of up to 1.8 mg per day (added to metformin, with or without basal insulin), was efficacious in improving glycemic control over 52 weeks. This efficacy came at the cost of an increased frequency of gastrointestinal adverse events. (Funded by Novo Nordisk; Ellipse ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01541215.). ",
        "Trastuzumab Deruxtecan in Previously Treated HER2-Positive Breast Cancer. BACKGROUND: Trastuzumab deruxtecan (DS-8201) is an antibody-drug conjugate composed of an anti-HER2 (human epidermal growth factor receptor 2) antibody, a cleavable tetrapeptide-based linker, and a cytotoxic topoisomerase I inhibitor. In a phase 1 dose-finding study, a majority of the patients with advanced HER2-positive breast cancer had a response to trastuzumab deruxtecan (median response duration, 20.7 months). The efficacy of trastuzumab deruxtecan in patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer previously treated with trastuzumab emtansine requires confirmation. METHODS: In this two-part, open-label, single-group, multicenter, phase 2 study, we evaluated trastuzumab deruxtecan in adults with pathologically documented HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer who had received previous treatment with trastuzumab emtansine. In the first part of the study, we evaluated three different doses of trastuzumab deruxtecan to establish a recommended dose; in the second part, we evaluated the efficacy and safety of the recommended dose. The primary end point was the objective response, according to independent central review. Key secondary end points were the disease-control rate, clinical-benefit rate, duration of response and progression-free survival, and safety. RESULTS: Overall, 184 patients who had undergone a median of six previous treatments received the recommended dose of trastuzumab deruxtecan (5.4 mg per kilogram of body weight). In the intention-to-treat analysis, a response to therapy was reported in 112 patients (60.9%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 53.4 to 68.0). The median duration of follow-up was 11.1 months (range, 0.7 to 19.9). The median response duration was 14.8 months (95% CI, 13.8 to 16.9), and the median duration of progression-free survival was 16.4 months (95% CI, 12.7 to not reached). During the study, the most common adverse events of grade 3 or higher were a decreased neutrophil count (in 20.7% of the patients), anemia (in 8.7%), and nausea (in 7.6%). On independent adjudication, the trial drug was associated with interstitial lung disease in 13.6% of the patients (grade 1 or 2, 10.9%; grade 3 or 4, 0.5%; and grade 5, 2.2%). CONCLUSIONS: Trastuzumab deruxtecan showed durable antitumor activity in a pretreated patient population with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer. In addition to nausea and myelosuppression, interstitial lung disease was observed in a subgroup of patients and requires attention to pulmonary symptoms and careful monitoring.

        "Sepsis Surveillance Using Adult Sepsis Events Simplified eSOFA Criteria Versus Sepsis-3 Sequential Organ Failure Assessment Criteria. OBJECTIVES: Sepsis-3 defines organ dysfunction as an increase in the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score by greater than or equal to 2 points. However, some Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score components are not routinely recorded in all hospitals' electronic health record systems, limiting its utility for wide-scale sepsis surveillance. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently released the Adult Sepsis Event surveillance definition that includes simplified organ dysfunction criteria optimized for electronic health records (eSOFA). We compared eSOFA versus Sequential Organ Failure Assessment with regard to sepsis prevalence, overlap, and outcomes. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: One hundred eleven U.S. hospitals in the Cerner HealthFacts dataset. PATIENTS: Adults hospitalized in 2013-2015. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We identified clinical indicators of presumed infection (blood cultures and antibiotics) concurrent with either: 1) an increase in Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score by 2 or more points (Sepsis-3) or 2) 1 or more eSOFA criteria: vasopressor initiation, mechanical ventilation initiation, lactate greater than or equal to 2.0 mmol/L, doubling in creatinine, doubling in bilirubin to greater than or equal to 2.0\u2009mg/dL, or greater than or equal to 50% decrease in platelet count to less than 100 cells/\u03bcL (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Adult Sepsis Event). We compared area under the receiver operating characteristic curves for discriminating in-hospital mortality, adjusting for baseline characteristics. Of 942,360 patients in the cohort, 57,242 (6.1%) had sepsis by Sequential Organ Failure Assessment versus 41,618 (4.4%) by eSOFA. Agreement between sepsis by Sequential Organ Failure Assessment and eSOFA was good (Cronbach's alpha 0.81). Baseline characteristics and infectious diagnoses were similar, but mortality was higher with eSOFA (17.1%) versus Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (14.4%; p < 0.001) as was discrimination for mortality (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.774 vs 0.759; p < 0.001). Comparisons were consistent across subgroups of age, infectious diagnoses, and comorbidities. CONCLUSIONS: The Adult Sepsis Event's eSOFA organ dysfunction criteria identify a smaller, more severely ill sepsis cohort compared with the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score, but with good overlap and similar clinical characteristics. Adult Sepsis Events may facilitate wide-scale automated sepsis surveillance that tracks closely with the more complex Sepsis-3 criteria. ",
        "Adjunctive Intermittent Pneumatic Compression for Venous Thromboprophylaxis. BACKGROUND: Whether adjunctive intermittent pneumatic compression in critically ill patients receiving pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis would result in a lower incidence of deep-vein thrombosis than pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis alone is uncertain. METHODS: We randomly assigned patients who were considered adults according to the local standards at the participating sites (\u226514, \u226516, or \u226518 years of age) within 48 hours after admission to an intensive care unit (ICU) to receive either intermittent pneumatic compression for at least 18 hours each day in addition to pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis with unfractionated or low-molecular-weight heparin (pneumatic compression group) or pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis alone (control group). The primary outcome was incident (i.e., new) proximal lower-limb deep-vein thrombosis, as detected on twice-weekly lower-limb ultrasonography after the third calendar day since randomization until ICU discharge, death, attainment of full mobility, or trial day 28, whichever occurred first. RESULTS: A total of 2003 patients underwent randomization - 991 were assigned to the pneumatic compression group and 1012 to the control group. Intermittent pneumatic compression was applied for a median of 22 hours (interquartile range, 21 to 23) daily for a median of 7 days (interquartile range, 4 to 13). The primary outcome occurred in 37 of 957 patients (3.9%) in the pneumatic compression group and in 41 of 985 patients (4.2%) in the control group (relative risk, 0.93; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.60 to 1.44; P\u2009=\u20090.74). Venous thromboembolism (pulmonary embolism or any lower-limb deep-vein thrombosis) occurred in 103 of 991 patients (10.4%) in the pneumatic compression group and in 95 of 1012 patients (9.4%) in the control group (relative risk, 1.11; 95% CI, 0.85 to 1.44), and death from any cause at 90 days occurred in 258 of 990 patients (26.1%) and 270 of 1011 patients (26.7%), respectively (relative risk, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.84 to 1.13). CONCLUSIONS: Among critically ill patients who were receiving pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis, adjunctive intermittent pneumatic compression did not result in a significantly lower incidence of proximal lower-limb deep-vein thrombosis than pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis alone.

        "Antibiotic Prescription in Young Children With Respiratory Syncytial Virus-Associated Respiratory Failure and Associated Outcomes. OBJECTIVES: To describe antibiotic prescribing practices during the first 2 days of mechanical ventilation among previously healthy young children with respiratory syncytial virus-associated lower respiratory tract infection and evaluate associations between the prescription of antibiotics at onset of mechanical ventilation with clinical outcomes. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Forty-six children's hospitals in the United States. PATIENTS: Children less than 2 years old discharged between 2012 and 2016 with an International Classification of Diseases diagnosis of respiratory syncytial virus-associated lower respiratory tract infection, no identified comorbid conditions, and receipt of mechanical ventilation. INTERVENTIONS: Antibiotic prescription during the first 2 days of mechanical ventilation. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We compared duration of mechanical ventilation and hospital length of stay between children prescribed antibiotics on both of the first 2 days of mechanical ventilation and children not prescribed antibiotics during the first 2 days of mechanical ventilation. We included 2,107 PICU children with respiratory syncytial virus-associated lower respiratory tract infection (60% male, median age of 1 mo [interquartile range, 1-4 mo]). The overall proportion of antibiotic prescription on both of the first 2 days of mechanical ventilation was 82%, decreasing over the study period (p = 0.004) and varying from 36% to 100% across centers. In the bivariate analysis, antibiotic prescription was associated with a shorter duration of mechanical ventilation (6 d [4-9 d] vs 8 d [6-11 d]; p < 0.001) and a shorter hospital length of stay (11 d [8-16 d] vs 13 d [10-18 d]; p < 0.001). After adjustment for center, demographics, and vasoactive medication prescription, antibiotic prescription was associated with a 1.21-day shorter duration of mechanical ventilation and a 2.07-day shorter length of stay. Ultimately, 95% of children were prescribed antibiotics sometime during hospitalization, but timing, duration, and antibiotic choice varied markedly. CONCLUSIONS: Although highly variable across centers and decreasing over time, the practice of instituting antibiotics after intubation in young children with respiratory syncytial virus-associated lower respiratory tract infection was associated with a shortened clinical course after adjustment for the limited available covariates. A prudent approach to identify and optimally treat bacterial coinfection is needed. ",
        "Evidence of Endotypes in Pediatric Acute Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure Caused by Sepsis. OBJECTIVES: Subclassification based on clinical or biologic commonalities (endotypes) is one approach to reduce heterogeneity in acute hypoxemic respiratory failure. In adults, biomarker-defined endotypes of respiratory failure have been described, with differential outcome profiles and response to therapy. To date, no studies have tested whether endotypes exist in pediatric acute hypoxemic respiratory failure, although messenger RNA expression-based endotypes have been described in pediatric sepsis. The aim of the present study was to test whether endotypes identified in pediatric sepsis are applicable to pediatric acute hypoxemic respiratory failure. DESIGN: Secondary analysis of a previously reported microarray-based study of pediatric sepsis. SETTING: Multiple PICUs in the United States. PATIENTS: Sixty-seven children with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure caused by sepsis. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Of the larger septic shock cohort, 67 met eligibility for acute hypoxemic respiratory failure. Twenty-three subjects were assigned to endotype A, and 44 to endotype B. Subjects assigned to endotype A had over four-fold greater unadjusted 28-day mortality, and nearly three-fold greater rates of complicated course. The association with mortality (odds ratio, 8.0; 95% CI, 1.6-41.0) and complicated course (odds ratio, 4.2; 95% CI, 1.2-14.9) persisted after adjustment for age, severity of illness, and PaO2/FIO2. CONCLUSIONS: Applying a previously reported endotyping strategy in children with septic shock identified endotypes of pediatric acute hypoxemic respiratory failure secondary to sepsis, with differential risk for poor outcomes. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of endotypes in pediatric respiratory failure. Our results support an investigation into using transcriptomics to identify messenger RNA-based endotypes in a dedicated, well-defined acute hypoxemic respiratory failure cohort. ",
        "Effect of Surgical Versus Medical Therapy on Diabetic Kidney Disease Over 5 Years in Severely Obese Adolescents With Type 2 Diabetes. OBJECTIVE: To compare diabetic kidney disease (DKD) rates over 5 years of follow-up in two cohorts of severely obese adolescents with type 2 diabetes (T2D) undergoing medical or surgical treatment for T2D. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A secondary analysis was performed of data collected from obese participants of similar age and racial distribution enrolled in the Teen-Longitudinal Assessment of Bariatric Surgery (Teen-LABS) and the Treatment Options of Type 2 Diabetes in Adolescents and Youth (TODAY) studies. Teen-LABS participants underwent metabolic bariatric surgery (MBS). TODAY participants were randomized to metformin alone or in combination with rosiglitazone or intensive lifestyle intervention, with insulin therapy given for glycemic progression. Glycemic control, BMI, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), urinary albumin excretion (UAE), and prevalence of hyperfiltration (eGFR \u2265135 mL/min/1.73 m2) and elevated UAE (\u226530 mg/g) were assessed annually. RESULTS: Participants with T2D from Teen-LABS (n = 30, mean \u00b1 SD age, 16.9 \u00b1 1.3 years; 70% female; 60% white; BMI 54.4 \u00b1 9.5 kg/m2) and TODAY (n = 63, age 15.3 \u00b1 1.3 years; 56% female; 71% white; BMI 40.5 \u00b1 4.9 kg/m2) were compared. During 5 years of follow-up, hyperfiltration decreased from 21% to 18% in Teen-LABS and increased from 7% to 48% in TODAY. Elevated UAE decreased from 27% to 5% in Teen-LABS and increased from 21% to 43% in TODAY. Adjusting for baseline age, sex, BMI, and HbA1c, TODAY participants had a greater odds of hyperfiltration (odds ratio 15.7 [95% CI 2.6, 94.3]) and elevated UAE (27.3 [4.9, 149.9]) at 5 years of follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with MBS, medical treatment of obese youth with T2D was associated with a higher odds of DKD over 5 years. ",
        "Care Practices for Patients With Advanced Kidney Disease Who Forgo Maintenance Dialysis. Importance: Although maintenance dialysis is a treatment choice with potential benefits and harms, little is known about care practices for patients with advanced chronic kidney disease who forgo this treatment. Objective: To describe how decisions not to start dialysis unfold in the clinical setting. Design, Setting, and Participants: A qualitative study was performed of documentation in the electronic medical records of 851 adults receiving care from the US Veterans Health Administration between January 1, 2000, and October 1, 2011, who had chosen not to start dialysis. Qualitative analysis was performed between March 1, 2017, and April 1, 2018. Main Outcomes and Measures: Dominant themes that emerged from clinician documentation of clinical events and health care interactions between patients, family members, and clinicians relevant to the decision to forgo dialysis. Results: In the cohort of 851 patients (842 men and 9 women; mean [SD] age, 75.0 [10.3] years), 567 (66.6%) were white. Three major dynamics relevant to understanding how decisions to forgo dialysis unfolded were identified. The first dynamic was that of dialysis as the norm: when patients expressed a desire to forgo dialysis, it was unusual for clinicians to readily accept patients' decisions. Clinicians tended to repeatedly question this preference over time, deliberated about patients' competency to make this decision, used a variety of strategies to encourage patients to initiate dialysis, and prepared for patients to change their minds and start dialysis. The second dynamic arose when patients were not candidates for dialysis: clinicians viewed particular patients as not candidates or appropriate for dialysis, usually on the basis of specific characteristics and/or expected prognosis, rather than after consideration of patients' goals and values. When clinicians decided patients were not candidates for dialysis, there seemed to be little room for uncertainty in these decisions. The third dynamic occurred when clinicians believed they had little to offer patients beyond dialysis: when it was clear that patients would not be starting dialysis, nephrologists often signed off from their care and had few recommendations other than referral to hospice care. Conclusions and Relevance: These findings describe an all-or-nothing approach to caring for patients with advanced chronic kidney disease in which initiation of dialysis served as a powerful default option with few perceived alternatives. Stronger efforts are needed to develop a more patient-centered approach to caring for patients with advanced chronic kidney disease that is capable of proactively supporting those who do not wish to start dialysis.

        "Association of HLA-C*06:02 Status With Differential Response to Ustekinumab in Patients With Psoriasis: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis. Importance: Previous research showed a differential response to ustekinumab therapy based on HLA-C*06:02 status in patients with psoriasis but consisted mostly of small (and sometimes inconclusive) cohort studies. Objective: To assess whether HLA-C*06:02 status is associated with a differential response to ustekinumab therapy in patients with psoriasis through a systematic review and a meta-analysis of available data. Data Sources: A comprehensive search was conducted using MEDLINE, Embase, the Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and gray literature sources. Databases were searched from January 1, 2000, to May 14, 2018. Search strategies included terms and synonyms for psoriasis, HLA-C, and ustekinumab. Languages were restricted to English, French, German, and Dutch. Study Selection: Studies were included if they reported the association between HLA-C*06:02 status and 75% improvement in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI75) response to ustekinumab therapy in patients with plaque psoriasis after 6 and/or 3 months of treatment. Randomized clinical trials and observational studies were included. Screening and selection were performed independently by 2 reviewers. Data Extraction and Synthesis: HLA-C*06:02 genotype status and PASI75 response rates were extracted by 2 reviewers. Data were pooled using random-effects models. Heterogeneity was assessed using the \u03c42 and I2 statistic. Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) and Meta-Analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) reporting guidelines were followed. Main Outcome and Measure: The primary outcome was the risk difference of achieving PASI75 after 6 months of ustekinumab therapy between HLA-C*06:02-positive and HLA-C*06:02-negative patients. Results: A total of 8 studies were reviewed; 1048 patients were included for meta-analyses, and 937 patients were included for the primary analysis of PASI75 response after 6 months of treatment. Random-effects meta-analysis showed a risk difference of 0.24 (95% CI, 0.14-0.35; P\u2009<\u2009.001) in favor of HLA-C*06:02-positive patients. The median PASI75 response rate in the HLA-C*06:02-positive group was 92% (pooled, 89%; range, 62%-98%). For HLA-C*06:02-negative patients, the median response rate was 67% (pooled, 62%; range, 40%-84%). Substantial heterogeneity may have been present, with an I2 of 82%. Conclusions and Relevance: The meta-analysis showed a differential response to ustekinumab therapy based on HLA-C*06:02 status in patients with psoriasis. Although HLA-C*06:02-positive patients had high PASI75 response rates after 6 months, the PASI75 response rate was also high in the HLA-C*06:02-negative group. There appears to be no rationale for excluding patients from ustekinumab treatment based on a negative HLA-C*06:02 status. ",
        "Excess Deaths Attributable to Influenza-Like Illness in the ESRD Population. BACKGROUND: Morbidity and mortality vary seasonally. Timing and severity of influenza seasons contribute to those patterns, especially among vulnerable populations such as patients with ESRD. However, the extent to which influenza-like illness (ILI), a syndrome comprising a range of potentially serious respiratory tract infections, contributes to mortality in patients with ESRD has not been quantified. METHODS: We used data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Outpatient Influenza-like Illness Surveillance Network and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ESRD death data from 2000 to 2013. After addressing the increasing trend in deaths due to the growing prevalent ESRD population, we calculated quarterly relative mortality compared with average third-quarter (summer) death counts. We used linear regression models to assess the relationship between ILI data and mortality, separately for quarters 4 and 1 for each influenza season, and model parameter estimates to predict seasonal mortality counts and calculate excess ILI-associated deaths. RESULTS: An estimated 1% absolute increase in quarterly ILI was associated with a 1.5% increase in relative mortality for quarter 4 and a 2.0% increase for quarter 1. The average number of annual deaths potentially attributable to ILI was substantial, about 1100 deaths per year. CONCLUSIONS: We found an association between community ILI activity and seasonal variation in all-cause mortality in patients with ESRD, with ILI likely contributing to >1000 deaths annually. Surveillance efforts, such as timely reporting to the CDC of ILI activity within dialysis units during influenza season, may help focus attention on high-risk periods for this vulnerable population.

        "Comparative Efficacy of Therapies for Treatment of Depression for Patients Undergoing Maintenance Hemodialysis: A Randomized Clinical Trial. Background: Although depression is common among patients receiving maintenance hemodialysis, data on their acceptance of treatment and on the comparative efficacy of various therapies are limited. Objective: To determine the effect of an engagement interview on treatment acceptance (phase 1) and to compare the efficacy of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) versus sertraline (phase 2) for treating depression in patients receiving hemodialysis. Design: Multicenter, parallel-group, open-label, randomized controlled trial. (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02358343). Setting: 41 dialysis facilities in 3 U.S. metropolitan areas. Participants: Patients who had been receiving hemodialysis for at least 3 months and had a Beck Depression Inventory-II score of 15 or greater; 184 patients participated in phase 1, and 120 subsequently participated in phase 2. Intervention: Engagement interview versus control visit (phase 1) and 12 weeks of CBT delivered in the dialysis facility versus sertraline treatment (phase 2). Measurements: The primary outcome for phase 1 was the proportion of participants who started depression treatment within 28 days. For phase 2, the primary outcome was depressive symptoms measured by the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptoms-Clinician-Rated (QIDS-C) at 12 weeks. Results: The proportion of participants who initiated treatment after the engagement or control visit did not differ (66% vs. 64%, respectively; P\u00a0= 0.77; estimated risk difference, 2.1 [95% CI, -12.1 to 16.4]). Compared with CBT, sertraline treatment resulted in lower QIDS-C depression scores at 12 weeks (effect estimate, -1.84 [CI, -3.54 to -0.13]; P\u00a0= 0.035). Adverse events were more frequent in the sertraline than the CBT group. Limitation: No randomized comparison was made with no treatment, and persistence of treatment effect was not assessed. Conclusion: An engagement interview with patients receiving maintenance hemodialysis had no effect on their acceptance of treatment for depression. After 12 weeks of treatment, depression scores were modestly better with sertraline treatment than with CBT.

        "Rituximab or Cyclosporine in the Treatment of Membranous Nephropathy. BACKGROUND: B-cell anomalies play a role in the pathogenesis of membranous nephropathy. B-cell depletion with rituximab may therefore be noninferior to treatment with cyclosporine for inducing and maintaining a complete or partial remission of proteinuria in patients with this condition. METHODS: We randomly assigned patients who had membranous nephropathy, proteinuria of at least 5 g per 24 hours, and a quantified creatinine clearance of at least 40 ml per minute per 1.73 m2 of body-surface area and had been receiving angiotensin-system blockade for at least 3 months to receive intravenous rituximab (two infusions, 1000 mg each, administered 14 days apart; repeated at 6 months in case of partial response) or oral cyclosporine (starting at a dose of 3.5 mg per kilogram of body weight per day for 12 months). Patients were followed for 24 months. The primary outcome was a composite of complete or partial remission of proteinuria at 24 months. Laboratory variables and safety were also assessed. RESULTS: A total of 130 patients underwent randomization. At 12 months, 39 of 65 patients (60%) in the rituximab group and 34 of 65 (52%) in the cyclosporine group had a complete or partial remission (risk difference, 8 percentage points; 95% confidence interval [CI], -9 to 25; P\u2009=\u20090.004 for noninferiority). At 24 months, 39 patients (60%) in the rituximab group and 13 (20%) in the cyclosporine group had a complete or partial remission (risk difference, 40 percentage points; 95% CI, 25 to 55; P<0.001 for both noninferiority and superiority). Among patients in remission who tested positive for anti-phospholipase A2 receptor (PLA2R) antibodies, the decline in autoantibodies to anti-PLA2R was faster and of greater magnitude and duration in the rituximab group than in the cyclosporine group. Serious adverse events occurred in 11 patients (17%) in the rituximab group and in 20 (31%) in the cyclosporine group (P\u2009=\u20090.06). CONCLUSIONS: Rituximab was noninferior to cyclosporine in inducing complete or partial remission of proteinuria at 12 months and was superior in maintaining proteinuria remission up to 24 months.

        "Disparities in Acceptance of Deceased Donor Kidneys Between the United States and France and Estimated Effects of Increased US Acceptance. Importance: Approximately 3500 donated kidneys are discarded in the United States each year, drawing concern from Medicare and advocacy groups. Objective: To estimate the effects of more aggressive allograft acceptance practices on the donor pool and allograft survival for the population of US wait-listed kidney transplant candidates. Design, Setting, and Participants: A nationwide study using validated registries from the United States and France comprising comprehensive cohorts of deceased donors with organs offered to kidney transplant centers between January 1, 2004, and December 31, 2014. Data were analyzed between September 1, 2018, and April 5, 2019. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was kidney allograft discard. The secondary outcome was allograft failure after transplantation. We used logistic regression to model organ acceptance and discard practices in both countries. We then quantified using computer simulation models the number of kidneys discarded in the United States that a more aggressive system would have instead used for transplantation. Finally, based on actual survival data, we quantified the additional years of allograft life that a redesigned US system would have saved. Findings: In the United States, 156\u202f089 kidneys were recovered from deceased donors between 2004 and 2014, of which 128\u202f102 were transplanted, and 27\u202f987 (17.9%) were discarded. In France, among the 29\u202f984 kidneys recovered between 2004 and 2014, 27\u202f252 were transplanted, and 2732 (9.1%, P\u2009<\u2009.001 vs United States) were discarded. The mean (SD) age of kidneys transplanted in the United States was 36.51 (17.02) years vs 50.91 (17.34) years in France (P\u2009<\u2009.001). Kidney quality showed little change in the United States over time (mean [SD] kidney donor risk index [KDRI], 1.30 [0.48] in 2004 vs 1.32 [0.46] in 2014), whereas a steadily rising KDRI in France reflected a temporal trend of more aggressive organ use (mean [SD] KDRI, 1.37 [0.47] in 2004 vs 1.74 [0.72] in 2014; P\u2009<\u2009.001). We applied the French-based allocation model to the population of US deceased donor kidneys and found that 17\u202f435 (62%) of kidneys discarded in the United States would have instead been transplanted under the French system. We further determined that a redesigned system with more aggressive organ acceptance practices would generate an additional 132\u202f445 allograft life-years in the United States over the 10-year observation period. Conclusions and Relevance: Greater acceptance of kidneys from deceased donors who are older and have more comorbidities could provide major survival benefits to the population of US wait-listed patients.

        "Association Between Dialysis Facility Ownership and Access to Kidney Transplantation. Importance: For-profit (vs nonprofit) dialysis facilities have historically had lower kidney transplantation rates, but it is unknown if the pattern holds for living donor and deceased donor kidney transplantation, varies by facility ownership, or has persisted over time in a nationally representative population. Objective: To determine the association between dialysis facility ownership and placement on the deceased donor kidney transplantation waiting list, receipt of a living donor kidney transplant, or receipt of a deceased donor kidney transplant. Design, Setting, and Participants: Retrospective cohort study that included 1\u202f478\u202f564 patients treated at 6511 US dialysis facilities. Adult patients with incident end-stage kidney disease from the US Renal Data System (2000-2016) were linked with facility ownership (Dialysis Facility Compare) and characteristics (Dialysis Facility Report). Exposures: The primary exposure was dialysis facility ownership, which was categorized as nonprofit small chains, nonprofit independent facilities, for-profit large chains (>1000 facilities), for-profit small chains (<1000 facilities), and for-profit independent facilities. Main Outcomes and Measures: Access to kidney transplantation was defined as time from initiation of dialysis to placement on the deceased donor kidney transplantation waiting list, receipt of a living donor kidney transplant, or receipt of a deceased donor kidney transplant. Cumulative incidence differences and multivariable Cox models assessed the association between dialysis facility ownership and each outcome. Results: Among 1\u202f478\u202f564 patients, the median age was 66 years (interquartile range, 55-76 years), with 55.3% male, and 28.1% non-Hispanic black patients. Eighty-seven percent of patients received care at a for-profit dialysis facility. A total of 109\u202f030 patients (7.4%) received care at 435 nonprofit small chain facilities; 78\u202f287 (5.3%) at 324 nonprofit independent facilities; 483\u202f988 (32.7%) at 2239 facilities of large for-profit chain 1; 482\u202f689 (32.6%) at 2082 facilities of large for-profit chain 2; 225\u202f890 (15.3%) at 997 for-profit small chain facilities; and 98\u202f680 (6.7%) at 434 for-profit independent facilities. During the study period, 121\u202f680 patients (8.2%) were placed on the deceased donor waiting list, 23\u202f762 (1.6%) received a living donor kidney transplant, and 49\u202f290 (3.3%) received a deceased donor kidney transplant. For-profit facilities had lower 5-year cumulative incidence differences for each outcome vs nonprofit facilities (deceased donor waiting list: -13.2% [95% CI, -13.4% to -13.0%]; receipt of a living donor kidney transplant: -2.3% [95% CI, -2.4% to -2.3%]; and receipt of a deceased donor kidney transplant: -4.3% [95% CI, -4.4% to -4.2%]). Adjusted Cox analyses showed lower relative rates for each outcome among patients treated at all for-profit vs all nonprofit dialysis facilities: deceased donor waiting list (hazard ratio [HR], 0.36 [95% CI, 0.35 to 0.36]); receipt of a living donor kidney transplant (HR, 0.52 [95% CI, 0.51 to 0.54]); and receipt of a deceased donor kidney transplant (HR, 0.44 [95% CI, 0.44 to 0.45]). Conclusions and Relevance: Among US patients with end-stage kidney disease, receiving dialysis at for-profit facilities compared with nonprofit facilities was associated with a lower likelihood of accessing kidney transplantation. Further research is needed to understand the mechanisms behind this association. ",
        "Association of Prenatal Exposure to Valproate and Other Antiepileptic Drugs With Risk for Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder in Offspring. Importance: Valproate is an antiepileptic drug (AED) used in the treatment of epilepsy and many other neurological and psychiatric disorders. Its use in pregnancy is associated with increased risks of congenital malformations and adverse neurodevelopment in the offspring and may be associated with an increased risk of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Objective: To determine whether prenatal exposure to valproate and other AEDs is associated with an increased risk of ADHD in the offspring. Design, Setting, and Participants: This was a population-based cohort study of all live-born singleton children in Denmark from January 1, 1997, to December 31, 2011 (N\u2009=\u2009913\u202f302). Information on prenatal exposure to AEDs, including valproate, was obtained from the Danish National Prescription Registry and all children with ADHD were identified (children with diagnosed ADHD in the Danish Psychiatric Central Research Register or children who redeemed a prescription for ADHD medication). The cohort was followed up from birth until the day of the ADHD diagnosis, death, emigration, or December 31, 2015, whichever came first. Data were analyzed in September 2018. Exposures: Maternal use of valproate and other AEDs in pregnancy. Main Outcomes and Measures: Cox regression estimates of the hazard ratio of ADHD. Estimates were adjusted for potential confounders. Results: The cohort included 913\u202f302 children (mean age at end of study, 10.1 years; median age, 9.4 years; interquartile range, 7.2-12.8 years; 468\u202f708 [51.3%] male). A total of 580 were identified as having been exposed to valproate during pregnancy; of them, 49 (8.4%) had ADHD. Among the 912\u202f722 children who were unexposed to valproate, 29\u202f396 (3.2%) had ADHD. Children with prenatal valproate exposure had a 48% increased risk of ADHD (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.48; 95% CI, 1.09-2.00) compared with children with no valproate exposure. The absolute 15-year risk of ADHD was 4.6% (95% CI, 4.5%-4.6%) in children unexposed to valproate and 11.0% (95% CI, 8.2%-14.2%) in children who were exposed to valproate in pregnancy. No associations were found between other AEDs and ADHD. Conclusions and Relevance: Maternal use of valproate, but not other AEDs, during pregnancy was associated with an increased risk of ADHD in the offspring. These findings have important implications for the counseling of women of childbearing potential using valproate. ",
        "Dynamical properties of elemental metabolism distinguish attention deficit hyperactivity disorder from autism spectrum disorder. Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are neurodevelopmental conditions of overlapping etiologies and phenotypes. For ASD, we recently reported altered elemental metabolic patterns in the form of short and irregular zinc and copper cycles. Here, we extend the application of these biomarkers of prenatal and early postnatal elemental metabolism to distinguish between individuals diagnosed with ADHD and/or ASD and neurotypical controls. We recruited twins discordant for ADHD, ASD and other neurodevelopmental diagnoses from national twin studies in Sweden (N\u2009=\u200974) diagnosed according to DSM-5 clinical consensus and standardized psychiatric instruments. Detailed temporal profiles of exposure to 10 metals over the prenatal and early childhood periods were measured using tooth biomarkers. We used recurrence quantification analysis (RQA) to characterize properties of cyclical metabolic patterns of these metals. Regularity (determinism) and complexity (entropy) of elemental cycles was consistently reduced in ADHD for cobalt, lead, and vanadium (determinism: cobalt, \u03b2\u2009=\u2009-0.03, P\u2009=\u20090.017; lead, \u03b2\u2009=\u2009-0.03, P\u2009=\u20090.016; and vanadium, \u03b2\u2009=\u2009-0.03, P\u2009=\u20090.01. Entropy: cobalt, \u03b2\u2009=\u2009-0.13, P\u2009=\u20090.017; lead, \u03b2\u2009=\u2009-0.18, P\u2009=\u20090.016; and vanadium, \u03b2\u2009=\u2009-0.15, P\u2009=\u20090.008). Further, we found elemental pathways and dynamical features specific to ADHD vs ASD, and unique characteristics associated with ADHD/ASD combined presentation. Dysregulation of cyclical processes in elemental metabolism during prenatal and early postnatal development not only encompasses pathways shared by ADHD and ASD, but also comprise features specific to either condition.

        "Association of Chronic Low-grade Inflammation With Risk of Alzheimer Disease in ApoE4 Carriers. Importance: The association between peripheral inflammatory biomarkers and Alzheimer disease (AD) is not consistent in the literature. It is possible that chronic inflammation, rather than 1 episode of inflammation, interacts with genetic vulnerability to increase the risk for AD. Objective: To study the interaction between the apolipoprotein E (ApoE) genotype and chronic low-grade inflammation and its association with the incidence of AD. Design, Setting, and Participants: In this cohort study, data from 2656 members of the Framingham Heart Study offspring cohort (Generation 2; August 13, 1971-November 27, 2017) were evaluated, including longitudinal measures of serum C-reactive protein (CRP), diagnoses of incident dementia including AD, and brain volume. Chronic low-grade inflammation was defined as having CRP at a high cutoff level at a minimum of 2 time points. Statistical analysis was performed from December 1, 1979, to December 31, 2015. Main Outcomes and Measures: Development of AD and brain volumes. Results: Of the 3130 eligible participants, 2656 (84.9%; 1227 men and 1429 women; mean [SD] age at last CRP measurement, 61.6 [9.5] years) with both ApoE status and longitudinal CRP measurements were included in this study analysis. Median (interquartile range) CRP levels increased with mean (SD) age (43.3 [9.6] years, 0.95 mg/L [0.40-2.35 mg/L] vs 59.1 [9.6] years, 2.04 mg/L [0.93-4.75 mg/L] vs 61.6 [9.5] years, 2.21 mg/L [1.05-5.12 mg/L]; P\u2009<\u2009.001), but less so among those with ApoE4 alleles, followed by ApoE3 then ApoE2 genotypes. During the 17 years of follow-up, 194 individuals (7.3%) developed dementia, 152 (78.4%) of whom had AD. ApoE4 coupled with chronic low-grade inflammation, defined as a CRP level of 8 mg/L or higher, was associated with an increased risk of AD, especially in the absence of cardiovascular diseases (hazard ratio, 6.63; 95% CI, 1.80-24.50; P\u2009=\u2009.005), as well as an increased risk of earlier disease onset compared with ApoE4 carriers without chronic inflammation (hazard ratio, 3.52; 95% CI, 1.27-9.75; P\u2009=\u2009.009). This phenomenon was not observed among ApoE3 and ApoE2 carriers with chronic low-grade inflammation. Finally, a subset of 1761 individuals (66.3%) underwent brain magnetic resonance imaging, and the interaction between ApoE4 and chronic low-grade inflammation was associated with brain atrophy in the temporal lobe (\u03b2\u2009=\u2009-0.88, SE\u2009=\u20090.22; P\u2009<\u2009.001) and hippocampus (\u03b2\u2009=\u2009-0.04, SE\u2009=\u20090.01; P\u2009=\u2009.005), after adjusting for confounders. Conclusions and Relevance: In this study, peripheral chronic low-grade inflammation in participants with ApoE4 was associated with shortened latency for onset of AD. Rigorously treating chronic systemic inflammation based on genetic risk could be effective for the prevention and intervention of AD. ",
        "Serum neurofilament dynamics predicts neurodegeneration and clinical progression in presymptomatic Alzheimer's disease. Neurofilament light chain (NfL) is a promising fluid biomarker of disease progression for various cerebral proteopathies. Here we leverage the unique characteristics of the Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer Network and ultrasensitive immunoassay technology to demonstrate that NfL levels in the cerebrospinal fluid (n\u2009=\u2009187) and serum (n\u2009=\u2009405) are correlated with one another and are elevated at the presymptomatic stages of familial Alzheimer's disease. Longitudinal, within-person analysis of serum NfL dynamics (n\u2009=\u2009196) confirmed this elevation and further revealed that the rate of change of serum NfL could discriminate mutation carriers from non-mutation carriers almost a decade earlier than cross-sectional absolute NfL levels (that is, 16.2 versus 6.8 years before the estimated symptom onset). Serum NfL rate of change peaked in participants converting from the presymptomatic to the symptomatic stage and was associated with cortical thinning assessed by magnetic resonance imaging, but less so with amyloid-\u03b2 deposition or glucose metabolism (assessed by positron emission tomography). Serum NfL was predictive for both the rate of cortical thinning and cognitive changes assessed by the Mini-Mental State Examination and Logical Memory test. Thus, NfL dynamics in serum predict disease progression and brain neurodegeneration at the early presymptomatic stages of familial Alzheimer's disease, which supports its potential utility as a clinically useful biomarker.

        "The sleep-wake cycle regulates brain interstitial fluid tau in mice and CSF tau in humans. The sleep-wake cycle regulates interstitial fluid (ISF) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of \u03b2-amyloid (A\u03b2) that accumulates in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Furthermore, chronic sleep deprivation (SD) increases A\u03b2 plaques. However, tau, not A\u03b2, accumulation appears to drive AD neurodegeneration. We tested whether ISF/CSF tau and tau seeding and spreading were influenced by the sleep-wake cycle and SD. Mouse ISF tau was increased ~90% during normal wakefulness versus sleep and ~100% during SD. Human CSF tau also increased more than 50% during SD. In a tau seeding-and-spreading model, chronic SD increased tau pathology spreading. Chemogenetically driven wakefulness in mice also significantly increased both ISF A\u03b2 and tau. Thus, the sleep-wake cycle regulates ISF tau, and SD increases ISF and CSF tau as well as tau pathology spreading. ",
        "A retrospective cohort study to evaluate the development of comorbidities, including psychiatric comorbidities, among a pediatric psoriasis population. BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE: Compared with the adult psoriasis population, knowledge about the incidence of comorbidities in the pediatric psoriasis population is limited. The objective of this study was to assess the prevalence and incidence of comorbidities, including psychiatric comorbidities, in patients with pediatric psoriasis. METHODS: In this claims-based, retrospective cohort study, patients with pediatric psoriasis were matched 1:3 with a nonpsoriasis cohort based on age, sex, and index date (the earliest of inpatient claims or the latter of two outpatient claims). RESULTS: Obesity, serious infection, and juvenile idiopathic arthropathy had higher prevalence and incidence rates in the psoriasis cohort than the nonpsoriasis cohort. Psychiatric comorbidities were also more common in the psoriasis cohort than the nonpsoriasis cohort, as were ulcerative colitis and Crohn disease. Stratifying the psoriasis cohort by disease severity-mild and moderate-to-severe-found no differences in incidence rates of comorbidities between the two subsets. CONCLUSION: The incidence rates of many comorbid conditions were higher for patients with pediatric psoriasis compared with patients without pediatric psoriasis, and similar between patients with moderate-to-severe and mild pediatric psoriasis.

        "Sex Differences in the Association of Global Amyloid and Regional Tau Deposition Measured by Positron Emission Tomography in Clinically Normal Older Adults. Importance: Mounting evidence suggests that sex differences exist in the pathologic trajectory of Alzheimer disease. Previous literature shows elevated levels of cerebrospinal fluid tau in women compared with men as a function of apolipoprotein E (APOE) \u03b54 status and \u03b2-amyloid (A\u03b2). What remains unclear is the association of sex with regional tau deposition in clinically normal individuals. Objective: To examine sex differences in the cross-sectional association between A\u03b2 and regional tau deposition as measured with positron emission tomography (PET). Design, Setting and Participants: This is a study of 2 cross-sectional, convenience-sampled cohorts of clinically normal individuals who received tau and A\u03b2 PET scans. Data were collected between January 2016 and February 2018 from 193 clinically normal individuals from the Harvard Aging Brain Study (age range, 55-92 years; 118 women [61%]) who underwent carbon 11-labeled Pittsburgh Compound B and flortaucipir F18 PET and 103 clinically normal individuals from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (age range, 63-94 years; 55 women [51%]) who underwent florbetapir and flortaucipir F 18 PET. Main Outcomes and Measures: A main association of sex with regional tau in the entorhinal cortices, inferior temporal lobe, and a meta-region of interest, which was a composite of regions in the temporal lobe. Associations between sex and global A\u03b2 as well as sex and APOE \u03b54 on these regions after controlling for age were also examined. Results: The mean (SD) age of all individuals was 74.2 (7.6) years (81 APOE \u03b54 carriers\u2009[31%]; 89 individuals [30%] with high A\u03b2). There was no clear association of sex with regional tau that was replicated across studies. However, in both cohorts, clinically normal women exhibited higher entorhinal cortical tau than men (meta-analytic estimate: \u03b2 [male]\u2009=\u2009-0.11 [0.05]; 95% CI, -0.21 to -0.02; P\u2009=\u2009.02), which was associated with individuals with higher A\u03b2 burden. A sex by APOE \u03b54 interaction was not associated with regional tau (meta-analytic estimate: \u03b2 [male, APOE \u03b54+]\u2009=\u2009-0.15 [0.09]; 95% CI, -0.32 to 0.01; P\u2009=\u2009.07). Conclusions and Relevance: Early tau deposition was elevated in women compared with men in individuals on the Alzheimer disease trajectory. These findings lend support to a growing body of literature that highlights a biological underpinning for sex differences in Alzheimer disease risk. ",
        "Association Between Longitudinal Plasma Neurofilament Light and Neurodegeneration in Patients With Alzheimer Disease. Importance: Plasma neurofilament light (NfL) has been suggested as a noninvasive biomarker to monitor neurodegeneration in Alzheimer disease (AD), but studies are lacking. Objective: To examine whether longitudinal plasma NfL levels are associated with other hallmarks of AD. Design, Setting, and Participants: This North American cohort study used data from 1583 individuals in the multicenter Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative study from September 7, 2005, through June 16, 2016. Patients were eligible for inclusion if they had NfL measurements. Annual plasma NfL samples were collected for up to 11 years and were analyzed in 2018. Exposures: Clinical diagnosis, A\u03b2 and tau cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers, imaging measures (magnetic resonance imaging and fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography), and tests on cognitive scores. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was the association between baseline exposures (diagnosis, CSF biomarkers, imaging measures, and cognition) and longitudinal plasma NfL levels, analyzed by an ultrasensitive assay. The secondary outcomes were the associations between a multimodal classification scheme with A\u03b2, tau, and neurodegeneration (ie, the ATN system) and plasma NfL levels and between longitudinal changes in plasma NfL levels and changes in the other measures. Results: Of the included 1583 participants, 716 (45.2%) were women, and the mean (SD) age was 72.9 (7.1) years; 401 had no cognitive impairment, 855 had mild cognitive impairment, and 327 had AD dementia. The NfL level was increased at baseline in patients with mild cognitive impairment and AD dementia (mean levels: cognitive unimpairment, 32.1 ng/L; mild cognitive impairment, 37.9 ng/L; and AD dementia, 45.9 ng/L; P\u2009<\u2009.001) and increased in all diagnostic groups, with the greatest increase in patients with AD dementia. A longitudinal increase in NfL level correlated with baseline CSF biomarkers (low A\u03b242 [P\u2009=\u2009.001], high total tau [P\u2009=\u2009.02], and high phosphorylated tau levels [P\u2009=\u2009.02]), magnetic resonance imaging measures (small hippocampal volumes [P\u2009<\u2009.001], thin regional cortices [P\u2009=\u2009.009], and large ventricular volumes [P\u2009=\u2009.002]), low fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography uptake (P\u2009=\u2009.01), and poor cognitive performance (P\u2009<\u2009.001) for a global cognitive score. With use of the ATN system, increased baseline NfL levels were seen in A-T+N+ (P\u2009<\u2009.001), A+T-N+ (P\u2009<\u2009.001), and A+T+N+ (P\u2009<\u2009.001), and increased rates of NfL levels were seen in A-T+N- (P\u2009=\u2009.009), A-T+N+ (P\u2009=\u2009.02), A+T-N+ (P\u2009=\u2009.04), and A+T+N+ (P\u2009=\u2009.002). Faster increase in NfL levels correlated with faster increase in CSF biomarkers of neuronal injury, faster rates of atrophy and hypometabolism, and faster worsening in global cognition (all P\u2009<\u2009.05 in patients with mild cognitive impairment; associations differed slightly in cognitively unimpaired controls and patients with AD dementia). Conclusions and Relevance: The findings suggest that plasma NfL can be used as a noninvasive biomarker associated with neurodegeneration in patients with AD and may be useful to monitor effects in trials of disease-modifying drugs.

        "Association of Early-Onset Alzheimer Disease With Elevated Low-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol Levels and Rare Genetic Coding Variants of APOB. Importance: Early-onset Alzheimer disease (EOAD) is a rare form of Alzheimer disease (AD) with a large genetic basis that is only partially understood. In late-onset AD, elevated circulating cholesterol levels increase AD risk even after adjusting for the apolipoprotein E \u03b54 (APOE E4) allele, a major genetic factor for AD and elevated cholesterol levels; however, the role of circulating cholesterol levels in EOAD is unclear. Objectives: To investigate the association between circulating cholesterol levels and EOAD and to identify genetic variants underlying this possible association. Design, Setting, and Participants: In this case series, plasma cholesterol levels were directly measured in 267 samples from the AD research centers (ADRCs) of Emory University and University of California, San Francisco, collected from January 21, 2009, through August 21, 2014. The association between cholesterol and EOAD was examined using multiple linear regression. To determine the underlying genetic variants, APOB, APP, PSEN1, and PSEN2 were sequenced in samples from 2125 EOAD cases and controls recruited from 29 ADRCs from January 1, 1984, through December 31, 2015. Data were analyzed from November 23, 2016, through April 10, 2018. Exposures: Clinical diagnosis, age at clinical diagnosis, plasma cholesterol measures (total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol [LDL-C], high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, and apolipoprotein B), and genetic variants in APOE, APP, PSEN1, PSEN2, and APOB. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was the association between EOAD and plasma cholesterol measures. The secondary outcome was the association between EOAD and the burden of genetic variants in APOB. Results: Of the 2125 samples that underwent genetic sequencing, 1276 were from women (60.0%) and 654 (30.8%) were from patients with EOAD (mean [SD] ages, 55.6 [4.3] years for cases and 72.0 [9.6] years for controls). APOE E4 explained 10.1% of the variance of EOAD. After controlling for APOE E4, EOAD cases had higher levels of total cholesterol (mean difference [SE], 21.9 [5.2] mg/dL; P\u2009=\u20092.9\u2009\u00d7\u200910-5), LDL-C (mean difference [SE], 22.0 [4.5] mg/dL; P\u2009=\u20091.8\u2009\u00d7\u200910-6), and ApoB (mean difference [SE], 12.0 [2.4] mg/dL; P\u2009=\u20092.0\u2009\u00d7\u200910-6) than controls in 267 frozen samples. Approximately 3% of EOAD cases carried known AD-causing mutations. Gene-based rare variant burden testing in 2066 samples showed that rare APOB coding variants were significantly more abundant in EOAD cases after adjusting for sex, APOE E4, genetic principal components, ADRC center, and batch (effect size, 0.20; P\u2009=\u20094.20\u2009\u00d7\u200910-4). Conclusions and Relevance: Elevated LDL-C levels were associated with higher probability of having EOAD, and EOAD cases were enriched for rare coding variants in APOB, which codes for the major protein of LDL-C. Collectively, these novel findings highlight the important role of LDL-C in EOAD pathogenesis and suggest a direct link of APOB variants to AD risk. ",
        "Effects of Nilvadipine on Cerebral Blood Flow in Patients With Alzheimer Disease. Cerebrovascular changes, including reduced cerebral blood flow (CBF), occur early in the development of Alzheimer disease and may accelerate disease progression. This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study investigated how 6 months of treatment with the calcium antagonist nilvadipine would affect CBF in patients with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer disease. CBF was measured with magnetic resonance arterial spin labeling in whole-brain gray matter and in a priori defined regions of interest including the hippocampus. Fifty-eight patients were randomly assigned (29 in each group), of whom 22 in both groups had no magnetic resonance exclusion criteria and were medication compliant over 6 months. Mean age was 72.8\u00b16.2 years, mean mini-mental state examination was 20.4\u00b13.4. Nilvadipine treatment lowered systolic blood pressure (\u0394=-11.5 [95% CI, -19.7 to -3.2] mm\u2009Hg; P<0.01), while whole-brain gray-matter CBF remained stable (\u0394=5.4 [95% CI, -6.4 to 17.2] mL/100 g per minute; P=0.36). CBF in the hippocampus increased (left: \u0394=24.4 [95% CI, 4.3-44.5] mL/100 g per minute; P=0.02; right: \u0394=20.1 [95% CI, -0.6 to 40.8] mL/100 g per minute; P=0.06). There was no significant change in CBF in the posterior cingulate cortex (\u0394=5.2 [95% CI, -16.5 to 27.0] mL/100 g per minute; P=0.63) or other regions of interest. In conclusion, nilvadipine reduced blood pressure and increased CBF in the hippocampus, whereas other regions showed stable or small nonsignificant increases in CBF. These findings not only indicate preserved cerebral autoregulation in Alzheimer disease but also point toward beneficial cerebrovascular effects of antihypertensive treatment.

        "Association of Altered Liver Enzymes With Alzheimer Disease Diagnosis, Cognition, Neuroimaging Measures, and Cerebrospinal Fluid Biomarkers. Importance: Increasing evidence suggests an important role of liver function in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer disease (AD). The liver is a major metabolic hub; therefore, investigating the association of liver function with AD, cognition, neuroimaging, and CSF biomarkers would improve the understanding of the role of metabolic dysfunction in AD. Objective: To examine whether liver function markers are associated with cognitive dysfunction and the \"A/T/N\" (amyloid, tau, and neurodegeneration) biomarkers for AD. Design, Setting, and Participants: In this cohort study, serum-based liver function markers were measured from September 1, 2005, to August 31, 2013, in 1581 AD Neuroimaging Initiative participants along with cognitive measures, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers, brain atrophy, brain glucose metabolism, and amyloid-\u03b2 accumulation. Associations of liver function markers with AD-associated clinical and A/T/N biomarkers were assessed using generalized linear models adjusted for confounding variables and multiple comparisons. Statistical analysis was performed from November 1, 2017, to February 28, 2019. Exposures: Five serum-based liver function markers (total bilirubin, albumin, alkaline phosphatase, alanine aminotransferase, and aspartate aminotransferase) from AD Neuroimaging Initiative participants were used as exposure variables. Main Outcomes and Measures: Primary outcomes included diagnosis of AD, composite scores for executive functioning and memory, CSF biomarkers, atrophy measured by magnetic resonance imaging, brain glucose metabolism measured by fludeoxyglucose F 18 (18F) positron emission tomography, and amyloid-\u03b2 accumulation measured by [18F]florbetapir positron emission tomography. Results: Participants in the AD Neuroimaging Initiative (n\u2009=\u20091581; 697 women and 884 men; mean [SD] age, 73.4 [7.2] years) included 407 cognitively normal older adults, 20 with significant memory concern, 298 with early mild cognitive impairment, 544 with late mild cognitive impairment, and 312 with AD. An elevated aspartate aminotransferase (AST) to alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ratio and lower levels of ALT were associated with AD diagnosis (AST to ALT ratio: odds ratio, 7.932 [95% CI, 1.673-37.617]; P\u2009=\u2009.03; ALT: odds ratio, 0.133 [95% CI, 0.042-0.422]; P\u2009=\u2009.004) and poor cognitive performance (AST to ALT ratio: \u03b2 [SE], -0.465 [0.180]; P\u2009=\u2009.02 for memory composite score; \u03b2 [SE], -0.679 [0.215]; P\u2009=\u2009.006 for executive function composite score; ALT: \u03b2 [SE], 0.397 [0.128]; P\u2009=\u2009.006 for memory composite score; \u03b2 [SE], 0.637 [0.152]; P\u2009<\u2009.001 for executive function composite score). Increased AST to ALT ratio values were associated with lower CSF amyloid-\u03b2 1-42 levels (\u03b2 [SE], -0.170 [0.061]; P\u2009=\u2009.04) and increased amyloid-\u03b2 deposition (amyloid biomarkers), higher CSF phosphorylated tau181 (\u03b2 [SE], 0.175 [0.055]; P\u2009=\u2009.02) (tau biomarkers) and higher CSF total tau levels (\u03b2 [SE], 0.160 [0.049]; P\u2009=\u2009.02) and reduced brain glucose metabolism (\u03b2 [SE], -0.123 [0.042]; P\u2009=\u2009.03) (neurodegeneration biomarkers). Lower levels of ALT were associated with increased amyloid-\u03b2 deposition (amyloid biomarkers), and reduced brain glucose metabolism (\u03b2 [SE], 0.096 [0.030]; P\u2009=\u2009.02) and greater atrophy (neurodegeneration biomarkers). Conclusions and Relevance: Consistent associations of serum-based liver function markers with cognitive performance and A/T/N biomarkers for AD highlight the involvement of metabolic disturbances in the pathophysiology of AD. Further studies are needed to determine if these associations represent a causative or secondary role. Liver enzyme involvement in AD opens avenues for novel diagnostics and therapeutics. ",
        "Hemoglobin and anemia in relation to dementia risk and accompanying changes on brain MRI. OBJECTIVE: To determine the long-term association of hemoglobin levels and anemia with risk of dementia, and explore underlying substrates on brain MRI in the general population. METHODS: Serum hemoglobin was measured in 12,305 participants without dementia of the population-based Rotterdam Study (mean age 64.6 years, 57.7% women). We determined risk of dementia and Alzheimer disease (AD) (until 2016) in relation to hemoglobin and anemia. Among 5,267 participants without dementia with brain MRI, we assessed hemoglobin in relation to vascular brain disease, structural connectivity, and global cerebral perfusion. RESULTS: During a mean follow-up of 12.1 years, 1,520 individuals developed dementia, 1,194 of whom had AD. We observed a U-shaped association between hemoglobin levels and dementia (p = 0.005), such that both low and high hemoglobin levels were associated with increased dementia risk (hazard ratio [95% confidence interval (CI)], lowest vs middle quintile 1.29 [1.09-1.52]; highest vs middle quintile 1.20 [1.00-1.44]). Overall prevalence of anemia was 6.1%, and anemia was associated with a 34% increased risk of dementia (95% CI 11%-62%) and 41% (15%-74%) for AD. Among individuals without dementia with brain MRI, similar U-shaped associations were seen of hemoglobin with white matter hyperintensity volume (p = 0.03), and structural connectivity (for mean diffusivity, p < 0.0001), but not with presence of cortical and lacunar infarcts. Cerebral microbleeds were more common with anemia. Hemoglobin levels inversely correlated to cerebral perfusion (p < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: Low and high levels of hemoglobin are associated with an increased risk of dementia, including AD, which may relate to differences in white matter integrity and cerebral perfusion. ",
        "Sex-specific norms for verbal memory tests may improve diagnostic accuracy of amnestic MCI. OBJECTIVE: To examine whether the use of sex-specific norms and cut scores to identify memory impairment improves diagnostic accuracy of amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) compared to non-sex-specific (typical) norms/cut scores given the female advantage in verbal memory. METHODS: We calculated sex-specific and typical norms/cut scores (age and education specific) for impairment on the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test in the Mayo Clinic Study of Aging. Norms/cut scores were applied to 453 women and 532 men from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. We compared sex differences in rates of aMCI (Jak/Bondi criteria) for sex-specific vs typical norms/cut scores. Using sex-specific cut scores as the true condition and typical cut scores as the predicted condition, we categorized participants as true positives (TPs), false positives (FPs), true negative (TNs), or false negative (FNs). In cross-sectional analyses within sex, we compared positivity rates of CSF hyperphosphorylated tau/\u03b2-amyloid (A\u03b2) and cortical A\u03b2 deposition ([18F]AV45 PET) and APOE \u03b54 frequency among diagnostic comparison groups. RESULTS: The frequency of aMCI was higher in men when using typical norms/cut scores. Using sex-adjusted norms/cut scores led to the identification of 10% FNs (missed aMCI cases) among women and 10% FPs among men. Biomarker analyses supported the hypothesis that sex-specific diagnostic criteria improves diagnostic accuracy. Biomarkers rates were higher in FNs vs TNs and similar in FNs and TPs. Biomarker rates were lower in FPs vs TPs and similar between FPs and TNs. CONCLUSION: Results suggest that non-sex-specific aMCI diagnostic criteria led to a 20% diagnostic error rate. Accounting for sex differences in verbal memory performance may improve aMCI classification. ",
        "Minocycline at 2 Different Dosages vs Placebo for Patients With Mild Alzheimer Disease: A Randomized Clinical Trial. Importance: There are no disease-modifying treatments for Alzheimer disease (AD), the most common cause of dementia. Minocycline is anti-inflammatory, protects against the toxic effects of \u03b2-amyloid in vitro and in animal models of AD, and is a credible repurposed treatment candidate. Objective: To determine whether 24 months of minocycline treatment can modify cognitive and functional decline in patients with mild AD. Design, Setting, and Participants: Participants were recruited into a double-blind randomized clinical trial from May 23, 2014, to April 14, 2016, with 24 months of treatment and follow-up. This multicenter study in England and Scotland involved 32 National Health Service memory clinics within secondary specialist services for people with dementia. From 886 screened patients, 554 patients with a diagnosis of mild AD (Standardised Mini-Mental State Examination [sMMSE] score \u226524) were randomized. Interventions: Participants were randomly allocated 1:1:1 in a semifactorial design to receive minocycline (400 mg/d or 200 mg/d) or placebo for 24 months. Main Outcomes and Measures: Primary outcome measures were decrease in sMMSE score and Bristol Activities of Daily Living Scale (BADLS), analyzed by intention-to-treat repeated-measures regression. Results: Of 544 eligible participants (241 women and 303 men), the mean (SD) age was 74.3 (8.2) years, and the mean (SD) sMMSE score was 26.4 (1.9). Fewer participants completed 400-mg minocycline hydrochloride treatment (28.8% [53 of 184]) than 200-mg minocycline treatment (61.9% [112 of 181]) or placebo (63.7% [114 of 179]; P\u2009<\u2009.001), mainly because of gastrointestinal symptoms (42 in the 400-mg group, 15 in the 200-mg group, and 10 in the placebo group; P\u2009<\u2009.001), dermatologic adverse effects (10 in the 400-mg group, 5 in the 200-mg group, and 1 in the placebo group; P\u2009=\u2009.02), and dizziness (14 in the 400-mg group, 3 in the 200-mg group, and 1 in the placebo group; P\u2009=\u2009.01). Assessment rates were lower in the 400-mg group: 68.4% (119 of 174 expected) for sMMSE at 24 months compared with 81.8% (144 of 176) for the 200-mg group and 83.8% (140 of 167) for the placebo group. Decrease in sMMSE scores over 24 months in the combined minocycline group was similar to that in the placebo group (4.1 vs 4.3 points). The combined minocycline group had mean sMMSE scores 0.1 points higher than the placebo group (95% CI, -1.1 to 1.2; P\u2009=\u2009.90). The decrease in mean sMMSE scores was less in the 400-mg group than in the 200-mg group (3.3 vs 4.7 points; treatment effect\u2009=\u20091.2; 95% CI, -0.1 to 2.5; P\u2009=\u2009.08). Worsening of BADLS scores over 24 months was similar in all groups: 5.7 in the 400-mg group, 6.6 in the 200-mg group, and 6.2 in the placebo groups (treatment effect for minocycline vs placebo\u2009=\u2009-0.53; 95% CI, -2.4 to 1.3; P\u2009=\u2009.57; treatment effect for 400 mg vs 200 mg of minocycline\u2009=\u2009-0.31; 95% CI, -0.2 to 1.8; P\u2009=\u2009.77). Results were similar in different patient subgroups and in sensitivity analyses adjusting for missing data. Conclusions and Relevance: Minocycline did not delay the progress of cognitive or functional impairment in people with mild AD during a 2-year period. This study also found that 400 mg of minocycline is poorly tolerated in this population. Trial Registration: isrctn.org Identifier: ISRCTN16105064. ",
        "Efficacy and Safety of Lanabecestat for Treatment of Early and Mild Alzheimer Disease: The AMARANTH and DAYBREAK-ALZ Randomized Clinical Trials. Importance: Alzheimer disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by cognitive deterioration and impaired activities of daily living. Current treatments provide only minor symptomatic improvements with limited benefit duration. Lanabecestat, a brain-permeable inhibitor of human beta-site amyloid precursor protein-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1/\u03b2-secretase), was developed to modify the clinical course of AD by slowing disease progression. Objective: To assess whether lanabecestat slows the progression of AD compared with placebo in patients with early AD (mild cognitive impairment) and mild AD dementia. Design, Setting, and Participants: AMARANTH (first patient visit on September 30, 2014; last patient visit on October 4, 2018) and DAYBREAK-ALZ (first patient visit on July 1, 2016; last patient visit on September 28, 2018) were randomized, placebo-controlled, phase 2/3 and phase 3 clinical trials lasting 104 weeks and 78 weeks, respectively. AMARANTH and DAYBREAK-ALZ were multicenter, global, double-blind studies conducted at 257 and 251 centers, respectively, located in 15 and 18 countries or territories, respectively. A population-based sample of men and women aged 55 to 85 years who met National Institute on Aging-Alzheimer's Association criteria for early AD or mild AD dementia was screened using cognitive assessments, and the presence of amyloid was confirmed. Patients were excluded for unstable medical conditions or medication use, significant cerebrovascular pathologic findings, or a history of vitiligo and/or current evidence of postinflammatory hypopigmentation. AMARANTH screened 6871 patients; 2218 (32.3%) were randomized, and 539 patients completed the study. DAYBREAK-ALZ screened 5706 patients; 1722 (30.2%) were randomized, and 76 patients completed the study. Interventions: Patients were randomized (1:1:1) to once-daily oral doses of lanabecestat (20 mg), lanabecestat (50 mg), or placebo. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome measure was change from baseline on the 13-item Alzheimer Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale. Secondary outcomes included Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study-Instrumental Activities of Daily Living Inventory, Clinical Dementia Rating, Functional Activities Questionnaire, Mini-Mental State Examination, and Neuropsychiatric Inventory. Efficacy analyses were conducted on the intent-to-treat population. Results: Among 2218 AMARANTH patients, the mean (SD) age was 71.3 (7.1) years, and 1177 of 2218 (53.1%) were women. Among 1722 DAYBREAK-ALZ patients, the mean (SD) age was 72.3 (7.0) years, and 1023 of 1722 (59.4%) were women. Both studies were terminated early after futility analysis. There were no consistent, reproducible dose-related findings on primary or secondary efficacy measures. Psychiatric adverse events, weight loss, and hair color changes were reported in a higher percentage of patients receiving lanabecestat than placebo. Conclusions and Relevance: Treatment with lanabecestat was well tolerated and did not slow cognitive or functional decline.

        "Objective subtle cognitive difficulties predict future amyloid accumulation and neurodegeneration. OBJECTIVE: To determine the temporal sequence of objectively defined subtle cognitive difficulties (Obj-SCD) in relation to amyloidosis and neurodegeneration, the current study examined the trajectories of amyloid PET and medial temporal neurodegeneration in participants with Obj-SCD relative to cognitively normal (CN) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) groups. METHOD: A total of 747 Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative participants (305 CN, 153 Obj-SCD, 289 MCI) underwent neuropsychological testing and serial amyloid PET and structural MRI examinations. Linear mixed effects models examined 4-year rate of change in cortical 18F-florbetapir PET, entorhinal cortex thickness, and hippocampal volume in those classified as Obj-SCD and MCI relative to CN. RESULT: Amyloid accumulation was faster in the Obj-SCD group than in the CN group; the MCI and CN groups did not significantly differ from each other. The Obj-SCD and MCI groups both demonstrated faster entorhinal cortical thinning relative to the CN group; only the MCI group exhibited faster hippocampal atrophy than CN participants. CONCLUSION: Relative to CN participants, Obj-SCD was associated with faster amyloid accumulation and selective vulnerability of entorhinal cortical thinning, whereas MCI was associated with faster entorhinal and hippocampal atrophy. Findings suggest that Obj-SCD, operationally defined using sensitive neuropsychological measures, can be identified prior to or during the preclinical stage of amyloid deposition. Further, consistent with the Braak neurofibrillary staging scheme, Obj-SCD status may track with early entorhinal pathologic changes, whereas MCI may track with more widespread medial temporal change. Thus, Obj-SCD may be a sensitive and noninvasive predictor of encroaching amyloidosis and neurodegeneration, prior to frank cognitive impairment associated with MCI. ",
        "Association of HLA Antigen Mismatch With Risk of Developing Skin Cancer After Solid-Organ Transplant. Importance: Risk factors for the development of skin cancer after solid-organ transplant can inform clinical care, but data on these risk factors are limited. Objective: To study the association between HLA antigen mismatch and skin cancer incidence after solid-organ transplant. Design, Setting, and Participants: This retrospective cohort study is a secondary analysis of the multicenter Transplant Skin Cancer Network study of 10\u202f649 adults who underwent a primary solid-organ transplant between January 1, 2003, and December 31, 2003, or between January 1, 2008, and December 31, 2008. These participants were identified through the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients standard analysis files, which contain data collected mostly by the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network. Participants were matched to skin cancer outcomes by medical record review. This study was conducted from August 1, 2016, to July 31, 2017. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was time to diagnosis of posttransplant skin cancer, including squamous cell carcinoma, melanoma, and Merkel cell carcinoma. The HLA antigen mismatch was calculated based on the 2016 Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network guidelines. Risk of skin cancer was analyzed using a multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression model. Results: In total, 10\u202f649 organ transplant recipients (6776 men [63.6%], with a mean [SD] age of 51 [12] years) contributed 59\u202f923 years of follow-up. For each additional mismatched allele, a 7% to 8% reduction in skin cancer risk was found (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 0.93; 95% CI, 0.87-0.99; P\u2009=\u2009.01). Subgroup analysis found the protective effect of HLA antigen mismatch to be statistically significant in lung (adjusted HR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.56-0.87; P\u2009=\u2009.001) and heart (adjusted HR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.60-0.93; P\u2009=\u2009.008) transplant recipients but not for recipients of liver, kidney, or pancreas. The degree of HLA-DR mismatch, but not HLA-A or HLA-B mismatch, was the most statistically significant for skin cancer risk (adjusted HR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.74-0.97; P\u2009=\u2009.01). Conclusions and Relevance: The HLA antigen mismatch appears to be associated with reductions in the risk of skin cancer after solid-organ transplant among heart and lung transplant recipients; this finding suggests that HLA antigen mismatch activates the tumor surveillance mechanisms that protect against skin cancer in transplant recipients and that skin cancer risk may be higher in patients who received a well-matched organ.

        "Association of Autism Spectrum Disorder With Prenatal Exposure to Medication Affecting Neurotransmitter Systems. Importance: Prenatal exposure to certain medications has been hypothesized to influence the risk of autism spectrum disorders (ASD). However, the underlying effects on the neurotransmitter systems have not been comprehensively assessed. Objective: To investigate the association of early-life interference with different neurotransmitter systems by prenatal medication exposure on the risk of ASD in offspring. Design, Setting, and Participants: This case-control study included children born from January 1, 1997, through December 31, 2007, and followed up for ASD until January 26, 2015, within a single Israeli health maintenance organization. Using publicly available data, 55 groups of medications affecting neurotransmitter systems and prescribed to pregnant women in this sample were identified. Children prenatally exposed to medications were compared with nonexposed children. Data were analyzed from March 1, 2017, through June 20, 2018. Main Outcome and Measures: Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs of ASD risk associated with exposure to medication groups using Cox proportional hazards regression, adjusted for the relevant confounders (eg, birth year, maternal age, maternal history of psychiatric and neurologic disorders, or maternal number of all medical diagnoses 1 year before pregnancy). Results: The analytic sample consisted of 96\u202f249 individuals (1405 cases; 94\u202f844 controls; mean [SD] age at the end of follow-up, 11.6 [3.1] years; 48.8% female), including 1405 with ASD and 94\u202f844 controls. Of 34 groups of medications, 5 showed nominally statistically significant association with ASD in fully adjusted models. Evidence of confounding effects of the number of maternal diagnoses on the association between offspring exposure to medication and ASD was found. Adjusting for this factor, lower estimates of ASD risk among children exposed to cannabinoid receptor agonists (HR,\u20090.72; 95% CI, 0.55-0.95; P\u2009=\u2009.02), muscarinic receptor 2 agonists (HR,\u20090.49; 95% CI, 0.24-0.98; P\u2009= .04), opioid receptor \u03ba and \u03b5 agonists (HR,\u20090.67; 95% CI, 0.45-0.99; P\u2009=\u2009.045), or \u03b12C-adrenergic receptor agonists (HR,\u20090.43; 95% CI, 0.19-0.96; P\u2009=\u2009.04) were observed. Exposure to antagonists of neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor \u03b1 was associated with higher estimates of ASD risk (HR,\u200912.94; 95% CI, 1.35-124.25; P\u2009=\u2009.03). Conclusions and Relevance: Most of the medications affecting neurotransmitter systems in this sample had no association with the estimates of ASD risk. Replication and/or validation using experimental techniques are required. ",
        "Atrial fibrillation, antithrombotic treatment, and cognitive aging: A population-based study. OBJECTIVE: To examine the association of atrial fibrillation (AF) with cognitive decline and dementia in old age, and to explore the cognitive benefit of antithrombotic treatment in patients with AF. METHODS: This population-based cohort study included 2,685 dementia-free participants from the Swedish National Study on Aging and Care in Kungsholmen, who were regularly examined from 2001-2004 to 2010-2013. AF was ascertained from clinical examination, ECG, and patient registry. Global cognitive function was assessed using the Mini-Mental State Examination. We followed the DSM-IV criteria for the diagnosis of dementia, the NINDS-AIREN (National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke and Association Internationale pour la Recherch\u00e9 et l'Enseignement en Neurosciences) criteria for vascular dementia, and the NINCDS-ADRDA (National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke and the Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association) criteria for Alzheimer disease. Data were analyzed using multiple linear mixed-effects and Cox regression models. RESULTS: We identified 243 participants (9.1%) with AF at baseline. During the 9-year follow-up period, 279 participants (11.4%) developed AF and 399 (14.9%) developed dementia. As a time-varying variable, AF was significantly associated with a faster annual Mini-Mental State Examination decline (\u03b2 coefficient = -0.24, 95% confidence interval [CI]: -0.31 to -0.16) and an increased hazard ratio (HR) of all-cause dementia (HR = 1.40, 95% CI: 1.11-1.77) and vascular and mixed dementia (HR = 1.88, 95% CI: 1.09-3.23), but not Alzheimer disease (HR = 1.33, 95% CI: 0.92-1.94). Among people with either prevalent or incident AF, use of anticoagulant drugs, but not antiplatelet treatment, was associated with a 60% decreased risk of dementia (HR = 0.40, 95% CI: 0.18-0.92). CONCLUSION: AF is associated with a faster global cognitive decline and an increased risk of dementia in older people. Use of anticoagulant drugs may reduce dementia risk in patients with AF. ",
        "Assessment of Use of Combined Dextromethorphan and Quinidine in Patients With Dementia or Parkinson Disease After US Food and Drug Administration Approval for Pseudobulbar Affect. Importance: In 2010, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved a combination of dextromethorphan hydrobromide and quinidine sulfate for the treatment of pseudobulbar affect after studies in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) or multiple sclerosis (MS). This medication, however, may be commonly prescribed in patients with dementia and/or Parkinson disease (PD). Objective: To investigate the prescribing patterns of dextromethorphan-quinidine, including trends in associated costs. Design, Setting, and Participants: This population-based cohort study of patients prescribed dextromethorphan-quinidine used data from 2 commercial insurance databases, Optum Clinformatics Data Mart and Truven Health MarketScan. The Medicare Part D Prescription Drug Program data set was used to evaluate numbers of prescriptions and total reported spending by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. Patients were included if they were prescribed dextromethorphan-quinidine from October 29, 2010, when the drug was approved, through March 1, 2017, for Optum and December 31, 2015, for Truven. Data were analyzed from December 1, 2017, through August 1, 2018. Main Outcomes and Measures: The proportion of patients prescribed dextromethorphan-quinidine with a diagnosis of MS, ALS, or dementia and/or PD, as well as the number of patients with a history of heart failure (a contraindication for the drug). Results: In the commercial health care databases, 12 858 patients filled a prescription for dextromethorphan-quinidine during the study period. Mean (SD) age was 66.0 (18.5) years, 66.7% were women, and 13.3% had a history of heart failure. Combining results from both databases, few patients had a diagnosis of MS (8.4%) or ALS (6.8%); most (57.0%) had a diagnosis of dementia and/or PD. In the Medicare Part D database, the number of patients prescribed dextromethorphan-quinidine increased 15.3-fold, from 3296 in 2011 to 50 402 in 2016. Reported spending by Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services on this medication increased from $3.9 million in 2011 to $200.4 million in 2016. Conclusions and Relevance: Despite approval by the FDA for pseudobulbar affect based on studies of patients with ALS or MS, dextromethorphan-quinidine appears to be primarily prescribed for patients with dementia and/or PD.

        "Association of body mass index and waist-to-hip ratio with brain structure: UK Biobank study. OBJECTIVE: To examine the association of body mass index (BMI) and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) with brain volume. METHODS: We used cross-sectional data from the UK Biobank study (n = 9,652, age 55.4 \u00b1 7.5 years, 47.9% men). Measures included BMI, WHR, and total fat mass as ascertained from bioimpedance. Brain images were produced with structural MRI. RESULTS: After adjustment for a range of covariates, higher levels of all obesity measures were related to lower gray matter volume: BMI per 1 SD (\u03b2 coefficient -4,113, 95% confidence interval [CI] -4,862 to -3,364), WHR (\u03b2 coefficient -4,272, 95% CI -5,280 to -3,264), and fat mass (\u03b2 coefficient -4,590, 95% CI -5,386 to -3,793). The combination of overall obesity (BMI \u226530 kg/m2) and central obesity (WHR >0.85 for women, >0.90 for men) was associated with the lowest gray matter compared with that in lean adults. In hypothesis-free testing with a Bonferroni correction, obesity was also related to various regional brain volumes, including caudate, putamen, pallidum, and nucleus accumbens. No associations between obesity and white matter were apparent. CONCLUSION: The combination of heightened BMI and WHR may be an important risk factor for gray matter atrophy. ",
        "Blood-brain barrier breakdown is an early biomarker of human cognitive dysfunction. Vascular contributions to cognitive impairment are increasingly recognized1-5 as shown by neuropathological6,7, neuroimaging4,8-11, and cerebrospinal fluid biomarker4,12 studies. Moreover, small vessel disease of the brain has been estimated to contribute to approximately 50% of all dementias worldwide, including those caused by Alzheimer's disease (AD)3,4,13. Vascular changes in AD have been typically attributed to the vasoactive and/or vasculotoxic effects of amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2)3,11,14, and more recently tau15. Animal studies suggest that A\u03b2 and tau lead to blood vessel abnormalities and blood-brain barrier (BBB) breakdown14-16. Although neurovascular dysfunction3,11 and BBB breakdown develop early in AD1,4,5,8-10,12,13, how they relate to changes in the AD classical biomarkers A\u03b2 and tau, which also develop before dementia17, remains unknown. To address this question, we studied brain capillary damage using a novel cerebrospinal fluid biomarker of BBB-associated capillary mural cell pericyte, soluble platelet-derived growth factor receptor-\u03b28,18, and regional BBB permeability using dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging8-10. Our data show that individuals with early cognitive dysfunction develop brain capillary damage and BBB breakdown in the hippocampus irrespective of Alzheimer's A\u03b2 and/or tau biomarker changes, suggesting that BBB breakdown is an early biomarker of human cognitive dysfunction independent of A\u03b2 and tau.

        "Effect of Intensive vs Standard Blood Pressure Control on Probable Dementia: A Randomized Clinical Trial. Importance: There are currently no proven treatments to reduce the risk of mild cognitive impairment and dementia. Objective: To evaluate the effect of intensive blood pressure control on risk of dementia. Design, Setting, and Participants: Randomized clinical trial conducted at 102 sites in the United States and Puerto Rico among adults aged 50 years or older with hypertension but without diabetes or history of stroke. Randomization began on November 8, 2010. The trial was stopped early for benefit on its primary outcome (a composite of cardiovascular events) and all-cause mortality on August 20, 2015. The final date for follow-up of cognitive outcomes was July 22, 2018. Interventions: Participants were randomized to a systolic blood pressure goal of either less than 120 mm Hg (intensive treatment group; n\u2009=\u20094678) or less than 140 mm Hg (standard treatment group; n\u2009=\u20094683). Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary cognitive outcome was occurrence of adjudicated probable dementia. Secondary cognitive outcomes included adjudicated mild cognitive impairment and a composite outcome of mild cognitive impairment or probable dementia. Results: Among 9361 randomized participants (mean age, 67.9 years; 3332 women [35.6%]), 8563 (91.5%) completed at least 1 follow-up cognitive assessment. The median intervention period was 3.34 years. During a total median follow-up of 5.11 years, adjudicated probable dementia occurred in 149 participants in the intensive treatment group vs 176 in the standard treatment group (7.2 vs 8.6 cases per 1000 person-years; hazard ratio [HR], 0.83; 95% CI, 0.67-1.04). Intensive BP control significantly reduced the risk of mild cognitive impairment (14.6 vs 18.3 cases per 1000 person-years; HR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.69-0.95) and the combined rate of mild cognitive impairment or probable dementia (20.2 vs 24.1 cases per 1000 person-years; HR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.74-0.97). Conclusions and Relevance: Among ambulatory adults with hypertension, treating to a systolic blood pressure goal of less than 120 mm Hg compared with a goal of less than 140 mm Hg did not result in a significant reduction in the risk of probable dementia. Because of early study termination and fewer than expected cases of dementia, the study may have been underpowered for this end point. Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01206062.

        "Education and cognitive reserve in old age. OBJECTIVE: To assess the contribution of education to cognitive reserve. METHODS: Analyses are based on older participants in a longitudinal clinical-pathologic cohort study who had annual cognitive testing (n = 2,899) and subgroups that developed incident dementia (n = 696), died, and underwent a neuropathologic examination from which 10 neurodegenerative and cerebrovascular markers were derived (n = 752), or both (n = 405). Cognitive test scores were converted to a standard scale and averaged to yield composite measures of cognition. RESULTS: Participants had a mean of 16.3 years of education (SD = 3.7, range 0-30). In all participants, education was associated with initial level of global cognition but not rate of cognitive change. In those who developed dementia, rate of global cognitive decline accelerated a mean of 1.8 years before the diagnosis, but education was not related to the onset or rate of accelerated decline. In the deceased, rate of global cognitive decline accelerated a mean of 3.4 years before death, but higher educational attainment was related to earlier (not later) onset of accelerated decline and unrelated to rate of acceleration. Higher education was associated with lower likelihood of gross and microscopic cerebral infarcts but not with other neuropathologic markers. Education was not related to global cognitive change not attributable to neuropathologic burden and did not decrease the association of higher neuropathologic burden with more rapid cognitive decline. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that the contribution of education to cognitive reserve is limited to its association with level of cognitive function before old age. ",
        "Findings of Impaired Hearing in Patients With Nonfluent/Agrammatic Variant Primary Progressive Aphasia. Importance: Despite being characterized as a disorder of language production, nonfluent/agrammatic variant primary progressive aphasia (nfvPPA) is frequently associated with auditory symptoms. However, to our knowledge, peripheral auditory function has not been defined in this condition. Objective: To assess peripheral hearing function in individuals with nfvPPA compared with healthy older individuals and patients with Alzheimer disease (AD). Design, Setting, and Participants: This cross-sectional single-center study was conducted at the Dementia Research Centre of University College London between August 2015 and July 2018. A consecutive cohort of patients with nfvPPA and patients with AD were compared with healthy control participants. No participant had substantial otological or cerebrovascular disease; all eligible patients fulfilling diagnostic criteria and able to comply with audiometry were included. Main Outcomes and Measures: We measured mean threshold sound levels required to detect pure tones at frequencies of 500, 1000, 2000, 4000, and 6000 Hz in the left and right ears separately; these were used to generate better-ear mean and worse-ear mean composite hearing threshold scores and interaural difference scores for each participant. All analyses were adjusted for participant age. Results: We studied 19 patients with nfvPPA (9 female; mean [SD] age, 70.3 [9.0] years), 20 patients with AD (9 female; mean [SD] age, 69.4 [8.1] years) and 34 control participants (15 female; mean [SD] age, 66.7 [6.3] years). The patients with nfvPPA had significantly higher scores than control participants on better-ear mean scores (patients with nfvPPA: mean [SD], 36.3 [9.4] decibels [dB]; control participants: 28.9 [7.3] dB; age-adjusted difference, 5.7 [95% CI, 1.4-10.0] dB; P\u2009=\u2009.01) and worse-ear mean scores (patients with nfvPPA: 42.2 [11.5] dB; control participants: 31.7 [8.1] dB; age-adjusted difference, 8.5 [95% CI, 3.6-13.4] dB; P\u2009=\u2009.001). The patients with nfvPPA also had significantly higher better-ear mean scores than patients with AD (patients with AD: mean [SD] 31.1 [7.5] dB; age-adjusted difference, 4.8 [95% CI, 0.0-9.6] dB; P\u2009=\u2009.048) and worse-ear mean scores (patients with AD: mean [SD], 33.8 [8.2] dB; age-adjusted difference, 7.8 [95% CI, 2.4-13.2] dB; P\u2009=\u2009.005). The difference scores (worse-ear mean minus better-ear mean) were significantly higher in the patients with nfvPPA (mean [SD], 5.9 [5.2] dB) than control participants (mean [SD], 2.8 [2.2] dB; age-adjusted difference, 2.8 [95% CI, 0.9-4.7] dB; P\u2009=\u2009.004) and patients with AD (mean [SD], 2.8 [2.1] dB; age-adjusted difference, 3.0 [95% CI, 0.9-5.1] dB; P\u2009=\u2009.005). Conclusions and Relevance: In this study, patients with nfvPPA performed worse on pure-tone audiometry than healthy older individuals or patients with AD, and the difference was not attributable to age or general disease factors. Cases of nfvPPA were additionally associated with increased functional interaural audiometric asymmetry. These findings suggest conjoint peripheral afferent and more central regulatory auditory dysfunction in individuals with nfvPPA. ",
        "Systemic inflammation during midlife and cognitive change over 20 years: The ARIC Study. OBJECTIVE: To examine the association between systemic inflammation measured during midlife and 20-year cognitive decline. METHODS: Within the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities cohort study, inflammatory biomarkers were measured during middle adulthood. We created an inflammation composite score using 4 blood biomarkers measured at visit 1 (fibrinogen, white blood cell count, von Willebrand factor, and factor VIII); we measured C-reactive protein (CRP) at visit 2. Cognition was assessed over 3 visits spanning 20 years using measures of memory, executive function, and language. RESULTS: A total of 12,336 participants (baseline age 56.8 [5.7], 21% black, 56% women) were included. After adjusting for demographic variables, vascular risk factors, and comorbidities, each standard deviation (SD) increase in midlife inflammation composite score was associated with an additional 20-year decline of -0.035 SD (95% confidence interval: -0.062 to -0.007) on the cognitive composite score. We found a similar association between each SD increase in midlife CRP level and additional 20-year cognitive decline (-0.038 SD, 95% confidence interval: -0.057 to -0.019). Participants with a midlife inflammation composite score in the top quartile had a 7.8% steeper cognitive decline, compared to participants in the lowest quartile; CRP in the top quartile was associated with an 11.6% steeper cognitive decline. In cognitive domain-specific analyses, elevated midlife inflammatory markers were most consistently associated with declines in memory. Results were similar after adjusting for attrition using inverse probability weighting. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings highlight what may be an early pathogenic role for systemic inflammation as a driver of cognitive decline in the decades leading up to older adulthood. ",
        "Cognitive and physical activity and dementia: A 44-year longitudinal population study of women. OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether cognitive and physical activities in midlife are associated with reduced risk of dementia and dementia subtypes in women followed for 44 years. METHODS: A population-based sample of 800 women aged 38-54 years (mean age 47 years) was followed from 1968 to 2012. Cognitive (artistic, intellectual, manual, religious, and club) and physical activity were assessed at baseline. During follow-up, dementia (n = 194), Alzheimer disease (n = 102), vascular dementia (n = 27), mixed dementia (n = 41), and dementia with cerebrovascular disease (n = 81) were diagnosed according to established criteria based on information from neuropsychiatric examinations, informant interviews, hospital records, and registry data. Cox regression models were used with adjustment for age, education, socioeconomic status, hypertension, body mass index, cigarette smoking, diabetes mellitus, angina pectoris, stress, and major depression. RESULTS: We found that cognitive activity in midlife was associated with a reduced risk of total dementia (hazard ratio [HR] 0.66; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.49-0.89) and Alzheimer disease (HR 0.54; 95% CI 0.36-0.82) during follow-up. Physical activity in midlife was associated with a reduced risk of mixed dementia (HR 0.43; 95% CI 0.22-0.86) and dementia with cerebrovascular disease (HR 0.47; 95% CI 0.28-0.78). The results were similar after excluding those who developed dementia before 1990 (n = 21), except that physical activity was then also associated with reduced risk of total dementia (HR 0.67; 95% CI 0.46-0.99). CONCLUSION: Our findings suggests that midlife cognitive and physical activities are independently associated with reduced risk of dementia and dementia subtypes. The results indicate that these midlife activities may have a role in preserving cognitive health in old age. ",
        "Association of HLA Antigen Mismatch With Risk of Developing Skin Cancer After Solid-Organ Transplant. Importance: Risk factors for the development of skin cancer after solid-organ transplant can inform clinical care, but data on these risk factors are limited. Objective: To study the association between HLA antigen mismatch and skin cancer incidence after solid-organ transplant. Design, Setting, and Participants: This retrospective cohort study is a secondary analysis of the multicenter Transplant Skin Cancer Network study of 10\u202f649 adults who underwent a primary solid-organ transplant between January 1, 2003, and December 31, 2003, or between January 1, 2008, and December 31, 2008. These participants were identified through the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients standard analysis files, which contain data collected mostly by the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network. Participants were matched to skin cancer outcomes by medical record review. This study was conducted from August 1, 2016, to July 31, 2017. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was time to diagnosis of posttransplant skin cancer, including squamous cell carcinoma, melanoma, and Merkel cell carcinoma. The HLA antigen mismatch was calculated based on the 2016 Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network guidelines. Risk of skin cancer was analyzed using a multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression model. Results: In total, 10\u202f649 organ transplant recipients (6776 men [63.6%], with a mean [SD] age of 51 [12] years) contributed 59\u202f923 years of follow-up. For each additional mismatched allele, a 7% to 8% reduction in skin cancer risk was found (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 0.93; 95% CI, 0.87-0.99; P\u2009=\u2009.01). Subgroup analysis found the protective effect of HLA antigen mismatch to be statistically significant in lung (adjusted HR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.56-0.87; P\u2009=\u2009.001) and heart (adjusted HR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.60-0.93; P\u2009=\u2009.008) transplant recipients but not for recipients of liver, kidney, or pancreas. The degree of HLA-DR mismatch, but not HLA-A or HLA-B mismatch, was the most statistically significant for skin cancer risk (adjusted HR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.74-0.97; P\u2009=\u2009.01). Conclusions and Relevance: The HLA antigen mismatch appears to be associated with reductions in the risk of skin cancer after solid-organ transplant among heart and lung transplant recipients; this finding suggests that HLA antigen mismatch activates the tumor surveillance mechanisms that protect against skin cancer in transplant recipients and that skin cancer risk may be higher in patients who received a well-matched organ.

        "Advantaged socioeconomic conditions in childhood are associated with higher cognitive functioning but stronger cognitive decline in older age. Cognitive aging is characterized by large heterogeneity, which may be due to variations in childhood socioeconomic conditions (CSC). Although there is substantial evidence for an effect of CSC on levels of cognitive functioning at older age, results on associations with cognitive decline are mixed. We examined by means of an accelerated longitudinal design the association between CSC and cognitive trajectories from 50 to 96 years. Cognition included two functions generally found to decline with aging: delayed recall and verbal fluency. Data are from six waves of the Survey of Health, Aging, and Retirement in Europe (SHARE), conducted between 2004 and 2015 (n = 24,066 at baseline; 56% female, age 50+). We found a consistent CSC pattern in levels of cognitive functioning in later life. Older people with disadvantaged CSC had lower levels of cognitive functioning than those with more advantaged CSC. We also find that decline is almost 1.6 times faster in the most advantaged group compared with the most disadvantaged group. The faster decline for people with more advantaged CSC becomes less pronounced when we additionally control for adulthood socioeconomic conditions and current levels of physical activity, depressive symptoms, and partner status. Our findings are in line with the latency, pathway, and cumulative model and lend support to theories of cognitive reserve, stating that neuronal loss can no longer be repaired in people with more cognitive reserve once the underlying pathology is substantial and speed of decline is accelerated.

        "Association of Neuropathologically Confirmed Frontotemporal Dementia and Alzheimer Disease With Criminal and Socially Inappropriate Behavior in a Swedish Cohort. Importance: Criminal and socially inappropriate behavior is encountered among patients with dementia, and it is sometimes the first sign of a dementing disorder. This behavior constitutes a significant burden to society, patients' relatives, and patients themselves. Objectives: To investigate and compare the prevalence and type of criminal and socially inappropriate behavior, as well as recurrence of criminal behavior, associated with Alzheimer disease (AD) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) neuropathologically verified post mortem, and to assess whether there is a specific type of protein pathology more closely associated with criminal behavior in patients with FTD. Design, Setting, and Participants: Cohort study using medical record review of 220 Swedish patients with a postmortem neuropathologic diagnosis of AD (n\u2009=\u2009101) or frontotemporal lobar degeneration (n\u2009=\u2009119) (hereinafter referred to as FTD) diagnosed between January 1, 1967, and December 31, 2017. Main Outcomes and Measures: Patient notes containing reports of criminal and socially inappropriate behavior, as well as data on dominant protein pathology for patients with FTD, were duly reviewed and recorded. The Fisher exact test or logistic regression was used to assess possible differences between groups. Results: Of the 220 patients studied, 128 (58.2%) were female, the median (range) age at disease onset was 63 (30-88) years and at death was 72 (34-96) years, and the median (range) disease duration was 9 (1-28) years. Instances of criminal behavior were found in 65 of the 220 patients (29.5%): in 15 of the 101 patients (14.9%) with AD and 50 of the 119 patients (42.0%) with FTD (P\u2009<\u2009.001). Recurrence of criminal behavior was significantly higher in the FTD group (89.0%) than in the AD group (53.3%) (P\u2009=\u2009.04). Instances of socially inappropriate behavior were found in 57 patients (56.4%) with AD and 89 (74.8%) with FTD (P\u2009=\u2009.004). An expression of non-tau pathology increased the odds for criminal behavior by a factor of 9.0 (95% CI, 3.4-24.0) among patients with FTD. Conclusions and Relevance: These results suggest that criminal and socially inappropriate behaviors may be more prevalent and criminal behaviors may be more recurrent in patients with FTD than in those with AD. Non-tau pathology, but not tau pathology, appears to be associated with criminal behavior. These findings may help with the clinical diagnostic process. ",
        "Association Between Caregiver Depression and Emergency Department Use Among Patients With Dementia. Importance: Current attempts to gauge the acute care needs of patients with dementia have not effectively addressed the role of caregivers, despite their extensive involvement in decisions about acute care management. Objective: To determine whether caregiver depression is associated with increased use of the emergency department (ED) among patients with dementia. Design, Setting, and Participants: This longitudinal cohort study used data from the Care Ecosystem study, a randomized clinical trial examining telephone-based supportive care for patients with dementia and their caregivers. Patients were 45 years or older with any type of dementia. A total of 780 caregiver-patient dyads were enrolled from March 20, 2015, until February 28, 2017, and 663 dyads contributed baseline and 6-month data and were included in the analysis. Exposures: Caregiver depression (9-item Patient Health Questionnaire score of \u226510). Secondary analyses examined caregiver burden and self-efficacy. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was the number of ED visits in a 6-month period. Results: Among the 663 caregivers (467 women and 196 men; mean [SD] age, 64.9 [11.8] years), 84 caregivers (12.7%) had depression at baseline. The mean incidence rate of ED visits was 0.9 per person-year. Rates of ED presentation were higher among dyads whose caregiver did vs did not have depression (1.5 vs 0.8 ED visits per person-year). In a Poisson regression model adjusting for patient age, sex, severity of dementia, number of comorbidities, and baseline ED use, as well as caregiver age and sex, caregiver depression continued to be associated with ED use, with a 73% increase in rates of ED use among dyads with caregivers with depression (adjusted incident rate ratio, 1.73; 95% CI, 1.30-2.30). Caregiver burden was associated with higher ED use in the unadjusted model, but this association did not reach statistical significance after adjustment (incident rate ratio, 1.19; 95% CI, 0.93-1.52). Caregiver self-efficacy was inversely proportional to the number of ED visits in the unadjusted and adjusted models (adjusted incident rate ratio, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.92-0.99). Conclusions and Relevance: Among patients with dementia, caregiver depression appears to be significantly associated with increased ED use, revealing a key caregiver vulnerability, which, if addressed with patient- and caregiver-centered dementia care, could improve health outcomes and lower costs for this high-risk population.

        "Quantity and quality of mental activities and the risk of incident mild cognitive impairment. OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether timing, number, and frequency of mentally stimulating activities in midlife and late life are associated with the risk of incident mild cognitive impairment (MCI). METHODS: We conducted a prospective cohort study in the setting of the population-based Mayo Clinic Study of Aging in Olmsted County, Minnesota, including 2,000 individuals aged \u226570 years who were cognitively unimpaired at baseline and were followed for a median of 5.0 years. Participants completed a self-reported survey on timing, number, and frequency of engagement in 5 mentally stimulating activities (reading books, computer use, social activities, playing games, craft activities) at baseline. RESULTS: The risk of incident MCI was significantly reduced for participants who engaged in social activities (hazard ratio [95% confidence interval] 0.80 [0.64-0.99]) and playing games (0.80 [0.66-0.98]) in both late life and midlife combined. Using a computer was associated with a decreased risk regardless of timing (not late life but midlife: 0.52 [0.31-0.88]; late life but not midlife: 0.70 [0.56-0.88]; late life and midlife: 0.63 [0.51-0.79]). Craft activities were associated with a reduced risk of incident MCI only when carried out in late life but not midlife (0.58 [0.34-0.97]). Furthermore, engaging in a higher number of activities in late life was associated with a significantly reduced risk of incident MCI (any 2 activities: 0.72 [0.53-0.99], any 3: 0.55 [0.40-0.77], any 4: 0.44 [0.30-0.65], all 5: 0.57 [0.34-0.96]). CONCLUSION: Engaging in a higher number of mentally stimulating activities, particularly in late life, is associated with a decreased risk of MCI among community-dwelling older persons. ",
        "Genetic predisposition, modifiable-risk-factor profile and long-term dementia risk in the general population. The exact etiology of dementia is still unclear, but both genetic and lifestyle factors are thought to be key drivers of this complex disease. The recognition of familial patterns of dementia has led to the discovery of genetic factors that have a role in the pathogenesis of dementia, including the apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype and a large and still-growing number of genetic variants1,2. Beyond genetic architecture, several modifiable risk factors have been implicated in the development of dementia3. Prevention trials of measures to halt or delay cognitive decline are increasingly recruiting older individuals who are genetically predisposed to dementia. However, it remains unclear whether targeted health and lifestyle interventions can attenuate or even offset increased genetic risk. Here, we leverage long-term data on both genetic and modifiable risk factors from 6,352 individuals aged 55 years and older in the population-based Rotterdam Study. In this study, we demonstrate that, in individuals at low and intermediate genetic risk, favorable modifiable-risk profiles are related to a lower risk of dementia compared to unfavorable profiles. In contrast, these protective associations were not found in those at high genetic risk. ",
        "Effect of Collaborative Dementia Care via Telephone and Internet on Quality of Life, Caregiver Well-being, and Health Care Use: The Care Ecosystem Randomized Clinical Trial. Importance: Few health systems have adopted effective dementia care management programs. The Care Ecosystem is a model for delivering care from centralized hubs across broad geographic areas to caregivers and persons with dementia (PWDs) independently of their health system affiliations. Objective: To determine whether the Care Ecosystem is effective in improving outcomes important to PWDs, their caregivers, and payers beyond those achieved with usual care. Design, Setting, and Participants: A single-blind, randomized clinical trial with a pragmatic design was conducted among PWDs and their caregivers. Each PWD-caregiver dyad was enrolled for 12 months between March 20, 2015, and February 28, 2017. Data were collected until March 5, 2018. Study interventions and assessments were administered over the telephone and internet by clinical and research teams in San Francisco, California, and Omaha, Nebraska. Of 2585 referred or volunteer PWD-caregiver dyads in California, Iowa, or Nebraska, 780 met eligibility criteria and were enrolled. A total of 512 PWD-caregiver dyads were randomized to receive care through the Care Ecosystem and 268 dyads to receive usual care. All eligible PWDs had a dementia diagnosis; were enrolled or eligible for enrollment in Medicare or Medicaid; and spoke English, Spanish, or Cantonese. Analyses were intention-to-treat. Intervention: Telephone-based collaborative dementia care was delivered by a trained care team navigator, who provided education, support and care coordination with a team of dementia specialists (advanced practice nurse, social worker, and pharmacist). Main Outcomes and Measures: Primary outcome measure: Quality of Life in Alzheimer's Disease based on caregiver's rating of 13 aspects of PWD's well-being (including physical health, energy level, mood, living situation, memory, relationships, and finances) on a 4-point scale (poor to excellent). Secondary outcomes: frequencies of PWDs' use of emergency department, hospitalization, and ambulance services; caregiver depression (score on 9-Item Patient Health Questionnaire; higher scores indicate more severe depression); and caregiver burden (score on 12-Item Zarit Burden Interview; higher scores indicate more severe caregiver burden). Results: The 780 PWDs (56.3% female; mean [SD] age, 78.1 [9.9] years) and 780 caregivers (70.9% female; mean [SD] age, 64.7 [12.0] years) lived in California (n\u2009=\u2009452), Nebraska (n\u2009=\u2009284), or Iowa (n\u2009=\u200944). Of 780 dyads, 655 were still active at 12 months, and 571 completed the 12-month survey. Compared with usual care, the Care Ecosystem improved PWD quality of life (B, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.25-1.30; P\u2009=\u2009.04), reduced emergency department visits (B, -0.14; 95% CI, -0.29 to -0.01; P\u2009=\u2009.04), and decreased caregiver depression (B, -1.14; 95% CI, -2.15 to -0.13; P\u2009=\u2009.03) and caregiver burden (B, -1.90; 95% CI, -3.89 to -0.08; P\u2009=\u2009.046). Conclusions and Relevance: Effective care management for dementia can be delivered from centralized hubs to supplement usual care and mitigate the growing societal and economic burdens of dementia.

        "Serum elaidic acid concentration and risk of dementia: The Hisayama Study. OBJECTIVE: The associations between trans fatty acids and dementia have been unclear. We investigated the prospective association between serum elaidic acid (trans 18:1 n-9) levels, as an objective biomarker for industrial trans fat, and incident dementia and its subtypes. METHODS: In total, 1,628 Japanese community residents aged 60 and older without dementia were followed prospectively from when they underwent a screening examination in 2002-2003 to November 2012 (median 10.3 years, interquartile range 7.2-10.4 years). Serum elaidic acid levels were measured using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry and divided into quartiles. The Cox proportional hazards model was used to estimate the hazard ratios for all-cause dementia, Alzheimer disease (AD), and vascular dementia by serum elaidic acid levels. RESULTS: During the follow-up, 377 participants developed some type of dementia (247 AD, 102 vascular dementia). Higher serum elaidic acid levels were significantly associated with greater risk of developing all-cause dementia (p for trend = 0.003) and AD (p for trend = 0.02) after adjustment for traditional risk factors. These associations remained significant after adjustment for dietary factors, including total energy intake and intakes of saturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids (both p for trend <0.05). No significant associations were found between serum elaidic acid levels and vascular dementia. CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that higher serum elaidic acid is a possible risk factor for the development of all-cause dementia and AD in later life. Public health policy to reduce industrially produced trans fatty acids may assist in the primary prevention of dementia. ",
        "Illiteracy, dementia risk, and cognitive trajectories among older adults with low education. OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether illiteracy was associated with greater risk of prevalent and incident dementia and more rapid cognitive decline among older adults with low education. METHODS: Analyses included 983 adults (\u226565 years old, \u22644 years of schooling) who participated in a longitudinal community aging study. Literacy was self-reported (\"Did you ever learn to read or write?\"). Neuropsychological measures of memory, language, and visuospatial abilities were administered at baseline and at follow-ups (median [range] 3.49 years [0-23]). At each visit, functional, cognitive, and medical data were reviewed and a dementia diagnosis was made using standard criteria. Logistic regression and Cox proportional hazards models evaluated the association of literacy with prevalent and incident dementia, respectively, while latent growth curve models evaluated the effect of literacy on cognitive trajectories, adjusting for relevant demographic and medical covariates. RESULTS: Illiterate participants were almost 3 times as likely to have dementia at baseline compared to literate participants. Among those who did not have dementia at baseline, illiterate participants were twice as likely to develop dementia. While illiterate participants showed worse memory, language, and visuospatial functioning at baseline than literate participants, literacy was not associated with rate of cognitive decline. CONCLUSION: We found that illiteracy was independently associated with higher risk of prevalent and incident dementia, but not with a more rapid rate of cognitive decline. The independent effect of illiteracy on dementia risk may be through a lower range of cognitive function, which is closer to diagnostic thresholds for dementia than the range of literate participants.

        "Association of Subclinical Hearing Loss With Cognitive Performance. Importance: Age-related hearing loss (HL) is a common and treatable condition that has been associated with cognitive impairment. The level of hearing at which this association begins has not been studied to date. Objective: To investigate whether the association between hearing and cognition is present among individuals traditionally classified as having normal hearing. Design, Setting, and Participants: Cross-sectional study of 2 US epidemiologic studies (Hispanic Community Health Study [HCHS], 2008-2011, and National Health and Nutrition Examination Study [NHANES], 1999-2000, 2001-2002, and 2011-2012 cycles). The dates of analysis were November 2018 to August 2019. Multivariable generalized additive model (GAM) regression and linear regression were used to assess the association between HL (exposure) and cognition (outcome). Participants included 6451 individuals aged 50 years or older from the general Hispanic population (HCHS [n\u2009=\u20095190]) and the general civilian, noninstitutionalized US population (NHANES [n\u2009=\u20091261]). Exposures: Audiometric HL (4-frequency pure-tone average). Main Outcomes and Measures: Neurocognitive performance measured by the Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST) (score range, 0-113), Word Frequency Test (range, 0-49), Spanish-English Verbal Learning Test (SEVLT) 3 trials (range, 5-40), SEVLT recall (range, 0-15), and Six-Item Screener (range, 0-6); higher scores indicated better cognitive performance. Results: Among 6451 individuals, the mean (SD) age was 59.4 (6.1) years, and 3841 (59.5%) were women. The GAM regression showed a significant inverse association between hearing and cognition across the entire spectrum of hearing after adjusting for demographics and cardiovascular disease. In separate multivariable linear regressions stratified by the classic binary definition of HL, decreased hearing was independently associated with decreased cognition in adults with normal hearing (pure-tone average \u226425 dB) across all cognitive tests in the HCHS. For example in this group, a 10-dB decrease in hearing was associated with a clinically meaningful 1.97-point (95% CI, 1.18-2.75) decrease in score on the DSST. When using a stricter HL cut point (15 dB), an association was also present in NHANES. The associations between hearing and cognition were stronger or equivalent in individuals with normal hearing than among those with HL. For example, there was a 2.28-point (95% CI, 1.56-3.00) combined cohort DSST score decrease per 10-dB decrease among individuals with normal hearing vs a 0.97-point (95% CI, 0.20-1.75) decrease among those with HL, with a significant interaction term between continuous and binary hearing. Conclusions and Relevance: An independent association was observed between cognition and subclinical HL. The association between hearing and cognition may be present earlier in HL than previously understood. Studies investigating whether treating HL can prevent impaired cognition and dementia should consider a lower threshold for defining HL than the current 25-dB threshold. ",
        "Circulating cortisol and cognitive and structural brain measures: The Framingham Heart Study. OBJECTIVE: To assess the association of early morning serum cortisol with cognitive performance and brain structural integrity in community-dwelling young and middle-aged adults without dementia. METHODS: We evaluated dementia-free Framingham Heart Study (generation 3) participants (mean age 48.5 years, 46.8% men) who underwent cognitive testing for memory, abstract reasoning, visual perception, attention, and executive function (n = 2,231) and brain MRI (n = 2018) to assess total white matter, lobar gray matter, and white matter hyperintensity volumes and fractional anisotropy (FA) measures. We used linear and logistic regression to assess the relations of cortisol (categorized in tertiles, with the middle tertile as referent) to measures of cognition, MRI volumes, presence of covert brain infarcts and cerebral microbleeds, and voxel-based microstructural white matter integrity and gray matter density, adjusting for age, sex, APOE, and vascular risk factors. RESULTS: Higher cortisol (highest tertile vs middle tertile) was associated with worse memory and visual perception, as well as lower total cerebral brain and occipital and frontal lobar gray matter volumes. Higher cortisol was associated with multiple areas of microstructural changes (decreased regional FA), especially in the splenium of corpus callosum and the posterior corona radiata. The association of cortisol with total cerebral brain volume varied by sex (p for interaction = 0.048); higher cortisol was inversely associated with cerebral brain volume in women (p = 0.001) but not in men (p = 0.717). There was no effect modification by the APOE4 genotype of the relations of cortisol and cognition or imaging traits. CONCLUSION: Higher serum cortisol was associated with lower brain volumes and impaired memory in asymptomatic younger to middle-aged adults, with the association being evident particularly in women.

        "Comparison of Survival Between Patients With Single vs Multiple Primary Cutaneous Melanomas. Importance: Melanoma is one of the most rapidly increasing forms of cancer worldwide. Most studies about survival among patients with melanoma consider only the primary tumor and disregard the potential effect of multiple primary tumors. A better understanding of the prognosis of patients with multiple primary melanoma is important for patient counselling and follow-up strategies. Objective: To describe the epidemiologic features of multiple primary melanoma in patients from the Netherlands. Design, Setting, and Participants: This retrospective, population-based cohort study included adults with histologically proven, primary, invasive cutaneous melanoma in the Netherlands between January 1, 2000, and December 31, 2014, with a median follow-up of 75.1 months, using data from PALGA, the Dutch Nationwide Network and Registry of Histopathology and Cytopathology. Follow-up data were retrieved from the Netherlands Cancer Registry. Statistical analysis was performed from August 1, 2018, to September 3, 2018. Main Outcomes and Measures: A multivariable Cox model with a time-varying covariate was performed to assess overall survival between patients with a single primary melanoma vs those with multiple primary melanomas. Secondary outcomes included incidence of multiple primary melanoma, differences in Breslow thickness, and time between first and second multiple primary melanoma. Results: Of the 56\u202f929 study patients, 31\u202f916 (56.1%) were female, with a mean (SD) age of 56.4 (16.2) years. A total of 54\u202f645 single primary melanomas and 4967 multiple primary melanomas in 2284 patients were included. The median Breslow thickness decreased from 0.90 mm (interquartile range, 0.55-1.70 mm) for the first melanoma to 0.65 mm (interquartile range, 0.45-1.10 mm) for the second melanoma (P\u2009<\u2009.001). For their second melanoma, 370 patients (16.2%) had a higher T stage, 1112 (48.7%) had the same T stage, and 802 (35.1%) had a lower T stage. In addition, 841 of 2284 second melanomas (36.8%) in patients with multiple primary melanomas were found during the first year of follow-up, whereas 624 of 2284 (27.3%) were found after 5 years of follow-up. These proportions did not vary when stratified for melanoma stage. Worse overall survival was seen among patients with multiple primary melanomas compared with patients with a single primary melanoma (hazard ratio, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.20-1.42; P\u2009<\u2009.001). Conclusions and Relevance: A significant decrease in Breslow thickness between the first and second multiple primary melanoma was found, and overall survival among patients with multiple primary melanomas was significantly worse than that among patients with a single primary melanoma. These findings suggest that more strict follow-up strategies may be warranted for patients with multiple primary melanomas. ",
        "Targeted Muscle Reinnervation Technique in Below-Knee Amputation. Approximately 25 percent of major limb amputees will develop chronic localized symptomatic neuromas and phantom limb pain in the residual limb. A method to treat and possibly prevent these pain symptoms is targeted reinnervation. Previous studies prove that targeted reinnervation successfully treats and, in some cases, resolves peripheral neuropathy and phantom limb pain in patients who have undergone previous amputation (i.e., secondary targeted reinnervation). This article seeks to share the authors' clinical indications and surgical technique for targeted muscle reinnervation in below-knee amputation, a surgical description currently absent from our literature. Targeted reinnervation for the below-knee amputee has been performed on 22 patients at the authors' institution. Each patient has been followed on an outpatient basis for 1 year to evaluate symptoms of neuroma or phantom limb pain, patient satisfaction, and functionality. All subjects have denied neuroma pain following amputation. The majority of subjects reported phantom pain at 1 month. However, at 3 months, all patients reported resolution of this pain. Dumanian et al. first noted the improvement of symptomatic neuroma and phantom limb pain in patients undergoing targeted reinnervation to provide intuitive control of upper limb prostheses. These findings have been substantiated by multiple previous studies at various amputation levels. This study extends the success of targeted muscle reinnervation to below-knee amputations and provides a description for this technique. ",
        "Risk of Depression and Anxiety in Adults With Cerebral Palsy. Importance: Cerebral palsy (CP) is considered a pediatric condition despite most individuals with CP living into adulthood. Thus, there is a lack of evidence in adults with CP, which includes a paucity of research examining mental health in this population. Objectives: To determine the risk of depression and anxiety in adults with CP compared with an age-, sex-, and practice-matched reference group of adults without CP, using primary care data. Design, Setting, and Participants: Retrospective longitudinal cohort study set in UK primary care. Data were analyzed using Cox proportional hazards regression analyses adjusted for chronic conditions and visits to their physician. The study period ran from January 1987 to November 2015. Data of entry into the study ranged from January 1987 to September 2015. Data for 1705 adults 18 years or older with CP and 5115 matched adults without CP were extracted. Cerebral palsy was identified using diagnostic codes, and each person with CP was compared with 3 age-, sex-, and practice-matched controls. Exposures: Diagnosis of CP, with a second analysis accounting for comorbidity of intellectual disability (ID). Main Outcomes and Measures: Time to diagnosis for depression or anxiety following the date of entry into the study in adults with CP (with and without ID) compared with matched controls. Results: The mean (SD) age of the 1705 patients with CP and the 5115 adults without CP was 33.3 (15.5) years, and 798 participants (46.8%) were women. Individuals with CP had an increased adjusted hazard of depression (hazard ratio [HR], 1.28; 95% CI, 1.09-1.51) and anxiety (HR, 1.40; 95% CI, 1.21-1.63) compared with the matched reference group. When we accounted for ID comorbidity, there were 363 adults with CP who also had ID (mean [SD] age, 32.1 [13.2] years; 159 women [47.6%]) and 1342 adults with CP who did not have ID (mean [SD] age, 33.6 [16.1] years; 639 women [43.8%]). Only those individuals with CP and no comorbid ID had a higher risk of incident depression (HR, 1.44; 95% CI, 1.20-1.72) and anxiety (HR, 1.55; 95% CI, 1.28-1.87) than their matched controls. Conclusions and Relevance: Adults with CP have an increased risk of depression or anxiety. In particular, these results indicate that this association is driven largely by those individuals with CP with no co-occurring ID. Future work is needed in community-based samples to fully elucidate the causal mechanisms driving these associations. ",

        "Association of Tourette Syndrome and Chronic Tic Disorder With Metabolic and Cardiovascular Disorders. Importance: There are limited data concerning the risk of metabolic and cardiovascular disorders among individuals with Tourette syndrome (TS) or chronic tic disorder (CTD). Objective: To investigate the risk of metabolic and cardiovascular disorders among individuals with TS or CTD over a period of 40 years. Design, Settings, and Participants: This longitudinal population-based cohort study included all individuals living in Sweden between January 1, 1973, and December 31, 2013. Families with clusters of full siblings discordant for TS or CTD were further identified. Data analyses were conducted from August 1, 2017, to October 11, 2018. Exposures: Previously validated International Classification of Diseases diagnoses of TS or CTD in the Swedish National Patient Register. Main Outcomes and Measures: Registered diagnoses of obesity, dyslipidemia, hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases (including ischemic heart diseases, arrhythmia, cerebrovascular diseases and transient ischemic attack, and arteriosclerosis). Results: Of the 14\u202f045\u202f026 individuals in the cohort, 7804 individuals (5964 males [76.4%]; median age at first diagnosis, 13.3 years [interquartile range, 9.9-21.3 years]) had a registered diagnosis of TS or CTD in specialist care. Of 2\u202f675\u202f482 families with at least 2 singleton full siblings, 5141 families included siblings who were discordant for these disorders. Individuals with TS or CTD had a higher risk of any metabolic or cardiovascular disorders compared with the general population (hazard ratio adjusted by sex and birth year [aHR], 1.99; 95% CI, 1.90-2.09) and sibling controls (aHR for any disorder, 1.37; 95% CI, 1.24-1.51). Specifically, individuals with TS or CTD had higher risks for obesity (aHR, 2.76; 95% CI, 2.47-3.09), type 2 diabetes (aHR, 1.67; 95% CI, 1.42-1.96), and circulatory system diseases (aHR, 1.76; 95% CI, 1.67-1.86). The risk of any cardiometabolic disorder was significantly greater in males than in females (aHR, 2.13; 95% CI, 2.01-2.26 vs aHR, 1.79; 95% CI, 1.64-1.96), as was the risk of obesity (aHR, 3.24; 95% CI, 2.83-3.70 vs aHR, 1.97; 95% CI, 1.59-2.44). The risks were already evident from childhood (the groups were significantly different by age 8 years) and were significantly reduced with the exclusion of individuals with comorbid attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (aHR, 1.52; 95% CI, 1.42-1.62), while excluding other comorbidities did not significantly affect the results. Compared with patients with TS or CTD who were not taking antipsychotics, patients with a longer duration of antipsychotic treatment (>1 year) had significantly lower risks of metabolic and cardiovascular disorders. Conclusions and Relevance: The findings of this study suggest that TS and CTD are associated with a substantial risk of metabolic and cardiovascular disorders. The results highlight the importance of carefully monitoring cardiometabolic health in patients with TS or CTD across the lifespan, particularly in those with comorbid attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.

        "Association of peripheral blood pressure with gray matter volume in 19- to 40-year-old adults. OBJECTIVE: To test whether elevated blood pressure (BP) relates to gray matter (GM) volume (GMV) changes in young adults who had not previously been diagnosed with hypertension (systolic BP [SBP]/diastolic BP [DBP] \u2265140/90 mm Hg). METHODS: We associated BP with GMV from structural 3T T1-weighted MRI of 423 healthy adults between 19 and 40 years of age (mean age 27.7 \u00b1 5.3 years, 177 women, SBP/DBP 123.2/73.4 \u00b1 12.2/8.5 mm Hg). Data originated from 4 previously unpublished cross-sectional studies conducted in Leipzig, Germany. We performed voxel-based morphometry on each study separately and combined results in image-based meta-analyses (IBMA) to assess cumulative effects across studies. Resting BP was assigned to 1 of 4 categories: (1) SBP <120 and DBP <80 mm Hg, (2) SBP 120-129 or DBP 80-84 mm Hg, (3) SBP 130-139 or DBP 85-89 mm Hg, (4) SBP \u2265140 or DBP \u226590 mm Hg. RESULTS: IBMA yielded the following results: (1) lower regional GMV was correlated with higher peripheral BP; (2) lower GMV was found with higher BP when comparing individuals in subhypertensive categories 3 and 2, respectively, to those in category 1; (3) lower BP-related GMV was found in regions including hippocampus, amygdala, thalamus, frontal, and parietal structures (e.g., precuneus). CONCLUSION: BP \u2265120/80 mm Hg was associated with lower GMV in regions that have previously been related to GM decline in older individuals with manifest hypertension. Our study shows that BP-associated GM alterations emerge continuously across the range of BP and earlier in adulthood than previously assumed. This suggests that treating hypertension or maintaining lower BP in early adulthood might be essential for preventing the pathophysiologic cascade of asymptomatic cerebrovascular disease to symptomatic end-organ damage, such as stroke or dementia.

        "Effect of aerobic exercise on cognition in younger adults: A randomized clinical trial. OBJECTIVE: To determine efficacy of aerobic exercise for cognitive function in younger healthy adults. METHODS: In a randomized, parallel-group, observer-masked, community-based clinical trial, 132 cognitively normal individuals aged 20-67 with below median aerobic capacity were randomly assigned to one of two 6-month, 4-times-weekly conditions: aerobic exercise and stretching/toning. Efficacy measures included aerobic capacity; cognitive function in several domains (executive function, episodic memory, processing speed, language, and attention), everyday function, body mass index (BMI), and cortical thickness. RESULTS: Aerobic capacity increased significantly (\u03b2 = 2.718; p = 0.003), and BMI decreased significantly (\u03b2 = -0.596; p = 0.013) in the aerobic exercise but not in the stretching/toning condition. Executive function improved significantly in the aerobic exercise condition; this effect was moderated by age (\u03b2 = 0.018 SD/y; p = 0.028). At age 40, the executive function measure increased by 0.228 SD (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.007-0.448), and by 0.596 SD (95% CI 0.219-0.973) at age 60. Cortical thickness increased significantly in the aerobic exercise group in a left frontal region and did not interact with age. Controlling for age and baseline performance, individuals with at least one APOE \u03b54 allele showed less improvement in executive function with aerobic exercise (\u03b2 = 0.5129, 95% CI 0.0381-0.988; p = 0.0346). CONCLUSIONS: This randomized clinical trial demonstrates the efficacy of aerobic exercise for cognition in adults age 20-67. The effect of aerobic exercise on executive function was more pronounced as age increased, suggesting that it may mitigate age-related declines. Increased cortical thickness suggests that aerobic exercise contributes to brain health in individuals as young as age 20. CLINICALTRIALSGOV IDENTIFIER: NCT01179958. CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE: This study provides Class II evidence that for adults age 20-67 with below median aerobic capacity, aerobic exercise significantly improves executive function but not other measures of cognitive function.

        "Persistent metabolic youth in the aging female brain. Sex differences influence brain morphology and physiology during both development and aging. Here we apply a machine learning algorithm to a multiparametric brain PET imaging dataset acquired in a cohort of 20- to 82-year-old, cognitively normal adults (n = 205) to define their metabolic brain age. We find that throughout the adult life span the female brain has a persistently lower metabolic brain age-relative to their chronological age-compared with the male brain. The persistence of relatively younger metabolic brain age in females throughout adulthood suggests that development might in part influence sex differences in brain aging. Our results also demonstrate that trajectories of natural brain aging vary significantly among individuals and provide a method to measure this. ",
        "Network-targeted stimulation engages neurobehavioral hallmarks of age-related memory decline. OBJECTIVE: To test whether targeting hippocampal-cortical brain networks with high-frequency transcranial magnetic stimulation in older adults influences behavioral and neural measures characteristic of age-related memory impairment. METHODS: Fifteen adults aged 64 to 80 years (mean = 72 years) completed a single-blind, sham-controlled experiment. Stimulation targets in parietal cortex were determined based on fMRI connectivity with the hippocampus. Recollection and recognition memory were assessed after 5 consecutive daily sessions of full-intensity stimulation vs low-intensity sham stimulation using a within-subjects crossover design. Neural correlates of recollection and recognition memory formation were obtained via fMRI, measured within the targeted hippocampal-cortical network vs a control frontal-parietal network. These outcomes were measured approximately 24 hours after the final stimulation session. RESULTS: Recollection was specifically impaired in older adults compared to a young-adult control sample at baseline. Relative to sham, stimulation improved recollection to a greater extent than recognition. Stimulation increased recollection fMRI signals throughout the hippocampal-cortical network, including at the targeted location of the hippocampus. Effects of stimulation on fMRI recollection signals were greater than those for recognition and were greater in the targeted network compared to the control network. CONCLUSIONS: Age-related recollection impairments were causally related to hippocampal-cortical network function in older adults. Stimulation selectively modified neural and behavioral hallmarks of age-related memory impairment, indicating effective engagement of memory intervention targets in older adults. ",
        "Speech synthesis from neural decoding of spoken sentences. Technology that translates neural activity into speech would be transformative for people who are unable to communicate as a result of neurological impairments. Decoding speech from neural activity is challenging because speaking requires very precise and rapid multi-dimensional control of vocal tract articulators. Here we designed a neural decoder that explicitly leverages kinematic and sound representations encoded in human cortical activity to synthesize audible speech. Recurrent neural networks first decoded directly recorded cortical activity into representations of articulatory movement, and then transformed these representations into speech acoustics. In closed vocabulary tests, listeners could readily identify and transcribe speech synthesized from cortical activity. Intermediate articulatory dynamics enhanced performance even with limited data. Decoded articulatory representations were highly conserved across speakers, enabling a component of the decoder to be transferrable across participants. Furthermore, the decoder could synthesize speech when a participant silently mimed sentences. These findings advance the clinical viability of using speech neuroprosthetic technology to restore spoken communication. ",
        "Nusinersen in later-onset spinal muscular atrophy: Long-term results from the phase 1/2 studies. OBJECTIVE: To report results of intrathecal nusinersen in children with later-onset spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). METHODS: Analyses included children from a phase 1b/2a study (ISIS-396443-CS2; NCT01703988) who first received nusinersen during that study and were eligible to continue treatment in the extension study (ISIS-396443-CS12; NCT02052791). The phase 1b/2a study was a 253-day, ascending dose (3, 6, 9, 12 mg), multiple-dose, open-label, multicenter study that enrolled children with SMA aged 2-15 years. The extension study was a 715-day, single-dose level (12 mg) study. Time between studies varied by participant (196-413 days). Assessments included the Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale-Expanded (HFMSE), Upper Limb Module (ULM), 6-Minute Walk Test (6MWT), compound muscle action potential (CMAP), and quantitative multipoint incremental motor unit number estimation. Safety also was assessed. RESULTS: Twenty-eight children were included (SMA type II, n = 11; SMA type III, n = 17). Mean HFMSE scores, ULM scores, and 6MWT distances improved by the day 1,150 visit (HFMSE: SMA type II, +10.8 points; SMA type III, +1.8 points; ULM: SMA type II, +4.0 points; 6MWT: SMA type III, +92.0 meters). Mean CMAP values remained relatively stable. No children discontinued treatment due to adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: Nusinersen treatment over \u223c3 years resulted in motor function improvements and disease activity stabilization not observed in natural history cohorts.

        "Having a first-degree relative with melanoma increases lifetime risk of melanoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and basal cell carcinoma. BACKGROUND: Previous studies have found familial aggregation of melanoma and keratinocyte cancers (KCs). OBJECTIVE: We sought to determine the risk of melanoma and KCs in those with a positive family history of melanoma while controlling for pigmentary and environmental risk factors. METHODS: We prospectively followed 216,115 participants from the Nurses' Health Study, Nurse's Health Study 2, and Health Professionals Follow-up Study for more than 20\u00a0years. Cox proportional hazards regression controlling for known risk factors for skin cancer was used to estimate association between family history of melanoma and melanoma and KCs. RESULTS: Compared with those without a family history of melanoma, individuals with a family history of melanoma had a 74% increased risk of melanoma (hazard ratio [HR], 1.74; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.45-2.09), a 22% increased risk of squamous cell carcinoma (HR, 1.22; 95% CI, 1.06-1.40), and a 27% increased risk of basal cell carcinoma (HR, 1.27; 95% CI, 1.12-1.44). Family history of melanoma increased the risk of development of truncal melanoma in both sexes, extremity melanoma in women, and extremity squamous cell carcinoma in women. LIMITATIONS: Limitations of this study include self-reported family history and detection bias. CONCLUSION: Individuals with a family history of melanoma are at an increased risk of melanoma and KCs.

        "Out-of-pocket costs are on the rise for commonly prescribed neurologic medications. OBJECTIVE: To determine out-of-pocket costs for neurologic medications in 5 common neurologic diseases. METHODS: Utilizing a large, privately insured, health care claims database from 2004 to 2016, we captured out-of-pocket medication costs for patients seen by outpatient neurologists with multiple sclerosis (MS), peripheral neuropathy, epilepsy, dementia, and Parkinson disease (PD). We compared out-of-pocket costs for those in high-deductible health plans compared to traditional plans and explored cumulative out-of-pocket costs over the first 2 years after diagnosis across conditions with high- (MS) and low/medium-cost (epilepsy) medications. RESULTS: The population consisted of 105,355 patients with MS, 314,530 with peripheral neuropathy, 281,073 with epilepsy, 120,720 with dementia, and 90,801 with PD. MS medications had the fastest rise in monthly out-of-pocket expenses (mean [SD] $15 [$23] in 2004, $309 [$593] in 2016) with minimal differences between medications. Out-of-pocket costs for brand name medications in the other conditions also rose considerably. Patients in high-deductible health plans incurred approximately twice the monthly out-of-pocket expense as compared to those not in these plans ($661 [$964] vs $246 [$472] in MS, $40 [$94] vs $18 [$46] in epilepsy in 2016). Cumulative 2-year out-of-pocket costs rose almost linearly over time in MS ($2,238 [$3,342]) and epilepsy ($230 [$443]). CONCLUSIONS: Out-of-pocket costs for neurologic medications have increased considerably over the last 12 years, particularly for those in high-deductible health plans. Out-of-pocket costs vary widely both across and within conditions. To minimize patient financial burden, neurologists require access to precise cost information when making treatment decisions. ",
        "Capturing acute vertigo: A vestibular event monitor. OBJECTIVE: To facilitate the diagnosis of vestibular disorders by patient-initiated capture of ictal nystagmus. METHODS: Adults from an Australian neurology outpatient clinic reporting recurrent vertigo were recruited prospectively and taught to self-record spontaneous and positional nystagmus at home while symptomatic, using miniature video-oculography goggles. Consenting patients with ictal videorecordings and a final unblinded clinical diagnosis of M\u00e9ni\u00e8re disease (MD), vestibular migraine (VM), or benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) were included. RESULTS: Ictal eye videos of 117 patients were analyzed. Of 43 patients with MD, 40 showed high-velocity spontaneous horizontal nystagmus (median slow-phase velocity [SPV] 39.7\u00b0/s; 21 showed horizontal nystagmus reversing direction within 12 hours [24 on separate days]). In 44 of 67 patients with VM, spontaneous horizontal (n = 28, 4.9\u00b0/s), upbeating (n = 6, 15.5\u00b0/s), or downbeating nystagmus (n = 10, 5.1\u00b0/s) was observed; 16 showed positional nystagmus only, and 7 had no nystagmus. Spontaneous horizontal nystagmus with SPV >12.05\u00b0/s had a sensitivity and specificity of 95.3% and 82.1% for MD (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.84-0.99, 0.71-0.90). Nystagmus direction change within 12 hours was highly specific (95.7%) for MD (95% CI 0.85-0.99). Spontaneous vertical nystagmus was highly specific (93.0%) for VM (95% CI 0.81-0.99). In the 7 patients with BPPV, spontaneous nystagmus was absent or <3\u00b0/s. Lying affected-ear down, patients with BPPV demonstrated paroxysmal positional nystagmus. Median time for peak SPV to halve (T50) was 19.0 seconds. Patients with VM and patients with MD demonstrated persistent positional nystagmus (median T50; 93.1 seconds, 213.2 seconds). T50s <47.3 seconds had a sensitivity and specificity of 100% and 77.8% for BPPV (95% CI 0.54-1.00, 0.64-0.88). CONCLUSION: Patient-initiated vestibular event monitoring is feasible and could facilitate rapid and accurate diagnosis of episodic vestibular disorders. ",
        "Associations between gabapentinoids and suicidal behaviour, unintentional overdoses, injuries, road traffic incidents, and violent crime: population based cohort study in Sweden. OBJECTIVE: To examine associations between gabapentinoids and adverse outcomes related to coordination disturbances (head or body injuries, or both and road traffic incidents or offences), mental health (suicidal behaviour, unintentional overdoses), and criminality. DESIGN: Population based cohort study. SETTING: High quality prescription, patient, death, and crime registers, Sweden. PARTICIPANTS: 191\u2009973 people from the Swedish Prescribed Drug Register who collected prescriptions for gabapentinoids (pregabalin or gabapentin) during 2006 to 2013. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcomes were suicidal behaviour, unintentional overdoses, head/body injuries, road traffic incidents and offences, and arrests for violent crime. Stratified Cox proportional hazards regression was conducted comparing treatment periods with non-treatment periods within an individual. Participants served as their own control, thus accounting for time invariant factors (eg, genetic and historical factors), and reducing confounding by indication. Additional adjustments were made by age, sex, comorbidities, substance use, and use of other antiepileptics. RESULTS: During the study period, 10\u2009026 (5.2%) participants were treated for suicidal behaviour or died from suicide, 17\u2009144 (8.9%) experienced an unintentional overdose, 12\u2009070 (6.3%) had a road traffic incident or offence, 70\u2009522 (36.7%) presented with head/body injuries, and 7984 (4.1%) were arrested for a violent crime. In within-individual analyses, gabapentinoid treatment was associated with increased hazards of suicidal behaviour and deaths from suicide (age adjusted hazard ratio 1.26, 95% confidence interval 1.20 to 1.32), unintentional overdoses (1.24, 1.19 to 1.28), head/body injuries (1.22, 1.19 to 1.25), and road traffic incidents and offences (1.13, 1.06 to 1.20). Associations with arrests for violent crime were less clear (1.04, 0.98 to 1.11). When the drugs were examined separately, pregabalin was associated with increased hazards of all outcomes, whereas gabapentin was associated with decreased or no statistically significant hazards. When stratifying on age, increased hazards of all outcomes were associated with participants aged 15 to 24 years. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that gabapentinoids are associated with an increased risk of suicidal behaviour, unintentional overdoses, head/body injuries, and road traffic incidents and offences. Pregabalin was associated with higher hazards of these outcomes than gabapentin. ",
        "Global Prevalence of Hypertension in Children: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis. Importance: Reliable estimates of the prevalence of childhood hypertension serve as the basis for adequate prevention and treatment. However, the prevalence of childhood hypertension has rarely been synthesized at the global level. Objective: To conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the prevalence of hypertension in the general pediatric population. Data Sources: PubMed, MEDLINE, Embase, Global Health, and Global Health Library were searched from inception until June 2018, using search terms related to hypertension (hypertension OR high blood pressure OR elevated blood pressure), children (children OR adolescents), and prevalence (prevalence OR epidemiology). Study Selection: Studies that were conducted in the general pediatric population and quantified the prevalence of childhood hypertension were eligible. Included studies had blood pressure measurements from at least 3 separate occasions. Data Extraction and Synthesis: Two authors independently extracted data. Random-effects meta-analysis was used to derive the pooled prevalence. Variations in the prevalence estimates in different subgroups, including age group, sex, setting, device, investigation period, BMI group, World Health Organization region and World Bank region, were examined by subgroup meta-analysis. Meta-regression was used to establish the age-specific prevalence of childhood hypertension and to assess its secular trend. Main Outcomes and Measures: Prevalence of childhood hypertension overall and by subgroup. Results: A total of 47 articles were included in the meta-analysis. The pooled prevalence was 4.00% (95% CI, 3.29%-4.78%) for hypertension, 9.67% (95% CI, 7.26%-12.38%) for prehypertension, 4.00% (95% CI, 2.10%-6.48%) for stage 1 hypertension, and 0.95% (95% CI, 0.48%-1.57%) for stage 2 hypertension in children 19 years and younger. In subgroup meta-analyses, the prevalence of childhood hypertension was higher when measured by aneroid sphygmomanometer (7.23% vs 4.59% by mercury sphygmomanometer vs 2.94% by oscillometric sphygmomanometer) and among overweight and obese children (15.27% and 4.99% vs 1.90% among normal-weight children). A trend of increasing prevalence of childhood hypertension was observed during the past 2 decades, with a relative increasing rate of 75% to 79% from 2000 to 2015. In 2015, the prevalence of hypertension ranged from 4.32% (95% CI, 2.79%-6.63%) among children aged 6 years to 3.28% (95% CI, 2.25%-4.77%) among those aged 19 years and peaked at 7.89% (95% CI, 5.75%-10.75%) among those aged 14 years. Conclusions and Relevance: This study provides a global estimation of childhood hypertension prevalence based on blood pressure measurements in at least 3 separate visits. More high-quality epidemiologic investigations on childhood hypertension are still needed. ",
        "Association of Neurocognitive and Physical Function With Gait Speed in Midlife. Importance: Gait speed is a well-known indicator of risk of functional decline and mortality in older adults, but little is known about the factors associated with gait speed earlier in life. Objectives: To test the hypothesis that slow gait speed reflects accelerated biological aging at midlife, as well as poor neurocognitive functioning in childhood and cognitive decline from childhood to midlife. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study uses data from the Dunedin Multidisciplinary Health and Development Study, a population-based study of a representative 1972 to 1973 birth cohort in New Zealand that observed participants to age 45 years (until April 2019). Data analysis was performed from April to June 2019. Exposures: Childhood neurocognitive functions and accelerated aging, brain structure, and concurrent physical and cognitive functions in adulthood. Main Outcomes and Measures: Gait speed at age 45 years, measured under 3 walking conditions: usual, dual task, and maximum gait speeds. Results: Of the 1037 original participants (91% of eligible births; 535 [51.6%] male), 997 were alive at age 45 years, of whom 904 (90.7%) had gait speed measured (455 [50.3%] male; 93% white). The mean (SD) gait speeds were 1.30 (0.17) m/s for usual gait, 1.16 (0.23) m/s for dual task gait, and 1.99 (0.29) m/s for maximum gait. Adults with more physical limitations (standardized regression coefficient [\u03b2], -0.27; 95% CI, -0.34 to -0.21; P\u2009<\u2009.001), poorer physical functions (ie, weak grip strength [\u03b2, 0.36; 95% CI, 0.25 to 0.46], poor balance [\u03b2, 0.28; 95% CI, 0.21 to 0.34], poor visual-motor coordination [\u03b2, 0.24; 95% CI, 0.17 to 0.30], and poor performance on the chair-stand [\u03b2, 0.34; 95% CI, 0.27 to 0.40] or 2-minute step tests [\u03b2, 0.33; 95% CI, 0.27 to 0.39]; all P\u2009<\u2009.001), accelerated biological aging across multiple organ systems (\u03b2, -0.33; 95% CI, -0.40 to -0.27; P\u2009<\u2009.001), older facial appearance (\u03b2, -0.25; 95% CI, -0.31 to -0.18; P\u2009<\u2009.001), smaller brain volume (\u03b2, 0.15; 95% CI, 0.06 to 0.23; P\u2009<\u2009.001), more cortical thinning (\u03b2, 0.09; 95% CI, 0.02 to 0.16; P\u2009=\u2009.01), smaller cortical surface area (\u03b2, 0.13; 95% CI, 0.04 to 0.21; P\u2009=\u2009.003), and more white matter hyperintensities (\u03b2, -0.09; 95% CI, -0.15 to -0.02; P\u2009=\u2009.01) had slower gait speed. Participants with lower IQ in midlife (\u03b2, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.32 to 0.44; P\u2009<\u2009.001) and participants who exhibited cognitive decline from childhood to adulthood (\u03b2, 0.10; 95% CI, 0.04 to 0.17; P\u2009<\u2009.001) had slower gait at age 45 years. Those with poor neurocognitive functioning as early as age 3 years had slower gait in midlife (\u03b2, 0.26; 95% CI, 0.20 to 0.32; P\u2009<\u2009.001). Conclusions and Relevance: Adults' gait speed is associated with more than geriatric functional status; it is also associated with midlife aging and lifelong brain health. ",
        "Associations Between Screen-Based Media Use and Brain White Matter Integrity in Preschool-Aged Children. Importance: The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends limits on screen-based media use, citing its cognitive-behavioral risks. Screen use by young children is prevalent and increasing, although its implications for brain development are unknown. Objective: To explore the associations between screen-based media use and integrity of brain white matter tracts supporting language and literacy skills in preschool-aged children. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cross-sectional study of healthy children aged 3 to 5 years (n\u2009=\u200947) was conducted from August 2017 to November 2018. Participants were recruited at a US children's hospital and community primary care clinics. Exposures: Children completed cognitive testing followed by diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), and their parent completed a ScreenQ survey. Main Outcomes and Measures: ScreenQ is a 15-item measure of screen-based media use reflecting the domains in the AAP recommendations: access to screens, frequency of use, content viewed, and coviewing. Higher scores reflect greater use. ScreenQ scores were applied as the independent variable in 3 multiple linear regression models, with scores in 3 standardized assessments as the dependent variable, controlling for child age and household income: Comprehensive Test of Phonological Processing, Second Edition (CTOPP-2; Rapid Object Naming subtest); Expressive Vocabulary Test, Second Edition (EVT-2; expressive language); and Get Ready to Read! (GRTR; emergent literacy skills). The DTI measures included fractional anisotropy (FA) and radial diffusivity (RD), which estimated microstructural organization and myelination of white matter tracts. ScreenQ was applied as a factor associated with FA and RD in whole-brain regression analyses, which were then narrowed to 3 left-sided tracts supporting language and emergent literacy abilities. Results: Of the 69 children recruited, 47 (among whom 27 [57%] were girls, and the mean [SD] age was 54.3\u2009[7.5] months) completed DTI. Mean (SD; range) ScreenQ score was 8.6 (4.8; 1-19) points. Mean (SD; range) CTOPP-2 score was 9.4 (3.3; 2-15) points, EVT-2 score was 113.1 (16.6; 88-144) points, and GRTR score was 19.0 (5.9; 5-25) points. ScreenQ scores were negatively correlated with EVT-2 (F2,43\u2009=\u20095.14; R2\u2009=\u20090.19; P\u2009<\u2009.01), CTOPP-2 (F2,35\u2009=\u20096.64; R2\u2009=\u20090.28; P\u2009<\u2009.01), and GRTR (F2,44\u2009=\u200917.08; R2\u2009=\u20090.44; P\u2009<\u2009.01) scores, controlling for child age. Higher ScreenQ scores were correlated with lower FA and higher RD in tracts involved with language, executive function, and emergent literacy abilities (P\u2009<\u2009.05, familywise error-corrected), controlling for child age and household income. Conclusions and Relevance: This study found an association between increased screen-based media use, compared with the AAP guidelines, and lower microstructural integrity of brain white matter tracts supporting language and emergent literacy skills in prekindergarten children. The findings suggest further study is needed, particularly during the rapid early stages of brain development. ",
        "Risk of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder and Major Depression in Civilian Patients After Mild Traumatic Brain Injury: A TRACK-TBI Study. Importance: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) has been associated with adverse mental health outcomes, such as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and major depressive disorder (MDD), but little is known about factors that modify risk for these psychiatric sequelae, particularly in the civilian sector. Objective: To ascertain prevalence of and risk factors for PTSD and MDD among patients evaluated in the emergency department for mild TBI (mTBI). Design, Setting, and Participants: Prospective longitudinal cohort study (February 2014 to May 2018). Posttraumatic stress disorder and MDD symptoms were assessed using the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 Item. Risk factors evaluated included preinjury and injury characteristics. Propensity score weights-adjusted multivariable logistic regression models were performed to assess associations with PTSD and MDD. A total of 1155 patients with mTBI (Glasgow Coma Scale score, 13-15) and 230 patients with nonhead orthopedic trauma injuries 17 years and older seen in 11 US hospitals with level 1 trauma centers were included in this study. Main Outcomes and Measures: Probable PTSD (PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 score, \u226533) and MDD (Patient Health Questionnaire-9 Item score, \u226515) at 3, 6, and 12 months postinjury. Results: Participants were 1155 patients (752 men [65.1%]; mean [SD] age, 40.5 [17.2] years) with mTBI and 230 patients (155 men [67.4%]; mean [SD] age, 40.4 [15.6] years) with nonhead orthopedic trauma injuries. Weights-adjusted prevalence of PTSD and/or MDD in the mTBI vs orthopedic trauma comparison groups at 3 months was 20.0% (SE, 1.4%) vs 8.7% (SE, 2.2%) (P\u2009<\u2009.001) and at 6 months was 21.2% (SE, 1.5%) vs 12.1% (SE, 3.2%) (P\u2009=\u2009.03). Risk factors for probable PTSD at 6 months after mTBI included less education (adjusted odds ratio, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.82-0.97 per year), being black (adjusted odds ratio, 5.11; 95% CI, 2.89-9.05), self-reported psychiatric history (adjusted odds ratio, 3.57; 95% CI, 2.09-6.09), and injury resulting from assault or other violence (adjusted odds ratio, 3.43; 95% CI, 1.56-7.54). Risk factors for probable MDD after mTBI were similar with the exception that cause of injury was not associated with increased risk. Conclusions and Relevance: After mTBI, some individuals, on the basis of education, race/ethnicity, history of mental health problems, and cause of injury were at substantially increased risk of PTSD and/or MDD. These findings should influence recognition of at-risk individuals and inform efforts at surveillance, follow-up, and intervention. ",
        "Association Between Statin Use and Risk of Dementia After a Concussion. Importance: Concussions are an acute injury that may lead to chronic disability, while statin use might improve neurologic recovery. Objective: To test whether statin use is associated with an increased or decreased risk of subsequent dementia after a concussion. Design, Setting, and Participants: Large extended population-based double cohort study in Ontario, Canada, from April 1, 1993, to April 1, 2013 (enrollment), and continued until March 31, 2016 (follow-up). Dates of analysis were April 28, 2014, through March 21, 2019. Participants were older adults diagnosed as having a concussion, excluding severe cases resulting in hospitalization, individuals with a prior diagnosis of dementia or delirium, and those who died within 90 days. Exposure: Statin prescription within 90 days after a concussion. Main Outcome and Measure: Long-term incidence of dementia. Results: This study identified 28\u202f815 patients diagnosed as having a concussion (median age, 76 years; 61.3% female), of whom 7058 (24.5%) received a statin, and 21\u202f757 (75.5%) did not receive a statin. A total of 4727 patients subsequently developed dementia over a mean follow-up of 3.9 years, equal to an incidence of 1 case per 6 patients. Patients who received a statin had a 13% reduced risk of dementia compared with patients who did not receive a statin (relative risk, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.81-0.93; P\u2009<\u2009.001). The decreased risk of dementia associated with statin use applied to diverse patient groups, remained independent of other cardiovascular medication use, intensified over time, was distinct from the risk of subsequent depression, and was not observed in patients after an ankle sprain. Conclusions and Relevance: In this study, older adults had a substantial long-term risk of dementia after a concussion, which was associated with a modest reduction among patients receiving a statin.

        "Acute elevation of serum inflammatory markers predicts symptom recovery after concussion. OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that acute elevations in serum inflammatory markers predict symptom recovery after sport-related concussion (SRC). METHODS: High school and collegiate football players (n = 857) were prospectively enrolled. Forty-one athletes with concussion and 43 matched control athletes met inclusion criteria. Serum levels of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1\u03b2, IL-10, tumor necrosis factor, C-reactive protein, interferon-\u03b3, and IL-1 receptor antagonist and Sport Concussion Assessment Tool, 3rd edition (SCAT3) symptom severity scores were collected at a preinjury baseline, 6 and 24-48 hours postinjury, and approximately 8, 15, and 45 days following concussion. The number of days that athletes were symptomatic following SRC (i.e., duration of symptoms) was the primary outcome variable. RESULTS: IL-6 and IL-1RA were significantly elevated in athletes with concussion at 6 hours relative to preinjury and other postinjury visits, as well as compared to controls (ps \u2264 0.001). IL-6 and IL-1RA significantly discriminated concussed from control athletes at 6 hours postconcussion (IL-6 area under receiver operating characteristic curve 0.79 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.65-0.92], IL-1RA AUC 0.79 [95% CI 0.67-0.90]). Further, IL-6 levels at 6 hours postconcussion were significantly associated with the duration of symptoms (hazard ratio for symptom recovery = 0.61 [95% CI 0.38-0.96], p = 0.031). CONCLUSIONS: Results support the potential utility of IL-6 and IL-1RA as serum biomarkers of SRC and demonstrate the potential of these markers in identifying athletes at risk for prolonged recovery after SRC. CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE: This study provides Class III evidence that serum levels of IL-6 and IL-1RA 6 hours postconcussion significantly discriminated concussed from control athletes. ",
        "Association of White Matter Rarefaction, Arteriolosclerosis, and Tau With Dementia in Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy. Importance: Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) is a neurodegenerative disease associated with repetitive head impacts, including those from US football, that presents with cognitive and neuropsychiatric disturbances that can progress to dementia. Pathways to dementia in CTE are unclear and likely involve tau and nontau pathologic conditions. Objective: To investigate the association of white matter rarefaction and cerebrovascular disease with dementia in deceased men older than 40 years who played football and had CTE. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cross-sectional study involves analyses of data from the ongoing Understanding Neurologic Injury and Traumatic Encephalopathy (UNITE) Study, which is conducted via and included brain donors from the Veterans Affairs-Boston University-Concussion Legacy Foundation brain bank between 2008 and 2017. An original sample of 224 men who had played football and were neuropathologically diagnosed with CTE was reduced after exclusion of those younger than 40 years and those missing data. Exposures: The number of years of football play as a proxy for repetitive head impacts. Main Outcomes and Measures: Neuropathological assessment of white matter rarefaction and arteriolosclerosis severity (on a scale of 0-3, where 3 is severe); number of infarcts, microinfarcts, and microbleeds; and phosphorylated tau accumulation determined by CTE stage and semiquantitative rating of dorsolateral frontal cortex (DLFC) neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) (none or mild vs moderate or severe). Informant-based retrospective clinical interviews determined dementia diagnoses via diagnostic consensus conferences. Results: A total of 180 men were included. The mean (SD) age of the sample at death was 67.9 (12.7) years. Of 180, 120 [66.7%]) were found to have had dementia prior to death. Moderate to severe white matter rarefaction (84 of 180 [46.6%]) and arteriolosclerosis (85 of 180 [47.2%]) were common; infarcts, microinfarcts, and microbleeds were not. A simultaneous equations regression model controlling for age and race showed that more years of play was associated with more severe white matter rarefaction (\u03b2, 0.16 [95% CI, 0.02-0.29]; P\u2009=\u2009.03) and greater phosphorylated tau accumulation (DLFC NFTs: \u03b2, 0.15 [95% CI, 0.004-0.30]; P\u2009=\u2009.04; CTE stage: \u03b2, 0.27 [95% CI, 0.14-0.41]; P\u2009<\u2009.001). White matter rarefaction (\u03b2, 0.16 [95% CI, 0.02-0.29]; P\u2009=\u2009.03) and DLFC NFTs (\u03b2, 0.16 [95% CI, 0.03-0.28]; P\u2009=\u2009.01) were associated with dementia. Arteriolosclerosis and years of play were not associated, but arteriolosclerosis was independently associated with dementia (\u03b2, 0.21 [95% CI, 0.07-0.35]; P\u2009=\u2009.003). Conclusions and Relevance: Among older men who had played football and had CTE, more years of football play were associated with more severe white matter rarefaction and greater DLFC NFT burden. White matter rarefaction, arteriolosclerosis, and DLFC NFTs were independently associated with dementia. Dementia in CTE is likely a result of neuropathologic changes, including white matter rarefaction and phosphorylated tau, associated with repetitive head impact and pathologic changes not associated with head trauma, such as arteriolosclerosis.

        "Factors Associated With Geriatric Frequent Users of Emergency Departments. STUDY OBJECTIVE: Frequent users of the emergency department (ED) are often associated with increased health care costs. Limited research is devoted to frequent ED use within the increasing senior population, which accounts for the highest use of health care resources. We evaluate patient characteristics and patterns of ED use among geriatric patients. METHODS: This was a multicenter, retrospective, longitudinal, cohort study of ED visits among geriatric patients older than 65 years in 2013 and 2014. Logistic regression analysis was used to identify independent associations with frequent users. The setting was a nonpublic statewide database in California, which includes 326 licensed nonfederal hospitals. We included all geriatric patients within the database who were older than 65 years and had an ED visit in 2014, for a total of 1,259,809 patients with 2,792,219 total ED visits. The main outcome was frequent users, defined as having greater than or equal to 6 ED visits in a 1-year period, starting from their last visit in\u00a02014. RESULTS: Overall, 5.7% of geriatric patients (n=71,449) were identified as frequent users of the ED. They accounted for 21.2% (n=592,407) of all ED visits. The associations of frequent ED use with the largest magnitude were patients with an injury-related visit (odds ratio 3.8; 95% confidence interval 3.8 to 3.9), primary diagnosis of pain (odds ratio 5.5; 95% confidence interval 5.4 to 5.6), and comorbidity index score greater than or equal to 3 (odds ratio 7.2; 95% confidence interval 7.0 to 7.5). CONCLUSION: Geriatric frequent users are likely to have comorbid conditions and be treated for conditions related to pain and injuries. These findings provide evidence to guide future interventions to address these needs that could potentially decrease frequent ED use among geriatric patients. ",
        "Association of Concussion Symptoms With Testosterone Levels and Erectile Dysfunction in Former Professional US-Style Football Players. Importance: Small studies suggest that head trauma in men may be associated with low testosterone levels and sexual dysfunction through mechanisms that likely include hypopituitarism secondary to ischemic injury and pituitary axonal tract damage. Athletes in contact sports may be at risk for pituitary insufficiencies or erectile dysfunction (ED) because of the high number of head traumas experienced during their careers. Whether multiple symptomatic concussive events are associated with later indicators of low testosterone levels and ED is unknown. Objective: To explore the associations between concussion symptom history and participant-reported indicators of low testosterone levels and ED. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cross-sectional study of former professional US-style football players was conducted in Boston, Massachusetts, from January 2015 to March 2017. Surveys on past football exposures, demographic factors, and current health conditions were sent via electronic and postal mail to participants within and outside of the United States. Analyses were conducted in Boston, Massachusetts; the data analysis began in March 2018 and additional analyses were performed through June 2019. Of the 13\u202f720 male former players eligible to enroll who were contacted, 3506 (25.6%) responded. Exposures: Concussion symptom score was calculated by summing the frequency with which participants reported 10 symptoms, such as loss of consciousness, disorientation, nausea, memory problems, and dizziness, at the time of football-related head injury. Main Outcomes and Measures: Self-reported recommendations or prescriptions for low testosterone or ED medication served as indicators for testosterone insufficiency and ED. Results: In 3409 former players (mean [SD] age, 52.5 [14.1] years), the prevalence of indicators of low testosterone levels and ED was 18.3% and 22.7%, respectively. The odds of reporting low testosterone levels or ED indicators were elevated for previously established risk factors (eg, diabetes, sleep apnea, and mood disorders). Models adjusted for demographic characteristics, football exposures, and current health factors showed a significant monotonically increasing association of concussion symptom score with the odds of reporting the low testosterone indicator (highest vs lowest quartile, odds ratio, 2.39; 95% CI, 1.79-3.19; P\u2009<\u2009.001). The ED indicator showed a similar association (highest quartile vs lowest, odds ratio, 1.72; 95% CI, 1.30-2.27; P\u2009<\u2009.001). Conclusions and Relevance: Concussion symptoms at the time of injury among former football players were associated with current participant-reported low testosterone levels and ED indicators. These findings suggest that men with a history of head injury may benefit from discussions with their health care clinicians regarding testosterone deficiency and sexual dysfunction. ",
        "Consensus Statement on Sports-Related Concussions in Youth Sports Using a Modified Delphi Approach. Importance: Given the importance of sports-related concussions among youth athletes, the rapid progress of research on this topic over the last decade, and the need to provide further guidance to youth athletes, their families, medical professionals, and athletic personnel and organizations, a panel of experts undertook a modified Delphi consensus process to summarize the current literature and provide recommendations regarding the prevention, assessment, and management of sports-related concussions for young athletes. Methods: A consensus panel of 11 experts was created to represent a broad spectrum of expertise in youth sports and concussions. The specific questions to be addressed were developed through an iterative process consisting of 3 rounds, and a review of the literature was conducted to identify research studies related to each question. The consensus panel used a modified Delphi process to reach consensus on the conclusions and recommendations for each question. Results and Conclusions: In 3 Delphi consensus rounds, 7 questions were addressed by the consensus panel of 11 experts, and 26 recommendations for the prevention, assessment, and management of sports-related concussions among young athletes were developed. For many of the questions addressed in this consensus statement, limitations existed in the quantity and quality of the evidence available to develop specific recommendations for youth sports stakeholders.

        "Tau Positron Emission Tomographic Findings in a Former US Football Player With Pathologically Confirmed Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy. Importance: Biomarkers for chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) are currently lacking. The radiotracer fluorine F 18-labeled (18F)-flortaucipir (FTP) detects tau pathology in Alzheimer disease, and positron emission tomography (PET) with FTP shows elevated binding in individuals at risk for CTE. No study, however, has assessed the correlation between in vivo FTP PET and postmortem tau in CTE. Objective: To assess the regional association between in vivo FTP binding and postmortem tau pathology in a patient with pathologically confirmed CTE. Design, Setting, and Participants: A white male former National Football League player with 17 years of US football exposure was clinically diagnosed with traumatic encephalopathy syndrome at a neurology tertiary referral center. 18F-Fludeoxyglucose, carbon 11-labeled Pittsburgh compound B, and FTP PET were performed 52 months prior to death, and magnetic resonance imaging, 50 months prior to death. Brain images were assessed qualitatively for abnormalities blinded to autopsy data. Autopsy was performed using a neurodegenerative research protocol. The FTP standardized uptake value ratios (inferior cerebellar gray reference region) and W-score (age-adjusted z-score) maps were compared with phosphorylated tau immunohistochemical analysis with monoclonal antibody CP13. Main Outcomes and Measures: Qualitative and quantitative comparisons between antemortem FTP PET and tau pathology at autopsy. Results: Flortaucipir uptake was distributed in a patchy, frontotemporal-predominant pattern that overlapped with regions showing neurodegeneration on magnetic resonance imaging and hypometabolism on 18F-fludeoxyglucose PET. Pathological assessment revealed stage 4 CTE; limbic argyrophilic grain disease; stage 2 limbic-predominant, age-related transactive response DNA-binding protein 43 encephalopathy; and Braak neurofibrillary tangle stage 3. 18F-Flortaucipir W-maps matched areas of high postmortem tau burden in left fusiform and inferior temporal gyri and juxtacortical frontal white matter. High FTP W-scores with low tau burden were found in the basal ganglia, thalamus, motor cortex, and calcarine cortex. No regions with low FTP W-scores corresponded to areas with high pathological tau burden. A modest correlation, which did not reach statistical significance (\u03c1\u2009=\u20090.35, P\u2009=\u2009.17), was found between FTP standardized uptake value ratio and tau area fraction at the regional level. Conclusions and Relevance: In this patient, FTP PET findings during life showed a modest correspondence with postmortem pathology in CTE. These findings suggest that FTP may have limited utility as a tau biomarker in CTE. ",
        "Acute vestibular migraine treatment with noninvasive vagus nerve stimulation. OBJECTIVE: To report on the benefits of noninvasive vagus nerve stimulation (nVNS) on acute vestibular migraine (VM) treatment. METHODS: This was a retrospective chart review of patients with VM treated with nVNS in a single tertiary referral center between November 2017 and January 2019. Eighteen patients (16 women) were identified (mean age 45.7 [\u00b114.8] years); 14 were treated for a VM attack and 4 for bothersome interictal dizziness consistent with persistent perceptual postural dizziness (PPPD). Patients graded the severity of vestibular symptoms and headache using an 11-point visual analog scale (VAS; 0 = no symptoms, 10 = worst ever symptoms) before and 15 minutes after nVNS. RESULTS: In those with acute VM, vertigo improved in 13/14 (complete resolution in 2, at least 50% improvement in 5). The mean vertigo intensity before nVNS was 5.2 (\u00b11.6; median 6), and 3.1 (\u00b12.2; median 3) following stimulation; mean reduction in vertigo intensity was 46.9% (\u00b131.5; median 45%). Five experienced headache with the VM attack; all reported improvement following nVNS. Mean headache severity was 6 (\u00b11.4; median 6) prior to treatment and 2.4 (\u00b11.5; median 3) following nVNS; mean reduction in headache intensity was 63.3% (\u00b121.7; median 50). All 4 treated with nVNS for interictal PPPD reported no benefit. CONCLUSION: Our study provides preliminary evidence that nVNS may provide rapid relief of vertigo and headache in acute VM, and supports further randomized, sham-controlled studies into nVNS in VM. CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE: This study provides Class IV evidence that for patients with acute VM, nVNS rapidly relieves vertigo and headache. ",
        "Effect of Ubrogepant vs Placebo on Pain and the Most Bothersome Associated Symptom in the Acute Treatment of Migraine: The ACHIEVE II Randomized Clinical Trial. Importance: Ubrogepant is an oral calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor antagonist under investigation for acute treatment of migraine. Objective: To evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of ubrogepant compared with placebo for acute treatment of a single migraine attack. Design, Setting, and Participants: Phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single-attack, clinical trial (ACHIEVE II) conducted in the United States (99 primary care and research clinics; August 26, 2016-February 26, 2018). Participants were adults with migraine with or without aura experiencing 2 to 8 migraine attacks per month. Interventions: Ubrogepant 50 mg (n\u2009=\u2009562), ubrogepant 25 mg (n\u2009=\u2009561), or placebo (n\u2009=\u2009563) for a migraine attack of moderate or severe pain intensity. Main Outcomes and Measures: Co-primary efficacy outcomes were pain freedom and absence of the participant-designated most bothersome migraine-associated symptom (among photophobia, phonophobia, and nausea) at 2 hours after taking the medication. Results: Among 1686 randomized participants, 1465 received study treatment (safety population; mean age, 41.5 years; 90% female); 1355 of 1465 (92.5%) were evaluable for efficacy. Pain freedom at 2 hours was reported by 101 of 464 participants (21.8%) in the ubrogepant 50-mg group, 90 of 435 (20.7%) in the ubrogepant 25-mg group, and 65 of 456 (14.3%) in the placebo group (absolute difference for 50 mg vs placebo, 7.5%; 95% CI, 2.6%-12.5%; P\u2009=\u2009.01; 25 mg vs placebo, 6.4%; 95% CI, 1.5%-11.5%; P\u2009=\u2009.03). Absence of the most bothersome associated symptom at 2 hours was reported by 180 of 463 participants (38.9%) in the ubrogepant 50-mg group, 148 of 434 (34.1%) in the ubrogepant 25-mg group, and 125 of 456 (27.4%) in the placebo group (absolute difference for 50 mg vs placebo, 11.5%; 95% CI, 5.4%-17.5%; P\u2009=\u2009.01; 25 mg vs placebo, 6.7%; 95% CI, 0.6%-12.7%; P\u2009=\u2009.07). The most common adverse events within 48 hours of any dose were nausea (50 mg, 10 of 488 [2.0%]; 25 mg, 12 of 478 [2.5%]; and placebo, 10 of 499 [2.0%]) and dizziness (50 mg, 7 of 488 [1.4%]; 25 mg, 10 of 478 [2.1%]; placebo, 8 of 499 [1.6%]). Conclusions and Relevance: Among adults with migraine, acute treatment with ubrogepant compared with placebo led to significantly greater rates of pain freedom at 2 hours with 50-mg and 25-mg doses, and absence of the most bothersome migraine-associated symptom at 2 hours only with the 50-mg dose. Further research is needed to assess the effectiveness of ubrogepant against other acute treatments for migraine and to evaluate the long-term safety of ubrogepant among unselected patient populations.

        "Association of Initial Disease-Modifying Therapy With Later Conversion to Secondary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis. Importance: Within 2 decades of onset, 80% of untreated patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (MS) convert to a phase of irreversible disability accrual termed secondary progressive MS. The association between disease-modifying treatments (DMTs), and this conversion has rarely been studied and never using a validated definition. Objective: To determine the association between the use, the type of, and the timing of DMTs with the risk of conversion to secondary progressive MS diagnosed with a validated definition. Design, Setting, and Participants: Cohort study with prospective data from 68 neurology centers in 21 countries examining patients with relapsing-remitting MS commencing DMTs (or clinical monitoring) between 1988-2012 with minimum 4 years' follow-up. Exposures: The use, type, and timing of the following DMTs: interferon beta, glatiramer acetate, fingolimod, natalizumab, or alemtuzumab. After propensity-score matching, 1555 patients were included (last follow-up, February 14, 2017). Main Outcome and Measure: Conversion to objectively defined secondary progressive MS. Results: Of the 1555 patients, 1123 were female (mean baseline age, 35 years [SD, 10]). Patients initially treated with glatiramer acetate or interferon beta had a lower hazard of conversion to secondary progressive MS than matched untreated patients (HR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.61-0.81; P\u2009<\u2009.001; 5-year absolute risk, 12% [49 of 407] vs 27% [58 of 213]; median follow-up, 7.6 years [IQR, 5.8-9.6]), as did fingolimod (HR, 0.37; 95% CI, 0.22-0.62; P\u2009<\u2009.001; 5-year absolute risk, 7% [6 of 85] vs 32% [56 of 174]; median follow-up, 4.5 years [IQR, 4.3-5.1]); natalizumab (HR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.43-0.86; P\u2009=\u2009.005; 5-year absolute risk, 19% [16 of 82] vs 38% [62 of 164]; median follow-up, 4.9 years [IQR, 4.4-5.8]); and alemtuzumab (HR, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.32-0.85; P\u2009=\u2009.009; 5-year absolute risk, 10% [4 of 44] vs 25% [23 of 92]; median follow-up, 7.4 years [IQR, 6.0-8.6]). Initial treatment with fingolimod, alemtuzumab, or natalizumab was associated with a lower risk of conversion than initial treatment with glatiramer acetate or interferon beta (HR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.44-0.99; P\u2009=\u2009.046); 5-year absolute risk, 7% [16 of 235] vs 12% [46 of 380]; median follow-up, 5.8 years [IQR, 4.7-8.0]). The probability of conversion was lower when glatiramer acetate or interferon beta was started within 5 years of disease onset vs later (HR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.61-0.98; P\u2009=\u2009.03; 5-year absolute risk, 3% [4 of 120] vs 6% [2 of 38]; median follow-up, 13.4 years [IQR, 11-18.1]). When glatiramer acetate or interferon beta were escalated to fingolimod, alemtuzumab, or natalizumab within 5 years vs later, the HR was 0.76 (95% CI, 0.66-0.88; P\u2009<\u2009.001; 5-year absolute risk, 8% [25 of 307] vs 14% [46 of 331], median follow-up, 5.3 years [IQR], 4.6-6.1). Conclusions and Relevance: Among patients with relapsing-remitting MS, initial treatment with fingolimod, alemtuzumab, or natalizumab was associated with a lower risk of conversion to secondary progressive MS vs initial treatment with glatiramer acetate or interferon beta. These findings, considered along with these therapies' risks, may help inform decisions about DMT selection. ",
        "Effect of Nonmyeloablative Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation vs Continued Disease-Modifying Therapy on Disease Progression in Patients With Relapsing-Remitting Multiple Sclerosis: A Randomized Clinical Trial. Importance: Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) represents a potentially useful approach to slow or prevent progressive disability in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (MS). Objective: To compare the effect of nonmyeloablative HSCT vs disease-modifying therapy (DMT) on disease progression. Design, Setting, and Participants: Between September 20, 2005, and July 7, 2016, a total of 110 patients with relapsing-remitting MS, at least 2 relapses while receiving DMT in the prior year, and an Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS; score range, 0-10 [10 = worst neurologic disability]) score of 2.0 to 6.0 were randomized at 4 US, European, and South American centers. Final follow-up occurred in January 2018 and database lock in February 2018. Interventions: Patients were randomized to receive HSCT along with cyclophosphamide (200 mg/kg) and antithymocyte globulin (6 mg/kg) (n\u2009=\u200955) or DMT of higher efficacy or a different class than DMT taken during the previous year (n\u2009=\u200955). Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary end point was disease progression, defined as an EDSS score increase after at least 1 year of 1.0 point or more (minimal clinically important difference, 0.5) on 2 evaluations 6 months apart, with differences in time to progression estimated as hazard ratios. Results: Among 110 randomized patients (73 [66%] women; mean age, 36 [SD, 8.6] years), 103 remained in the trial, with 98 evaluated at 1 year and 23 evaluated yearly for 5 years (median follow-up, 2 years; mean, 2.8 years). Disease progression occurred in 3 patients in the HSCT group and 34 patients in the DMT group. Median time to progression could not be calculated in the HSCT group because of too few events; it was 24 months (interquartile range, 18-48 months) in the DMT group (hazard ratio, 0.07; 95% CI, 0.02-0.24; P\u2009<\u2009.001). During the first year, mean EDSS scores decreased (improved) from 3.38 to 2.36 in the HSCT group and increased (worsened) from 3.31 to 3.98 in the DMT group (between-group mean difference, -1.7; 95% CI, -2.03 to -1.29; P\u2009<\u2009.001). There were no deaths and no patients who received HSCT developed nonhematopoietic grade 4 toxicities (such as myocardial infarction, sepsis, or other disabling or potential life-threatening events). Conclusions and Relevance: In this preliminary study of patients with relapsing-remitting MS, nonmyeloablative HSCT, compared with DMT, resulted in prolonged time to disease progression. Further research is needed to replicate these findings and to assess long-term outcomes and safety. Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT00273364. ",
        "Clinical Outcomes of Escalation vs Early Intensive Disease-Modifying Therapy in Patients With Multiple Sclerosis. Importance: Uncertainty remains about how aggressively to treat early multiple sclerosis. High-efficacy disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) are often reserved for individuals expressing poor prognostic features at baseline. Objective: To analyze long-term outcomes in a population-based cohort according to initial treatment strategy. Design, Setting and Participants: In this cohort study, data were derived from January 1998 to December 2016, and analysis was performed in January 2017. From a total of 720 patients prescribed a DMT, 592 (82%) were included in analysis. Reasons for exclusion were first treated elsewhere or privately (n\u2009=\u200939), clinical trial participant (n\u2009=\u200925), and insufficient clinical data (n\u2009=\u200945). Exposures: Patients were classified according to first-line treatment strategy: high-efficacy (early intensive treatment [EIT]) or moderate-efficacy DMT (escalation [ESC]). Main Outcomes and Measures: Primary outcome was 5-year change in Expanded Disability Status Scale score. Secondary outcome was time to sustained accumulation of disability (SAD). Models were adjusted for sex, age at treatment, year of starting DMT, and escalation to high-efficacy treatment in the ESC group. Results: Mean (SD) age of 592 patients at symptom onset was 27.0 (9.4) years. Mean (SD) 5-year change in Expanded Disability Status Scale score was lower in the EIT group than the ESC group (0.3 [1.5] vs 1.2 [1.5]); this remained significant after adjustment for relevant covariates (\u03b2\u2009=\u2009-0.85; 95% CI, -1.38 to -0.32; P\u2009=\u2009.002). Median (95% CI) time to SAD was 6.0 (3.17-9.16) years for EIT and 3.14 (2.77-4.00) years for ESC (P\u2009=\u2009.05). For those within the ESC group who escalated to high-efficacy DMT as second-line treatment, median (95% CI) time to SAD was 3.3 years (1.8-5.6; compared with EIT group log-rank test P\u2009=\u2009.08). After adjustment for relevant covariates, there was no difference in hazard of SAD between the groups. However, 60% of those who escalated to high-efficacy DMTs were observed to develop SAD while still receiving initial moderate-efficacy treatment before escalation. Conclusions and Relevance: In a real-life setting, long-term outcomes were more favorable following early intensive therapy vs first-line moderate-efficacy DMT. Contemporary surveillance strategies and escalation protocols may be insufficiently responsive. This finding is particularly relevant as patients in real-world practice are typically selected for an EIT approach to therapy on the basis of clinical and radiological features predictive of a poor outcome. These data support the need for a prospective randomized clinical trial. ",
        "Cellular senescence in progenitor cells contributes to diminished remyelination potential in progressive multiple sclerosis. Cellular senescence is a form of adaptive cellular physiology associated with aging. Cellular senescence causes a proinflammatory cellular phenotype that impairs tissue regeneration, has been linked to stress, and is implicated in several human neurodegenerative diseases. We had previously determined that neural progenitor cells (NPCs) derived from induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines from patients with primary progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS) failed to promote oligodendrocyte progenitor cell (OPC) maturation, whereas NPCs from age-matched control cell lines did so efficiently. Herein, we report that expression of hallmarks of cellular senescence were identified in SOX2+ progenitor cells within white matter lesions of human progressive MS (PMS) autopsy brain tissues and iPS-derived NPCs from patients with PPMS. Expression of cellular senescence genes in PPMS NPCs was found to be reversible by treatment with rapamycin, which then enhanced PPMS NPC support for oligodendrocyte (OL) differentiation. A proteomic analysis of the PPMS NPC secretome identified high-mobility group box-1 (HMGB1), which was found to be a senescence-associated inhibitor of OL differentiation. Transcriptome analysis of OPCs revealed that senescent NPCs induced expression of epigenetic regulators mediated by extracellular HMGB1. Lastly, we determined that progenitor cells are a source of elevated HMGB1 in human white matter lesions. Based on these data, we conclude that cellular senescence contributes to altered progenitor cell functions in demyelinated lesions in MS. Moreover, these data implicate cellular aging and senescence as a process that contributes to remyelination failure in PMS, which may impact how this disease is modeled and inform development of future myelin regeneration strategies.

        "Placebo-Controlled Trial of an Oral BTK Inhibitor in Multiple Sclerosis. BACKGROUND: Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) regulates the functions of B cells and myeloid cells that are implicated in the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis. Evobrutinib is a selective oral BTK inhibitor that has been shown to inhibit B-cell activation both in vitro and in vivo. METHODS: In this double-blind, randomized, phase 2 trial, we assigned patients with relapsing multiple sclerosis to one of five groups: placebo, evobrutinib (at a dose of 25 mg once daily, 75 mg once daily, or 75 mg twice daily), or open-label dimethyl fumarate (DMF) as a reference. The primary end point was the total (cumulative) number of gadolinium-enhancing lesions identified on T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging at weeks 12, 16, 20, and 24. Key secondary end points included the annualized relapse rate and change from baseline in the score on the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS). RESULTS: A total of 267 patients were randomly assigned to a trial group. The mean (\u00b1SD) total number of gadolinium-enhancing lesions during weeks 12 through 24 was 3.85\u00b15.44 in the placebo group, 4.06\u00b18.02 in the evobrutinib 25-mg group, 1.69\u00b14.69 in the evobrutinib 75-mg once-daily group, 1.15\u00b13.70 in the evobrutinib 75-mg twice-daily group, and 4.78\u00b122.05 in the DMF group. The baseline adjusted rate ratios for the total number of lesions over time as compared with placebo were 1.45 in the evobrutinib 25-mg group (P\u2009=\u20090.32), 0.30 in the evobrutinib 75-mg once-daily group (P\u2009=\u20090.005), and 0.44 in the evobrutinib 75-mg twice-daily group (P\u2009=\u20090.06). The unadjusted annualized relapse rate at week 24 was 0.37 in the placebo group, 0.57 in the evobrutinib 25-mg group, 0.13 in the evobrutinib 75-mg once-daily group, 0.08 in the evobrutinib 75-mg twice-daily group, and 0.20 in the DMF group. There was no significant effect of trial group on the change from baseline in the EDSS score. Elevations in liver aminotransferase values were observed with evobrutinib. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with relapsing multiple sclerosis who received 75 mg of evobrutinib once daily had significantly fewer enhancing lesions during weeks 12 through 24 than those who received placebo. There was no significant difference with placebo for either the 25-mg once-daily or 75-mg twice-daily dose of evobrutinib, nor in the annualized relapse rate or disability progression at any dose. Longer and larger trials are required to determine the effect and risks of evobrutinib in patients with multiple sclerosis. (Funded by EMD Serono; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT02975349.). ",
        "Effect of Rocuronium vs Succinylcholine on Endotracheal Intubation Success Rate Among Patients Undergoing Out-of-Hospital Rapid Sequence Intubation: A Randomized Clinical Trial. Importance: Rocuronium and succinylcholine are often used for rapid sequence intubation, although the comparative efficacy of these paralytic agents for achieving successful intubation in an emergency setting has not been evaluated in clinical trials. Succinylcholine use has been associated with several adverse events not reported with rocuronium. Objective: To assess the noninferiority of rocuronium vs succinylcholine for tracheal intubation in out-of-hospital emergency situations. Design, Setting and Participants: Multicenter, single-blind, noninferiority randomized clinical trial comparing rocuronium (1.2 mg/kg) with succinylcholine (1 mg/kg) for rapid sequence intubation in 1248 adult patients needing out-of-hospital tracheal intubation. Enrollment occurred from January 2014 to August 2016 in 17 French out-of-hospital emergency medical units. The date of final follow-up was August 31, 2016. Interventions: Patients were randomly assigned to undergo tracheal intubation facilitated by rocuronium (n\u2009=\u2009624) or succinylcholine (n\u2009=\u2009624). Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was the intubation success rate on first attempt. A noninferiority margin of 7% was chosen. A per-protocol analysis was prespecified as the primary analysis. Results: Among 1248 patients who were randomized (mean age, 56 years; 501 [40.1%] women), 1230 (98.6%) completed the trial and 1226 (98.2%) were included in the per-protocol analysis. The number of patients with successful first-attempt intubation was 455 of 610 (74.6%) in the rocuronium group vs 489 of 616 (79.4%) in the succinylcholine group, with a between-group difference of -4.8% (1-sided 97.5% CI, -9% to \u221e), which did not meet criteria for noninferiority. The most common intubation-related adverse events were hypoxemia (55 of 610 patients [9.0%]) and hypotension (39 of 610 patients [6.4%]) in the rocuronium group and hypoxemia (61 of 616 [9.9%]) and hypotension (62 of 616 patients [10.1%]) in the succinylcholine group. Conclusions and Relevance: Among patients undergoing endotracheal intubation in an out-of-hospital emergency setting, rocuronium, compared with succinylcholine, failed to demonstrate noninferiority with regard to first-attempt intubation success rate.

        "Association of Chronic Active Multiple Sclerosis Lesions With Disability In Vivo. Importance: In multiple sclerosis (MS), chronic active lesions, which previously could only be detected at autopsy, can now be identified on susceptibility-based magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in vivo as non-gadolinium-enhancing lesions with paramagnetic rims. Pathologically, they feature smoldering inflammatory demyelination at the edge, remyelination failure, and axonal degeneration. To our knowledge, the prospect of long-term in vivo monitoring makes it possible for the first time to determine their contribution to disability and value as a treatment target. Objective: To assess whether rim lesions are associated with patient disability and long-term lesion outcomes. Design, Setting, Participants: We performed 3 studies at the National Institutes of Health Clinical Center: (1) a prospective clinical/radiological cohort of 209 patients with MS (diagnosis according to the 2010 McDonald revised MS criteria, age \u226518 years, with 7-T or 3-T susceptibility-based brain MRI results) who were enrolled from January 2012 to March 2018 (of 209, 17 patients [8%] were excluded because of uninterpretable MRI scans); (2) a radiological/pathological analysis of expanding lesions featuring rims; and (3) a retrospective longitudinal radiological study assessing long-term lesion evolution in 23 patients with MS with yearly MRI scans for 10 years or more (earliest scan, 1992). Main Outcomes and Measures: (1) Identification of chronic rim lesions on 7-T or 3-T susceptibility-based brain MRI in 192 patients with MS and the association of rim counts with clinical disability (primary analysis) and brain volume changes (exploratory analysis). (2) Pathological characterization of 10 expanding lesions from an adult with progressive MS who came to autopsy after 7 years of receiving serial in vivo MRI scans. (3) Evaluation of annual lesion volume change (primary analysis) and T1 times (exploratory analysis) in 27 rim lesions vs 27 rimless lesions. Results: Of 209 participants, 104 (50%) were women and 32 (15%) were African American. One hundred seventeen patients (56%) had at least 1 rim lesion regardless of prior or ongoing treatment. Further, 84 patients (40%) had no rims (mean [SD] age, 47 [14] years), 66 (32%) had 1 to 3 rims (mean [SD] age, 47 [11] years), and 42 (20%) had 4 rims or more (mean [SD] age, 44 [11] years). Individuals with 4 rim lesions or more reached motor and cognitive disability at an earlier age. Normalized volumes of brain, white matter, and basal ganglia were lower in those with rim lesions. Whereas rimless lesions shrank over time (-3.6%/year), rim lesions were stable in size or expanded (2.2%/year; P\u2009<\u2009.001). Rim lesions had longer T1 times, suggesting more tissue destruction, than rimless lesions. On histopathological analysis, all 10 rim lesions that expanded in vivo had chronic active inflammation. Conclusions and Relevance: Chronic active lesions are common, are associated with more aggressive disease, exert ongoing tissue damage, and occur even in individuals treated with effective disease-modifying therapies. These results prompt the planning of MRI-based clinical trials aimed at treating perilesional chronic inflammation in MS. ",
        "Evaluation of multiple sclerosis disability outcome measures using pooled clinical trial data. OBJECTIVE: We report analyses of a pooled database by the Multiple Sclerosis Outcome Assessments Consortium to evaluate 4 proposed components of a multidimensional test battery. METHODS: Standardized data on 12,776 participants, comprising demographics, multiple sclerosis disease characteristics, Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score, performance measures, and Short Form-36 Physical Component Summary (SF-36 PCS), were pooled from control and treatment arms of 14 clinical trials. Analyses of Timed 25-Foot Walk (T25FW), 9-Hole Peg Test (9HPT), Low Contrast Letter Acuity (LCLA), and Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT) included measurement properties; construct, convergent, and known group validity; and longitudinal performance of the measures individually and when combined into a multidimensional test battery relative to the EDSS and SF-36 to determine sensitivity and clinical meaningfulness. RESULTS: The performance measures had excellent test-retest reliability and showed expected differences between subgroups based on disease duration and EDSS level. Progression rates in detecting time to 3-month confirmed worsening were lower for T25FW and 9HPT compared to EDSS, while progression rates for LCLA and SDMT were similar to EDSS. When the 4 measures were analyzed as a multidimensional measure rather than as individual measures, progression on any one performance measure was more sensitive than the EDSS. Worsening on the performance measures analyzed individually or as a multidimensional test battery was associated with clinically meaningful SF-36 PCS score worsening, supporting clinical meaningfulness of designated performance test score worsening. CONCLUSION: These results support the use of the 4 proposed performance measures, individually or combined into a multidimensional test battery as study outcome measures. ",
        "Effect of generic glatiramer acetate on spending and use of drugs for multiple sclerosis. OBJECTIVE: To estimate changes in costs and utilization trends for disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) from 2011 to 2017 in the US Medicaid program. METHODS: Using quarterly Medicaid State Drug Utilization Data from 2011 to 2017, we summarize trends in spending, utilization, and costs per prescription for 15 multiple sclerosis (MS) DMTs including brand and generic versions of glatiramer acetate. We use interrupted time series regression to estimate the effect of market entry of generic glatiramer acetate on cost per prescription of other self-administered DMTs. RESULTS: Gross annual expenditures on MS DMTs increased from $453 million to $1.32 billion between 2011 and 2017 within the Medicaid program. Increased spending was primarily driven by increases in per prescription costs, which doubled during the study period. Although total utilization was stable, product specific utilization shifted from injectable to oral DMTs. However, throughout the study, the plurality of utilization was glatiramer acetate. The introduction of generic glatiramer acetate in Q2 of 2015 was associated with an immediate increase of $441 (95% confidence interval [CI] $184-$697; p < 0.001) in the cost per prescription of branded glatiramer acetate followed by a gradual $52 per prescription reduction (95% CI -$86 to -$18) over time. There were minimal changes in the costs for the other DMTs. CONCLUSIONS: Spending on MS DMTs in the Medicaid program have more than doubled over the last 7 years primarily as a function of higher costs per prescription. Introduction of a generic glatiramer acetate product in 2015 had nominal effects on overall price trajectories and utilization within the class. ",
        "Receipt of Overlapping Opioid and Benzodiazepine Prescriptions Among Veterans Dually Enrolled in Medicare Part D and the Department of Veterans Affairs: A Cross-sectional Study. Background: Overlapping use of opioids and benzodiazepines is associated with increased risk for overdose. Veterans receiving medications concurrently from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and Medicare may be at higher risk for such overlap. Objective: To assess the association between dual use of VA and Medicare drug benefits and receipt of overlapping opioid and benzodiazepine prescriptions. Design: Cross-sectional. Setting: VA and Medicare. Participants: All veterans enrolled in VA and Medicare Part D who filled at least 2 opioid prescriptions in 2013 (n\u00a0= 368\u00a0891). Measurements: Outcomes were the proportion of patients with a Pharmacy Quality Alliance (PQA) measure of opioid-benzodiazepine overlap (\u22652 filled prescriptions for benzodiazepines with \u226530 days of overlap with opioids) and the proportion of patients with high-dose opioid-benzodiazepine overlap (\u226530 days of overlap with a daily opioid dose >120 morphine milligram equivalents). Augmented inverse probability weighting regression was used to compare these measures by prescription drug source: VA only, Medicare only, or VA and Medicare (dual use). Results: Of 368\u00a0891 eligible veterans, 18.3% received prescriptions from the VA only, 30.3% from Medicare only, and 51.4% from both VA and Medicare. The proportion with PQA opioid-benzodiazepine overlap was larger for the dual-use group than the VA-only group (23.1% vs. 17.3%; adjusted risk ratio [aRR], 1.27 [95% CI, 1.24 to 1.30]) and Medicare-only group (23.1% vs. 16.5%; aRR, 1.12 [CI, 1.10 to 1.14]). The proportion with high-dose overlap was also larger for the dual-use group than the VA-only group (4.7% vs. 2.3%; aRR, 2.23 [CI, 2.10 to 2.36]) and Medicare-only group (4.7% vs. 2.9%; aRR, 1.06 [CI, 1.02 to 1.11]). Limitation: Data are from 2013 and cannot capture medications purchased without insurance; unmeasured confounding may remain in this cross-sectional study. Conclusion: Among a national cohort of veterans dually enrolled in VA and Medicare, receiving prescriptions from both sources was associated with greater risk for receiving potentially unsafe overlapping prescriptions for opioids and benzodiazepines.

        "Assessment of Changes in the Geographical Distribution of Opioid-Related Mortality Across the United States by Opioid Type, 1999-2016. Importance: As the opioid epidemic evolves, it is vital to identify changes in the geographical distribution of opioid-related deaths, and the specific opioids to which those deaths are attributed, to ensure that federal and state public health interventions remain appropriately targeted. Objective: To identify changes in the geographical distribution of opioid-related mortality across the United States by opioid type. Design, Setting, and Participants: Cross-sectional study using joinpoint modeling and life table analysis of individual-level data from the National Center for Health Statistics on 351\u202f630 US residents who died from opioid-related causes from January 1, 1999, to December 31, 2016, for all of the United States and the District of Columbia. The analysis was conducted from September 6 to November 23, 2018. Exposures: Deaths involving any opioid, heroin, synthetic opioids, and natural and semisynthetic opioids. Main Outcomes and Measures: Opioid-related mortality rate, annual percent change in the opioid-related mortality rate, and life expectancy lost at age 15 years by state and opioid type. Results: From 1999 to 2016, a total of 231\u202f264 men and 120\u202f366 women died from opioid-related causes across the whole United States. Sixty-six observations were removed owing to missing data on age; therefore, 351\u202f564 US residents were included in this study. The mean (SD) age at death was 39.8 (12.5) years for men and was 43.5 (12.9) years from women. Opioid-related mortality rates, especially from synthetic opioids, rapidly increased in all of the eastern United States. In most states, mortality associated with natural and semisynthetic opioids (ie, prescription painkillers) remained stable. In contrast, 28 states had mortality rates from synthetic opioids that more than doubled every 2 years (ie, annual percent change, \u226541%), including 12 with high mortality rates from synthetic opioids (>10 per 100\u202f000 people). Among these 28 states, the mortality rate from natural and semisynthetic opioids ranged from 2.0 to 18.7 per 100\u202f000 people (with a mean mortality rate of 6.0 per 100\u202f000 people). The District of Columbia had the fastest rate of increase in mortality from opioids, more than tripling every year since 2013 (annual percent change, 228.3%; 95% CI, 169.7%-299.6%; P\u2009<\u2009.001), and a high mortality rate from synthetic opioids in 2016 (18.8 per 100\u202f000 people); the mortality rate from natural and semisynthetic opioids was 6.9 per 100\u202f000 people. Nationally, overall opioid-related mortality resulted in 0.36 years of life expectancy lost in 2016, which was 14% higher than deaths due to firearms and 18% higher than deaths due to motor vehicle crashes; 0.17 years of the life expectancy lost was due specifically to synthetic opioids. In 2016, New Hampshire and West Virginia lost more than 1 year of life expectancy due to opioid-related mortality. Conclusions and Relevance: Opioid-related mortality, particularly mortality associated with synthetic opioids, has increased in the eastern United States. These findings indicate that policies focused on reducing opioid-related deaths may need to prioritize synthetic opioids and rapidly expanding epidemics in northeastern states and consider the potential for synthetic opioid epidemics outside of the heroin supply.

        "Randomized Delayed-Start Trial of Levodopa in Parkinson's Disease. BACKGROUND: Levodopa is the main treatment for symptoms of Parkinson's disease. Determining whether levodopa also has a disease-modifying effect could provide guidance as to when in the course of the disease the treatment with this drug should be initiated. METHODS: In a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, delayed-start trial, we randomly assigned patients with early Parkinson's disease to receive levodopa (100 mg three times per day) in combination with carbidopa (25 mg three times per day) for 80 weeks (early-start group) or placebo for 40 weeks followed by levodopa in combination with carbidopa for 40 weeks (delayed-start group). The primary outcome was the between-group difference in the mean change from baseline to week 80 in the total score on the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS; scores range from 0 to 176, with higher scores signifying more severe disease). Secondary analyses included the progression of symptoms, as measured by the UPDRS score, between weeks 4 and 40 and the noninferiority of early initiation of treatment to delayed initiation between weeks 44 and 80, with a noninferiority margin of 0.055 points per week. RESULTS: A total of 445 patients were randomly assigned: 222 to the early-start group and 223 to the delayed-start group. The mean (\u00b1SD) UPDRS score at baseline was 28.1\u00b111.4 points in the early-start group and 29.3\u00b112.1 points in the delayed-start group. The change in UPDRS score from baseline to week 80 was -1.0\u00b113.1 points and -2.0\u00b113.0 points, respectively (difference, 1.0 point; 95% confidence interval [CI], -1.5 to 3.5; P=0.44); this finding of no significant between-group difference at week 80 implies that levodopa had no disease-modifying effect. Between weeks 4 and 40, the rate of progression of symptoms, as measured in UPDRS points per week, was 0.04\u00b10.23 in the early-start group and 0.06\u00b10.34 in the delayed-start group (difference, -0.02; 95% CI, -0.07 to 0.03). The corresponding rates between weeks 44 and 80 were 0.10\u00b10.25 and 0.03\u00b10.28 (difference, 0.07; two-sided 90% CI, 0.03 to 0.10); the difference in the rate of progression between weeks 44 and 80 did not meet the criterion for noninferiority of early receipt of levodopa to delayed receipt. The rates of dyskinesia and levodopa-related fluctuations in motor response did not differ significantly between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with early Parkinson's disease who were evaluated over the course of 80 weeks, treatment with levodopa in combination with carbidopa had no disease-modifying effect.

        "Risk of Developing Parkinson Disease in Bipolar Disorder: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis. Importance: Parkinson disease (PD) manifests by motor and nonmotor symptoms, which may be preceded by mood disorders by more than a decade. Bipolar disorder (BD) is characterized by cyclic episodes of depression and mania. It is also suggested that dopamine might be relevant in the pathophysiology of BD. Objective: To assess the association of BD with a later diagnosis of idiopathic PD. Data Sources: An electronic literature search was performed of Cochrane Controlled Register of Trials, MEDLINE, Embase, and PsycINFO from database inception to May 2019 using the terms Parkinson disease, bipolar disorder, and mania, with no constraints applied. Study Selection: Studies that reported data on the likelihood of developing PD in BD vs non-BD populations were included. Two review authors independently conducted the study selection. Data Extraction and Synthesis: Two review authors independently extracted study data. Data were pooled using a random-effects model, results were abstracted as odds ratios and 95% CIs, and heterogeneity was reported as I2. Main Outcome and Measures: Odds ratios of PD. Results: Seven studies were eligible for inclusion and included 4\u202f374\u202f211 participants overall. A previous diagnosis of BD increased the likelihood of a subsequent diagnosis of idiopathic PD (odds ratio, 3.35; 95% CI, 2.00-5.60; I2\u2009=\u200992%). A sensitivity analysis was performed by removing the studies that had a high risk of bias and also showed an increased risk of PD in people with BD (odds ratio, 3.21; 95% CI, 1.89-5.45; I2\u2009=\u200994%). Preplanned subgroup analyses according to study design and diagnostic certainty failed to show a significant effect. Conclusions and Relevance: This review suggests that patients with BD have a significantly increased risk of developing PD compared with the general population. Subgroup analyses suggested a possible overestimation in the magnitude of the associations. These findings highlight the probability that BD may be associated with a later development of PD and the importance of the differential diagnosis of parkinsonism features in people with BD. ",
        "Nilotinib Effects on Safety, Tolerability, and Potential Biomarkers in Parkinson Disease: A Phase 2 Randomized Clinical Trial. Importance: This study evaluated nilotinib safety and its effects on biomarkers as a potential disease-modifying drug in Parkinson disease. Objectives: To assess nilotinib effects on safety and pharmacokinetics and measure the change in exploratory biomarkers in patients with moderately severe Parkinson disease. Design, Setting, and Participants: This was a single-center, phase 2, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial with 300 patients approached in clinic; of these, 200 declined to participate, 100 were screened, 25 were excluded, and 75 were randomized 1:1:1 into placebo; nilotinib, 150-mg; or nilotinib, 300-mg groups. Recruitment started on May 17, 2017, and ended April 28, 2018, and follow-up ended August 10, 2019. Parkinson disease was confirmed according to the UK Brain Bank diagnostic criteria and symptoms were stabilized with use of optimal levodopa and/or dopamine agonists and other medications used in Parkinson disease. Interventions: Nilotinib vs placebo, administered orally once daily for 12 months followed by a 3-month washout period. Main Outcomes and Measures: It was hypothesized that nilotinib is safe and can be detected in the cerebrospinal fluid, where it alters exploratory biomarkers via inhibition of Abelson tyrosine kinase and potentially improves clinical outcomes. Results: Of the 75 patients included in the study, 55 were men (73.3%); mean (SD) age was 68.4 (8.2) years. Doses of 150 or 300 mg of nilotinib were reasonably safe, although more serious adverse events were detected in the nilotinib (150 mg: 6 [24%]; 300 mg: 12 [48%]) vs placebo (4 [16%]) groups. The 150-mg nilotinib group showed an increase in cerebrospinal fluid levels of the dopamine metabolites homovanillic acid (159.80nM; 90% CI, 7.04-312.60nM; P\u2009=\u2009.04) and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (4.87nM; 90% CI, 1.51-8.23nM; P\u2009=\u2009.01), and the 300-mg nilotinib group showed an increase in 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (7.52nM; 90% CI, 2.35-12.69nM; P\u2009=\u2009.01). The nilotinib 150-mg but not the nilotinib 300-mg group demonstrated a reduction of \u03b1-synuclein oligomers (-0.04 pg/mL; 90% CI, -0.08 to 0.01 pg/mL; P\u2009=\u2009.03). A significant reduction of hyperphosphorylated tau levels was seen in the nilotinib 150-mg (-10.04 pg/mL; 90% CI, -17.41 to -2.67 pg/mL; P\u2009=\u2009.01) and nilotinib 300-mg (-12.05 pg/mL; 90% CI, -19.21 to -4.90 pg/mL; P\u2009=\u2009.01) groups. Conclusions and Relevance: In this study, nilotinib appeared to be reasonably safe and detectable in the cerebrospinal fluid. Exploratory biomarkers were altered in response to nilotinib. Taken together, these data will guide the development of a phase 3 study to investigate the effects of nilotinib therapy in patients with Parkinson disease.

        "Ambroxol for the Treatment of Patients With Parkinson Disease With and Without Glucocerebrosidase Gene Mutations: A Nonrandomized, Noncontrolled Trial. Importance: Mutations of the glucocerebrosidase gene, GBA1 (OMIM 606463), are the most important risk factor for Parkinson disease (PD). In vitro and in vivo studies have reported that ambroxol increases \u03b2-glucocerebrosidase (GCase) enzyme activity and reduces \u03b1-synuclein levels. These observations support a potential role for ambroxol therapy in modifying a relevant pathogenetic pathway in PD. Objective: To assess safety, tolerability, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) penetration, and target engagement of ambroxol therapy with GCase in patients with PD with and without GBA1 mutations. Interventions: An escalating dose of oral ambroxol to 1.26 g per day. Design, Setting, and Participants: This single-center open-label noncontrolled clinical trial was conducted between January 11, 2017, and April 25, 2018, at the Leonard Wolfson Experimental Neuroscience Centre, a dedicated clinical research facility and part of the University College London Queen Square Institute of Neurology in London, United Kingdom. Participants were recruited from established databases at the Royal Free London Hospital and National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery in London. Twenty-four patients with moderate PD were evaluated for eligibility, and 23 entered the study. Of those, 18 patients completed the study; 1 patient was excluded (failed lumbar puncture), and 4 patients withdrew (predominantly lumbar puncture-related complications). All data analyses were performed from November 1 to December 14, 2018. Main Outcomes and Measures: Primary outcomes at 186 days were the detection of ambroxol in the CSF and a change in CSF GCase activity. Results: Of the 18 participants (15 men [83.3%]; mean [SD] age, 60.2 [9.7] years) who completed the study, 17 (8 with GBA1 mutations and 9 without GBA1 mutations) were included in the primary analysis. Between days 0 and 186, a 156-ng/mL increase in the level of ambroxol in CSF (lower 95% confidence limit, 129 ng/mL; P\u2009<\u2009.001) was observed. The CSF GCase activity decreased by 19% (0.059 nmol/mL per hour; 95% CI, -0.115 to -0.002; P\u2009=\u2009.04). The ambroxol therapy was well tolerated, with no serious adverse events. An increase of 50 pg/mL (13%) in the CSF \u03b1-synuclein concentration (95% CI, 14-87; P\u2009=\u2009.01) and an increase of 88 ng/mol (35%) in the CSF GCase protein levels (95% CI, 40-137; P\u2009=\u2009.002) were observed. Mean (SD) scores on part 3 of the Movement Disorders Society Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale decreased (ie, improved) by 6.8 (7.1) points (95% CI, -10.4 to -3.1; P\u2009=\u2009.001). These changes were observed in patients with and without GBA1 mutations. Conclusions and Relevance: The study results suggest that ambroxol therapy was safe and well tolerated; CSF penetration and target engagement of ambroxol were achieved, and CSF \u03b1-synuclein levels were increased. Placebo-controlled clinical trials are needed to examine whether ambroxol therapy is associated with changes in the natural progression of PD.

        "Association of Unintended Pregnancy With Spontaneous Fetal Loss in Women With Epilepsy: Findings of the Epilepsy Birth Control Registry. Importance: If unintended pregnancy is common among women with epilepsy and is associated with increased risk of spontaneous fetal loss (SFL), it is important to develop guidelines for safe and effective contraception for this community. Objective: To assess whether planned pregnancy is a determinant of SFL in women with epilepsy. Design, Setting, and Participants: The Epilepsy Birth Control Registry conducted this web-based, retrospective survey between 2010 and 2014. It gathered demographic, epilepsy, antiepileptic drug (AED), contraceptive, and reproductive data from 1144 women with epilepsy in the community between ages 18 and 47 years. Data were analyzed between March 2018 and May 2018. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was the risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals for SFL in unplanned vs planned pregnancies. The secondary outcome was the identification of some potentially modifiable variables (maternal age, pregnancy spacing, and AED category) of SFL vs live birth using binary logistic regression. Results: The participants were proportionally younger (mean [SD] age, 28.5 [6.8] years), and 39.8% had household incomes of $25\u202f000 or less. Minority women represented only 8.7% of the participants. There were 530 of 794 unplanned pregnancies (66.8%) and 264 of 794 planned pregnancies (33.2%). The risk for SFL in 653 unaborted pregnancies in women with epilepsy was greater for unplanned (n\u2009=\u2009137 of 391; 35.0%) than planned (n\u2009=\u200943 of 262; 16.4%) pregnancies (RR, 2.14; 95% CI, 1.59-2.90; P\u2009<\u2009.001). Regression analysis found that the risk for SFL was greater when planning was entered alone (odds ratio [OR], 2.75; 95% CI, 1.87-4.05; P\u2009<\u2009.001) and more so when adjusted for maternal age, interpregnancy interval, and AED category (OR, 3.57; 95% CI, 1.54-8.78; P\u2009=\u2009.003). Interpregnancy interval (OR, 2.878; 95% CI, 1.8094-4.5801; P\u2009=\u2009.008) and maternal age (OR, 0.957; 95% CI, 0.928-0.986 for each year from 18 to 47 years; P\u2009=\u2009.02), but not AED category, were also associated. The risk was greater when interpregnancy interval was less than 1 year (n\u2009=\u200956 of 122; 45.9%) vs greater than 1 year (n\u2009=\u200956 of 246; 22.8%) (RR, 2.02; 95% CI, 1.49-2.72; P\u2009<\u2009.001). Relative to the younger than 18 years cohort (n\u2009=\u200915 of 29; 51.7%), the risks were lower for the intermediate older cohort aged 18 to 27 years (n\u2009=\u2009118 of 400; 29.5%; RR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.39-0.84; P\u2009<\u2009.004) and the cohort aged 28 to 37 years (n\u2009=\u200944 of 212; 20.8%; RR, 0.40; 95% CI, 0.26-0.62; P\u2009<\u2009.001) but not significantly different for the small number of participants in the aged 38 to 47 years cohort (n\u2009=\u20093 of 12; 25.0%). No individual AED category's SFL frequency differed significantly from the no AED category. Conclusions and relevance: The Epilepsy Birth Control Registry retrospective survey finding that unplanned pregnancy in women with epilepsy may double the risk for SFL warrants prospective investigation with outcome verification.

        "Recognition and Initial Management of Fulminant Myocarditis: A Scientific Statement From the American Heart Association. Fulminant myocarditis (FM) is an uncommon syndrome characterized by sudden and severe diffuse cardiac inflammation often leading to death resulting from cardiogenic shock, ventricular arrhythmias, or multiorgan system failure. Historically, FM was almost exclusively diagnosed at autopsy. By definition, all patients with FM will need some form of inotropic or mechanical circulatory support to maintain end-organ perfusion until transplantation or recovery. Specific subtypes of FM may respond to immunomodulatory therapy in addition to guideline-directed medical care. Despite the increasing availability of circulatory support, orthotopic heart transplantation, and disease-specific treatments, patients with FM experience significant morbidity and mortality as a result of a delay in diagnosis and initiation of circulatory support and lack of appropriately trained specialists to manage the condition. This scientific statement outlines the resources necessary to manage the spectrum of FM, including extracorporeal life support, percutaneous and durable ventricular assist devices, transplantation capabilities, and specialists in advanced heart failure, cardiothoracic surgery, cardiac pathology, immunology, and infectious disease. Education of frontline providers who are most likely to encounter FM first is essential to increase timely access to appropriately resourced facilities, to prevent multiorgan system failure, and to tailor disease-specific therapy as early as possible in the disease process.

        "Readmission after seizure discharge in a nationally representative sample. OBJECTIVE: To determine the 30-day readmission rate after seizure-related discharge in a nationally representative sample, as well as patient, clinical, and hospital characteristics associated with readmission. METHODS: Retrospective cohort study of adults discharged alive from a nonelective hospitalization for epilepsy or seizure, sampled from the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project's 2014 Nationwide Readmissions Database. Descriptive statistics and logistic regression models were built to quantify and characterize nonelective readmission within 30 days. RESULTS: A total of 139,800 admissions met inclusion criteria, of which 15,094 (10.8%) were readmitted within 30 days. Patient characteristics associated with readmission included comorbid disease burden (Elixhauser score 2: adjusted odds ratio [AOR] [95% confidence interval (CI)] 1.38 [1.21-1.57]; Elixhauser score 3: AOR 1.52 [1.34-1.73]; Elixhauser score >4: AOR 2.28 [2.01-2.58] as compared to 1) and participation in public insurance programs (Medicare: AOR 1.39 [1.26-1.54]; Medicaid: AOR 1.39 [1.26-1.54] as compared to private insurance). Adverse events (AOR 1.17 [1.05-1.30]) and prolonged length of stay, as well as nonroutine discharge (AOR 1.32 [1.23-1.42]), were also associated with increased adjusted odds of readmission. The most common primary reason for readmission was epilepsy or convulsion (17%). CONCLUSIONS: Patients hospitalized with seizure are frequently readmitted. While readmitted patients are more likely to have multiple medical comorbidities, our study demonstrated that inpatient adverse events were also significantly associated with readmission. The most common reason for readmission was seizure or epilepsy. Together, these 2 findings suggest that a proportion of readmissions are related to modifiable care process factors and may therefore be avoidable. Further study into understanding preventable drivers of readmission in this population presents an opportunity to improve patient outcomes and health. ",

        "Self-management of Epilepsy: A Systematic Review. Background: Although self-management is recommended for persons with epilepsy, its optimal strategies and effects are uncertain. Purpose: To evaluate the components and efficacy of self-management interventions in the treatment of epilepsy in community-dwelling persons. Data Sources: English-language searches of MEDLINE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PsycINFO, and CINAHL in April 2018; the MEDLINE search was updated in March 2019. Study Selection: Randomized and nonrandomized comparative studies of self-management interventions for adults with epilepsy. Data Extraction: An investigator assessed study characteristics; intervention details, including 6 components of self-management; and outcomes, which were verified by a second reviewer. Risk of bias (ROB) was assessed independently by 2 investigators. Data Synthesis: 13 randomized and 2 nonrandomized studies (2514 patients) evaluated self-management interventions. Interventions were delivered primarily in group settings, used a median of 4 components, and followed 2 general strategies: 1 based on education and the other on psychosocial therapy. Education-based approaches improved self-management behaviors (standardized mean difference, 0.52 [95% CI, 0.0 to 1.04]), and psychosocial therapy-based approaches improved quality of life (mean difference, 6.64 [CI, 2.51 to 10.77]). Overall, self-management interventions did not reduce seizure rates, but 1 educational intervention decreased a composite of seizures, emergency department visits, and hospitalizations. Limitation: High ROB in most studies, incomplete intervention descriptions, and studies limited to English-language publications. Conclusion: There is limited evidence that self-management strategies modestly improve some patient outcomes that are important to persons with epilepsy. Overall, self-management research in epilepsy is limited by the range of interventions tested, the small number of studies using self-monitoring technology, and uncertainty about components and strategies associated with benefit.

        "Randomized Trial of Three Anticonvulsant Medications for Status Epilepticus. BACKGROUND: The choice of drugs for patients with status epilepticus that is refractory to treatment with benzodiazepines has not been thoroughly studied. METHODS: In a randomized, blinded, adaptive trial, we compared the efficacy and safety of three intravenous anticonvulsive agents - levetiracetam, fosphenytoin, and valproate - in children and adults with convulsive status epilepticus that was unresponsive to treatment with benzodiazepines. The primary outcome was absence of clinically evident seizures and improvement in the level of consciousness by 60 minutes after the start of drug infusion, without additional anticonvulsant medication. The posterior probabilities that each drug was the most or least effective were calculated. Safety outcomes included life-threatening hypotension or cardiac arrhythmia, endotracheal intubation, seizure recurrence, and death. RESULTS: A total of 384 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive levetiracetam (145 patients), fosphenytoin (118), or valproate (121). Reenrollment of patients with a second episode of status epilepticus accounted for 16 additional instances of randomization. In accordance with a prespecified stopping rule for futility of finding one drug to be superior or inferior, a planned interim analysis led to the trial being stopped. Of the enrolled patients, 10% were determined to have had psychogenic seizures. The primary outcome of cessation of status epilepticus and improvement in the level of consciousness at 60 minutes occurred in 68 patients assigned to levetiracetam (47%; 95% credible interval, 39 to 55), 53 patients assigned to fosphenytoin (45%; 95% credible interval, 36 to 54), and 56 patients assigned to valproate (46%; 95% credible interval, 38 to 55). The posterior probability that each drug was the most effective was 0.41, 0.24, and 0.35, respectively. Numerically more episodes of hypotension and intubation occurred in the fosphenytoin group and more deaths occurred in the levetiracetam group than in the other groups, but these differences were not significant. CONCLUSIONS: In the context of benzodiazepine-refractory convulsive status epilepticus, the anticonvulsant drugs levetiracetam, fosphenytoin, and valproate each led to seizure cessation and improved alertness by 60 minutes in approximately half the patients, and the three drugs were associated with similar incidences of adverse events.

        "Risk factors for possible REM sleep behavior disorder: A CLSA population-based cohort study. OBJECTIVE: To assess sociodemographic, socioeconomic, and clinical correlates of idiopathic REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) in a 30,097-person national cohort. METHODS: Participants 45 to 85 years of age in Canada were collected as part of the Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging. Possible RBD (pRBD) was screened with the REM Sleep Behavior Disorder Single-Question Screen, a questionnaire with 94% specificity and 87% sensitivity. To improve diagnostic accuracy, those screening positive for apnea or non-REM parasomnia (young-onset pRBD) and those self-reporting dementia or Parkinson disease were excluded. A series of sociodemographic, lifestyle, and mental health variables were analyzed cross-sectionally. Potential correlates were assessed via multivariable logistic regression. RESULTS: Of 30,097 participants, 958 (3.2%) were identified as having pRBD. Male sex (odds ratio [OR] 2.09, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.78-2.44) and lower education (OR 0.95, 95% CI 0.92-0.98) were associated with pRBD. Participants with pRBD had smoked more (pack-years OR 1.01, 95% CI 1.00-1.01) and were more likely to be moderate to heavy drinkers (OR 1.25, 95% CI 1.04-1.51). There was a strong association between pRBD and self-reported antidepressant treatment for depression (OR 2.77, 95% CI 2.23-3.45), psychological distress (OR 1.61, 95% CI 1.44-1.80), mental illness (OR 2.09, 95% CI 1.75-2.49), and posttraumatic stress disorder (OR 2.68, 95% CI 1.97-3.65). CONCLUSIONS: Our study replicated previous reported associations between pRBD and smoking, low education, and male sex and found previously unreported links with alcohol use and psychological distress. Risk factors for pRBD differ from those previously defined for neurodegenerative synucleinopathies. ",
        "Coupled electrophysiological, hemodynamic, and cerebrospinal fluid oscillations in human sleep. Sleep is essential for both cognition and maintenance of healthy brain function. Slow waves in neural activity contribute to memory consolidation, whereas cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) clears metabolic waste products from the brain. Whether these two processes are related is not known. We used accelerated neuroimaging to measure physiological and neural dynamics in the human brain. We discovered a coherent pattern of oscillating electrophysiological, hemodynamic, and CSF dynamics that appears during non-rapid eye movement sleep. Neural slow waves are followed by hemodynamic oscillations, which in turn are coupled to CSF flow. These results demonstrate that the sleeping brain exhibits waves of CSF flow on a macroscopic scale, and these CSF dynamics are interlinked with neural and hemodynamic rhythms. ",
        "Comparison of Lemborexant With Placebo and Zolpidem Tartrate Extended Release for the Treatment of Older Adults With Insomnia Disorder: A Phase 3 Randomized Clinical Trial. Importance: Insomnia disorder is prevalent and associated with health risks in older adults; however, efficacy and safety issues with existing treatments create significant unmet needs in this patient population. Objective: To compare treatment with the orexin receptor antagonist lemborexant with placebo and zolpidem tartrate extended release in participants with insomnia disorder. Design, Setting, and Participants: The Study of the Efficacy and Safety of Lemborexant in Subjects 55 Years and Older With Insomnia Disorder (SUNRISE 1) clinical trial was a global randomized double-blind parallel-group placebo-controlled active-comparator phase 3 study conducted at 67 sites in North America and Europe from May 31, 2016, to January 30, 2018. Data analyses were conducted from January 31, 2018, to September 10, 2018. Participants were 55 years and older with insomnia disorder characterized by reported sleep maintenance difficulties and confirmed by sleep history, sleep diary, and polysomnography. Participants could have also had sleep onset difficulties. Interventions: Participants received placebo, zolpidem tartrate extended release (6.25 mg), or lemborexant (5 mg or 10 mg) for 1 month at bedtime. Main Outcomes and Measures: Paired polysomnograms were collected at baseline, the first 2 nights, and the last 2 nights of treatment. The primary end point was the change from baseline in latency to persistent sleep for lemborexant therapy vs placebo. Key secondary end points were changes from baseline in sleep efficiency and wake-after-sleep onset compared with placebo, and wake-after-sleep onset in the second half of the night compared with zolpidem therapy. Results: Among 1006 participants randomized (placebo, n\u2009=\u2009208; zolpidem, n\u2009=\u2009263; lemborexant 5 mg, n\u2009=\u2009266; and lemborexant 10 mg, n\u2009=\u2009269), 869 (86.4%) were women and the median age was 63 years (range, 55-88 years). Both doses of lemborexant therapy demonstrated statistically significant greater changes from baseline on objective sleep onset as assessed by latency to persistent sleep (log transformed) that was measured using polysomnography at the end of 1 month of treatment (nights 29 and 30) compared with placebo (primary end point for least squares geometric means treatment ratio vs placebo: for lemborexant 5 mg, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.67-0.89; P\u2009<\u2009.001; for lemborexant 10 mg, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.63-0.83; P\u2009<\u2009.001). For nights 29 and 30, as measured using polysomnography, the mean change from baseline in sleep efficiency (LSM treatment difference vs placebo for lemborexant 5 mg, 7.1%; 95% CI, 5.6%-8.5%; P\u2009<\u2009.001 and for lemborexant 10 mg, 8.0%; 95% CI, 6.6%-9.5%; P\u2009<\u2009.001) and wake-after-sleep onset (least squares mean treatment ratio vs placebo for lemborexant 5 mg, -24.0 min; 95% CI, -30.0 to -18.0 min; P\u2009<\u2009.001 and for lemborexant 10 mg, -25.4 min; 95% CI, -31.4 to -19.3 min; P\u2009<\u2009.001) were significantly greater for both doses of lemborexant therapy compared with placebo. Also, for nights 29 and 30, wake-after-sleep onset in the second half of the night (least squares mean treatment difference vs zolpidem for lemborexant 5 mg, -6.7 min; 95% CI, -11.2 to -2.2 min; P\u2009=\u2009.004 and for lemborexant 10 mg, -8.0 min; 95% CI, -12.5 to -3.5 min; P\u2009<\u2009.001) was significantly greater for both doses of lemborexant therapy compared with zolpidem therapy measured using polysomnography. Six participants (4 in the zolpidem group and 2 in the lemborexant 5 mg group) reported serious adverse events; none were treatment-related. Other adverse events were mostly mild or moderate in severity. Conclusions and Relevance: In this randomized clinical trial, lemborexant therapy significantly improved both sleep onset and sleep maintenance, including in the second half of the night, compared with both placebo and zolpidem measured objectively using polysomnography. Lemborexant therapy was well tolerated. Trial Registrations: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02783729; EudraCT identifier: 2015-001463-39. ",
        "Aspirin reduces long-term stroke risk in women with prior hypertensive disorders of pregnancy. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP) increased long-term stroke risk in women in the California Teachers Study (CTS), a prospective cohort study, and whether aspirin or statin use modified this risk. METHODS: CTS participants \u226460 years of age at the time of enrollment in 1995 were followed up prospectively for validated stroke outcomes obtained via linkage with California hospital records through December 31, 2015. We calculated unadjusted and adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) for the primary outcomes of all stroke and stroke before 60 years of age among those with and without a history of HDP. We tested for interactions (p < 0.2) and performed stratified analyses to assess the risk of the primary outcomes in women with and without self-reported use of aspirin or statins. RESULTS: Of 83,749 women included in the analysis, 4,070 (4.9%) had HDP. Women with prior HDP had increased risk of all stroke (adjusted HR 1.3, 95% CI 1.2-1.4) but no increased risk of stroke before age 60 (adjusted HR 1.2, 95% CI 0.9-1.7). There was an interaction (p = 0.18) between aspirin use and HDP history on risk of stroke before age 60: nonusers of aspirin had higher risk (adjusted HR 1.5, 95% CI 1.0-2.1) while aspirin users did not (adjusted HR 0.8, 95% CI 0.4-1.7). This effect was not seen with statins. CONCLUSIONS: After controlling for comorbid conditions, women with prior HDP had increased long-term stroke risk, which was reduced by aspirin use. Randomized trials may be needed to assess whether long-term aspirin use could benefit selected women with a history of HDP. ",
        "Comparison of Clinical Care and In-Hospital Outcomes of Asian American and White Patients With Acute Ischemic Stroke. Importance: Although overall stroke incidence and mortality in the United States is improving, little is known about the characteristics and clinical outcomes of acute ischemic stroke in Asian American individuals. Objective: To compare the characteristics, care, and outcomes of Asian American and white patients with acute ischemic stroke. Design, Setting, Participants: Retrospective analysis of Asian American and white patients admitted with a primary diagnosis of acute ischemic stroke to hospitals participating in the Get With The Guidelines-Stroke (GWTG-Stroke) program between April 1, 2004, and July 31, 2016. The GWTG-Stroke database is a prospectively collected stroke quality improvement registry sponsored by the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association. Main Outcomes and Measures: Multivariable logistic regression models assessed the association of Asian American race/ethnicity, clinical outcomes, and quality measures. Results: The study population of 1\u202f772\u202f299 patients (mean [SD] age, 72.4 [14.2] years; 51.3% female) consisted of 64\u202f337 Asian American patients (3.6%) and 1\u202f707\u202f962 white patients (96.4%) admitted to 2171 GWTG-Stroke hospitals with acute ischemic stroke. After adjustment for patient and hospital variables, Asian American patients were seen with greater stroke severity compared with white patients (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale [NIHSS] score \u226516) (odds ratio [OR], 1.35; 95% CI, 1.30-1.40; P\u2009<\u2009.001), manifested higher in-hospital mortality (OR, 1.14; 95% CI, 1.09-1.19; P\u2009<\u2009.001), had longer length of stay (OR, 1.17; 95% CI, 1.14-1.20; P\u2009<\u2009.001), and were less likely to ambulate independently at discharge (OR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.79-0.90; P\u2009<\u2009.001). Although Asian American patients had fewer intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (IV tPA) administrations than white patients (OR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.91-0.98; P\u2009=\u2009.003), they had more symptomatic hemorrhage after tPA (OR, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.20-1.55; P\u2009<\u2009.001) and overall post-tPA complications (OR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.18-1.46; P\u2009<\u2009.001). Asian American patients had better quality measure adherence overall than white patients, including rehabilitation (OR, 1.27; 95% CI, 1.18-1.36; P\u2009<\u2009.001), door to tPA within 60 minutes (OR, 1.14; 95% CI, 1.06-1.22; P\u2009<\u2009.001), and intensive statin therapy (OR, 1.14; 95% CI, 1.10-1.18; P\u2009<\u2009.001). After adjustment for stroke severity, Asian American patients had lower in-hospital mortality than white patients (OR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.91-0.99; P\u2009=\u2009.008). Conclusions and Relevance: Asian American patients manifested more severe ischemic strokes, were less likely to receive IV tPA, and had worse functional outcomes than white patients. These findings warrant additional research toward improving clinical outcomes for Asian American patients with acute ischemic stroke. ",
        "Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and risk of intracerebral hemorrhage: A prospective study. OBJECTIVE: To prospectively examine the association between low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (LDL-C) concentrations and intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) risk. METHODS: The current cohort study included 96,043 participants (mean age 51.3 years) who were free of stroke, myocardial infarction, and cancer at baseline (2006). Serum LDL-C concentrations were assessed in 2006, 2008, 2010, and 2012. Cumulative average LDL-C concentrations were calculated from all available LDL-C data during that period. Incident ICH was confirmed by review of medical records. RESULTS: We identified 753 incident ICH cases during 9 years of follow-up. The ICH risk was similar among participants with LDL concentrations of 70 to 99 mg/dL and those with LDL-C concentrations \u2265100 mg/dL. In contrast, participants with LDL-C concentrations <70 mg/dL had a significantly higher risk of developing ICH than those with LDL-C concentrations of 70 to 99 mg/dL; adjusted hazard ratios were 1.65 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.32-2.05) for LDL-C concentrations of 50 to 69 mg/dL and 2.69 (95% CI 2.03-3.57) for LDL-C concentrations <50 mg/dL. CONCLUSIONS: We observed a significant association between lower LDL-C and higher risk of ICH when LDL-C was <70 mg/dL, and the association became nonsignificant when LDL-C \u226570 mg/dL. These data can help determination of the ideal LDL range in patients who are at increased risk of both atherosclerotic disease and hemorrhagic stroke and guide planning of future lipid-lowering studies.

        "A new area for the management of hyperkalaemia with potassium binders: clinical use in nephrology. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients and more so CKD patients treated with renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors (RAASi) are prone to experience hyperkalaemia, a condition associated with an increased risk of death. This represents a true dilemma in daily practice since RAASi are the cornerstones of nephroprotective and cardioprotective strategies in CKD patients, as well as in hypertensive patients with or without CKD. The recent availability in the USA and EU of the potassium-binding resin Patiromer, together with sodium zirconium cyclosilicate (SZC), which was more recently approved in the EU and the US, may lead to a paradigm shift both in the treatment of hyperkalaemia and in enabling RAASi maintenance. Whether potassium normalization, potentially combined with a RAASi maintenance strategy, may translate into improved cardiovascular and renal outcomes needs be tested prospectively. ",
        "Personality traits and diabetes incidence among postmenopausal women. OBJECTIVE: We examined whether personality traits, including optimism, ambivalence over emotional expressiveness, negative emotional expressiveness, and hostility, were associated with risk of developing type 2 diabetes (hereafter diabetes) among postmenopausal women. METHODS: A total of 139,924 postmenopausal women without diabetes at baseline (between 1993 and 1998) aged 50 to 79 years from the Women's Health Initiative were prospectively followed for a mean of 14 (range 0.1-23) years. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to assess associations between personality traits and diabetes incidence adjusting for common demographic factors, health behaviors, and depressive symptoms. Personality traits were gathered at baseline using questionnaires. Diabetes during follow-up was assessed via self-report of physician-diagnosed treated diabetes. RESULTS: There were 19,240 cases of diabetes during follow-up. Compared with women in the lowest quartile of optimism (least optimistic), women in the highest quartile (most optimistic) had 12% (hazard ratio [HR], 0.88; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.84-0.92) lower risk of incident diabetes. Compared with women in the lowest quartile for negative emotional expressiveness or hostility, women in the highest quartile had 9% (HR, 1.09; 95% CI: 1.05-1.14) and 17% (HR, 1.17; 95% CI: 1.12-1.23) higher risk of diabetes, respectively. The association of hostility with risk of diabetes was stronger among nonobese than obese women. CONCLUSIONS: Low optimism and high NEE and hostility were associated with increased risk of incident diabetes among postmenopausal women independent of major health behaviors and depressive symptoms. In addition to efforts to promote healthy behaviors, women's personality traits should be considered to guide clinical or programmatic intervention strategies in diabetes prevention. ",
        "Degree of serotonin reuptake inhibition of antidepressants and ischemic risk: A cohort study. OBJECTIVE: To assess whether use of antidepressants with strong inhibition of serotonin reuptake is associated with a decreased incidence of ischemic stroke and myocardial infarction (MI). METHODS: We conducted a cohort study using the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink and considering new users of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or third-generation antidepressants who were \u226518 years of age between 1995 and 2014. Using a nested case-control approach, we matched each case of a first ischemic stroke or MI identified during follow-up with up to 30 controls on age, sex, calendar time, and duration of follow-up. We estimated incidence rate ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of each outcome associated with current use of strong compared with weak inhibitors of serotonin reuptake using conditional logistic regression. RESULTS: The cohort included 938,388 incident users of SSRIs (n = 868,755) or third-generation antidepressants (n = 69,633). Mean age at cohort entry was 46 years (64% women). During follow-up, 15,860 cases of ischemic stroke and 8,626 cases of MI were identified and matched to 473,712 and 258,022 controls, respectively. Compared with current use of weak inhibitors of serotonin reuptake, current use of strong inhibitors was associated with a decreased rate of ischemic stroke (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.80-0.97), but the effect size was smaller in some sensitivity analyses. The rate of MI was similar between strong and weak inhibitors (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.87-1.15). CONCLUSION: Our large population-based study suggests that antidepressants strongly inhibiting serotonin reuptake may be associated with a small decrease in the rate of ischemic stroke. ",
        "Outcomes Associated With Clopidogrel-Aspirin Use in Minor Stroke or Transient Ischemic Attack: A Pooled Analysis of Clopidogrel in High-Risk Patients With Acute Non-Disabling Cerebrovascular Events (CHANCE) and Platelet-Oriented Inhibition in New TIA and Minor Ischemic Stroke (POINT) Trials. Importance: Dual antiplatelet therapy with clopidogrel and aspirin is effective for secondary prevention after minor ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA). Uncertainties remained about the optimal duration of dual antiplatelet therapy for minor stroke or TIA. Objective: To obtain precise estimates of efficacy and risk of dual antiplatelet therapy after minor ischemic stroke or TIA. Design, Setting, and Participants: This analysis pooled individual patient-level data from 2 large-scale randomized clinical trials that evaluated clopidogrel-aspirin as a treatment to prevent stroke after a minor stroke or high-risk TIA. The Clopidogrel in High-Risk Patients With Acute Non-Disabling Cerebrovascular Events (CHANCE) trial enrolled patients at 114 sites in China from October 1, 2009, to July 30, 2012. The Platelet-Oriented Inhibition in New TIA and Minor Ischemic Stroke (POINT) trial enrolled patients at 269 international sites from May 28, 2010, to December 19, 2017. Both were followed up for 90 days. Data analysis occurred from November 2018 to May 2019. Interventions: In the 2 trials, patients with minor stroke or high-risk TIA were randomized to clopidogrel-aspirin or aspirin alone within 12 hours (POINT) or 24 hours (CHANCE) of symptom onset. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary efficacy outcome was a major ischemic event (ischemic stroke, myocardial infarction, or death from ischemic vascular causes). The primary safety outcome was major hemorrhage. Results: The study enrolled 5170 patients (CHANCE) and 4881 patients (POINT). Analysis included individual data from 10\u202f051 patients (5016 in the clopidogrel-aspirin treatment group and 5035 in the control group) with a median age of 63.2 (interquartile range, 55.0-72.9) years; 6106 patients (60.8%) were male. Clopidogrel-aspirin treatment reduced the risk of major ischemic events at 90 days compared with aspirin alone (328 of 5016 [6.5%] vs 458 of 5035 [9.1%]; hazard ratio [HR], 0.70 [95% CI, 0.61-0.81]; P\u2009<\u2009.001), mainly within the first 21 days (263 of 5016 [5.2%] vs 391 of 5035 [7.8%]; HR, 0.66 [95% CI, 0.56-0.77]; P\u2009<\u2009.001), but not from day 22 to day 90. No evidence of heterogeneity of treatment outcome across trials or prespecified subgroups was observed. Major hemorrhages were more frequent in the clopidogrel-aspirin group, but the difference was nonsignificant. Conclusions and Relevance: In this analysis of the POINT and CHANCE trials, the benefit of dual antiplatelet therapy appeared to be confined to the first 21 days after minor ischemic stroke or high-risk TIA.

        "Association of General Anesthesia vs Procedural Sedation With Functional Outcome Among Patients With Acute Ischemic Stroke Undergoing Thrombectomy: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis. Importance: General anesthesia during thrombectomy for acute ischemic stroke has been associated with poor neurological outcome in nonrandomized studies. Three single-center randomized trials reported no significantly different or improved outcomes for patients who received general anesthesia compared with procedural sedation. Objective: To detect differences in functional outcome at 3 months between patients who received general anesthesia vs procedural sedation during thrombectomy for anterior circulation acute ischemic stroke. Data Source: MEDLINE search for English-language articles published from January 1, 1980, to July 31, 2019. Study Selection: Randomized clinical trials of adults with a National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score of at least 10 and anterior circulation acute ischemic stroke assigned to receive general anesthesia or procedural sedation during thrombectomy. Data Extraction and Synthesis: Individual patient data were obtained from 3 single-center, randomized, parallel-group, open-label treatment trials with blinded end point evaluation that met inclusion criteria and were analyzed using fixed-effects meta-analysis. Main Outcomes and Measures: Degree of disability, measured via the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score (range 0-6; lower scores indicate less disability), analyzed with the common odds ratio (cOR) to detect the ordinal shift in the distribution of disability over the range of mRS scores. Results: A total of 368 patients (mean [SD] age, 71.5 [12.9] years; 163 [44.3%] women; median [interquartile range] National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score, 17 [14-21]) were included in the analysis, including 183 (49.7%) who received general anesthesia and 185 (50.3%) who received procedural sedation. The mean 3-month mRS score was 2.8 (95% CI, 2.5-3.1) in the general anesthesia group vs 3.2 (95% CI, 3.0-3.5) in the procedural sedation group (difference, 0.43 [95% CI, 0.03-0.83]; cOR, 1.58 [95% CI, 1.09-2.29]; P\u2009=\u2009.02). Among prespecified adverse events, only hypotension (decline in systolic blood pressure of more than 20% from baseline) (80.8% vs 53.1%; OR, 4.26 [95% CI, 2.55-7.09]; P\u2009<\u2009.001) and blood pressure variability (systolic blood pressure >180 mm Hg or <120 mm Hg) (79.7 vs 62.3%; OR, 2.42 [95% CI, 1.49-3.93]; P\u2009<\u2009.001) were significantly more common in the general anesthesia group. Conclusions and Relevance: Among patients with acute ischemic stroke involving the anterior circulation undergoing thrombectomy, the use of protocol-based general anesthesia, compared with procedural sedation, was significantly associated with less disability at 3 months. These findings should be interpreted tentatively, given that the individual trials examined were single-center trials and disability was the primary outcome in only 1 trial. ",
        "Posttraumatic Stress Disorder and Risk for Stroke in Young and Middle-Aged Adults: A 13-Year Cohort Study. Background and Purpose- In older populations, transient ischemic attack (TIA) and ischemic stroke have been linked to psychological factors, including posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Whether PTSD also increases risk for early incident stroke in young adults is unknown. Methods- We prospectively assessed the incidence of TIA and ischemic stroke in a cohort of 987\u2009855 young and middle-aged Veterans (mean age of 30.29\u00b19.19 years; 87.8% men, 64.4% white) who first accessed care through the Veterans Health Administration from October 2001 to November 2014 and were free of TIA and ischemic stroke at baseline. For each outcome, time-varying multivariate Cox models were constructed to examine the effect of PTSD on incident stroke. We also assessed for effect modification by sex. Additional sensitivity analyses controlled for healthcare utilization. Results- Over a 13-year period, TIA and ischemic stroke were diagnosed in 766 and 1877 patients, respectively. PTSD was diagnosed in 28.6% of the sample during follow-up. In unadjusted analyses, PTSD was significantly associated with new-onset TIA (hazard ratio [HR],\u20092.02; 95% CI,\u20091.62-2.52) and ischemic stroke (HR,\u20091.62; 95% CI,\u20091.47-1.79). In fully adjusted models, the association between PTSD and incident TIA (HR, 1.61; 95% CI,\u20091.27-2.04) and ischemic stroke (HR, 1.36; 95% CI,\u20091.22-1.52) remained significant. The effect of PTSD on ischemic stroke risk was stronger in men than in women (HR, 0.63; 95% CI,\u20090.47-0.86; P=0.003), but no effect of sex was found for TIA. Conclusions- PTSD is associated with a significant increase in risk of early incident TIA and ischemic stroke independent of established stroke risk factors, coexisting psychiatric disorders, and healthcare utilization. Sex moderated the relationship for adults with ischemic stroke but not TIA. These findings suggest that psychological factors, including PTSD, may be important targets for future age-specific prevention strategies for young adults. ",
        "Sleep duration, midday napping, and sleep quality and incident stroke: The Dongfeng-Tongji cohort. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the associations of sleep duration, midday napping, sleep quality, and change in sleep duration with risk of incident stroke and stroke subtypes. METHODS: Among 31,750 participants aged 61.7 years on average at baseline from the Dongfeng-Tongji cohort, we used Cox regression models to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for incident stroke. RESULTS: Compared with sleeping 7 to <8 hours/night, those reporting longer sleep duration (\u22659 hours/night) had a greater risk of total stroke (hazard ratio [HR] 1.23; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.07-1.41), while shorter sleep (<6 hours/night) had no significant effect on stroke risk. The HR (95% CI) of total stroke was 1.25 (1.03-1.53) for midday napping >90 minutes vs 1-30 minutes. The results were similar for ischemic stroke. Compared with good sleep quality, those with poor sleep quality showed a 29%, 28%, and 56% higher risk of total, ischemic, and hemorrhagic stroke, respectively. Moreover, we observed significant joint effects of sleeping \u22659 hours/night and midday napping >90 minutes (HR 1.85; 95% CI 1.28-2.66), and sleeping \u22659 hours/night and poor sleep quality (HR 1.82; 95% CI 1.33-2.48) on risk of total stroke. Furthermore, compared with persistently sleeping 7-9 hours/night, those who persistently slept \u22659 hours/night or switched from 7 to 9 hours to \u22659 hours/night had a higher risk of total stroke. CONCLUSIONS: Long sleep duration, long midday napping, and poor sleep quality were independently and jointly associated with higher risks of incident stroke. Persistently long sleep duration or switch from average to long sleep duration increased the risk of stroke. ",
        "The Association Between Nurse Shift Patterns and Nurse-Nurse and Nurse-Physician Collaboration in Acute Care Hospital Units. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to examine the impact of nurse shift patterns on nurses' collaboration with nurses and physicians in US acute care hospital units. BACKGROUND: Collaboration between nurses and other healthcare providers is critical for ensuring quality patient care. Nurses perform collaboration during their shift work; thus, nurse shift patterns may influence collaboration. However, there is a dearth of empirical evidence of the relationship between nurse shift patterns and collaboration of nurses with other healthcare providers. METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study using data from 957 units in 168 acute care hospitals. Measures of collaboration include nurse-nurse collaboration and nurse-physician collaboration. Measures of shift patterns included shift length and overtime. Multilevel linear regressions were conducted at the unit level, controlling unit and hospital characteristics. RESULTS: Overtime (more nurses working overtime or longer overtime hours) was associated with lower collaboration at the unit level; however, shift length was not. CONCLUSIONS: Working overtime may negatively influence nurses' collaboration with other healthcare providers. ",
        "Oncologists' Attitudes and Practice of Addressing Diet, Physical Activity, and Weight Management With Patients With Cancer: Findings of an ASCO Survey of the Oncology Workforce. PURPOSE: Obesity and related factors have been linked to cancer risk and outcomes, but little information exists with regard to oncologists' attention to these issues as a part of clinical care. METHODS: Oncology providers actively caring for patients with cancer in the United States and internationally were asked to complete an online survey about practice patterns and perceptions with regard to obesity and weight management during and after active cancer treatment. RESULTS: Nine hundred seventy-one practicing oncology providers completed the survey. The majority of respondents indicated a belief that the evidence linking obesity to cancer outcomes was strong and that weight and related factors should be addressed as a part of cancer treatment. The majority of respondents also reported that they frequently assessed body weight and related factors as well as counsel their patients to exercise, consume a healthy diet, and lose weight, if applicable. However, referral to providers and programs to support weight loss and increased physical activity occurred less frequently, and a number of barriers were identified for the incorporation of weight management and physical activity programs in the treatment of patients with cancer. CONCLUSION: In a survey of oncology providers, attention to weight management, physical activity, and diet in patients with cancer was high during and after cancer treatment but often did not result in referrals to support lifestyle change. Future work is needed to support education and training of oncology providers to facilitate referrals and overcome barriers to implementation of weight management and physical activity programs for patients with cancer.

        "Sleep Problems in 2- to 5-Year-Olds With Autism Spectrum Disorder and Other Developmental Delays. : media-1vid110.1542/5984243260001PEDS-VA_2018-0492Video Abstract BACKGROUND: Sleep problems can impact daytime behavior, quality of life, and overall health. We compared sleep habits in young children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and other developmental delays and disorders and in children from the general population (POP). We included 2- to 5-year-old children whose parent completed all items on the Children's Sleep Habits Questionnaire (CSHQ) in a multisite case-control study: 522 children with ASD; 228 children with other developmental delays and disorders with autism spectrum disorder characteristics (DD w/ASD); 534 children with other developmental delays and disorders without autism spectrum disorder characteristics (DD w/o ASD); and 703 POP. Multivariable analysis of variance compared CSHQ mean total score (TS) and subscale scores between groups. Logistic regression analysis examined group differences by using TS cutoffs of 41 and 48. Analyses were adjusted for covariates. Mean CSHQ TS for children in each group: ASD (48.5); DD w/ASD (50.4); DD w/o ASD (44.4); and POP (43.3). Differences between children with ASD and both children with DD w/o ASD and POP were statistically significant. Using a TS cutoff of 48, the proportion of children with sleep problems was significantly higher in children in the ASD group versus DD w/o ASD and POP groups (adjusted odds ratios [95% confidence intervals]: 2.12 [1.57 to 2.87] and 2.37 [1.75 to 3.22], respectively). Sleep problems are more than twice as common in young children with ASD and DD w/ASD. Screening for sleep problems is important in young children to facilitate provision of appropriate interventions.

        "Association of Maternal Prenatal Vitamin Use With Risk for Autism Spectrum Disorder Recurrence in Young Siblings. Importance: Maternal use of folic acid supplements has been inconsistently associated with reduced risk for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in the child. No study to date has examined this association in the context of ASD recurrence in high-risk families. Objective: To examine the association between maternal prenatal vitamin use and ASD recurrence risk in younger siblings of children with ASD. Design, Setting, and Participants: This prospective cohort study analyzed data from a sample of children (n\u2009=\u2009332) and their mothers (n\u2009=\u2009305) enrolled in the MARBLES (Markers of Autism Risk in Babies: Learning Early Signs) study. Participants in the MARBLES study were recruited at the MIND Institute of the University of California, Davis and were primarily from families receiving services for children with ASD in the California Department of Developmental Services. In this sample, the younger siblings at high risk for ASD were born between December 1, 2006, and June 30, 2015, and completed a final clinical assessment within 6 months of their third birthday. Prenatal vitamin use during pregnancy was reported by mothers during telephone interviews. Data analysis for this study was conducted from January 1, 2017, to December 3, 2018. Main Outcomes and Measures: Autism spectrum disorder, other nontypical development (non-TD), and typical development (TD) were algorithmically defined according to Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule and Mullen Scales of Early Learning subscale scores. Results: After exclusions, the final sample comprised 241 younger siblings, of which 140 (58.1%) were male and 101 (41.9%) were female, with a mean (SD) age of 36.5 (1.6) months. Most mothers (231 [95.9%]) reported taking prenatal vitamins during pregnancy, but only 87 mothers (36.1%) met the recommendations to take prenatal vitamins in the 6 months before pregnancy. The prevalence of ASD was 14.1% (18) in children whose mothers took prenatal vitamins in the first month of pregnancy compared with 32.7% (37) in children whose mothers did not take prenatal vitamins during that time. Children whose mothers reported taking prenatal vitamins during the first month of pregnancy were less likely to receive an ASD diagnosis (adjusted relative risk [RR], 0.50; 95% CI, 0.30-0.81) but not a non-TD 36-month outcome (adjusted RR, 1.14; 95% CI, 0.75-1.75) compared with children whose mothers reported not taking prenatal vitamins. Children in the former maternal prenatal vitamin group also had statistically significantly lower autism symptom severity (adjusted estimated difference,\u2009-0.60; 95% CI, -0.97 to -0.23) and higher cognitive scores (adjusted estimated difference,\u20097.1; 95% CI, 1.2-13.1). Conclusions and Relevance: Maternal prenatal vitamin intake during the first month of pregnancy may reduce ASD recurrence in siblings of children with ASD in high-risk families. Additional research is needed to confirm these results; to investigate dose thresholds, contributing nutrients, and biologic mechanisms of prenatal vitamins; and to inform public health recommendations for ASD prevention in affected families.

        "Estimating the Risk of Attempted Suicide Among Sexual Minority Youths: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis. Importance: Suicide is the second-leading cause of death among adolescents. Sexual minority individuals are at a higher risk of suicide and attempted suicide, but a precise and systematic evaluation of this risk among sexual minority youths has not been documented to our knowledge. Objective: To examine the risk of attempted suicide among sexual minority adolescents, differentiating for each sexual minority group. Data Sources: Electronic databases (PubMed, Embase, and PsycINFO) were searched for articles published through April 30, 2017, with the following search terms: heterosexual, homosexual, bisexual, transgender, adolescents, teens, and attempted suicide. Study Selection: Studies that reported attempted suicide in sexual minority adolescents compared with heterosexual peers were included. Thirty-five studies satisfied criteria for inclusion of 764 records identified. Data Extraction and Synthesis: Pooled analyses were based on odds ratios (ORs), with relevant 95% CIs, weighting each study with inverse variance models with random effects. Risk of publication bias and analysis of heterogeneity through univariable and multivariable meta-regressions were also rated. Main Outcomes and Measures: The evaluation of increased odds of attempted suicide among sexual minority youths compared with heterosexual peers. Results: Thirty-five studies reported in 22 articles that involved a total of 2\u202f378\u202f987 heterosexual and 113\u202f468 sexual minority adolescents (age range, 12-20 years) were included in the analysis. Sexual minority youths were generally at higher risk of attempted suicide (OR, 3.50; 95% CI, 2.98-4.12; c2\u2009=\u20093074.01; P\u2009<\u2009.001; I2\u2009=\u200999%). If estimated in each sexual minority group, the OR was 3.71 in the homosexual group (95% CI, 3.15-4.37; c2\u2009=\u2009825.20; P\u2009<\u2009.001; I2\u2009=\u200997%) and 4.87 in the bisexual group (95% CI, 4.76-4.98; c2\u2009=\u2009980.02; P\u2009<\u2009.001; I2\u2009=\u200998%); transgender youths were described as an individual group in only 1 study, which reported an OR of 5.87 (95% CI, 3.51-9.82). Meta-regressions weighted for the study weight highlighted that the presence of young participants (12 years old) was associated with heterogeneity in the bisexual group, whereas the year of sampling was associated with heterogeneity in the whole group when combined with other covariates. Conclusions and Relevance: Our findings suggest that youths with nonheterosexual identity have a significantly higher risk of life-threatening behavior compared with their heterosexual peers. Public awareness is important, and a careful evaluation of supportive strategies (eg, support programs, counseling, and destigmatizing efforts) should be part of education and public health planning.

        "Implementation of a Health Plan Program for Switching From Analogue to Human Insulin and Glycemic Control Among Medicare Beneficiaries With Type 2 Diabetes. Importance: Prices for newer analogue insulin products have increased. Lower-cost human insulin may be effective for many patients with type 2 diabetes. Objective: To evaluate the association between implementation of a health plan-based intervention of switching patients from analogue to human insulin and glycemic control. Design, Setting, and Participants: A retrospective cohort study using population-level interrupted times series analysis of members participating in a Medicare Advantage and prescription drug plan operating in 4 US states. Participants were prescribed insulin between January 1, 2014, and December 31, 2016 (median follow-up, 729 days). The intervention began in February 2015 and was expanded to the entire health plan system by June 2015. Exposures: Implementation of a health plan program to switch patients from analogue to human insulin. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was the change in mean hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels estimated over three 12-month periods: preintervention (baseline) in 2014, intervention in 2015, and postintervention in 2016. Secondary outcomes included rates of serious hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia using ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM diagnostic codes. Results: Over 3 years, 14\u202f635 members (mean [SD] age: 72.5 [9.8] years; 51% women; 93% with type 2 diabetes) filled 221\u202f866 insulin prescriptions. The mean HbA1c was 8.46% (95% CI, 8.40%-8.52%) at baseline and decreased at a rate of -0.02% (95% CI, -0.03% to -0.01%; P\u2009<.001) per month before the intervention. There was an association between the start of the intervention and an overall HbA1c level increase of 0.14% (95% CI, 0.05%-0.23%; P\u2009=\u2009.003) and slope change of 0.02% (95% CI, 0.01%-0.03%; P\u2009<\u2009.001). After the completion of the intervention, there were no significant differences in changes in the level (0.08% [95% CI, -0.01% to 0.17%]) or slope (<0.001% [95% CI, -0.008% to 0.010%]) of mean HbA1c compared with the intervention period (P\u2009=\u2009.09 and P\u2009=\u20090.81, respectively). For serious hypoglycemic events, there was no significant association between the start of the intervention and a level (2.66/1000 person-years [95% CI, -3.82 to 9.13]; P\u2009=\u2009.41) or slope change (-0.66/1000 person-years [95% CI, -1.59 to 0.27]; P\u2009=\u2009.16). The level (1.64/1000 person-years [95% CI, -4.83 to 8.11]; P\u2009=\u2009.61) and slope (-0.23/1000 person-years [95% CI, -1.17 to 0.70]; P\u2009=\u2009.61) changes in the postintervention period were not significantly different compared with the intervention period. The baseline rate of serious hyperglycemia was 22.33 per 1000 person-years (95% CI, 12.70-31.97). For the rate of serious hyperglycemic events, there was no significant association between the start of the intervention and a level (4.23/1000 person-years [95% CI, -8.62 to 17.08]; P\u2009=\u2009.51) or slope (-0.51/1000 person-years [95% CI, -2.37 to 1.34]; P\u2009=\u2009.58) change. Conclusions and Relevance: Among Medicare beneficiaries with type 2 diabetes, implementation of a health plan program that involved switching patients from analogue to human insulin was associated with a small increase in population-level HbA1c.

        "Association of Prenatal Phthalate Exposure With Language Development in Early Childhood. Importance: Prenatal exposure to phthalates has been associated with neurodevelopmental outcomes, but little is known about the association with language development. Objective: To examine the association of prenatal phthalate exposure with language development in children in 2 population-based pregnancy cohort studies. Design, Setting, and Participants: Data for this study were obtained from the Swedish Environmental Longitudinal Mother and Child, Asthma and Allergy (SELMA) study conducted in prenatal clinics throughout V\u00e4rmland county in Sweden and The Infant Development and the Environment Study (TIDES) conducted in 4 academic centers in the United States. Participants recruited into both studies were women in their first trimester of pregnancy who had literacy in Swedish (SELMA) or English or Spanish (TIDES). This study included mothers and their children from both the SELMA study (n\u2009=\u2009963) and TIDES (n\u2009=\u2009370) who had complete data on prenatal urinary phthalate metabolite levels, language delay, and modeled covariables. For SELMA, the data were collected from November 1, 2007, to June 30, 2013, and data analysis was conducted from November 1, 2016, to June 30, 2018. For TIDES, data collection began January 1, 2010, and ended March 29, 2016, and data analysis was performed from September 15, 2016, to June 30, 2018. Main Outcomes and Measures: Mothers completed a language development questionnaire that asked the number of words their children could understand or use at a median of 30 months of age (SELMA) and 37 months of age (TIDES). The responses were categorized as fewer than 25, 25 to 50, and more than 50 words, with 50 words or fewer classified as language delay. Results: In the SELMA study, 963 mothers, 455 (47.2%) girls, and 508 (52.8%) boys were included. In TIDES, 370 mothers, 185 (50.0%) girls, and 185 (50.0%) boys were included in this analysis. The prevalence of language delay was 10.0% in both SELMA (96 reported) and TIDES (37 reported), with higher rates of delay in boys than girls (SELMA: 69 [13.5%] vs 27 [6.0%]; TIDES: 23 [12.4%] vs 14 [7.6%]). In crude analyses, the metabolite levels of dibutyl phthalate and butyl benzyl phthalate were statistically significantly associated with language delay in both cohorts. In adjusted analyses, a doubling of prenatal exposure of dibutyl phthalate and butyl benzyl phthalate metabolites increased the odds ratio (OR) for language delay by approximately 25% to 40%, with statistically significant results in the SELMA study (dibutyl phthalate OR, 1.29 [95% CI, 1.03-1.63; P\u2009=\u2009.03]; butyl benzyl phthalate OR, 1.26 [95% CI, 1.07-1.49; P\u2009=\u2009.003]). A doubling of prenatal monoethyl phthalate exposure was associated with an approximately 15% increase in the OR for language delay in the SELMA study (OR, 1.14; 95% CI, 1.00-1.31; P\u2009=\u2009.05), but no such association was found in TIDES (OR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.79-1.23). Conclusions and Relevance: In findings from this study, prenatal exposure to dibutyl phthalate and butyl benzyl phthalate was statistically significantly associated with language delay in children in both the SELMA study and TIDES. These findings, along with the prevalence of prenatal exposure to phthalates, the importance of language development, and the inconsistent results from a 2017 Danish study, suggest that the association of phthalates with language delay may warrant further examination.

        "Natural Progression of Symptom Change and Recovery From Concussion in a Pediatric Population. Importance: The natural progression of symptom change and recovery remains poorly defined in children after concussion. Objectives: To describe the natural progression of symptom change by age group (5-7, 8-12, and 13-18 years) and sex, as well as to develop centile curves to inform families about children after injury recovery. Design, Setting, and Participants: Planned secondary analysis of a prospective multicenter cohort study (Predicting Persistent Postconcussive Problems in Pediatrics). The setting was 9 pediatric emergency departments within the Pediatric Emergency Research Canada (PERC) network. Participants were aged 5 to 18 years with acute concussion, enrolled from August 1, 2013, to May 31, 2015, and data analyses were performed between January 2018 and March 2018. Exposures: Participants had a concussion consistent with the Zurich Consensus Statement on Concussion in Sport diagnostic criteria and 85% completeness of the Postconcussion Symptom Inventory (PCSI) at each time point. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was symptom change, defined as current rating minus preinjury rating (delta score), at presentation and 1, 2, 4, 8, and 12 weeks after injury, measured using the PCSI. Symptoms were self-rated for ages 8 to 18 years and rated by the child and parent for ages 5 to 7 years. The secondary outcome was recovery, defined as no change in symptoms relative to current preinjury PCSI ratings (delta score\u2009=\u20090). Mixed-effects models incorporated the total score, adjusting for random effects (site and participant variability), fixed-effects indicators (age, sex, time, age by time interaction, and sex by time interaction), and variables associated with recovery. Recovery centile curves by age and sex were computed. Results: A total of 3063 children (median age, 12.0 years [interquartile range, 9.2-14.6 years]; 60.7% male) completed the primary outcome; 2716 were included in the primary outcome analysis. For the group aged 5 to 7 years, symptom change primarily occurred the first week after injury; by 2 weeks, 75.6% of symptoms had improved (PCSI change between 0 and 2 weeks, -5.3; 95% CI, -5.5 to -5.0). For the groups aged 8 to 12 years and 13 to 18 years, symptom change was prominent the first 2 weeks but flattened between 2 and 4 weeks. By 4 weeks, 83.6% and 86.2% of symptoms, respectively, had improved for the groups aged 8 to 12 years (PCSI change between 0 and 4 weeks, -9.0; 95% CI, -9.6 to -8.4) and 13 to 18 years (PCSI change between 0 and 4 weeks, -28.6; 95% CI, -30.8 to -26.3). Sex by time interaction was significant only for the adolescent group (\u03b2\u2009=\u20090.32; 95% CI, 0.21-0.43; P\u2009<\u2009.001). Most adolescent girls had not recovered by week 12. Conclusions and Relevance: Symptom improvement primarily occurs in the first 2 weeks after concussion in children and in the first 4 weeks after concussion in preadolescents and male adolescents. Female adolescents appear to have protracted recovery. The derived recovery curves may be useful for evidence-based anticipatory guidance. ",
        "Pharmacological Treatments for Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome: A Systematic Review and Network Meta-analysis. Importance: Incidence of neonatal abstinence syndrome is rising rapidly, and optimal pharmacotherapy may meaningfully reduce length of treatment. Objective: To compare pharmacological therapies for neonatal abstinence syndrome. Data Sources: Systematic review and network meta-analysis of Medline (1946-June 2018), Embase (1974-June 2018), Cochrane CENTRAL (1966-June 2018), Web of Science (1900-June 2018), and ClinicalTrials.gov (June 2018). Study Selection: Randomized clinical trials of pharmacological treatments for neonatal abstinence syndrome alone or in combination with adjuvant treatments. Abstract, title, and full-text screening were conducted independently by 2 reviewers (T.D. and C.G.). Data Extraction and Synthesis: Data extraction was conducted independently by 2 reviewers (T.D. and C.G.) according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA)-Network Meta-Analyses guidelines. Quality was assessed with the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool and data were pooled with fixed-effect models as a result of the low number of trials that were included in the analysis. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was the length of treatment. The length of stay, need for adjuvant therapy, and adverse events were considered as secondary outcomes. Results: Eighteen trials (N\u2009=\u20091072) were eligible for inclusion. The treatments that were included in the length of treatment analysis were buprenorphine, clonidine, diluted tincture of opium and clonidine, diluted tincture of opium, morphine, methadone, and phenobarbital. Sublingual buprenorphine was considered the optimal treatment for a reduction in the length of treatment (days: mean difference vs morphine, -12.75 [95% CI, -17.97 to -7.58]; median rank, 1 [3-1]) and length of stay (days: mean difference vs morphine, -11.43 [95% CI, -16.95 to -5.82]; median rank, 1 [3-1]) but not the need for adjuvant treatment (odds ratio vs morphine, 1.23 [95% CI, 0.46-3.44]; median rank, 3 [5-1]). The results were robust to bias but sensitive to imprecision. Conclusions and Relevance: The current evidence suggests that buprenorphine is the optimal treatment for neonatal abstinence treatment, but limitations are considerable and wide-scale adoption requires a large multisite trial. Morphine, which is considered standard of care in most hospitals, was the lowest-ranked opioid for length of treatment and length of stay. ",
        "Association Between Screen Time and Children's Performance on a Developmental Screening Test. Importance: Excessive screen time is associated with delays in development; however, it is unclear if greater screen time predicts lower performance scores on developmental screening tests or if children with poor developmental performance receive added screen time as a way to modulate challenging behavior. Objective: To assess the directional association between screen time and child development in a population of mothers and children. Design, Setting, and Participants: This longitudinal cohort study used a 3-wave, cross-lagged panel model in\u20092441 mothers and children in Calgary, Alberta, Canada, drawn from the All Our Families study. Data were available when children were aged 24, 36, and 60 months. Data were collected between October 20, 2011, and October 6, 2016. Statistical analyses were conducted from July 31 to November 15, 2018. Exposures: Media. Main Outcomes and Measures: At age 24, 36, and 60 months, children's screen-time behavior (total hours per week) and developmental outcomes (Ages and Stages Questionnaire, Third Edition) were assessed via maternal report. Results: Of the 2441 children included in the analysis, 1227 (50.2%) were boys. A random-intercepts, cross-lagged panel model revealed that higher levels of screen time at 24 and 36 months were significantly associated with poorer performance on developmental screening tests at 36 months (\u03b2, -0.06; 95% CI, -0.10 to -0.01) and 60 months (\u03b2, -0.08; 95% CI, -0.13 to -0.02), respectively. These within-person (time-varying) associations statistically controlled for between-person (stable) differences. Conclusions and Relevance: The results of this study support the directional association between screen time and child development. Recommendations include encouraging family media plans, as well as managing screen time, to offset the potential consequences of excess use. ",
        "Evaluation and Management of Penicillin Allergy: A Review. Importance: \u03b2-Lactam antibiotics are among the safest and most effective antibiotics. Many patients report allergies to these drugs that limit their use, resulting in the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics that increase the risk for antimicrobial resistance and adverse events. Observations: Approximately 10% of the US population has reported allergies to the \u03b2-lactam agent penicillin, with higher rates reported by older and hospitalized patients. Although many patients report that they are allergic to penicillin, clinically significant IgE-mediated or T lymphocyte-mediated penicillin hypersensitivity is uncommon (<5%). Currently, the rate of IgE-mediated penicillin allergies is decreasing, potentially due to a decreased use of parenteral penicillins, and because severe anaphylactic reactions to oral amoxicillin are rare. IgE-mediated penicillin allergy wanes over time, with 80% of patients becoming tolerant after a decade. Cross-reactivity between penicillin and cephalosporin drugs occurs in about 2% of cases, less than the 8% reported previously. Some patients have a medical history that suggests they are at a low risk for developing an allergic reaction to penicillin. Low-risk histories include patients having isolated nonallergic symptoms, such as gastrointestinal symptoms, or patients solely with a family history of a penicillin allergy, symptoms of pruritus without rash, or remote (>10 years) unknown reactions without features suggestive of an IgE-mediated reaction. A moderate-risk history includes urticaria or other pruritic rashes and reactions with features of IgE-mediated reactions. A high-risk history includes patients who have had anaphylaxis, positive penicillin skin testing, recurrent penicillin reactions, or hypersensitivities to multiple \u03b2-lactam antibiotics. The goals of antimicrobial stewardship are undermined when reported allergy to penicillin leads to the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics that increase the risk for antimicrobial resistance, including increased risk of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus. Broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents also increase the risk of developing Clostridium difficile (also known as Clostridioides difficile) infection. Direct amoxicillin challenge is appropriate for patients with low-risk allergy histories. Moderate-risk patients can be evaluated with penicillin skin testing, which carries a negative predictive value that exceeds 95% and approaches 100% when combined with amoxicillin challenge. Clinicians performing penicillin allergy evaluation need to identify what methods are supported by their available resources. Conclusions and Relevance: Many patients report they are allergic to penicillin but few have clinically significant reactions. Evaluation of penicillin allergy before deciding not to use penicillin or other \u03b2-lactam antibiotics is an important tool for antimicrobial stewardship. ",
        "Association of Sexting With Sexual Behaviors and Mental Health Among Adolescents: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis. Importance: Sexting is the exchange of sexual messages, photographs, or videos via technological devices and is common and increasing among youth. Although various studies have examined the association between sexting, sexual behaviors, and mental health, results are mixed. Objective: To provide a meta-analytic synthesis of studies examining the associations between sexting, sexual behavior, and mental health using sex, age, publication date, and study methodological quality as moderators. Data Sources: Electronic searches were conducted in April 2018 in MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Embase, and Web of Science, yielding 1672 nonduplicate records. Study Selection: Studies were included if participants were younger than 18 years and an association between sexting and sexual behaviors or mental health risk factors was examined. Data Extraction and Synthesis: All relevant data were extracted by 2 independent reviewers. Random-effects meta-analyses were used to derive odds ratios (ORs). Main Outcomes and Measures: Sexual behavior (sexual activity, multiple sexual partners, lack of contraception use) and mental health risk factors (anxiety/depression, delinquent behavior, and alcohol, drug use, and smoking). Results: Participants totaled 41\u202f723 from 23 included studies. The mean (range) age was 14.9 (11.9-16.8) years, and 21\u202f717 (52.1%) were female. Significant associations were observed between sexting and sexual activity (16 studies; OR, 3.66; 95% CI, 2.71-4.92), multiple sexual partners (5 studies; OR, 5.37; 95% CI, 2.72-12.67), lack of contraception use (6 studies; OR, 2.16; 95% CI, 1.08-4.32), delinquent behavior (3 studies; OR, 2.50; 95% CI, 1.29-4.86), anxiety/depression (7 studies; OR, 1.79; 95% CI, 1.41-2.28), alcohol use (8 studies; OR, 3.78; 95% CI, 3.11-4.59), drug use (5 studies; OR, 3.48; 95% CI, 2.24-5.40), and smoking behavior (4 studies; OR, 2.66; 95% CI, 1.88-3.76). Moderator analyses revealed that associations between sexting, sexual behavior, and mental health factors were stronger in younger compared to older adolescents. Conclusions and Relevance: Results of this meta-analysis suggest that sexting is associated with sexual behavior and mental health difficulties, especially in younger adolescents. Longitudinal research is needed to assess directionality of effects and to analyze the mechanisms by which sexting and its correlates are related. Educational campaigns to raise awareness of digital health, safety, and security are needed to help youth navigate their personal, social, and sexual development in a technological world. ",
        "Management of Infants at Risk for Group B Streptococcal Disease. Group B streptococcal (GBS) infection remains the most common cause of neonatal early-onset sepsis and a significant cause of late-onset sepsis among young infants. Administration of intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis is the only currently available effective strategy for the prevention of perinatal GBS early-onset disease, and there is no effective approach for the prevention of late-onset disease. The American Academy of Pediatrics joins with the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists to reaffirm the use of universal antenatal microbiologic-based testing for the detection of maternal GBS colonization to facilitate appropriate administration of intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis. The purpose of this clinical report is to provide neonatal clinicians with updated information regarding the epidemiology of GBS disease as well current recommendations for the evaluation of newborn infants at risk for GBS disease and for treatment of those with confirmed GBS infection. This clinical report is endorsed by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), July 2019, and should be construed as ACOG clinical guidance. ",
        "C-Type Natriuretic Peptide Analogue Therapy in Children with Achondroplasia. BACKGROUND: Achondroplasia is a genetic disorder that inhibits endochondral ossification, resulting in disproportionate short stature and clinically significant medical complications. Vosoritide is a biologic analogue of C-type natriuretic peptide, a potent stimulator of endochondral ossification. METHODS: In a multinational, phase 2, dose-finding study and extension study, we evaluated the safety and side-effect profile of vosoritide in children (5 to 14 years of age) with achondroplasia. A total of 35 children were enrolled in four sequential cohorts to receive vosoritide at a once-daily subcutaneous dose of 2.5 \u03bcg per kilogram of body weight (8 patients in cohort 1), 7.5 \u03bcg per kilogram (8 patients in cohort 2), 15.0 \u03bcg per kilogram (10 patients in cohort 3), or 30.0 \u03bcg per kilogram (9 patients in cohort 4). After 6 months, the dose in cohort 1 was increased to 7.5 \u03bcg per kilogram and then to 15.0 \u03bcg per kilogram, and in cohort 2, the dose was increased to 15.0 \u03bcg per kilogram; the patients in cohorts 3 and 4 continued to receive their initial doses. At the time of data cutoff, the 24-month dose-finding study had been completed, and 30 patients had been enrolled in an ongoing long-term extension study; the median duration of follow-up across both studies was 42 months. RESULTS: During the treatment periods in the dose-finding and extension studies, adverse events occurred in 35 of 35 patients (100%), and serious adverse events occurred in 4 of 35 patients (11%). Therapy was discontinued in 6 patients (in 1 because of an adverse event). During the first 6 months of treatment, a dose-dependent increase in the annualized growth velocity was observed with vosoritide up to a dose of 15.0 \u03bcg per kilogram, and a sustained increase in the annualized growth velocity was observed at doses of 15.0 and 30.0 \u03bcg per kilogram for up to 42 months. CONCLUSIONS: In children with achondroplasia, once-daily subcutaneous administration of vosoritide was associated with a side-effect profile that appeared generally mild. Treatment resulted in a sustained increase in the annualized growth velocity for up to 42 months.

        "Acceleration of BMI in Early Childhood and Risk of Sustained Obesity. BACKGROUND: The dynamics of body-mass index (BMI) in children from birth to adolescence are unclear, and whether susceptibility for the development of sustained obesity occurs at a specific age in children is important to determine. METHODS: To assess the age at onset of obesity, we performed prospective and retrospective analyses of the course of BMI over time in a population-based sample of 51,505 children for whom sequential anthropometric data were available during childhood (0 to 14 years of age) and adolescence (15 to 18 years of age). In addition, we assessed the dynamics of annual BMI increments, defined as the change in BMI standard-deviation score per year, during childhood in 34,196 children. RESULTS: In retrospective analyses, we found that most of the adolescents with normal weight had always had a normal weight throughout childhood. Approximately half (53%) of the obese adolescents had been overweight or obese from 5 years of age onward, and the BMI standard-deviation score further increased with age. In prospective analyses, we found that almost 90% of the children who were obese at 3 years of age were overweight or obese in adolescence. Among the adolescents who were obese, the greatest acceleration in annual BMI increments had occurred between 2 and 6 years of age, with a further rise in BMI percentile thereafter. High acceleration in annual BMI increments during the preschool years (but not during the school years) was associated with a risk of overweight or obesity in adolescence that was 1.4 times as high as the risk among children who had had stable BMI. The rate of overweight or obesity in adolescence was higher among children who had been large for gestational age at birth (43.7%) than among those who had been at an appropriate weight for gestational age (28.4%) or small for gestational age (27.2%), which corresponded to a risk of adolescent obesity that was 1.55 times as high among those who had been large for gestational age as among the other groups. CONCLUSIONS: Among obese adolescents, the most rapid weight gain had occurred between 2 and 6 years of age; most children who were obese at that age were obese in adolescence.

        "Longitudinal birth cohort study found that a significant proportion of children had abnormal metabolic profiles and insulin resistance at 6\u00a0years of age. AIM: Metabolic syndrome represents a cluster of risk factors for cardiovascular disease, and we investigated whether otherwise healthy 6-year-olds showed metabolic alterations. METHODS: This study followed up a representative Swedish population-based cohort of full-term infants recruited on the maternity ward at Hallands Hospital Halmstad, Sweden, from 2008 to 2011. They were examined at a mean of 6.6\u00a0years of age (range 6.5-6.9) using various measures for signs of metabolic syndrome. RESULTS: One key measure showed that 55 (26%) of the 212 children had one or more risk factors for metabolic syndrome requiring action. The 37 who were obese (3%) or overweight (14%) were significantly more likely to be insulin resistant than the normal weight group (28% versus 5%, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and have high triglycerides (8% versus 0%, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Children with high waist circumferences had higher systolic (p\u00a0=\u00a00.01) and diastolic (p\u00a0=\u00a00.02) blood pressure than those with normal waist circumferences. Waist circumference identified children at high risk of metabolic syndrome better than body mass index. CONCLUSION: A significant percentage of 6-year-old children showed abnormal metabolic profiles, including insulin resistance, which increased their risk of cardiovascular disease. Waist circumference was a stronger marker for metabolic alterations than body mass index. ",
        "Effect of a Behavioral Intervention Strategy on Sustained Change in Physical Activity and Sedentary Behavior in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes: The IDES_2 Randomized Clinical Trial. Importance: There is no definitive evidence that changes in physical activity/sedentary behavior can be maintained long term in individuals with type 2 diabetes. Objective: To investigate whether a behavioral intervention strategy can produce a sustained increase in physical activity and reduction in sedentary time among individuals with type 2 diabetes. Design, Setting, and Participants: The Italian Diabetes and Exercise Study 2 was an open-label, assessor-blinded, randomized clinical superiority trial, with recruitment from October 2012 to February 2014 and follow-up until February 2017. In 3 outpatient diabetes clinics in Rome, 300 physically inactive and sedentary patients with type 2 diabetes were randomized 1:1 (stratified by center, age, and diabetes treatment) to receive a behavioral intervention or standard care for 3 years. Interventions: All participants received usual care targeted to meet American Diabetes Association guideline recommendations. Participants in the behavioral intervention group (n\u2009=\u2009150) received 1 individual theoretical counseling session and 8 individual biweekly theoretical and practical counseling sessions each year. Participants in the standard care group (n\u2009=\u2009150) received only general physician recommendations. Main Outcomes and Measures: Co-primary end points were sustained change in physical activity volume, time spent in light-intensity and moderate- to vigorous-intensity physical activity, and sedentary time, measured by an accelerometer. Results: Of the 300 randomized participants (mean [SD] age, 61.6 [8.5] years; 116 women [38.7%]), 267 completed the study (133 in the behavioral intervention\u2009group and 134 in the standard care\u2009group). Median follow-up was 3.0 years. Participants in the behavioral intervention and standard care groups accumulated, respectively, 13.8 vs 10.5 metabolic equivalent-h/wk of physical activity volume (difference, 3.3 [95% CI, 2.2-4.4]; P\u2009<\u2009.001), 18.9 vs 12.5 min/dof moderate- to vigorous-intensity physical activity (difference, 6.4 [95% CI, 5.0-7.8]; P\u2009<\u2009.001), 4.6 vs 3.8 h/d of light-intensity physical activity (difference, 0.8 [95% CI, 0.5-1.1]; P\u2009<\u2009.001), and 10.9 vs 11.7 h/d of sedentary time (difference, -0.8 [95% CI, -1.0 to -0.5]; P\u2009<\u2009.001). Significant between-group differences were maintained throughout the study, but the between-group difference in moderate- to vigorous-intensity physical activity decreased during the third year from 6.5 to 3.6 min/d. There were 41 adverse events in the behavioral intervention group and 59 in the standard care group outside of the sessions; participants in the behavioral intervention group experienced 30 adverse events during the sessions (most commonly musculoskeletal injury/discomfort and mild hypoglycemia). Conclusions and Relevance: Among patients with type 2 diabetes at 3 diabetes clinics in Rome who were followed up for 3 years, a behavioral intervention strategy compared with standard care resulted in a sustained increase in physical activity and decrease in sedentary time. Further research is needed to assess the generalizability of these findings. Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01600937. ",
        "Association of Infant Temperament With Subsequent Obesity in Young Children of Mothers With Gestational Diabetes Mellitus. Importance: Infant temperament is associated with excess weight gain or childhood obesity risk in samples of healthy individuals, although the evidence has been inconsistent. To our knowledge, no prior research has examined this topic among children exposed to gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) in utero. Objective: To prospectively evaluate infant temperament in association with overweight and obesity status at ages 2 to 5 years among children born to mothers who experienced GDM. Design, Setting, and Participants: This prospective cohort study took place at Kaiser Permanente Northern California medical centers. We studied singleton infants delivered at 35 weeks' gestational age or later to mothers who had been diagnosed with GDM. Data were collected from 2009 to 2016, and data analysis occurred from June 2017 to October 2018. Exposures: The primary exposures in the child's first year were soothability, distress to limitations, and activity aspects of temperament, as assessed by a validated questionnaire. Modifiable covariates in the child's first year included breastfeeding intensity and duration monthly ratio scores, along with the timing of the introduction of sugary beverages and complementary foods. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was child overweight and obesity status, assessed at ages 2 to 5 years. Multinomial logistic regression models estimated adjusted odds ratios and 95% CIs for infants whose temperaments were measured at 6 to 9 weeks of age and categorized as elevated (\u226575th percentile) or not elevated in the 3 domains. We controlled for nonmodifiable and modifiable covariates across models. Results: A total of 382 mother-infant pairs participted, including 130 infants (34.0%) who were non-Hispanic white, 126 infants (33.0%) who were Hispanic, 96 infants (25.1%) who were Asian, 26 infants (6.8%) who were non-Hispanic black, and 4 infants (1.1%) who were of other races/ethnicities. In descriptive analyses, elevated infant soothability and activity temperaments were associated with the early introduction of 100% fruit juice and/or sugar-sweetened beverages (at ages <6 months) and shorter breastfeeding duration (from 0 to <3 months), while elevated distress to limitations was associated with early introduction of complementary foods (at ages <4 months). Elevated soothability consistently was associated with a higher odds of later childhood obesity, with adjusted odds ratios across models ranging from 2.22 (95% CI, 1.04-4.73) to 2.54 (95% CI, 1.28-5.03). Greater breastfeeding intensity and duration (12-month combined) score was associated with lower odds of obesity, independent of infant temperament and other covariates. Conclusions and Relevance: Among this high-risk population of infants, elevated soothability was associated with early childhood obesity risk, perhaps in part because caregivers use sugary drinks to assuage infants. Soothability temperament may be a novel screening target for early obesity prevention interventions involving responsive feeding and emotion regulation. ",
        "Five-Year Outcomes of Gastric Bypass in Adolescents as Compared with Adults. BACKGROUND: Bariatric surgery results in weight loss and health improvements in adults and adolescents. However, whether outcomes differ according to the age of the patient at the time of surgery is unclear. METHODS: We evaluated the health effects of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass in a cohort of adolescents (161 patients enrolled from 2006 through 2012) and a cohort of adults (396 patients enrolled from 2006 through 2009). The two cohorts were participants in two related but independent studies. Linear mixed and Poisson mixed models were used to compare outcomes with regard to weight and coexisting conditions between the cohorts 5 years after surgery. The rates of death and subsequent abdominal operations and selected micronutrient levels (up to 2 years after surgery) were also compared between the cohorts. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in percent weight change between adolescents (-26%; 95% confidence interval [CI], -29 to -23) and adults (-29%; 95% CI, -31 to -27) 5 years after surgery (P\u2009=\u20090.08). After surgery, adolescents were significantly more likely than adults to have remission of type 2 diabetes (86% vs. 53%; risk ratio, 1.27; 95% CI, 1.03 to 1.57) and of hypertension (68% vs. 41%; risk ratio, 1.51; 95% CI, 1.21 to 1.88). Three adolescents (1.9%) and seven adults (1.8%) died in the 5 years after surgery. The rate of abdominal reoperations was significantly higher among adolescents than among adults (19 vs. 10 reoperations per 500 person-years, P\u2009=\u20090.003). More adolescents than adults had low ferritin levels (72 of 132 patients [48%] vs. 54 of 179 patients [29%], P\u2009=\u20090.004). CONCLUSIONS: Adolescents and adults who underwent gastric bypass had marked weight loss that was similar in magnitude 5 years after surgery. Adolescents had remission of diabetes and hypertension more often than adults.

        "Chronotype, Social Jet Lag, and Cardiometabolic Risk Factors in Early Adolescence. Importance: Inadequate sleep duration and quality increase the risk of obesity. Sleep timing, while less studied, is important in adolescents because increasing evening preferences (chronotypes), early school start times, and irregular sleep schedules may cause circadian misalignment. Objective: To investigate associations of chronotype and social jet lag with adiposity and cardiometabolic risk in young adolescents. Design, Setting, and Participants: Starting in 1999, Project Viva recruited pregnant women from eastern Massachusetts. Mother-child in-person visits occurred throughout childhood. From January 23, 2012, to October 16, 2016, 804 adolescents aged 12 to 17 years completed 5 days or more of wrist actigraphy, questionnaires, and anthropometric measurements. A cross-sectional analysis using these data was conducted from April 31, 2018, to May 1, 2019. Exposures: Chronotype, measured via a continuous scale with higher scores indicating greater evening preferences, and social jet lag, measured as the continuous difference in actigraphy sleep midpoint in hours from midnight on weekends vs weekdays, with higher values representing more delayed sleep timing on weekends. Main Outcomes and Measures: Adiposity, measured via anthropometry and dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. For a subset of 479 adolescents with blood samples, cardiometabolic risk scores were computed as the mean of 5 sex- and cohort-specific z scores for waist circumference, systolic blood pressure, inversely scaled high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and log-transformed triglycerides and homeostatic model of insulin resistance. Results: Among the 804 adolescents in the study, 418 were girls and 386 were boys, with a mean (SD) age of 13.2 (0.9) years. In multivariable models adjusted for age, puberty, season, and sociodemographics, associations of chronotype and social jet lag with adiposity varied by sex. For girls, greater evening preference was associated with a 0.58-cm (95% CI, 0.12-1.03 cm; P\u2009=\u2009.04 for interaction) higher waist circumference and 0.16 kg/m2 (95% CI, 0.01-0.31 kg/m2; P\u2009=\u2009.03 for interaction) higher fat mass index as measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry; each hour of social jet lag was associated with a 1.19-cm (95% CI, 0.04-2.35 cm; P\u2009=\u2009.21 for interaction) higher waist circumference and 0.45 kg/m2 (95% CI, 0.09-0.82 kg/m2; P\u2009=\u2009.01 for interaction) higher fat mass index as measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. Associations of social jet lag and evening chronotypes persisted for many measures of adiposity after adjustment for sleep duration and other lifestyle behaviors. By contrast, no associations were observed in boys. There were no associations with the cardiometabolic risk score for either sex, although statistical power was low for this outcome. Conclusions and Relevance: Evening chronotypes and social jet lag were associated with greater adiposity in adolescent girls but not adolescent boys. Interventions aimed at improving sleep schedules may be useful for obesity prevention, especially in girls. ",
        "Marked Influence of Adiposity on Laboratory Biomarkers in a Healthy Cohort of Children and Adolescents. BACKGROUND: The prevalence of pediatric obesity is increasing worldwide and strongly associates with metabolic abnormalities, including inflammation, insulin resistance, and dyslipidemia. This study assessed the influence of 3 measures of adiposity on levels of routinely assessed biochemical markers in apparently healthy children and adolescents. METHODS: The influence of adiposity on 35 biochemical markers was examined in the Canadian Laboratory Initiative on Pediatric Reference Intervals (CALIPER) cohort of healthy children and adolescents by comparing serum biomarker levels between subjects with a normal weight, overweight, and obese body mass index (BMI). The cohort comprised 1332 subjects 5.1 to 19.0 years of age with a BMI ranging from 13.4 to 65.0 kg/m2. The association between each biochemical marker and BMI, waist circumference, and waist-to-height ratio z-scores was assessed, while adjusting for age and sex. Reference intervals were established for all biochemical markers before and after removing overweight/obese subjects. RESULTS: In children and adolescents, levels of 13 routinely assessed biochemical markers, including alanine aminotransferase, apolipoprotein B, complement components 3 and 4, cholinesterase, high sensitivity C-reactive protein, gamma-glutamyl transferase, haptoglobin, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, iron, transferrin, triglycerides, and uric acid, were significantly different between BMI categories. BMI, waist circumference, and/or waist-to-height ratio were significantly associated with the serum concentration of 24 of the 35 markers examined, after adjusting for age and sex. CONCLUSIONS: Excess adiposity significantly influences circulating levels of routinely assessed laboratory markers, most notably liver enzymes, lipids/lipoproteins, inflammatory markers, and uric acid in children and adolescents. Although it is unknown whether altered biochemical marker levels in subjects with overweight/obesity reflect health or indolent disease, clinicians should be aware of the effect of weight status on several laboratory tests.

        "Effect of Prenatal Docosahexaenoic Acid Supplementation on Blood Pressure in Children With Overweight Condition or Obesity: A Secondary Analysis of a Randomized Clinical Trial. Importance: The blood pressure-lowering property of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) in children and adults is known, and an observational study from the Netherlands has linked higher intrauterine DHA exposure to lower childhood blood pressure. However, the association of prenatal intake of DHA supplement with childhood blood pressure has not been evaluated in randomized clinical trials. Objective: To determine the effect of DHA supplementation during pregnancy on childhood blood pressure. Design, Setting, and Participants: This prespecified secondary analysis of the Kansas University DHA Outcome Study (KUDOS), a phase 3, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial was conducted at several local hospitals in the Kansas City, Kansas, metropolitan area. Pregnant women (n\u2009=\u2009350) were enrolled in the KUDOS trial between January 10, 2006, and November 17, 2009, and were followed up until their children were 18 months of age. During pregnancy, the women received either 3 capsules per day of placebo or 600 mg per day of DHA from a mean (SD) of 14.5 (3.7) weeks' (all before 20 weeks) gestation until birth. The parents of 190 children consented to additional follow-up of their children until 6 years, which ended April 29, 2016. Study personnel involved in testing were blind to the randomization until all children had completed the trial. Data analysis was performed from May 23, 2017, to July 10, 2018. Interventions: Pregnant women were assigned to either 600 mg per day of DHA or a placebo that was half soy and half corn oil. Both placebo and DHA were provided in 3 capsules per day. Main Outcomes and Measures: Childhood blood pressure was a planned secondary outcome of a study powered to measure cognitive development. The hypothesis was that DHA would lower blood pressure prior to data analysis. Systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) were measured at 4, 4.5, 5, 5.5, and 6 years and were analyzed for possible covariates using mixed models to generate a final model. Results: In total, 171 children (88 [51.5%] female) were included in this analysis. Of these children, 89 (52.0%) were randomized to the DHA group and 82 (47.9%) to the placebo group. A statistically significant interaction was found between treatment (placebo or DHA)\u2009and child weight status (5-year body mass index \u226485th or >85th percentile) for both SBP and DBP. Children who were overweight or obese whose mothers received placebo during pregnancy had higher SBP and DBP compared with children who were overweight or obese whose mothers received DHA (mean [SE] SBP, 104.28 [1.37] mm Hg vs 100.34 [1.02] mm Hg; DBP, 64.7 [1.23] mm Hg vs 59.76 [0.91] mm Hg). No differences in the SBP and DBP were found between children who were overweight or obese whose mothers received DHA and children who were not overweight or obese. In the mixed model analysis, the child's age at blood pressure measurement and the maternal prepregnancy body mass index were the only other statistically significant variables (child age, SBP: F\u2009=\u20097.385; P\u2009=\u2009.001; DBP: F\u2009=\u20097.39; P\u2009=\u2009.001; prepregnancy BMI, SBP: r\u2009=\u20090.284; P\u2009=\u2009.001; DBP: r\u2009=\u20090.216; P\u2009=\u2009.01). Conclusions and Relevance: Maternal docosahexaenoic acid intake during pregnancy appeared to mitigate the association between childhood overweight condition or obesity and blood pressure.

        "Human Papillomavirus Vaccine Effectiveness and Herd Protection in Young Women. BACKGROUND: Clinical trials of the 4-valent human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine demonstrate high efficacy, but surveillance studies are essential to examine the long-term impact of vaccine introduction on HPV prevalence in community settings. The aims of this study were to determine during the 11 years after vaccine introduction the prevalence of (1) vaccine-type HPV in adolescent and young adult women who were vaccinated (to assess vaccine effectiveness) and (2) vaccine-type HPV in women who were unvaccinated (to assess herd protection). METHODS: Young women 13 to 26 years of age were recruited from hospital-based and community health clinics for 4 surveillance studies from 2006 to 2017. We determined the proportion of vaccinated and unvaccinated women who were positive for vaccine-type HPV across the studies, and the odds of positivity for vaccine-type HPV using logistic regression; all analyses were propensity score-adjusted to control for between-wave differences in participant characteristics. RESULTS: Vaccination rates increased from 0% to 84.3% (97% of study participants received the 4-valent vaccine). Among women who were vaccinated, 4-valent vaccine-type HPV detection decreased from 35% to 6.7% (80.9% decline; odds ratio 0.13, 95% confidence interval 0.08 to 0.22). Among women who were unvaccinated, 4-valent vaccine-type HPV detection decreased from 32.4% to 19.4% (40% decline; odds ratio 0.50, 95% confidence interval 0.26 to 0.97). Estimated vaccine effectiveness was 90.6% in wave 3 and 80.1% in wave 4. CONCLUSIONS: In this study in which trends in HPV in a US community >10 years after 4-valent HPV vaccine introduction and after 9-valent vaccine introduction were examined, we found evidence of vaccine effectiveness and herd protection. Further research is needed to examine trends in 9-valent vaccine-type HPV after higher rates of vaccination are achieved. ",
        "Acupuncture as Adjunctive Therapy for Chronic Stable Angina: A Randomized Clinical Trial. Importance: The effects of acupuncture as adjunctive treatment to antianginal therapies for patients with chronic stable angina are uncertain. Objective: To investigate the efficacy and safety of acupuncture as adjunctive therapy to antianginal therapies in reducing frequency of angina attacks in patients with chronic stable angina. Design, Setting, and Participants: In this 20-week randomized clinical trial conducted in outpatient and inpatient settings at 5 clinical centers in China from October 10, 2012, to September 19, 2015, 404 participants were randomly assigned to receive acupuncture on the acupoints on the disease-affected meridian (DAM), receive acupuncture on the acupoints on the nonaffected meridian (NAM), receive sham acupuncture (SA), and receive no acupuncture (wait list [WL] group). Participants were 35 to 80 years of age with chronic stable angina based on the criteria of the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association, with angina occurring at least twice weekly. Statistical analysis was conducted from December 1, 2015, to July 30, 2016. Interventions: All participants in the 4 groups received antianginal therapies as recommended by the guidelines. Participants in the DAM, NAM, and SA groups received acupuncture treatment 3 times weekly for 4 weeks for a total of 12 sessions. Participants in the WL group did not receive acupuncture during the 16-week study period. Main Outcomes and Measures: Participants used diaries to record angina attacks. The primary outcome was the change in frequency of angina attacks every 4 weeks from baseline to week 16. Results: A total of 398 participants (253 women and 145 men; mean [SD] age, 62.6 [9.7] years) were included in the intention-to-treat analyses. Baseline characteristics were comparable across the 4 groups. Mean changes in frequency of angina attacks differed significantly among the 4 groups at 16 weeks: a greater reduction of angina attacks was observed in the DAM group vs the NAM group (difference, 4.07; 95% CI, 2.43-5.71; P\u2009<\u2009.001), in the DAM group vs the SA group (difference, 5.18; 95% CI, 3.54-6.81; P\u2009<\u2009.001), and in the DAM group vs the WL group (difference, 5.63 attacks; 95% CI, 3.99-7.27; P\u2009<\u2009.001). Conclusions and Relevance: Compared with acupuncture on the NAM, SA, or no acupuncture (WL), acupuncture on the DAM as adjunctive treatment to antianginal therapy showed superior benefits in alleviating angina.

        "Cannabinoids for the treatment of mental disorders and symptoms of mental disorders: a systematic review and meta-analysis. BACKGROUND: Medicinal cannabinoids, including medicinal cannabis and pharmaceutical cannabinoids and their synthetic derivatives, such as tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD), have been suggested to have a therapeutic role in certain mental disorders. We analysed the available evidence to ascertain the effectiveness and safety of all types of medicinal cannabinoids in treating symptoms of various mental disorders. METHODS: For this systematic review and meta-analysis we searched MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Clinical Trials, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews for studies published between Jan 1, 1980, and April 30, 2018. We also searched for unpublished or ongoing studies on ClinicalTrials.gov, the EU Clinical Trials Register, and the Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry. We considered all studies examining any type and formulation of a medicinal cannabinoid in adults (\u226518 years) for treating depression, anxiety, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), Tourette syndrome, post-traumatic stress disorder, or psychosis, either as the primary condition or secondary to other medical conditions. We placed no restrictions on language, publication status, or study type (ie, both experimental and observational study designs were included). Primary outcomes were remission from and changes in symptoms of these mental disorders. The safety of medicinal cannabinoids for these mental disorders was also examined. Evidence from randomised controlled trials was synthesised as odds ratios (ORs) for disorder remission, adverse events, and withdrawals and as standardised mean differences (SMDs) for change in symptoms, via random-effects meta-analyses. The quality of the evidence was assessed with the Cochrane risk of bias tool and Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. This study is registered with PROSPERO (CRD42017059372, CRD42017059373, CRD42017059376, CRD42017064996, and CRD42018102977). FINDINGS: 83 eligible studies (40 randomised controlled trials, n=3067) were included: 42 for depression (23 randomised controlled trials; n=2551), 31 for anxiety (17 randomised controlled trials; n=605), eight for Tourette syndrome (two randomised controlled trials; n=36), three for ADHD (one randomised controlled trial; n=30), 12 for post-traumatic stress disorder (one randomised controlled trial; n=10), and 11 for psychosis (six randomised controlled trials; n=281). Pharmaceutical THC (with or without CBD) improved anxiety symptoms among individuals with other medical conditions (primarily chronic non-cancer pain and multiple sclerosis; SMD -0\u00b725 [95% CI -0\u00b749 to -0\u00b701]; seven studies; n=252), although the evidence GRADE was very low. Pharmaceutical THC (with or without CBD) worsened negative symptoms of psychosis in a single study (SMD 0\u00b736 [95% CI 0\u00b710 to 0\u00b762]; n=24). Pharmaceutical THC (with or without CBD) did not significantly affect any other primary outcomes for the mental disorders examined but did increase the number of people who had adverse events (OR 1\u00b799 [95% CI 1\u00b720 to 3\u00b729]; ten studies; n=1495) and withdrawals due to adverse events (2\u00b778 [1\u00b759 to 4\u00b786]; 11 studies; n=1621) compared with placebo across all mental disorders examined. Few randomised controlled trials examined the role of pharmaceutical CBD or medicinal cannabis. INTERPRETATION: There is scarce evidence to suggest that cannabinoids improve depressive disorders and symptoms, anxiety disorders, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, Tourette syndrome, post-traumatic stress disorder, or psychosis. There is very low quality evidence that pharmaceutical THC (with or without CBD) leads to a small improvement in symptoms of anxiety among individuals with other medical conditions. There remains insufficient evidence to provide guidance on the use of cannabinoids for treating mental disorders within a regulatory framework. Further high-quality studies directly examining the effect of cannabinoids on treating mental disorders are needed.

        "Excess mortality in Finnish diabetic subjects due to alcohol, accidents and suicide: a nationwide study. Aims: To characterize the burden of external causes of death attributable to alcohol-related causes, accidents and. suicide among diabetic patients in a large national cohort. Methods: The population included diabetic individuals who had purchased and received reimbursement for at least one insulin prescription and/or one oral antidiabetic drug prescription between January 1997 and December 2010, and a non-diabetic reference population matched by sex, age and area. All new insulin users in this period were included, as well as 50% of new oral drug (OAD) users as a random sample. The data were collected by means of linkage from national registries. We analyzed the cohort data using Poisson regression models separately for each end-point and by gender (mortality rate ratio (MRR)). We subjected the case-cohort data to conditional logistic regression analysis based on exposure information within 1 year of the end-point event. The follow-up started on the date of the first diabetes medication prescription and ended on 31 December 2012 or on the date of death. Results: The study population comprised 434 629 individuals (226 372 men; diabetes population: 208 148 subjects, of whom 76% were treated only with OAD). The mean follow-up time was 7.1 years, during which there were 2832. deaths attributable to alcohol, 3187 to accidents and 853 to suicide. The diabetic subjects had higher mortality at. almost all end-points, especially those treated with insulin: the adjusted MRRs for alcohol-related deaths were 1.71 for diabetic men treated with OAD and 6.92 for those on insulin; the respective MRRs for diabetic women were 2.10 and 10.60. There were more accident-related deaths among those treated with insulin (MRRs: 2.06 and 1.53 for men and women, respectively), and more suicides (MRR: 2.10 for men treated with insulin and 1.62 among women treated only with OAD). The results from the cohort study and the case-cohort study were rather similar. A time-dependent effect of diabetes was observed in alcohol-related mortality among men. Conclusions: The findings from this large nationwide cohort indicate higher mortality attributable to suicide, alcoholrelated. causes and accidents among diabetic patients than among the non-diabetic population. The results emphasize. the importance of effective psychosocial interventions among high-risk diabetic patients. ",
        "Association of Statin Therapy With Prevention of Vision-Threatening Diabetic Retinopathy. Importance: Diabetic retinopathy is the leading cause of blindness in working-age adults. Studies have suggested that statins may reduce the risk of developing diabetic retinopathy. Objective: To investigate the association between statin therapy and the development of diabetic retinopathy in patients with diabetes and dyslipidemia. Design, Setting, and Participants: This population-based cohort study, conducted among 37\u202f894 Taiwanese patients between January 1, 1998, and December 31, 2013, used the National Health Insurance Research Database to identify patients with type 2 diabetes and dyslipidemia. Outcomes were compared between those taking statins and those not taking statins. Statistical analysis was performed from May 1 to 31, 2018. Exposure: Statin therapy with a medication possession rate of 80% or more with no other lipid-lowering medications. Main Outcomes and Measures: Any stage of diabetic retinopathy and treatments for vision-threatening diabetic retinopathy. Results: Of 1\u202f648\u202f305 patients with type 2 diabetes, 219\u202f359 were eligible for analysis over the study period, including 199\u202f760 patients taking statins and 19\u202f599 patients not taking statins. After propensity score matching, there were 18\u202f947 patients in the statin group (10 436 women and 8511 men; mean [SD] age, 61.5 [10.8] years) and 18\u202f947 patients in the nonstatin group (10 430 women and 8517 men; mean [SD] age, 61.0 [11.0] years), with a mean follow-up of 7.6 years for the statin group and 7.3 years for the nonstatin group. During the study period, 2004 patients in the statin group (10.6%) and 2269 patients in the nonstatin group (12.0%) developed diabetic retinopathy. Patients in the statin group had a significantly lower rate of diabetic retinopathy (hazard ratio [HR], 0.86; 95% CI, 0.81-0.91), nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy (HR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.86-0.99), proliferative diabetic retinopathy (HR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.58-0.70), vitreous hemorrhage (HR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.54-0.71), tractional retinal detachment (HR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.47-0.79), and macular edema (HR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.46-0.79) than the nonstatin group, as well as lower rates of interventions such as retinal laser treatment (HR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.65-0.77), intravitreal injection (HR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.61-0.89), and vitrectomy (HR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.48-0.69), along with a smaller number of the interventions (retinal lasers: rate ratio, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.59-0.64; intravitreal injections: rate ratio, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.61-0.76; and vitrectomies: rate ratio, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.46-0.63). Statin therapy was also associated with lower risks of major adverse cardiovascular events (HR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.77-0.85), new-onset diabetic neuropathy (HR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.82-0.89), and new-onset diabetic foot ulcers (HR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.68-0.78). Conclusions and Relevance: Statin therapy was associated with a decreased risk of diabetic retinopathy and need for treatments for vision-threatening diabetic retinopathy in Taiwanese patients with type 2 diabetes and dyslipidemia.

        "Fournier Gangrene Associated With Sodium-Glucose Cotransporter-2 Inhibitors: A Review of Spontaneous Postmarketing Cases. Background: Use of sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors has been associated with Fournier gangrene (FG), a rare urologic emergency characterized by necrotizing infection of the external genitalia, perineum, and perianal region. Objective: To describe and compare reported cases of FG in diabetic adults receiving treatment with SGLT2 inhibitors or other antiglycemic agents. Design: Descriptive case series. Setting: U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Adverse Event Reporting System and published case reports. Patients: Adults receiving SGLT2 inhibitors or other antiglycemic agents. Measurements: Clinical and laboratory data. Results: The FDA identified 55 unique cases of FG in patients receiving SGLT2 inhibitors between 1 March 2013 and 31 January 2019. The patients ranged in age from 33 to 87 years; 39 were men, and 16 were women. Time to onset after initiation of SGLT2-inhibitor therapy ranged from 5 days to 49 months. All patients had surgical debridement and were severely ill. Reported complications included diabetic ketoacidosis (n\u00a0= 8), sepsis or septic shock (n\u00a0= 9), and acute kidney injury (n\u00a0= 4). Eight patients had fecal diversion surgery, 2 patients developed necrotizing fasciitis of a lower extremity that required amputation, and 1 patient required a lower-extremity bypass procedure because of gangrenous toes. Three patients died. For comparison, the FDA identified 19 FG cases associated with other antiglycemic agents between 1984 and 31 January 2019: metformin (n\u00a0= 8), insulin glargine (n\u00a0= 6), short-acting insulin (n\u00a0= 2), sitagliptin plus metformin (n\u00a0= 2), and dulaglutide (n\u00a0= 1). These patients ranged in age from 42 to 79 years; 12 were men, and 7 were women. Two patients died. Limitation: Inability to establish causality or incidence, variable quality of reports, possible underreporting, and confounding by indication. Conclusion: FG is a newly identified safety concern in patients receiving SGLT2 inhibitors. Physicians prescribing these agents should be aware of this possible complication and have a high index of suspicion to recognize it in its early stages. Primary Funding Source: None. ",
        "Excess Burden of Mental Illness and Hospitalization in Young-Onset Type 2 Diabetes: A Population-Based Cohort Study. Background: Type 2 diabetes (T2D) increases hospitalization risk. Young-onset T2D (YOD) (defined as onset before age 40 years) is associated with excess morbidity and mortality, but its effect on hospitalizations is unknown. Objective: To determine hospitalization rates among persons with YOD and to examine the effect of age at onset on hospitalization risk. Design: Prospective cohort study. Setting: Hong Kong. Participants: Adults aged 20 to 75 years in population-based (2002 to 2014; n\u00a0= 422\u00a0908) and registry-based (2000 to 2014; n\u00a0= 20\u00a0886) T2D cohorts. Measurements: All-cause and cause-specific hospitalization rates. Negative binomial regression models estimated effect of age at onset on hospitalization rate and cumulative bed-days from onset to age 75 years for YOD. Results: Patients with YOD had the highest hospitalization rates by attained age. In the registry cohort, 36.8% of YOD bed-days before age 40 years were due to mental illness. The adjusted rate ratios showed increased hospitalization in YOD versus usual-onset T2D (onset at age \u226540 years) (all-cause, 1.8 [95% CI, 1.7 to 2.0]; renal, 6.7 [CI, 4.2 to 10.6]; diabetes, 3.7 [CI, 3.0 to 4.6]; cardiovascular, 2.1 [CI, 1.8 to 2.5]; infection, 1.7 [CI, 1.4 to 2.1]; P\u00a0< 0.001 for all). Models estimated that intensified risk factor control in YOD (hemoglobin A1c level <6.2%, systolic blood pressure <120 mm Hg, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level <2.0 mmol/L [<77.3 mg/dL], triglyceride level <1.3 mmol/L [<115.1 mg/dL], waist circumference of 85 cm [men] or 80 cm [women], and smoking cessation) was associated with a one-third reduction in cumulative bed-days from onset to age 75 years (97 to 65 bed-days). Limitation: Possible residual confounding. Conclusion: Adults with YOD have excess hospitalizations across their lifespan compared with persons with usual-onset T2D, including an unexpectedly large burden of mental illness in young adulthood. Efforts to prevent YOD and intensify cardiometabolic risk factor control while focusing on mental health are urgently needed. Primary Funding Source: Asia Diabetes Foundation. ",
        "Higher serum levels of vitamin D are associated with lower blood glucose levels. OBJECTIVE: Vitamin D plays an important role in bone metabolism. There is now evidence that a higher serum level of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) is associated with a lower risk of developing type 2 diabetes mellitus, because it provides better glycemic control, possibly by promoting greater insulin sensitivity, and also by improving pancreatic beta cell function. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the possible association between 25(OH)D sufficiency and glycemia. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study involving 680 women, 35 to 74 years of age, selected through systematic sampling. From each participant, fasting blood samples were collected for the determination of 25(OH)D and glucose levels. RESULTS: The mean fasting blood glucose level was 105\u200amg/dL (range 26-401\u200amg/dL). Fasting serum levels of 25(OH)D were <30\u200ang/mL in 65.4% of the participants and <20\u200ang/mL in 25.6%. A serum 25(OH)D level <30\u200ang/mL was positively associated with a blood glucose level \u2265100\u200amg/dL (odds ratio [OR] 1.29, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.05-1.57), as was a serum 25(OH)D level <20\u200ang/mL (OR 1.25, 95% CI 1.04-1.50). CONCLUSIONS: Lower serum 25(OH)D concentrations appear to be associated with a high blood glucose levels. ",
        "Association of Serum Cholesterol Levels With Peripheral Nerve Damage in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes. Importance: Lowering serum cholesterol levels is a well-established treatment for dyslipidemia in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D). However, nerve lesions in patients with T2D increase with lower serum cholesterol levels, suggesting that lowering serum cholesterol levels is associated with diabetic polyneuropathy (DPN) in patients with T2D. Objective: To investigate whether there is an association between serum cholesterol levels and peripheral nerve lesions in patients with T2D with and without DPN. Design, Setting, and Participants: This single-center, cross-sectional, prospective cohort study was performed from June 1, 2015, to March 31, 2018. Observers were blinded to clinical data. A total of 256 participants were approached, of whom 156 were excluded. A total of 100 participants consented to undergo magnetic resonance neurography of the right leg at the Department of Neuroradiology and clinical, serologic, and electrophysiologic assessment at the Department of Endocrinology, Heidelberg University Hospital, Heidelberg, Germany. Exposures: Quantification of the nerve's diameter and lipid equivalent lesion (LEL) load with a subsequent analysis of all acquired clinical and serologic data with use of 3.0-T magnetic resonance neurography of the right leg with 3-dimensional reconstruction of the sciatic nerve. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was lesion load and extension. Secondary outcomes were clinical, serologic, and electrophysiologic findings. Results: A total of 100 participants with T2D (mean [SD] age, 64.6 [0.9] years; 68 [68.0%] male) participated in the study. The LEL load correlated positively with the nerve's mean cross-sectional area (r\u2009=\u20090.44; P\u2009<\u2009.001) and the maximum length of a lesion (r\u2009=\u20090.71; P\u2009<\u2009.001). The LEL load was negatively associated with total serum cholesterol level (r\u2009=\u2009-0.41; P\u2009<\u2009.001), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level (r\u2009=\u2009-0.30; P\u2009=\u2009.006), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level (r\u2009=\u2009-0.33; P\u2009=\u2009.003), nerve conduction velocities of the tibial (r\u2009=\u2009-0.33; P\u2009=\u2009.01) and peroneal (r\u2009=\u2009-0.51; P\u2009<\u2009.001) nerves, and nerve conduction amplitudes of the tibial (r\u2009=\u2009-0.31; P\u2009=\u2009.02) and peroneal (r\u2009=\u2009-0.28; P\u2009=\u2009.03) nerves. Conclusions and Relevance: The findings suggest that lowering serum cholesterol levels in patients with T2D and DPN is associated with a higher amount of nerve lesions and declining nerve conduction velocities and amplitudes. These findings may be relevant to emerging therapies that promote an aggressive lowering of serum cholesterol levels in patients with T2D. ",
        "Prevalence of Prediabetes Among Adolescents and Young Adults in the United States, 2005-2016. Importance: Individuals with prediabetes are at increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and cardiovascular disease. The incidence and prevalence of type 2 diabetes in the US adolescent population have increased in the last decade. Therefore, it is important to monitor the prevalence of prediabetes and varying levels of glucose tolerance to assess the future risk of type 2 diabetes in the youngest segment of the population. Objective: To examine the prevalence of impaired fasting glucose (IFG), impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), and increased glycated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels in US adolescents (aged 12-18 years) and young adults (aged 19-34 years) without diabetes. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cross-sectional analyses of the 2005-2016 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey assessed a population-based sample of adolescents and young adults who were not pregnant, did not have diabetes, and had measured fasting plasma glucose, 2-hour plasma glucose after a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test, and HbA1c levels. Analysis began in April 2017. Main Outcomes and Measures: Impaired fasting glucose was defined as fasting plasma glucose of 100 mg/dL to less than 126 mg/dL, IGT as 2-hour plasma glucose of 140 mg/dL to less than 200 mg/dL, and increased HbA1c level as HbA1c level between 5.7% and 6.4%. The prevalence of IFG, isolated IFG, IGT, isolated IGT, increased HbA1c level, isolated increased HbA1c level, and prediabetes (defined as having IFG, IGT, or increased HbA1c level) were estimated. Fasting insulin levels and cardiometabolic risk factors across glycemic abnormality phenotypes were also compared. Obesity was defined as having age- and sex-specific body mass index (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) in the 95th percentile or higher in adolescents or 30 or higher in young adults. Results: Of 5786 individuals, 2606 (45%) were adolescents and 3180 (55%) were young adults. Of adolescents, 50.6% (95% CI, 47.6%-53.6%) were boys, and 50.6% (95% CI, 48.8%-52.4%) of young adults were men. Among adolescents, the prevalence of prediabetes was 18.0% (95% CI, 16.0%-20.1%) and among young adults was 24.0% (95% CI, 22.0%-26.1%). Impaired fasting glucose constituted the largest proportion of prediabetes, with prevalence of 11.1% (95% CI, 9.5%-13.0%) in adolescents and 15.8% (95% CI, 14.0%-17.9%) in young adults. In multivariable logistic models including age, sex, race/ethnicity, and body mass index, the predictive marginal prevalence of prediabetes was significantly higher in male than in female individuals (22.5% [95% CI, 19.5%-25.4%] vs 13.4% [95% CI, 10.8%-16.5%] in adolescents and 29.1% [95% CI, 26.4%-32.1%] vs 18.8% [95% CI, 16.5%-21.3%] in young adults). Prediabetes prevalence was significantly higher in individuals with obesity than in those with normal weight (25.7% [95% CI, 20.0%-32.4%] vs 16.4% [95% CI, 14.3%-18.7%] in adolescents and 36.9% [95% CI, 32.9%-41.1%] vs 16.6% [95% CI, 14.2%-19.4%] in young adults). Compared with persons with normal glucose tolerance, adolescents and young adults with prediabetes had significantly higher non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, systolic blood pressure, central adiposity, and lower insulin sensitivity (P\u2009<\u2009.05 for all). Conclusions and Relevance: In the United States, about 1 of 5 adolescents and 1 of 4 young adults have prediabetes. The adjusted prevalence of prediabetes is higher in male individuals and in people with obesity. Adolescents and young adults with prediabetes also present an unfavorable cardiometabolic risk profile, putting them both at increased risk of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. ",
        "Assessing the Risk for Gout With Sodium-Glucose Cotransporter-2 Inhibitors in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes: A Population-Based Cohort Study. Background: Hyperuricemia is common in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and is known to cause gout. Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors prevent glucose reabsorption and lower serum uric acid levels. Objective: To compare the rate of gout between adults prescribed an SGLT2 inhibitor and those prescribed a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP1) receptor agonist. Design: Population-based new-user cohort study. Setting: A U.S. nationwide commercial insurance database from March 2013 to December 2017. Patients: Persons with type 2 diabetes newly prescribed an SGLT2 inhibitor were 1:1 propensity score matched to patients newly prescribed a GLP1 agonist. Persons were excluded if they had a history of gout or had received gout-specific treatment previously. Measurements: The primary outcome was a new diagnosis of gout. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) of the primary outcome and 95% CIs. Results: The study identified 295\u00a0907 adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus who were newly prescribed an SGLT2 inhibitor or a GLP1 agonist. The gout incidence rate was lower among patients prescribed an SGLT2 inhibitor (4.9 events per 1000 person-years) than those prescribed a GLP1 agonist (7.8 events per 1000 person-years), with an HR of 0.64 (95% CI, 0.57 to 0.72) and a rate difference of -2.9 (CI, -3.6 to -2.1) per 1000 person-years. Limitation: Unmeasured confounding, missing data (namely incomplete laboratory data), and low baseline risk for gout. Conclusion: Adults with type 2 diabetes prescribed an SGLT2 inhibitor had a lower rate of gout than those prescribed a GLP1 agonist. Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors may reduce the risk for gout among adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus, although future studies are necessary to confirm this observation.

        "Effect of Integrated Behavioral Weight Loss Treatment and Problem-Solving Therapy on Body Mass Index and Depressive Symptoms Among Patients With Obesity and Depression: The RAINBOW Randomized Clinical Trial. Importance: Coexisting obesity and depression exacerbate morbidity and disability, but effective treatments remain elusive. Objective: To test the hypothesis that an integrated collaborative care intervention would significantly improve both obesity and depression at 12 months compared with usual care. Design, Setting, and Participants: The Research Aimed at Improving Both Mood and Weight (RAINBOW) randomized clinical trial enrolled 409 adults with body mass indices (BMIs) of 30 or greater (\u226527 for Asian adults) and 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) scores of 10 or greater. Primary care patients at a health system in Northern California were recruited from September 30, 2014, to January 12, 2017; the date of final 12-month follow-up was January 17, 2018. Interventions: All participants randomly assigned to the intervention (n\u2009=\u2009204) or the usual care control group (n\u2009=\u2009205) received medical care from their personal physicians as usual, received information on routine services for obesity and depression at their clinic, and received wireless physical activity trackers. Intervention participants also received a 12-month intervention that integrated a Diabetes Prevention Program-based behavioral weight loss treatment with problem-solving therapy for depression and, if indicated, antidepressant medications. Main Outcomes and Measures: The co-primary outcome measures were BMI and 20-item Depression Symptom Checklist (SCL-20) scores (range, 0 [best] to 4 [worst]) at 12 months. Results: Among 409 participants randomized (mean age of 51.0 years [SD, 12.1 years]; 70% were women; mean BMI of 36.7 [SD, 6.4]; mean PHQ-9 score of 13.8 [SD, 3.1]; and mean SCL-20 score of 1.5 [SD, 0.5]), 344 (84.1%) completed 12-month follow-up. At 12 months, mean BMI declined from 36.7 (SD, 6.9) to 35.9 (SD, 7.1) among intervention participants compared with a change in mean BMI from 36.6 (SD, 5.8) to 36.6 (SD, 6.0) among usual care participants (between-group mean difference, -0.7 [95% CI, -1.1 to -0.2]; P\u2009=\u2009.01). Mean SCL-20 score declined from 1.5 (SD, 0.5) to 1.1 (SD, 1.0) at 12 months among intervention participants compared with a change in mean SCL-20 score from 1.5 (SD, 0.6) to 1.4 (SD, 1.3) among usual care participants (between-group mean difference, -0.2 [95% CI, -0.4 to 0]; P\u2009=\u2009.01). There were 47 adverse events or serious adverse events that involved musculoskeletal injuries (27 in the intervention group and 20 in the usual care group). Conclusions and Relevance: Among adults with obesity and depression, a collaborative care intervention integrating behavioral weight loss treatment, problem-solving therapy, and as-needed antidepressant medications significantly improved weight loss and depressive symptoms at 12 months compared with usual care; however, the effect sizes were modest and of uncertain clinical importance.

        "Association of Midlife Diet With Subsequent Risk for Dementia. Importance: Observational studies suggest that diet is linked to cognitive health. However, the duration of follow-up in many studies is not sufficient to take into account the long preclinical phase of dementia, and the evidence from interventional studies is not conclusive. Objective: To examine whether midlife diet is associated with subsequent risk for dementia. Design, Setting, and Participants: Population-based cohort study established in 1985-1988 that had dietary intake assessed in 1991-1993, 1997-1999, and 2002-2004 and follow-up for incident dementia until March 31, 2017. Exposures: Food frequency questionnaire to derive the Alternate Healthy Eating Index (AHEI), an 11-component diet quality score (score range, 0-110), with higher scores indicating a healthier diet. Main Outcome and Measures: Incident dementia ascertained through linkage to electronic health records. Results: Among 8225 participants without dementia in 1991-1993 (mean age, 50.2 years [SD, 6.1 years]; 5686 [69.1%] were men), a total of 344 cases of incident dementia were recorded during a median follow-up of 24.8 years (interquartile range, 24.2-25.1 years). No significant difference in the incidence rate for dementia was observed in tertiles of AHEI exposure during 1991-1993, 1997-1999 (median follow-up, 19.1 years), and 2002-2004 (median follow-up, 13.5 years). Compared with an incidence rate for dementia of 1.76 (95% CI, 1.47-2.12) per 1000 person-years in the worst tertile of AHEI (lowest tertile of diet quality) in 1991-1993, the absolute rate difference for the intermediate tertile was 0.03 (95% CI, -0.43 to 0.49) per 1000 person-years and for the best tertile was 0.04 (95% CI, -0.42 to 0.51) per 1000 person-years. Compared with the worst AHEI tertile in 1997-1999 (incidence rate for dementia, 2.06 [95% CI, 1.62 to 2.61] per 1000 person-years), the absolute rate difference for the intermediate AHEI tertile was 0.14 (95% CI, -0.58 to 0.86) per 1000 person-years and for the best AHEI tertile was 0.14 (95% CI, -0.58 to 0.85) per 1000 person-years. Compared with the worst AHEI tertile in 2002-2004 (incidence rate for dementia, 3.12 [95% CI, 2.49 to 3.92] per 1000 person-years), the absolute rate difference for the intermediate AHEI tertile was -0.61 (95% CI, -1.56 to 0.33) per 1000 person-years and for the best AHEI tertile was -0.73 (95% CI, -1.67 to 0.22) per 1000 person-years. In the multivariable analysis, the adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) for dementia per 1-SD (10-point) AHEI increment were not significant as assessed in 1991-1993 (adjusted HR, 0.97 [95% CI, 0.87 to 1.08]), in 1997-1999 (adjusted HR, 0.97 [95% CI, 0.83 to 1.12]), or in 2002-2004 (adjusted HR, 0.87 [95% CI, 0.75 to 1.00]). Conclusions and Relevance: In this long-term prospective cohort study, diet quality assessed during midlife was not significantly associated with subsequent risk for dementia. ",
        "Association of High Intakes of Vitamins B6 and B12 From Food and Supplements With Risk of Hip Fracture Among Postmenopausal Women in the Nurses' Health Study. Importance: Vitamin supplementation far exceeding recommended doses is popular in segments of the population. However, adverse effects can occur. In a previous secondary analysis of combined data from 2 double-blind randomized clinical trials (RCTs), an unexpected increased risk of hip fracture was found among those treated with high doses of vitamin B6 in combination with vitamin B12. Objectives: To study if high intakes of vitamins B6 and B12 from food and supplements were associated with a risk of hip fracture in the Nurses' Health Study and to investigate whether combined high intakes of both vitamins conferred a particularly increased fracture risk. Design, Setting, and Participants: In this prospective cohort study, 75\u202f864 postmenopausal women in the United States were followed up from June 1984 through May 2014. The dates of analysis were July 2016 to June 2018. Information on hip fracture and a wide range of potential confounders was collected at baseline and with biennial follow-up questionnaires. Extensive dietary information was collected approximately every 4 years with a semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire. Relative risks (RRs) were calculated by Cox proportional hazards regression, with cumulative average intakes of vitamins B6 and B12 as main exposures, adjusting for potential confounders. Main Outcome and Measure: Hip fracture. Results: During follow-up, 2304 of 75\u202f864 women had a hip fracture. Among the women with hip fractures, the median (range) age at hip fracture was 75.8 (46.7-93.0) years and the mean (SD) body mass index (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) was 24.3 (4.6). Median (interquartile range) cumulative average intakes of total vitamins B6 and B12 were 3.6 (4.8) mg/d and 12.1 (11.7) \u03bcg/d, respectively. Both vitamin B6 (RR, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.04-1.59 for an intake of \u226535 vs <2 mg/d; P\u2009=\u2009.06 for linear trend) and vitamin B12 (RR, 1.25; 95% CI, 0.98-1.58 for an intake of \u226530 vs <5 \u03bcg/d; P\u2009=\u2009.02 for linear trend) were associated with increased fracture risk. Risk was highest in women with a combined high intake of both vitamins (B6 \u226535 mg/d and B12 \u226520 \u03bcg/d), exhibiting an almost 50% increased risk of hip fracture (RR, 1.47; 95% CI, 1.15-1.89) compared with women with a low intake of both vitamins (B6 <2 mg/d and B12 <10 \u03bcg/d). Conclusions and Relevance: In this cohort study, a combined high intake of vitamins B6 and B12 was associated with an increased risk of hip fracture. The intakes were far higher than the recommended dietary allowances. These findings add to previous studies suggesting that vitamin supplements should be used cautiously because adverse effects can occur. ",
        "Association Between Plant-Based Dietary Patterns and Risk of Type 2 Diabetes: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis. Importance: Accumulating epidemiologic evidence has suggested favorable associations between plant-based dietary patterns and risk of type 2 diabetes, although there is a lack of a quantitative summary of evidence substantiating this important association. Objective: To quantitatively synthesize available prospective observational evidence on the association between plant-based dietary patterns and risk of type 2 diabetes. Data Sources: A systematic search of PubMed and MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, and reference lists through February 15, 2019, was conducted. Data analysis was conducted between December 2018 and February 2019. Study Selection: All prospective observational studies that examined the association between adherence to plant-based dietary patterns and incidence of type 2 diabetes among adults 18 years or older were identified. Data Extraction and Synthesis: Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology guidelines for data abstraction and reporting were followed, and a National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute assessment tool was used to evaluate study quality. Two authors independently conducted full-text assessments and data abstraction. Meta-analysis was conducted using the random-effects method to calculate the overall relative risk (RR) and 95% CI. Main Outcomes and Measures: Level of adherence to a plant-based diet and incidence of type 2 diabetes. Results: A total of 9 studies were identified, totaling 307\u202f099 participants with 23\u202f544 cases of incident type 2 diabetes. A significant inverse association was observed between higher adherence to a plant-based dietary pattern and risk of type 2 diabetes (RR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.71-0.84) in comparison with poorer adherence, with modest heterogeneity across studies (I2\u2009=\u200944.5%; P\u2009=\u2009.07 for heterogeneity). Similar findings were obtained when using the fixed-effects model (RR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.75-0.84). Consistent associations were observed across predefined subgroups. This association was strengthened when healthy plant-based foods, such as fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, and nuts, were included in the definition of plant-based patterns (RR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.62-0.79). Most studies were deemed to have good quality in terms of dietary assessment, disease outcomes, and statistical adjustment for confounding factors. Using restricted cubic splines, a significant inverse linear dose-response association was identified between plant-based dietary indices and risk of type 2 diabetes. Conclusions and Relevance: Plant-based dietary patterns, especially when they are enriched with healthful plant-based foods, may be beneficial for the primary prevention of type 2 diabetes. ",
        "Association of High-Dose Vitamin D Supplementation During Pregnancy With the Risk of Enamel Defects in Offspring: A 6-Year Follow-up of a Randomized Clinical Trial. Importance: Enamel defects of developmental origin affect up to 38% of schoolchildren and is recognized as a global public health challenge. The impaired enamel formation results in pain owing to hypersensitivity, posteruptive breakdowns, rapid caries progression, and extractions in some cases. The etiology is unknown; therefore, prevention is currently not possible. Objective: To assess the association of a high-dose vitamin D supplementation in pregnant women with enamel defects and caries in their offspring. Design, Setting, and Participants: Post hoc analysis of a double-blind, single-center, randomized clinical trial, the Copenhagen Prospective Studies on Asthma in Childhood 2010 cohort (COPSAC2010). Enrollment began March 2009 and included 623 women recruited at 24 weeks of pregnancy and 588 of their children. A dental examination was completed at age 6 years in 496 of 588 children (84%). Data were analyzed in 2018. Intervention: High-dose vitamin D3 (2400 IU/d; N\u2009=\u2009315) or matching placebo tablets (N\u2009=\u2009308) from pregnancy week 24 to 1 week post partum. In addition, all women received 400 IU/d of vitamin D3 as part of standard care. Main Outcomes and Measures: Enamel defect was defined as having at least 1 molar affected by demarcated opacity, enamel breakdown, and/or atypical restoration. Caries was defined as decayed, missing, or filled surfaces in both the deciduous and permanent dentitions (World Health Organization standard). Results: The risk of enamel defects in the permanent dentition was lower in the offspring of mothers who received high-dose vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy compared with standard dose (15.1% [n\u2009=\u200926 of 172] vs 27.5% [n\u2009=\u200944 of 160]; odds ratio, 0.47; 95% CI, 0.27-0.81). A similar association was observed for the deciduous dentition (8.6% [n\u2009=\u200921 of 244] vs 15.9% [n\u2009=\u200940 of 252]; odds ratio, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.28-0.87). There was no association between supplementation and caries. Conclusions and Relevance: High-dose vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy was associated with approximately 50% reduced odds of enamel defects in the offspring. This suggests prenatal vitamin D supplementation as a preventive intervention for enamel defects, with a clinically important association with dental health.

        "Reach and Use of Diabetes Prevention Services in the United States, 2016-2017. Importance: Coordinated efforts by national organizations in the United States to implement evidence-based lifestyle modification programs are under way to reduce type 2 diabetes (hereinafter referred to as diabetes) and cardiovascular risks. Objective: To provide a status report on the reach and use of diabetes prevention services nationally. Design, Setting, and Participants: This nationally representative, population-based cross-sectional analysis of 2016 and 2017 National Health Interview Survey data was conducted from August 3, 2017, through November 15, 2018. Nonpregnant, noninstitutionalized, civilian respondents 18 years or older at high risk for diabetes, defined as those with no self-reported diabetes diagnosis but with diagnosed prediabetes or an elevated American Diabetes Association (ADA) risk score (>5), were included in the analysis. Analyses were conducted for adults with (and in sensitivity analyses, for those without) elevated body mass index. Main Outcomes and Measures: Absolute numbers and proportions of adults at high risk with elevated body mass index receiving advice about diet, physical activity guidance, referral to weight loss programs, referral to diabetes prevention programs, or any of these, and those affirming engagement in each (or any) activity in the past year were estimated. To identify where gaps exist, a prevention continuum diagram plotted existing vs desired goal achievement. Variation in risk-reducing activities by age, sex, race/ethnicity, educational attainment, insurance status, history of gestational diabetes mellitus, hypertension, or body mass index was also examined. Results: This analysis included 50\u202f912 respondents (representing 223.0 million adults nationally) 18 years or older (mean [SE] age, 46.1 [0.2] years; 48.1% [0.3%] male) with complete data and no self-reported diabetes diagnosis by their health care professional. Of the represented population, 36.0% (80.0 million) had either a physician diagnosis of prediabetes (17.9 million), an elevated ADA risk score (73.3 million), or both (11.3 million). Among those with diagnosed prediabetes, 73.5% (95% CI, 71.6%-75.3%) reported receiving advice and/or referrals for diabetes risk reduction from their health care professional, and, of those, 35.0% (95% CI, 30.5%-39.8%) to 75.8% (95% CI, 73.2%-78.3%) reported engaging in the respective activity or program in the past year. Half of adults with elevated ADA risk scores but no diagnosed prediabetes (50.6%; 95% CI, 49.5%-51.8%) reported receiving risk-reduction advice and/or referral, of whom 33.5% (95% CI, 30.1%-37.0%) to 75.2% (95% CI, 73.4%-76.9%) reported engaging in activities and/or programs. Participation in diabetes prevention programs was exceedingly low. Advice from a health care professional, age range from 45 to 64 years, higher educational attainment, health insurance status, gestational diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and obesity were associated with higher engagement in risk-reducing activities and/or programs. Conclusions and Relevance: Among adults at high risk for diabetes, major gaps in receiving advice and/or referrals and engaging in diabetes risk-reduction activities and/or programs were noted. These results suggest that risk perception, health care professional referral and communication, and insurance coverage may be key levers to increase risk-reducing behaviors in US adults. These findings provide a benchmark from which to monitor future program availability and coverage, identification of prediabetes, and referral to and retention in programs. ",
        "Association of Animal and Plant Protein Intake With All-Cause and Cause-Specific Mortality in a Japanese Cohort. Importance: Epidemiological evidence regarding the long-term effects of higher dietary protein intake on mortality outcomes in the general population is not clear. Objective: To evaluate the associations between animal and plant protein intake and all-cause and cause-specific mortality. Design, Setting, and Participants: This prospective cohort study included 70 696 participants in the Japan Public Health Center-based Prospective Cohort who were aged 45 to 74 years and had no history of cancer, cerebrovascular disease, or ischemic heart disease at study baseline. Data were collected from January 1, 1995, through December 31, 1999, with follow-up completed December 31, 2016, during which 12 381 total deaths were documented. Dietary intake information was collected through a validated food frequency questionnaire and used to estimate protein intake in all participants. Participants were grouped into quintile categories based on their protein intake, expressed as a percentage of total energy. Data were analyzed from July 18, 2017, through April 10, 2019. Main Outcomes and Measures: Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs for all-cause and cause-specific mortality were estimated using Cox proportional hazards regression models with adjustment for potential confounding factors. Results: Among the 70 696 participants, 32 201 (45.5%) were men (mean [SD] age, 55.6 [7.6] years) and 38 495 (54.5%) were women (mean [SD] age, 55.8 [7.7] years). Intake of animal protein showed no clear association with total or cause-specific mortality. In contrast, intake of plant protein was associated with lower total mortality, with multivariable-adjusted HRs of 0.89 (95% CI, 0.83-0.95) for quintile 2; 0.88 (95% CI, 0.82-0.95) for quintile 3; 0.84 (95% CI, 0.77-0.92) for quintile 4; and 0.87 (95% CI, 0.78-0.96) for quintile 5, with quintile 1 as the reference category (P\u2009=\u2009.01 for trend). For cause-specific mortality, this association with plant protein intake was evident for cardiovascular disease (CVD)-related mortality (HRs, 0.84 [95% CI, 0.73-0.96] to 0.70 [95% CI, 0.59-0.83]; P\u2009=\u2009.002 for trend). Isocaloric substitution of 3% energy from plant protein for red meat protein was associated with lower total (HR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.55-0.80), cancer-related (HR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.45-0.82), and CVD-related (HR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.39-0.86) mortality; substitution for processed meat protein was associated with lower total (HR, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.38-0.75) and cancer-related (HR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.30-0.85) mortality. Conclusions and Relevance: In this large prospective study, higher plant protein intake was associated with lower total and CVD-related mortality. Although animal protein intake was not associated with mortality outcomes, replacement of red meat protein or processed meat protein with plant protein was associated with lower total, cancer-related, and CVD-related mortality.

        "Dietary Cholesterol and Cardiovascular Risk: A Science Advisory From the American Heart Association. The elimination of specific dietary cholesterol target recommendations in recent guidelines has raised questions about its role with respect to cardiovascular disease. This advisory was developed after a review of human studies on the relationship of dietary cholesterol with blood lipids, lipoproteins, and cardiovascular disease risk to address questions about the relevance of dietary cholesterol guidance for heart health. Evidence from observational studies conducted in several countries generally does not indicate a significant association with cardiovascular disease risk. Although meta-analyses of intervention studies differ in their findings, most associate intakes of cholesterol that exceed current average levels with elevated total or low-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations. Dietary guidance should focus on healthy dietary patterns (eg, Mediterranean-style and DASH [Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension]-style diets) that are inherently relatively low in cholesterol with typical levels similar to the current US intake. These patterns emphasize fruits, vegetables, whole grains, low-fat or fat-free dairy products, lean protein sources, nuts, seeds, and liquid vegetable oils. A recommendation that gives a specific dietary cholesterol target within the context of food-based advice is challenging for clinicians and consumers to implement; hence, guidance focused on dietary patterns is more likely to improve diet quality and to promote cardiovascular health.

        "Ultraprocessed Food Consumption and Risk of Type 2 Diabetes Among Participants of the NutriNet-Sant\u00e9 Prospective Cohort. Importance: Ultraprocessed foods (UPF) are widespread in Western diets. Their consumption has been associated in recent prospective studies with increased risks of all-cause mortality and chronic diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular diseases, hypertension, and dyslipidemia; however, data regarding diabetes is lacking. Objective: To assess the associations between consumption of UPF and risk of type 2 diabetes (T2D). Design, Setting, and Participants: In this population-based prospective cohort study, 104\u202f707 participants aged 18 years or older from the French NutriNet-Sant\u00e9 cohort (2009-2019) were included. Dietary intake data were collected using repeated 24-hour dietary records (5.7 per participant on average), designed to register participants' usual consumption for more than 3500 different food items. These were categorized according to their degree of processing by the NOVA classification system. Main Outcomes and Measures: Associations between UPF consumption and risk of T2D were assessed using cause-specific multivariable Cox proportional hazard models adjusted for known risk factors (sociodemographic, anthropometric, lifestyle, medical history, and nutritional factors). Results: A total of 104\u202f707 participants (21\u202f800 [20.8%] men and 82\u202f907 [79.2%] women) were included. Mean (SD) baseline age of participants was 42.7 (14.5) years. Absolute T2D rates in the lowest and highest UPF consumers were 113 and 166 per 100\u202f000 person-years, respectively. Consumption of UPF was associated with a higher risk of T2D (multi-adjusted hazard ratio [HR] for an absolute increment of 10 in the percentage of UPF in the diet, 1.15; 95% CI, 1.06-1.25; median follow-up, 6.0 years; 582\u202f252 person-years; 821 incident cases). These results remained statistically significant after adjustment for several markers of the nutritional quality of the diet, for other metabolic comorbidities (HR, 1.13; 95% CI, 1.03-1.23), and for weight change (HR, 1.13; 95% CI, 1.01-1.27). The absolute amount of UPF consumption (grams per day) was consistently associated with T2D risk, even when adjusting for unprocessed or minimally processed food intake (HR for a 100 g/d increase, 1.05; 95% CI, 1.02-1.08). Conclusions and Relevance: In this large observational prospective study, a higher proportion of UPF in the diet was associated with a higher risk of T2D. Even though these results need to be confirmed in other populations and settings, they provide evidence to support efforts by public health authorities to recommend limiting UPF consumption.

Design, Setting, and Participants: This retrospective cohort study enrolled patients at a tertiary care academic medical center from January 1, 1991, to December 31, 2014, with a median follow-up of 8.4 years. Data analysis was performed from April 19 to July 17, 2018. Consecutive adult patients referred for symptom-limited exercise treadmill testing were stratified by age- and sex-matched cardiorespiratory fitness into performance groups: low (<25th percentile), below average (25th-49th percentile), above average (50th-74th percentile), high (75th-97.6th percentile), and elite (\u226597.7th percentile). Exposures: Cardiorespiratory fitness, as quantified by peak estimated metabolic equivalents on treadmill testing. Main Outcomes and Measures: All-cause mortality. Results: The study population included 122\u202f007 patients (mean [SD] age, 53.4\u2009[12.6] years; 72 173 [59.2%] male). Death occurred in 13\u202f637 patients during 1.1 million person-years of observation. Risk-adjusted all-cause mortality was inversely proportional to cardiorespiratory fitness and was lowest in elite performers (elite vs low: adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 0.20; 95% CI, 0.16-0.24; P\u2009<\u2009.001; elite vs high: adjusted HR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.63-0.95; P\u2009=\u2009.02). The increase in all-cause mortality associated with reduced cardiorespiratory fitness (low vs elite: adjusted HR, 5.04; 95% CI, 4.10-6.20; P\u2009<\u2009.001; below average vs above average: adjusted HR, 1.41; 95% CI, 1.34-1.49; P\u2009<\u2009.001) was comparable to or greater than traditional clinical risk factors (coronary artery disease: adjusted HR, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.24-1.35; P\u2009<\u2009.001; smoking: adjusted HR, 1.41; 95% CI, 1.36-1.46; P\u2009<\u2009.001; diabetes: adjusted HR, 1.40; 95% CI, 1.34-1.46; P\u2009<\u2009.001). In subgroup analysis, the benefit of elite over high performance was present in patients 70 years or older (adjusted HR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.52-0.98; P\u2009=\u2009.04) and patients with hypertension (adjusted HR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.50-0.99; P\u2009=\u2009.05). Extreme cardiorespiratory fitness (\u22652 SDs above the mean for age and sex) was associated with the lowest risk-adjusted all-cause mortality compared with all other performance groups. Conclusions and Relevance: Cardiorespiratory fitness is inversely associated with long-term mortality with no observed upper limit of benefit. Extremely high aerobic fitness was associated with the greatest survival and was associated with benefit in older patients and those with hypertension. Cardiorespiratory fitness is a modifiable indicator of long-term mortality, and health care professionals should encourage patients to achieve and maintain high levels of fitness. ",
        "Effect of Genetic Diagnosis on Patients with Previously Undiagnosed Disease. BACKGROUND: Many patients remain without a diagnosis despite extensive medical evaluation. The Undiagnosed Diseases Network (UDN) was established to apply a multidisciplinary model in the evaluation of the most challenging cases and to identify the biologic characteristics of newly discovered diseases. The UDN, which is funded by the National Institutes of Health, was formed in 2014 as a network of seven clinical sites, two sequencing cores, and a coordinating center. Later, a central biorepository, a metabolomics core, and a model organisms screening center were added. METHODS: We evaluated patients who were referred to the UDN over a period of 20 months. The patients were required to have an undiagnosed condition despite thorough evaluation by a health care provider. We determined the rate of diagnosis among patients who subsequently had a complete evaluation, and we observed the effect of diagnosis on medical care. RESULTS: A total of 1519 patients (53% female) were referred to the UDN, of whom 601 (40%) were accepted for evaluation. Of the accepted patients, 192 (32%) had previously undergone exome sequencing. Symptoms were neurologic in 40% of the applicants, musculoskeletal in 10%, immunologic in 7%, gastrointestinal in 7%, and rheumatologic in 6%. Of the 382 patients who had a complete evaluation, 132 received a diagnosis, yielding a rate of diagnosis of 35%. A total of 15 diagnoses (11%) were made by clinical review alone, and 98 (74%) were made by exome or genome sequencing. Of the diagnoses, 21% led to recommendations regarding changes in therapy, 37% led to changes in diagnostic testing, and 36% led to variant-specific genetic counseling. We defined 31 new syndromes. CONCLUSIONS: The UDN established a diagnosis in 132 of the 382 patients who had a complete evaluation, yielding a rate of diagnosis of 35%. (Funded by the National Institutes of Health Common Fund.).

        "Association of Social and Behavioral Risk Factors With Earlier Onset of Adult Hypertension and Diabetes. Importance: The National Academy of Medicine has recommended incorporating information on social and behavioral factors associated with health, such as educational level and exercise, into electronic health records, but questions remain about the clinical value of doing so. Objective: To examine whether National Academy of Medicine-recommended social and behavioral risk factor domains are associated with earlier onset of hypertension and/or diabetes in a clinical population. Design, Setting, and Participants: This prospective cohort study used data collected from April 1, 2005, to December 31, 2016, from a population-based sample of 41\u202f745 patients from 4 cycles of Kaiser Permanente Northern California's Adult Member Health Survey, administered to members at 19 Kaiser Permanente Northern California medical center service populations. The study used Kaplan-Meier survival tables and Cox proportional hazards regression analysis to estimate the onset of hypertension and diabetes among patients with no indication of disease at baseline. Data analysis was performed from June 2, 2017, to March 26, 2019. Exposures: Race/ethnicity, educational level, financial worry, partnership status, stress, intimate partner violence, concentrated neighborhood poverty, depressive symptoms, infrequent exercise, smoking, heavy alcohol consumption, and cumulative social and behavioral risk. Main Outcomes and Measures: Onset of hypertension and diabetes during the 3.5 years after survey administration. Results: The study included 18\u202f133 people without baseline hypertension (mean [SD] age, 48.1 [15.3] years; 10 997 [60.7%] female; and 11 503 [63.4%] white) and 35\u202f788 people without baseline diabetes (mean [SD] age, 56.2 [16.9] years; 20 191 [56.4%] female; and 24 351 [68.0%] white). There was a dose-response association between the number of social and behavioral risk factors and likelihood of onset of each condition. Controlling for age, sex, race/ethnicity, body mass index, and survey year, hazard ratios (HRs) comparing those with 3 or more risk factors with those with 0 risk factor were 1.41 (95% CI, 1.17-1.71) for developing hypertension and 1.53 (95% CI, 1.29-1.82) for developing diabetes. When the same covariates were adjusted for, having less than a high school educational level (hazard ratio [HR], 1.84; 95% CI, 1.40-2.43), being widowed (HR, 1.38; 95% CI, 1.11-1.71), concentrated neighborhood poverty (HR, 1.26; 95% CI, 1.00-1.59), infrequent exercise (HR, 1.22; 95% CI, 1.08-1.38), and smoking (HR, 1.35; 95% CI, 1.10-1.67) were significantly associated with hypertension onset. Having less than a high school educational level (HR, 1.58; 95% CI, 1.26-1.97), financial worry (HR, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.13-1.46), being single or separated (HR, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.08-1.42), high stress (HR, 1.28; 95% CI, 1.09-1.51), intimate partner violence (HR, 1.68; 95% CI, 1.14-2.48), concentrated neighborhood poverty (HR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.07-1.60), depressive symptoms (HR, 1.28; 95% CI, 1.10-1.50), and smoking (HR, 1.53; 95% CI, 1.27-1.86) were significantly associated with diabetes onset, although heavy alcohol consumption was associated with protection (HR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.66-0.85) rather than risk. Conclusions and Relevance: Independent of traditional risk factors, individual and cumulative social and behavioral risk factor exposures were associated with onset of hypertension and diabetes within 3.5 years in a clinical setting. The findings support the value of assessing social and behavioral risk factors to help identify high-risk patients and of providing targets for intervention. ",
        "Care of the Transgender Patient. Transgender persons are a diverse group whose gender identity differs from their sex recorded at birth. Some choose to undergo medical treatment to align their physical appearance with their gender identity. Barriers to accessing appropriate and culturally competent care contribute to health disparities in transgender persons, such as increased rates of certain types of cancer, substance abuse, mental health conditions, infections, and chronic diseases. Thus, it is important that clinicians understand the specific medical issues that are relevant to this population. ",
        "Association of Aspirin Use With Mortality Risk Among Older Adult Participants in the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial. Importance: Aspirin use has been associated with reduced risk of cancer mortality, particularly of the colorectum. However, aspirin efficacy may be influenced by biological characteristics, such as obesity and age. With the increasing prevalence of obesity and conflicting data regarding the effect of aspirin in older adults, understanding the potential association of aspirin use with cancer mortality according to body mass index (BMI) and age is imperative. Objectives: To investigate the association of aspirin use with risk of all-cause, any cancer, gastrointestinal (GI) cancer, and colorectal cancer (CRC) mortality among older adults and to perform an exploratory analysis of the association of aspirin use with mortality stratified by BMI. Design, Setting, Participants: This cohort study evaluated aspirin use among participants aged 65 years and older in the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial at baseline (November 8, 1993, to July 2, 2001) and follow-up (2006-2008). Analysis began in late 2018 and was completed in September 2019. Main Outcomes and Measures: All-cause, any cancer, GI cancer, or CRC mortality. Multivariable hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs were calculated using time-varying Cox proportional hazards regression modeling, adjusting for additional factors. Results: A total of 146\u202f152 individuals (mean [SD] age at baseline, 66.3 [2.4] years; 74\u202f742 [51.1%] women; 129\u202f446 [88.6%] non-Hispanic white) were included in analysis. The median (interquartile range) follow-up time was 12.5 (8.7-16.4) years, encompassing 1\u202f822\u202f164 person-years. Compared with no use, aspirin use 1 to 3 times per month was associated with reduced risk of all-cause mortality (HR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.80-0.88; P\u2009<\u2009.001) and cancer mortality (HR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.81-0.94; P\u2009<\u2009.001). Aspirin use 3 or more times per week was associated with decreased risk of mortality of all causes (HR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.80-0.83; P\u2009<\u2009.001), any cancer (HR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.81-0.88; P\u2009<\u2009.001), GI cancer (HR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.66-0.84; P\u2009<\u2009.001), and CRC (HR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.61-0.84; P\u2009<\u2009.001). When stratified by BMI (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared), aspirin use 3 or more times per week among individuals with BMI 20 to 24.9 was associated with reduced risk of all-cause mortality (HR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.78-0.85; P\u2009<\u2009.001) and any cancer mortality (HR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.79-0.82; P\u2009<\u2009.001). Among individuals with BMI 25 to 29.9, aspirin use 3 or more times per week was associated with reduced risk of all-cause mortality (HR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.79-0.85; P\u2009<\u2009.001), any cancer mortality (HR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.81-0.91; P\u2009<\u2009.001), GI cancer mortality (HR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.60-0.86; P\u2009<\u2009.001), and CRC mortality (HR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.51-0.85; P\u2009=\u2009.001). Conclusions and Relevance: In this cohort study, aspirin use 3 or more times per week was associated with a reduction in all-cause, cancer, GI cancer and CRC mortality in older adults. ",
        "Effect of Peer Comparison Letters for High-Volume Primary Care Prescribers of Quetiapine in Older and Disabled Adults: A Randomized Clinical Trial. Importance: Antipsychotic agents, such as quetiapine fumarate, are frequently overprescribed for indications not supported by clinical evidence, potentially causing harm. Objective: To investigate if peer comparison letters targeting high-volume primary care prescribers of quetiapine meaningfully reduce their prescribing. Design, Setting, and Participants: Randomized clinical trial (intent to treat) conducted from 2015 to 2017 of prescribers and their patients nationwide in the Medicare program. The trial targeted the 5055 highest-volume primary care prescribers of quetiapine in 2013 and 2014 (approximately 5% of all primary care prescribers of quetiapine). Interventions: Prescribers were randomized (1:1 ratio) to receive a placebo letter or 3 peer comparison letters stating that their quetiapine prescribing was high relative to their peers and was under review by Medicare. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was the total quetiapine days supplied by prescribers from the intervention start to 9 months. Secondary outcomes included quetiapine receipt from all prescribers by baseline patients, quetiapine receipt by patients with low-value or guideline-concordant indications for therapy, mortality, and hospital use. In exploratory analyses, the study followed outcomes to 2 years. Results: Of the 5055 prescribers, 231 (4.6%) were general practitioners, 2428 (48.0%) were in family medicine, and 2396 (47.4%) were in internal medicine; 4155 (82.2%) were male. All were included in the analyses. Over 9 months, the treatment arm supplied 11.1% fewer quetiapine days per prescriber vs the control arm (2456 vs 2864 days; percentage difference, 11.1% fewer days; 95% CI, -13.1% to -9.2% days; P\u2009<\u2009.001; adjusted difference, -319 days; 95% CI, -374 to -263 days; P\u2009<\u2009.001), which persisted through 2 years (15.6% fewer days; 95% CI, -18.1% to -13.0%; P\u2009<\u2009.001). At the patient level, individuals in the treatment arm received 3.9% (95% CI, -5.0% to -2.9%; P\u2009<\u2009.001) fewer days of quetiapine from all prescribers over 9 months, with a larger decrease among patients with low-value vs guideline-concordant indications (-5.9% [95% CI, -8.0% to -3.9%] vs -2.4% [95% CI, -4.0% to -0.9%], P\u2009=\u2009.01 for test that effects were equal for both patient groups). There was no evidence of substitution to other antipsychotics, and 9-month mortality and hospital use were similar between the treatment vs control arms. Conclusions and Relevance: Peer comparison letters caused substantial and durable reductions in quetiapine prescribing, with no evidence of negative effects on patients. Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02467933. ",
        "Obesity, depression and hip pain. INTRODUCTION: Up to 64% of the general population reports experiencing chronic pain, with the hip being one of the most frequent sites. An association has been shown between chronic back pain, obesity and depression. To date, a similar association has not been investigated with chronic hip pain. METHODS: A total of 2,515 subjects were chosen as a representative cross-section of the German population. Each was provided with a questionnaire that included the Regional Pain Scale, European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30), Beck Depression Inventory-Primary Care and Winkler social class index. Participant height and weight values were obtained from self-reports. Using logistic regression methodology, we analysed the association between hip pain, obesity and increased depression scores. RESULTS: A total of 124 (4.9%) subjects reported chronic hip pain and an additional 39 (1.5%) reported chronic hip pain that was disabling. Hip pain affected 1-5 sites (oligolocular) in 47% of cases, and was widespread (6-19 sites) in 50%. Obesity and increased values on the depression scale were associated with an increased likelihood of chronic hip pain (odds ratio [OR] 2.55 and 8.53, respectively) compared with subjects without pain. Increased values on the depression scale (OR 28.22) increased the likelihood of experiencing disabling chronic hip pain in comparison with pain free individuals. CONCLUSIONS: Hip pain is rarely the sole site of pain. Obesity and increased values on the depression scale are associated with chronic hip pain. Increased values on the depression scale are associated with disabling chronic hip pain. ",
        "Intensive Glucose Control in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes - 15-Year Follow-up. BACKGROUND: We previously reported that a median of 5.6 years of intensive as compared with standard glucose lowering in 1791 military veterans with type 2 diabetes resulted in a risk of major cardiovascular events that was significantly lower (by 17%) after a total of 10 years of combined intervention and observational follow-up. We now report the full 15-year follow-up. METHODS: We observationally followed enrolled participants (complete cohort) after the conclusion of the original clinical trial by using central databases to identify cardiovascular events, hospitalizations, and deaths. Participants were asked whether they would be willing to provide additional data by means of surveys and chart reviews (survey cohort). The prespecified primary outcome was a composite of major cardiovascular events, including nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, new or worsening congestive heart failure, amputation for ischemic gangrene, and death from cardiovascular causes. Death from any cause was a prespecified secondary outcome. RESULTS: There were 1655 participants in the complete cohort and 1391 in the survey cohort. During the trial (which originally enrolled 1791 participants), the separation of the glycated hemoglobin curves between the intensive-therapy group (892 participants) and the standard-therapy group (899 participants) averaged 1.5 percentage points, and this difference declined to 0.2 to 0.3 percentage points by 3 years after the trial ended. Over a period of 15 years of follow-up (active treatment plus post-trial observation), the risks of major cardiovascular events or death were not lower in the intensive-therapy group than in the standard-therapy group (hazard ratio for primary outcome, 0.91; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.78 to 1.06; P\u2009=\u20090.23; hazard ratio for death, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.88 to 1.18). The risk of major cardiovascular disease outcomes was reduced, however, during an extended interval of separation of the glycated hemoglobin curves (hazard ratio, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.70 to 0.99), but this benefit did not continue after equalization of the glycated hemoglobin levels (hazard ratio, 1.26; 95% CI, 0.90 to 1.75). CONCLUSIONS: Participants with type 2 diabetes who had been randomly assigned to intensive glucose control for 5.6 years had a lower risk of cardiovascular events than those who received standard therapy only during the prolonged period in which the glycated hemoglobin curves were separated. There was no evidence of a legacy effect or a mortality benefit with intensive glucose control. (Funded by the VA Cooperative Studies Program; VADT ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00032487.). ",
        "Changes in Sexual Functioning in Women and Men in the 5 Years After Bariatric Surgery. Importance: Short-term improvements in sexual functioning are reported after bariatric surgery, but to our knowledge, little is known about the durability of these improvements. Objective: To determine the percentage of adults with impairment in sexual functioning who experience durable improvements in sexual functioning after bariatric surgery and to identify factors associated with improvements. Design, Setting, and Participants: The Longitudinal Assessment of Bariatric Surgery-2 is an observational cohort study conducted at 10 hospitals in 6 US clinical centers. Adults undergoing their first bariatric procedure were recruited from 2005 through 2009, data were collected through August 2014. Data analysis was conducted from 2016 to April 2018. Interventions: Participants completed assessments before the procedure and annually thereafter for 5 years. Main Outcomes and Measures: A self-administered questionnaire was used to assess clinically meaningful differences before and after surgery in past-month sexual satisfaction, desire, and activity and physical health limitations to sexual activity among subgroups who reported sexual functioning at less than domain-specific thresholds before surgery. Results: Of 2215 participants eligible for sexual function follow-up, 2036 (91.9%) completed 1 or more follow-up assessment (1431 [64.6%] at year 5), of whom 1607 (78.9%) were women. At the presurgery assessment, median (interquartile range) age was 47 (37-55) years, and the median (interquartile range) body mass index was 45.8 (41.7-51.3). Among those who were not satisfied with their sexual life before surgery (1015 of 1456 women [69.7%]; 304 of 409 men [74.3%]), 56.0% of women (95% CI, 52.5%-59.5%) and 49.2% of men (95% CI, 42.4%-55.9%) experienced clinically meaningful improvements at year 1; these percentages did not significantly differ during further follow-up. Among those who reported physical limitations to sexual activity at baseline (892 of 1490 women [59.9%] and 267 of 406 men [65.8%]), the percentage experiencing improvement in this domain decreased during follow-up, but 73.6% (95% CI, 69.3%-78.0%) of women and 67.6% (95% CI, 59.6%-75.6%) of men continued to report improvements at year 5. Greater postsurgical reduction in depressive symptoms was independently associated with improvement in 4 domains of sexual life among women (frequency of sexual desire: adjusted relative risk [aRR] per 5-point decrease in Beck Depression Inventory score, 1.12 [95% CI, 1.07-1.18]; P\u2009<\u2009.001; frequency of sexual activity: aRR, 1.13 [95% CI, 1.08-1.18]; P\u2009<\u2009.001; the degree to which physical health limited sexual activity: aRR, 1.19 [95% CI, 1.14-1.23]; P\u2009<\u2009.001; and satisfaction with sexual life: aRR, 1.25 [95% CI, 1.19-1.31]; P\u2009<\u2009.001) and 2 domains among men (physical health limitations: aRR, 1.14 [95% CI, 1.04-1.26]; P\u2009=\u2009.008 and satisfaction with sexual life: aRR, 1.55 [95% CI, 1.33-1.81]; P\u2009<\u2009.001). Surgical procedure was not associated with improvement. Conclusions and Relevance: Per this study, approximately half of women and men who were not satisfied with their sexual life prior to bariatric surgery experienced improvements in satisfaction in 5 years of follow-up.

        "Association of Exposure to Artificial Light at Night While Sleeping With Risk of Obesity in Women. Importance: Short sleep has been associated with obesity, but to date the association between exposure to artificial light at night (ALAN) while sleeping and obesity is unknown. Objective: To determine whether ALAN exposure while sleeping is associated with the prevalence and risk of obesity. Design, Setting, and Participants: This baseline and prospective analysis included women aged 35 to 74 years enrolled in the Sister Study in all 50 US states and Puerto Rico from July 2003 through March 2009. Follow-up was completed on August 14, 2015. A total of 43\u202f722 women with no history of cancer or cardiovascular disease who were not shift workers, daytime sleepers, or pregnant at baseline were included in the analysis. Data were analyzed from September 1, 2017, through December 31, 2018. Exposures: Artificial light at night while sleeping reported at enrollment, categorized as no light, small nightlight in the room, light outside the room, and light or television in the room. Main Outcomes and Measures: Prevalent obesity at baseline was based on measured general obesity (body mass index [BMI] \u226530.0) and central obesity (waist circumference [WC] \u226588 cm, waist-to-hip ratio [WHR] \u22650.85, or waist-to-height ratio [WHtR]\u22650.5). To evaluate incident overweight and obesity, self-reported BMI at enrollment was compared with self-reported BMI at follow-up (mean [SD] follow-up,\u20095.7 [1.0] years). Generalized log-linear models with robust error variance were used to estimate multivariable-adjusted prevalence ratios (PRs) and relative risks (RRs) with 95% CIs for prevalent and incident obesity. Results: Among the population of 43 722 women (mean [SD] age, 55.4 [8.9] years), having any ALAN exposure while sleeping was positively associated with a higher prevalence of obesity at baseline, as measured using BMI (PR, 1.03; 95% CI, 1.02-1.03), WC (PR, 1.12; 95% CI, 1.09-1.16), WHR (PR, 1.04; 95% CI, 1.00-1.08), and WHtR (PR, 1.07; 95% CI, 1.04-1.09), after adjusting for confounding factors, with P\u2009<\u2009.001 for trend for each measure. Having any ALAN exposure while sleeping was also associated with incident obesity (RR, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.06-1.34). Compared with no ALAN, sleeping with a television or a light on in the room was associated with gaining 5 kg or more (RR, 1.17; 95% CI, 1.08-1.27; P\u2009<\u2009.001 for trend), a BMI increase of 10% or more (RR, 1.13; 95% CI, 1.02-1.26; P\u2009=\u2009.04 for trend), incident overweight (RR, 1.22; 95% CI,1.06-1.40;\u2009P\u2009=\u2009.03 for trend), and incident obesity (RR, 1.33; 95% CI, 1.13-1.57; P\u2009<\u2009.001 for trend). Results were supported by sensitivity analyses and additional multivariable analyses including potential mediators such as sleep duration and quality, diet, and physical activity. Conclusions and Relevance: These results suggest that exposure to ALAN while sleeping may be a risk factor for weight gain and development of overweight or obesity. Further prospective and interventional studies could help elucidate this association and clarify whether lowering exposure to ALAN while sleeping can promote obesity prevention. ",
        "Prophylactic Inferior Vena Cava Filters Prior to Bariatric Surgery: Insights From the National Inpatient Sample. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to determine in-hospital mortality, post-surgical thromboembolic events, and\u00a0health care costs associated with the placement of prophylactic inferior vena cava filters (IVCFs) prior to bariatric\u00a0surgery. BACKGROUND: The role of prophylactic IVCFs prior to bariatric surgery is controversial, and the nationwide clinical outcomes associated with this practice are unknown. METHODS: This observational study used the National Inpatient Sample database to identify obese patients who underwent bariatric surgery from January 2005 to September 2015. Using propensity score matching, outcomes associated with patients receiving prophylactic IVCFs prior to their bariatric surgery were compared with those among patients who did not receive IVCFs. RESULTS: A total of 258,480 patients underwent bariatric surgery, of whom 1,047 (0.41%) had prophylactic IVCFs implanted. Patients with prophylactic IVCFs compared with those without IVCFs had a significantly higher rate of the combined endpoint of in-hospital mortality or pulmonary embolism (1.4% vs. 0.4%; odds ratio: 3.75; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.25 to 11.30; p\u00a0= 0.019). Additionally, prophylactic IVCFs were associated with higher rates of lower extremity or caval deep vein thrombosis (1.8% vs. 0.3%; odds ratio: 6.33; 95% CI: 1.87 to 21.4; p\u00a0<\u00a00.01), length of stay (median 3 days vs. 2 days; p < 0.01), and hospital charges (median $63,000 vs. $37,000; p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: In this nationwide observational study, prophylactic IVCF implantation prior to bariatric surgery was\u00a0associated with worse clinical outcomes and increased health care resource utilization.

        "Incidence and Determinants of Mental Health Service Use After Bariatric Surgery. Importance: Obesity is associated with an increased prevalence of psychiatric disorders. The association of bariatric surgery with mental health outcomes is poorly understood. Objective: To investigate the association of bariatric surgery with the incidence of outpatient, emergency department (ED), and inpatient mental health service use. Design, Setting, and Participants: This statewide, mirror-image, longitudinal cohort study used data from Western Australian Department of Health Data Linkage Branch records from all patients undergoing index (ie, first) bariatric surgery in Western Australia over a 10-year period (January 2007-December 2016), with mean (SD) follow-up periods of 10.2 (2.9) years before and 5.2 (2.9) years after index bariatric surgery. The data analysis was performed between November 2018 and March 2019. Exposures: Index bariatric surgery. Main Outcomes and Measures: The incidence and predictors for mental health presentations, deliberate self-harm, and suicide in association with the timing of bariatric surgery. Results: A total of 24\u202f766 patients underwent index bariatric surgery; of these, the mean (SD) age was 42.5 (11.7) years and 19\u202f144 (77.3%) were women. Use of at least 1 mental health service occurred in 3976 patients (16.1%), with 1401 patients (35.2%) presenting only before surgery, 1025 (25.8%) presenting before and after surgery, and 1550 patients (39.0%) presenting only after surgery. There was an increase in psychiatric illness presentations after bariatric surgery (outpatient clinic attendance: incidence rate ratio [IRR], 2.3; 95% CI, 2.3-2.4; ED attendance: IRR, 3.0; 95% CI, 2.8-3.2; psychiatric hospitalization: IRR, 3.0; 95% CI, 2.8-3.1). There was also a 5-fold increase in deliberate self-harm presentations to an ED after surgery (IRR, 4.7; 95% CI, 3.8-5.7), with 25 of 261 postoperatives deaths (9.6%) due to suicide. Complications after bariatric surgery requiring further surgical intervention and a history of mental health service provision before surgery were the most important associations with subsequent mental health presentations after surgery. Deliberate self-harm and mental and behavioral disorders due to psychoactive substance use before bariatric surgery were the main associations with subsequent deliberate self-harm or suicide after surgery. Conclusions and Relevance: We observed an increase in mental health service presentations after bariatric surgery, particularly among those who had prior psychiatric illnesses or developed surgical complications requiring further surgery. These findings caution the hypothesis that weight reduction by bariatric surgery will improve mental health in patients with obesity. ",
        "Association Between Bariatric Surgery and Long-term Health Care Expenditures Among Veterans With Severe Obesity. Importance: Bariatric surgery has been associated with improvements in health in patients with severe obesity; however, it is unclear whether these health benefits translate into lower health care expenditures. Objective: To examine 10-year health care expenditures in a large, multisite retrospective cohort study of veterans with severe obesity who did and did not undergo bariatric surgery. Design, Setting, and Participants: A total of 9954 veterans with severe obesity between January 1, 2000, and September 30, 2011, were identified from veterans affairs (VA) electronic health records. Of those, 2498 veterans who underwent bariatric surgery were allocated to the surgery cohort. Sequential stratification was used to match each patient in the surgery cohort with up to 3 patients who had not undergone bariatric surgery but were of the same sex, race/ethnicity, diabetes status, and VA regional network and were closest in age, body mass index (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared), and comorbidities. A total of 7456 patients were identified and allocated to the nonsurgery (control) cohort. The VA health care expenditures among the surgery and nonsurgery cohorts were estimated using regression models. Data were analyzed from July to August 2018 and in April 2019. Interventions: The bariatric surgical procedures (n\u2009=\u20092498) included in this study were Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (1842 [73.7%]), sleeve gastrectomy (381 [15.3%]), adjustable gastric banding (249 [10.0%]), and other procedures (26 [1.0%]). Main Outcomes and Measures: The study measured total, outpatient, inpatient, and outpatient pharmacy expenditures from 3 years before surgery to 10 years after surgery, excluding expenditures associated with the initial bariatric surgical procedure. Results: Among 9954 veterans with severe obesity, 7387 (74.2%) were men; the mean (SD) age was 52.3 (8.8) years for the surgery cohort and 52.5 (8.7) years for the nonsurgery cohort. Mean total expenditures for the surgery cohort were $5093 (95% CI, $4811-$5391) at 7 to 12 months before surgery, which increased to $7448 (95% CI, $6989-$7936) at 6 months after surgery. Postsurgical expenditures decreased to $6692 (95% CI, $6197-$7226) at 5 years after surgery, followed by a gradual increase to $8495 (95% CI, $7609-$9484) at 10 years after surgery. Total expenditures were higher in the surgery cohort than in the nonsurgery cohort during the 3 years before surgery and in the first 2 years after surgery. The expenditures of the 2 cohorts converged 5 to 10 years after surgery. Outpatient pharmacy expenditures were significantly lower among the surgery cohort in all years of follow-up ($509 lower at 3 years before surgery and $461 lower at 7 to 12 months before surgery), but these cost reductions were offset by higher inpatient and outpatient (nonpharmacy) expenditures. Conclusions and Relevance: In this cohort study of 9954 predominantly older male veterans with severe obesity, total health care expenditures increased immediately after patients underwent bariatric surgery but converged with those of patients who had not undergone surgery at 10 years after surgery. This finding suggests that the value of bariatric surgery lies primarily in its associations with improvements in health and not in its potential to decrease health care costs. ",
        "Nonmedical Prescription Opioid Use by Parents and Adolescents in the US. BACKGROUND: To date, intergenerational patterns of nonmedical prescription opioid (NMPO) use have not been examined. We investigate the association between parental and adolescent NMPO use in the United States. METHODS: Data are from 35\u2009000 parent-child dyads with an adolescent aged 12 to 17 years from the 2004-2012 nationally representative National Surveys on Drug Use and Health. Using multivariable logistic regression models, we estimated the association between self-reported parental and adolescent lifetime NMPO use, controlling for parental and adolescent use of other drugs, attitudes about drug use, parental and adolescent psychosocial risk factors, and sociodemographic characteristics. RESULTS: Controlling for other factors, parental NMPO use was associated with adolescent NMPO use (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.30; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.09-1.56). Mothers' use had a stronger association with adolescent use than fathers' use (aOR 1.62 [95% CI 1.28-2.056] versus aOR 0.98 [95% CI 0.74-1.24]). Associations between parental and adolescent NMPO use did not differ by adolescent sex or race and/or ethnicity. Parental lifetime smoking, low monitoring, and parent-adolescent conflict were uniquely associated with adolescent NMPO use (aOR 1.19-1.24) as were adolescent smoking, marijuana use, depression, delinquency, and perceived schoolmates' drug use (aOR 1.25-1.71). Perceived risk of drug use and religiosity were associated with lower rates of adolescent NMPO use (aOR 0.77-0.93). Use among older adolescents was higher than among younger adolescents (aOR 1.27; 95% CI 1.21-1.34). CONCLUSIONS: Parent-based interventions targeted at adolescent NMPO use should address parental NMPO use and smoking and promote positive parenting. ",
        "Estimates of the Percentage of US Adults With Diabetes Who Could Be Screened for Diabetic Retinopathy in Primary Care Settings. Importance: Prior studies found that screening for diabetic retinopathy (DR) in primary care settings using telemedicine increased screening rates among individuals with diabetes. This finding has led to interest in expanding the use of primary care-based screening for DR. Objective: To estimate the percentages of US adults with diabetes and high-risk US adults with diabetes who have regular contact with primary care physicians and therefore could potentially receive timely screening for DR in primary care settings. Design, Setting, and Participants: The empirical analyses used data from the cross-sectional population-based 2016 National Health Interview Survey on US adults 18 years or older with self-reported diabetes (n\u2009=\u20093229). Based on previous research, individuals who had lower income, lower educational levels, or type 2 diabetes; who were African American or Hispanic, uninsured, or not using insulin or oral medication for diabetes; or who did not have DR were defined as being at high risk of missing recommended eye examinations. Data were collected throughout 2016 and analyzed from July 17 through November 5, 2018. Main Outcomes and Measures: Outcomes were whether an individual visited a primary care physician and whether an individual missed having a dilated eye examination in the past year. Results: The survey sample included 3229 participants. Using weighted percentages of the full sample, 15.3% (95% CI, 13.8%-17.0%) had lower income, 19.7% (95% CI, 17.8%-21.6%) had lower educational levels, 15.4% (95% CI, 13.5%-17.4%) were African American, 16.0% (95% CI, 13.7%-18.6%) were Hispanic, 6.1% (95% CI, 4.9%-7.5%) were uninsured, and 50.1% (95% CI, 47.7%-52.4%) were female; the mean age was 60.1 years (95% CI, 59.4-60.8 years). In addition, 87.7% (95% CI, 85.9%-89.3%) visited a primary care physician in the past year. Of those who did not receive a dilated eye examination in the past year, 82.2% (95% CI, 78.4%-85.4%) visited a primary care physician during the year. Except for the uninsured subgroup, more than 78% of each high-risk subgroup had visited a primary care physician in the past year. Conclusions and Relevance: Screening for DR in primary care settings has the potential to provide timely screening to a large portion of US adults with diabetes because most US adults with diabetes, including those at high-risk of missing recommended eye examinations, have regular contact with primary care physicians.

        "Association of Unrecognized Obstructive Sleep Apnea With Postoperative Cardiovascular Events in Patients Undergoing Major Noncardiac Surgery. Importance: Unrecognized obstructive sleep apnea increases cardiovascular risks in the general population, but whether obstructive sleep apnea poses a similar risk in the perioperative period remains uncertain. Objectives: To determine the association between obstructive sleep apnea and 30-day risk of cardiovascular complications after major noncardiac surgery. Design, Setting, and Participants: Prospective cohort study involving adult at-risk patients without prior diagnosis of sleep apnea and undergoing major noncardiac surgery from 8 hospitals in 5 countries between January 2012 and July 2017, with follow-up until August 2017. Postoperative monitoring included nocturnal pulse oximetry and measurement of cardiac troponin concentrations. Exposures: Obstructive sleep apnea was classified as mild (respiratory event index [REI] 5-14.9 events/h), moderate (REI 15-30), and severe (REI >30), based on preoperative portable sleep monitoring. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was a composite of myocardial injury, cardiac death, heart failure, thromboembolism, atrial fibrillation, and stroke within 30 days of surgery. Proportional-hazards analysis was used to determine the association between obstructive sleep apnea and postoperative cardiovascular complications. Results: Among a total of 1364 patients recruited for the study, 1218 patients (mean age, 67 [SD, 9] years; 40.2% women) were included in the analyses. At 30 days after surgery, rates of the primary outcome were 30.1% (41/136) for patients with severe OSA, 22.1% (52/235) for patients with moderate OSA, 19.0% (86/452) for patients with mild OSA, and 14.2% (56/395) for patients with no OSA. OSA was associated with higher risk for the primary outcome (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 1.49 [95% CI, 1.19-2.01]; P\u2009=\u2009.01); however, the association was significant only among patients with severe OSA (adjusted HR, 2.23 [95% CI, 1.49-3.34]; P\u2009=\u2009.001) and not among those with moderate OSA (adjusted HR, 1.47 [95% CI, 0.98-2.09]; P\u2009=\u2009.07) or mild OSA (adjusted HR, 1.36 [95% CI, 0.97-1.91]; P\u2009=\u2009.08) (P\u2009=\u2009.01 for interaction). The mean cumulative duration of oxyhemoglobin desaturation less than 80% during the first 3 postoperative nights in patients with cardiovascular complications (23.1 [95% CI, 15.5-27.7] minutes) was longer than in those without (10.2 [95% CI, 7.8-10.9] minutes) (P\u2009<\u2009.001). No significant interaction effects on perioperative outcomes were observed with type of anesthesia, use of postoperative opioids, and supplemental oxygen therapy. Conclusions and Relevance: Among at-risk adults undergoing major noncardiac surgery, unrecognized severe obstructive sleep apnea was significantly associated with increased risk of 30-day postoperative cardiovascular complications. Further research would be needed to assess whether interventions can modify this risk. ",
        "Combustible and Electronic Tobacco and Marijuana Products in Hip-Hop Music Videos, 2013-2017. Importance: Hip-hop is the leading music genre in the United States and its fan base includes a large proportion of adolescents and young adults of all racial and ethnic groups, particularly minorities. The appearance of combustible and electronic tobacco and marijuana products, especially brand placement and use by popular and influential artists, may increase the risk of tobacco and marijuana use and decrease perceptions of harm. Objective: To assess the prevalence of the appearance and use of combustible and electronic tobacco and marijuana products, including brand placement, in leading hip-hop songs. Design, Setting, and Participants: Analysis of top 50 songs from 2013 to 2017 of Billboard magazine's weekly Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs with videos that included the appearance or use of combustible tobacco and marijuana products (manufactured cigarettes, cigars, hookah or waterpipe, pipe, hand-rolled tobacco and marijuana products, marijuana buds); appearance of exhaled smoke or vapor without an identifiable source product; appearance or use of electronic tobacco and marijuana products (eg, electronic cigarettes); tobacco or marijuana brand placement; appearance or use of combustible and electronic tobacco and marijuana by main or featured artist. Data were collected from December 6, 2017, to June 4, 2018. Main Outcomes and Measures: Prevalence of (1) appearance or use of combustible tobacco and marijuana products, (2) appearance of smoke or vapor, (3) appearance or use of electronic tobacco and marijuana products, (4) tobacco or marijuana brand placement, and (5) appearance or use of combustible and electronic tobacco and marijuana by main or featured artist. Probability of appearance or use of combustible and electronic tobacco and marijuana products by quartile of viewership of videos. Results: The proportion of leading hip-hop videos containing combustible use, electronic use, or smoke or vapor ranged from 40.2% (76 of 189) in 2015, to 50.7% (102 of 201) in 2016. For each year, the leading category of combustible use was hand-rolled products. The appearance of branded products increased from 0% in 2013 (0 of 82) to 9.9% in 2017 (10 of 101) for combustible products, and from 25.0% in 2013 (3 of 12) to 87.5% in 2017 (14 of 16) for electronic products. The prevalence of combustible or electronic product use or exhaled smoke or vapor increased by quartile of total number of views: 41.9% (8700 to 19 million views) among songs in the first quartile of viewership and 49.7% among songs in the fourth quartile of viewership (112 million to 4 billion views). Conclusions and Relevance: Combustible and electronic tobacco and marijuana use frequently occurred in popular hip-hop music videos. The genre's broad appeal, use of branded products by influential artists, and rise of electronic product and marijuana use may contribute to a growing public health concern of tobacco and marijuana use.

        "Changing Perceptions of Harm of e-Cigarette vs Cigarette Use Among Adults in 2 US National Surveys From 2012 to 2017. Importance: Debate is ongoing about whether the scientific evidence of the health risks of electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) compared with combustible cigarettes (hereinafter referred to as cigarettes) has been accurately communicated to the public. Large representative surveys are needed to examine how the public perceives the health risk of e-cigarettes and how their perceptions change over time. Objective: To examine how US adults perceived the harm of e-cigarettes relative to cigarettes and how their perception has changed from 2012 to 2017. Design, Setting, and Participants: Survey study using data from 2 multiyear cross-sectional nationally representative surveys-the Tobacco Products and Risk Perceptions Surveys (TPRPS) and the Health Information National Trends Surveys (HINTS)-to assess perceived harm of e-cigarettes relative to cigarettes among US adults in 2012, 2014, 2015, 2016, and 2017. Respondents were selected via address-based sampling or random-digit dialing and consisted of adults 18 years or older. Analyses were conducted from February through April 2018. Main Outcomes and Measures: Self-reported perceived harm of e-cigarettes relative to cigarettes. Results: The analytical samples of TPRPS consisted of 2800 adults in 2012 (cumulative response rate, 7.3%), 5668 in 2014 (cumulative response rate, 6.6%), 5372 in 2015 (cumulative response rate, 6.8%), 5245 in 2016 (cumulative response rate, 6.4%), and 5357 in 2017 (cumulative response rate, 5.8%). The analytical samples of HINTS consisted of 2609 adults in 2012 (response rate, 39.9%), 3301 in 2014 (response rate, 34.4%), 2224 in 2015 (response rate, 33.0%), and 2683 in 2017 (response rate, 32.4%). The proportion of adults who perceived e-cigarettes as less harmful than cigarettes decreased from 39.4% (95% CI, 36.9%-41.9%) in 2012 to 33.9% (95% CI, 32.7%-35.2%) in 2017 in TPRPS and decreased from 50.7% (95% CI, 48.8%-52.7%) in 2012 to 34.5% (95% CI, 32.7%-36.3%) in 2017 in HINTS. During the same period, the proportion of adults who perceived e-cigarettes to be as harmful as cigarettes increased from 11.5% (95% CI, 10.0%-13.2%) in 2012 to 36.4% (95% CI, 35.1%-37.7%) in 2017 (TPRPS) and from 46.4% (95% CI, 44.5%-48.3%) in 2012 to 55.6% (95% CI, 53.7%-57.5%) in 2017 (HINTS). Those who perceived e-cigarettes to be more harmful than cigarettes increased from 1.3% (95% CI, 0.8%-2.2%) in 2012 to 4.3% (95% CI, 3.8%-4.9%) in 2017 (TPRPS) and from 2.8% (95% CI, 2.2%-3.5%) in 2012 to 9.9% (95% CI, 8.8%-11.1%) in 2017 (HINTS). Conclusions and Relevance: In this study, the proportion of US adults who perceived e-cigarettes to be as harmful as or more harmful than cigarettes increased substantially from 2012 to 2017. The findings of this study underscore the urgent need to accurately communicate the risks of e-cigarettes to the public, which should clearly differentiate the absolute from the relative harms of e-cigarettes.

        "Type 2 diabetes in midlife and risk of cerebrovascular disease in late life: a prospective nested case-control study in a nationwide Swedish twin cohort. AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: We aimed to examine the association between midlife type 2 diabetes mellitus and cerebrovascular disease (CBD) in late life, and further to explore whether genetic and early-life familial environmental factors (such as shared childhood socioeconomic status and adolescent environment) play a role in this association. METHODS: In this prospective nested case-control study based on the Swedish Twin Registry, 33,086 twin individuals who were born in 1958 or earlier and were CBD-free before the age of 60 were included. Midlife (40-59\u00a0years) type 2 diabetes was ascertained from self-report, the National Patient Registry (NPR) and glucose-lowering medication use. CBD diagnosis (cerebral infarction, occlusion of cerebral arteries, subarachnoid haemorrhage, intracerebral haemorrhage and unspecified CBD) and onset age were identified from the NPR. Late-life CBD was defined as CBD onset age \u226560\u00a0years. Generalised estimating equation (GEE) models were used to analyse unmatched case-control data (adjusted for the clustering of twins within a pair). Conditional logistic regression was used in co-twin matched case-control analyses in CBD-discordant twin pairs. RESULTS: Of all the participants, 1248 (3.8%) had midlife type 2 diabetes and 3121 (9.4%) had CBD in late life. In GEE models adjusted for age, sex, education, BMI, smoking, alcohol consumption, marital status, hypertension and heart disease, the ORs (95% CIs) of type 2 diabetes were 1.29 (1.03, 1.61) for cerebral infarction, 2.03 (1.20, 3.44) for occlusion of cerebral arteries, 0.52 (0.12, 2.21) for subarachnoid haemorrhage and 0.78 (0.45, 1.36) for intracerebral haemorrhage. In multi-adjusted conditional logistic regression, the OR of the type 2 diabetes-cerebral infarction association was 0.96 (0.51, 1.80). The differences in ORs from the GEE and co-twin control analyses were not statistically significant (p\u2009=\u20090.780). CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Midlife type 2 diabetes is significantly associated with increased risk of cerebral infarction and occlusion of cerebral arteries, but not intracerebral haemorrhage or subarachnoid haemorrhage in late life. Genetic and early-life familial environmental factors do not appear to account for the type 2 diabetes-cerebral infarction association, but further clarification is needed. ",
        "Association of Cumulative Socioeconomic and Health-Related Disadvantage With Disparities in Smoking Prevalence in the United States, 2008 to 2017. Importance: Understanding emerging patterns of smoking disparities among disadvantaged populations can guide tobacco control policy. Objective: To estimate disparities in smoking prevalence associated with the number of socioeconomic and health-related disadvantages faced by a population among US adults from 2008 to 2017. Design, Setting, and Participants: Nationally representative cross-sectional annual household-based probability sample of US noninstitutionalized residents. Polytomous regression estimated associations of disadvantage variables, survey year, and their interaction with the following 3 pairwise contrasts: current vs never smoking (estimate of overall disparities), current vs former smoking (unique contribution of disparities in smoking cessation), and former vs never smoking (unique contribution of disparities in smoking initiation). The setting was in-home face-to-face interviews. Participants were respondents in 2008 to 2017 survey years who were aged 25 years or older (N\u2009=\u2009279 559). Exposures: Self-reported past-year unemployment, income below the federal poverty line, absence of high school diploma, disability/limitation interfering with daily functions, serious psychological distress on the Kessler 6-item screen, and at least 60 past-year heavy drinking days, each coded yes or no. These indicators were summed in a cumulative disadvantage index (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 or 6). Main Outcomes and Measures: Self-reported current, former (ever smoked \u2265100 cigarettes, had since quit, and not currently smoking), and never (<100 cigarettes) smoking. Results: Among 278 048 respondents (mean [SD] age, 51.9 [16.8] years; 55.7% female) with data on smoking history (99.5% of the sample), the mean current smoking prevalence across 2008 to 2017 compared with populations without disadvantages was successively higher among populations with 1 disadvantage (21.4% vs 13.8%; current vs never smoking adjusted odds ratio [OR], 2.34; 95% CI, 2.27-2.43), 2 disadvantages (26.6% vs 13.8%; OR, 3.55; 95% CI, 3.39-3.72), 3 disadvantages (35.1% vs 13.8%; OR, 5.35; 95% CI, 5.05-5.66), 4 disadvantages (45.7% vs 13.8%; OR, 8.59; 95% CI, 7.91-9.34), or 5 or 6 disadvantages (58.2% vs 13.8%; OR, 14.70; 95% CI, 12.30-17.50). In current vs former and former vs never smoking status contrasts, ORs were lower but also showed successively greater associations with increasing cumulative disadvantage. Current (vs never) smoking odds significantly declined each year among populations with 0 (OR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.94-0.96), 1 (OR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.95-0.97), or 2 (OR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.97-0.99) disadvantages but did not change across 2008 to 2017 among those with 3 or more disadvantages. Conclusions and Relevance: Results of this study demonstrate that US disparities in smoking prevalence from 2008 to 2017 were successively larger with each additional disadvantage faced, were expressed in higher smoking initiation odds and lower smoking cessation odds, and widened over time.

        "Mental Health Problems and Initiation of E-cigarette and Combustible Cigarette Use. BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: During adolescence, mental health problems may increase the risk of initiating combustible cigarette use. However, it is unknown if this association extends to electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes). We examined whether internalizing and externalizing problems were associated with initiation of e-cigarette, combustible cigarette, and dual-product use among adolescents. METHODS: Participants were drawn from the Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health Study, a nationally representative longitudinal study of US adolescents followed from 2013 to 2015. The study sample included 7702 adolescents aged 12 to 17 years who at baseline reported no lifetime use of tobacco products. We examined the respective associations between baseline internalizing and externalizing problems and initiating use of e-cigarettes, combustible cigarettes, or both at 1-year follow-up. RESULTS: Compared with adolescents with low externalizing problems, adolescents with high externalizing problems were significantly more likely to initiate use of e-cigarettes (adjusted relative risk ratio [aRRR] = 2.78; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.76-4.40), combustible cigarettes (aRRR = 5.59; 95% CI: 2.63-11.90), and both products (aRRR = 2.23; 95% CI: 1.15-4.31). Adolescents with high internalizing problems were at increased risk of initiating use of e-cigarettes (aRRR = 1.61; 95% CI: 1.12-2.33) but not combustible cigarettes or both products. CONCLUSIONS: Mental health problems are associated with increased risk for initiating e-cigarette, combustible cigarette, and dual-product use in adolescence. This association is more consistent for externalizing problems than internalizing problems. Addressing mental health problems could be a promising target for preventing initiation of nicotine- and/or tobacco-product use by adolescents. ",
        "Gestational diabetes associated with incident diabetes in childhood and youth: a retrospective cohort study. BACKGROUND: Indicators of childhood- and youth-onset diabetes may be useful for early detection of diabetes; there is a known association between composite exposure of parental type 2 diabetes and gestational diabetes mellitus with childhood- and youth-onset diabetes. We examined associations between gestational diabetes mellitus and incidence of childhood- and youth-onset diabetes in offspring. METHODS: Using public health insurance administrative databases from Quebec, Canada, we randomly selected singleton live births with maternal gestational diabetes mellitus (1990-2007) and matched them 1:1 with singleton live births without gestational diabetes mellitus. Follow-up was to Mar. 31, 2012. We examined associations of diabetes in offspring with maternal gestational diabetes mellitus through unadjusted and adjusted Cox proportional hazards models. In secondary analyses, we separately considered age groups ranging from birth to age 12 years, and age 12 to 22 years. RESULTS: Incidence of pediatric diabetes (per 10 000 person-years) was higher in offspring born to mothers with gestational diabetes mellitus (4.52, 95% confidence interval [CI] 4.47-4.57) than in mothers without gestational diabetes mellitus (2.4, 95% CI 2.37-2.46). In an adjusted Cox proportional hazards model, maternal gestational diabetes mellitus was associated with development of pediatric diabetes overall (birth to age 22 yr: hazard ratio [HR] 1.77, 95% CI 1.41-2.22), during childhood (birth to age 12 yr: HR 1.43, 95% CI 1.09-1.89), and in youth (age 12 to 22 yr: HR 2.53, 95% CI 1.67-3.85). INTERPRETATION: Gestational diabetes mellitus is associated with incident diabetes in offspring during childhood and adolescence. Future studies are needed to examine longer-term outcomes in patients with pediatric diabetes with a maternal history of gestational diabetes mellitus, to ascertain how they compare with other patients with childhood- or youth-onset diabetes, in terms of disease severity and outcomes.

        "Efficacy of Short-term Treatment of Internet and Computer Game Addiction: A Randomized Clinical Trial. Importance: Internet and computer game addiction represent a growing mental health concern, acknowledged by the World Health Organization. Objective: To determine whether manualized cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), using short-term treatment for internet and computer game addiction (STICA), is efficient in individuals experiencing internet and computer game addiction. Design, Setting, and Participants: A multicenter randomized clinical trial was conducted in 4 outpatient clinics in Germany and Austria from January 24, 2012, to June 14, 2017, including follow-ups. Blinded measurements were conducted. A consecutive sample of 143 men was randomized to the treatment group (STICA; n\u2009=\u200972) or wait-list control (WLC) group (n\u2009=\u200971). Main inclusion criteria were male sex and internet addiction as the primary diagnosis. The STICA group had an additional 6-month follow-up (n\u2009=\u200936). Data were analyzed from November 2018 to March 2019. Interventions: The manualized CBT program aimed to recover functional internet use. The program consisted of 15 weekly group and up to 8 two-week individual sessions. Main Outcomes and Measures: The predefined primary outcome was the Assessment of Internet and Computer Game Addiction Self-report (AICA-S). Secondary outcomes were self-reported internet addiction symptoms, time spent online on weekdays, psychosocial functioning, and depression. Results: A total of\u2009143 men (mean [SD] age, 26.2 [7.8] years) were analyzed based on intent-to-treat analyses. Of these participants, 50 of 72 men (69.4%) in the STICA group showed remission vs 17 of 71 men (23.9%) in the WLC group. In logistic regression analysis, remission in the STICA vs WLC group was higher (odds ratio, 10.10; 95% CI, 3.69-27.65), taking into account internet addiction baseline severity, comorbidity, treatment center, and age. Compared with the WLC groups, effect sizes at treatment termination of STICA were d\u2009=\u20091.19 for AICA-S, d\u2009=\u20090.88 for time spent online on weekdays, d\u2009=\u20090.64 for psychosocial functioning, and d\u2009=\u20090.67 for depression. Fourteen adverse events and 8 serious adverse events occurred. A causal relationship with treatment was considered likely in 2 AEs, one in each group. Conclusions and Relevance: Short-term treatment for internet and computer game addiction is a promising, manualized, short-term CBT for a broad range of internet addictions in multiple treatment centers. Further trials investigating the long-term efficacy of STICA and addressing specific groups and subgroups compared with active control conditions are required.

        "Nabiximols for the Treatment of Cannabis Dependence: A Randomized Clinical Trial. Importance: There are no effective medications for treating dependence on cannabis. Objective: To examine the safety and efficacy of nabiximols in the treatment of patients with cannabis dependence. Design, Setting, and Participants: This parallel double-blind randomized clinical trial comparing nabiximols with placebo in a 12-week, multisite outpatient study recruited participants from February 3, 2016, to June 14, 2017, at 4 outpatient specialist alcohol and drug treatment services in New South Wales, Australia. Participants had cannabis dependence (as defined by the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision) and were seeking treatment, were nonresponsive to prior treatment attempts, were 18 to 64 years of age, had no other substance use disorder, had no severe medical or psychiatric conditions, were not pregnant, were not mandated by a court to undergo treatment, and provided informed consent. Results for primary efficacy measures and all secondary outcomes were obtained using a modified intention-to-treat data set. Interventions: Participants received 12-week treatment involving weekly clinical reviews, structured counseling, and flexible medication doses-up to 32 sprays daily (tetrahydrocannabinol, 86.4 mg, and cannabidiol, 80 mg), dispensed weekly. Main Outcomes and Measures: Primary outcome was self-reported number of days using illicit cannabis during the 12-week period. Other outcomes included alternate cannabis use parameters (periods of abstinence, withdrawal, cravings, and problems), safety parameters (adverse events and aberrant medication use), health status, other substance use, and treatment retention. Results: A total of 128 participants (30 women and 98 men; mean [SD] age, 35.0 [10.9] years) were randomized and received at least 1 dose of study medication. Participants had used a mean (SD) of 2.3 (2.1) g of cannabis on a mean (SD) of 25.7 (4.5) days in the past 28 days. Treatment retention was comparable for the 2 groups (placebo, 30 of 67 participants [44.8%]; nabiximols, 30 of 61 participants [49.2%]), and both groups used similar mean (SD) doses (placebo, 18.5 [9.5] sprays daily; nabiximols, 17.6 [9.5] sprays daily, equivalent to a mean [SD] of 47.5 [25.7] mg of tetrahydrocannabinol and 44.0 [23.8] mg of cannabidiol). For the primary end point, the placebo group reported significantly more days using cannabis during the 12 weeks (mean [SD], 53.1 [33.0] days) than the nabiximols group (mean [SD], 35.0 [32.4] days; estimated difference, 18.6 days; 95% CI, 3.5-33.7 days; P\u2009=\u2009.02). Both groups showed comparable improvements in health status, with no substantial changes in other substance use. Medication was well tolerated with few adverse events. Conclusions and Relevance: This study demonstrates that cannabinoid agonist treatment, in this case using nabiximols, in combination with psychosocial interventions is a safe approach for reducing cannabis use among individuals with cannabis dependence who are seeking treatment.

        "Association of Psychiatric Comorbidity With the Risk of Premature Death Among Children and Adults With Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder. Importance: A previous register-based study reported elevated all-cause mortality in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), but cause-specific risks and the potential associations of psychiatric comorbidities remain unknown. Objectives: To investigate the all-cause and cause-specific mortality risks in ADHD and to explore the potential role of psychiatric comorbidities. Design, Setting, and Participants: This prospective cohort study used Swedish national registers to identify 2 675 615 individuals born in Sweden from January 1, 1983, through December 31, 2009, as the study population, among whom 86 670 individuals (3.2%) received a diagnosis of ADHD during follow-up. Follow-up was completed December 31, 2013, and data were analyzed from October 2018 through March 2019. Exposures: Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder identified by first clinical diagnosis or first prescription of ADHD medications as recorded in Swedish registers. Clinical diagnosis of psychiatric comorbidity was available in the National Patient Register. Main Outcomes and Measures: All-cause and cause-specific mortalities and hazard ratios (HRs) using Cox proportional hazards regression models. Results: In the overall cohort of 2 675 615 individuals, 1 374 790 (51.4%) were male (57 919 with an ADHD diagnosis) and 1 300 825 (48.6%) were female (28 751 with an ADHD diagnosis). Mean (SD) age at study entry was 6.4 (5.6) years. During follow-up, 424 individuals with ADHD and 6231 without ADHD died, resulting in mortality rates of 11.57 and 2.16 per 10 000 person-years, respectively. The association was stronger in adulthood (HR, 4.64; 95% CI, 4.11-5.25) compared with childhood (HR, 1.41; 95% CI, 0.97-2.04) and increased substantially with the number of psychiatric comorbidities with ADHD (HR for individuals with only ADHD, 1.41 [95% CI, 1.01-1.97]; HR for those with \u22654 comorbidities, 25.22 [95% CI, 19.60-32.46]). In adulthood, when adjusting for early-onset psychiatric comorbidity, the association between ADHD and risk of death due to natural causes was attenuated substantially and was no longer statistically significant (HR, 1.32; 95% CI, 0.94-1.85). When adjusting for later-onset psychiatric disorders, the association was attenuated to statistical nonsignificance for death due to suicide (HR, 1.13; 95% CI, 0.88-1.45) but remained statistically significant for death caused by unintentional injury (HR, 2.14; 95% CI, 1.71-2.68) or other external causes (HR, 1.75; 95% CI, 1.23-2.48). Conclusions and Relevance: Psychiatric comorbidity appears to play an important role in all-cause and cause-specific mortality risks in ADHD. In adulthood, early-onset psychiatric comorbidity contributed primarily to the association with death due to natural causes, whereas later-onset psychiatric comorbidity mainly influenced death due to unnatural causes, including suicide and unintentional injury. These findings suggest that health care professionals should closely monitor specific psychiatric comorbidities in individuals with ADHD to identify high-risk groups for prevention efforts. ",
        "Effectiveness and Acceptability of Cognitive Behavior Therapy Delivery Formats in Adults With Depression: A Network Meta-analysis. Importance: Cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) has been shown to be effective in the treatment of acute depression. However, whether CBT can be effectively delivered in individual, group, telephone-administered, guided self-help, and unguided self-help formats remains unclear. Objective: To examine the most effective delivery format for CBT via a network meta-analysis. Data Sources: A database updated yearly from PubMed, PsycINFO, Embase, and the Cochrane Library. Literature search dates encompassed January 1, 1966, to January 1, 2018. Study Selection: Randomized clinical trials of CBT for adult depression. The 5 treatment formats were compared with each other and the control conditions (waiting list, care as usual, and pill placebo). Data Extraction and Synthesis: PRISMA guidelines were used when extracting data and assessing data quality. Data were pooled using a random-effects model. Pairwise and network meta-analyses were conducted. Main Outcomes and Measures: Severity of depression and acceptability of the treatment formats. Results: A total of 155 trials with 15\u202f191 participants compared 5 CBT delivery formats with 2 control conditions. In half of the studies (78 [50.3%]), patients met the criteria for a depressive disorder; in the other half (77 [49.7%]), participants scored above the cutoff point on a self-report measure. The effectiveness of individual, group, telephone, and guided self-help CBT did not differ statistically significantly from each other. These formats were statistically significantly more effective than the waiting list (standardized mean differences [SMDs], 0.87-1.02) and care as usual (SMDs, 0.47-0.72) control conditions as well as the unguided self-help CBT (SMDs, 0.34-0.59). In terms of acceptability (dropout for any reason), individual (relative risk [RR]\u2009=\u20091.44; 95% CI, 1.09-1.89) and group (RR\u2009=\u20091.38; 95% CI, 1.06-1.80) CBT were significantly better than guided self-help. Guided self-help was also less acceptable than being on a waiting list (RR\u2009=\u20090.63; 95% CI, 0.52-0.75) and care as usual (RR\u2009=\u20090.72; 95% CI, 0.57-0.90). Sensitivity analyses supported the overall findings. Conclusions and Relevance: For acute symptoms of depression, group, telephone, and guided self-help treatment formats appeared to be effective interventions, which may be considered as alternatives to individual CBT; although there were few indications of significant differences in efficacy between treatments with human support, guided self-help CBT may be less acceptable for patients than individual, group, or telephone formats.

        "Trends in Treatment and Spending for Patients Receiving Outpatient Treatment of Depression in the United States, 1998-2015. Context: After marked increases from 1987 to 1997, trends in depression treatment in the United States increased modestly from 1998 to 2007. However, multiple policy changes that expanded insurance coverage for mental health conditions may have shifted these trends again since 2007. Objective: To examine national trends in outpatient treatment of depression from 1998 to 2015, with particular focus on 2007 to 2015. Design, Setting, and Participants: This analysis of the use of health services and spending for treatment of depression in the United States assessed data from the 1998 (n\u2009=\u200922 953), 2007 (n\u2009=\u200929 370), and 2015 (n\u2009=\u200933 893) Medical Expenditure Panel Surveys (MEPSs). Participants included respondent households to the nationally representative survey. Data were analyzed from June 15 through December 18, 2018. Main Outcomes and Measures: Rates of outpatient and pharmaceutical treatment of depression; counts of outpatient visits, psychotherapy visits, and prescriptions; and expenditures. Results: The analysis included 86\u202f216 individuals from the 1998, 2007, and 2015 MEPSs. Respondents' mean (SD) age was 37.2 (22.7) years; 45\u202f086 (52.3%) were female, 24\u202f312 (28.2%) were Hispanic, 15\u202f463 (17.9%) were black, and 62\u202f926 (72.9%) were white. Rates of outpatient treatment of depression increased from 2.36 (95% CI, 2.12-2.61) per 100 population in 1998 to 3.47 (95% CI, 3.16-3.79) per 100 population in 2015. The proportion of respondents who were treated for depression using psychotherapy decreased from 53.7% (95% CI, 48.3%-59.1%) in 1998 to 43.2% (95% CI, 39.0%-47.4%) in 2007 and then increased to 50.4% (95% CI, 46.0%-54.9%) in 2015, whereas the proportion receiving pharmacotherapy remained steady at 81.9% (95% CI, 77.9%-85.9%) in 1998, 82.4% (95% CI, 79.3%-85.4%) in 2007, and 80.8% (95% CI, 77.9%-83.7%) in 2015. After adjusting for inflation using 2015 US dollars, prescription expenditures for these individuals decreased from $848 (95% CI, $713-$984) per year in 1998 to $603 (95% CI, $484-$722) per year in 2015, whereas the mean number of prescriptions decreased from 7.64 (95% CI, 6.61-8.67) in 1998 to 7.03 (95% CI, 6.51-7.56) in 2015. National expenditures for outpatient treatment of depression increased from $12 430 000 in 1997 to $15 554 000 in 2007 and then to $17 404 000 in 2015, consistent with a slowing growth in national outpatient expenditures for depression. The percentage of this spending that came from self-pay (uninsured) individuals decreased from 32% in 1998 to 29% in 2007 and then to 20% in 2015. This decrease was largely associated with increasing Medicaid coverage, because the percentage of this spending covered was 19% in 1998, 15% in 2007, and 36% in 2015. Conclusions and Relevance: Recent policy changes that increased insurance coverage for depression may be associated with reduced uninsured burden and with modest increases in the prevalence of and overall spending for outpatient treatment of depression. The lower-than-expected rate of treatment suggests that substantial barriers remain to individuals receiving treatment for their depression. ",
        "Efficacy of Esketamine Nasal Spray Plus Oral Antidepressant Treatment for Relapse Prevention in Patients With Treatment-Resistant Depression: A Randomized Clinical Trial. Importance: Controlled studies have shown short-term efficacy of esketamine for treatment-resistant depression (TRD), but long-term effects remain to be established. Objective: To assess the efficacy of esketamine nasal spray plus an oral antidepressant compared with an oral antidepressant plus placebo nasal spray in delaying relapse of depressive symptoms in patients with TRD in stable remission after an induction and optimization course of esketamine nasal spray plus an oral antidepressant. Design, Setting, and Participants: In this phase 3, multicenter, double-blind, randomized withdrawal study conducted from October 6, 2015, to February 15, 2018, at outpatient referral centers, 705 adults with prospectively confirmed TRD were enrolled; 455 entered the optimization phase and were treated with esketamine nasal spray (56 or 84 mg) plus an oral antidepressant. After 16 weeks of esketamine treatment, 297 who achieved stable remission or stable response entered the randomized withdrawal phase. Interventions: Patients who achieved stable remission and those who achieved stable response (without remission) were randomized 1:1 to continue esketamine nasal spray or discontinue esketamine treatment and switch to placebo nasal spray, with oral antidepressant treatment continued in each group. Main Outcomes and Measures: Time to relapse was examined in patients who achieved stable remission, as assessed using a weighted combination log-rank test. Results: Among the 297 adults (mean age [SD], 46.3 [11.13] years; 197 [66.3%] female) who entered the randomized maintenance phase, 176 achieved stable remission; 24 (26.7%) in the esketamine and antidepressant group and 39 (45.3%) in the antidepressant and placebo group experienced relapse (log-rank P\u2009=\u2009.003, number needed to treat [NNT], 6). Among the 121 who achieved stable response, 16 (25.8%) in the esketamine and antidepressant group and 34 (57.6%) in the antidepressant and placebo group experienced relapse (log-rank P\u2009<\u2009.001, NNT, 4). Esketamine and antidepressant treatment decreased the risk of relapse by 51% (hazard ratio [HR], 0.49; 95% CI, 0.29-0.84) among patients who achieved stable remission and 70% (HR, 0.30; 95% CI, 0.16-0.55) among those who achieved stable response compared with antidepressant and placebo treatment. The most common adverse events reported for esketamine-treated patients after randomization were transient dysgeusia, vertigo, dissociation, somnolence, and dizziness (incidence, 20.4%-27.0%), each reported in fewer patients (<7%) treated with an antidepressant and placebo. Conclusions and Relevance: For patients with TRD who experienced remission or response after esketamine treatment, continuation of esketamine nasal spray in addition to oral antidepressant treatment resulted in clinically meaningful superiority in delaying relapse compared with antidepressant plus placebo.

        "Association of Screen Time and Depression in Adolescence. Importance: Increases in screen time have been found to be associated with increases in depressive symptoms. However, longitudinal studies are lacking. Objective: To repeatedly measure the association between screen time and depression to test 3 explanatory hypotheses: displacement, upward social comparison, and reinforcing spirals. Design, Setting, and Participants: This secondary analysis used data from a randomized clinical trial assessing the 4-year efficacy of a personality-targeted drug and alcohol prevention intervention. This study assessed screen time and depression throughout 4 years, using an annual survey in a sample of adolescents who entered the seventh grade in 31 schools in the Greater Montreal area. Data were collected from September 2012 to September 2018. Analysis began and ended in December 2018. Main Outcomes and Measures: Independent variables were social media, television, video gaming, and computer use. Symptoms of depression was the outcome, measured using the Brief Symptoms Inventory. Exercise and self-esteem were assessed to test displacement and upward social comparison hypothesis. Results: A total of 3826 adolescents (1798 girls [47%]; mean [SD] age, 12.7 [0.5] years) were included. In general, depression symptoms increased yearly (year 1 mean [SD], 4.29 [5.10] points; year 4 mean [SD], 5.45 [5.93] points). Multilevel models, which included random intercepts at the school and individual level estimated between-person and within-person associations between screen time and depression. Significant between-person associations showed that for every increased hour spent using social media, adolescents showed a 0.64-unit increase in depressive symptoms (95% CI, 0.32-0.51). Similar between-level associations were reported for computer use (0.69; 95% CI, 0.47-0.91). Significant within-person associations revealed that a further 1-hour increase in social media use in a given year was associated with a further 0.41-unit increase in depressive symptoms in that same year. A similar within-person association was found for television (0.18; 95% CI, 0.09-0.27). Significant between-person and within-person associations between screen time and exercise and self-esteem supported upward social comparison and not displacement hypothesis. Furthermore, a significant interaction between the between-person and within-person associations concerning social media and self-esteem supported reinforcing spirals hypothesis. Conclusions and Relevance: Time-varying associations between social media, television, and depression were found, which appeared to be more explained by upward social comparison and reinforcing spirals hypotheses than by the displacement hypothesis. Both screen time modes should be taken into account when developing preventive measures and when advising parents. ",
        "Natural history of prediabetes in older adults from a population-based longitudinal study. BACKGROUND: The natural history of prediabetes in older adults remains unknown. OBJECTIVES: To assess the rate at which prediabetes progresses to diabetes, leads to death or reverts to normoglycaemia in older adults and to identify prognostic factors related to different outcomes of prediabetes. METHODS: In the Swedish National Study on Aging and Care-Kungsholmen, 2575 diabetes-free participants aged \u226560\u00a0years were examined at baseline and followed for up to 12\u00a0years. At each wave, diabetes was diagnosed via medical examination, antidiabetic drug use, medical records or glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) \u22656.5%. Prediabetes was defined as HbA1c \u22655.7% and normoglycaemia as HbA1c <5.7% in diabetes-free participants. Data were analysed with multinomial logistic regression. RESULTS: At baseline, 918 (36%) individuals had prediabetes. Of them, 204 (22%) reverted to normoglycaemia (3.4/100 person-years, 95% CI 5.6-12.3), 119 (13%) developed diabetes (2.0/100 person-years, 95% CI 1.7-2.4) and 215 (23%) died (13.0/100 person-years, 95% CI 11.4-14.9) during the 12-year follow-up. The rates of reversion, progression and mortality were higher in the first 6-year than in the second 6-year follow-up, albeit not statistically significant. Lower systolic blood pressure (SBP), absence of heart diseases and weight loss promoted the reversion from prediabetes to normoglycaemia, whilst obesity accelerated its progression to diabetes. CONCLUSIONS: During a 12-year follow-up, most of older adults with prediabetes remained stable or reverted to normoglycaemia, whereas only one-third developed diabetes or died. Lower SBP, no heart diseases and weight management may promote reversion to normoglycaemia, suggesting possible strategies for achieving normoglycaemia in older adults with prediabetes. ",
        "Effect of Continuing Olanzapine vs Placebo on Relapse Among Patients With Psychotic Depression in Remission: The STOP-PD II Randomized Clinical Trial. Importance: Psychotic depression is a severely disabling and potentially lethal disorder. Little is known about the efficacy and tolerability of continuing antipsychotic medication for patients with psychotic depression in remission. Objective: To determine the clinical effects of continuing antipsychotic medication once an episode of psychotic depression has responded to combination treatment with an antidepressant and antipsychotic agent. Design, Setting, and Participants: Thirty-six week randomized clinical trial conducted at 4 academic medical centers. Patients aged 18 years or older had an episode of psychotic depression acutely treated with sertraline plus olanzapine for up to 12 weeks and met criteria for remission of psychosis and remission or near-remission of depressive symptoms for 8 weeks before entering the clinical trial. The study was conducted from November 2011 to June 2017, and the final date of follow-up was June 13, 2017. Interventions: Participants were randomized either to continue olanzapine (n\u2009=\u200964) or switch from olanzapine to placebo (n\u2009=\u200962). All participants continued sertraline. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was risk of relapse. Main secondary outcomes were change in weight, waist circumference, lipids, serum glucose, and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c). Results: Among 126 participants who were randomized (mean [SD] age, 55.3 years [14.9 years]; 78 women [61.9%]), 114 (90.5%) completed the trial. At the time of randomization, the median dosage of sertraline was 150 mg/d (interquartile range [IQR], 150-200 mg/d) and the median dosage of olanzapine was 15 mg/d (IQR, 10-20 mg/d). Thirteen participants (20.3%) randomized to olanzapine and 34 (54.8%) to placebo experienced a relapse (hazard ratio, 0.25; 95% CI, 0.13 to 0.48; P\u2009<\u2009.001). The effect of olanzapine on the daily rate of anthropometric and metabolic measures significantly differed from placebo for weight (0.13 lb; 95% CI, 0.11 to 0.15), waist circumference (0.009 inches; 95% CI, 0.004 to 0.014), and total cholesterol (0.29 mg/dL; 95% CI, 0.13 to 0.45) but was not significantly different for low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (0.04 mg/dL; 95% CI, -0.01 to 0.10), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (-0.01 mg/dL; 95% CI, -0.03 to 0.01), triglyceride (-0.153 mg/dL; 95% CI, -0.306 to 0.004), glucose (-0.02 mg/dL; 95% CI, -0.12 to 0.08), or HbA1c levels (-0.0002 mg/dL; 95% CI, -0.0021 to 0.0016). Conclusions and Relevance: Among patients with psychotic depression in remission, continuing sertraline plus olanzapine compared with sertraline plus placebo reduced the risk of relapse over 36 weeks. This benefit needs to be balanced against potential adverse effects of olanzapine, including weight gain. Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01427608. ",
        "The Cost-Effectiveness of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy Versus Second-Generation Antidepressants for Initial Treatment of Major Depressive Disorder in the United States: A Decision Analytic Model. Background: Most guidelines for major depressive disorder recommend initial treatment with either a second-generation antidepressant (SGA) or cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). Although most trials suggest that these treatments have similar efficacy, their health economic implications are uncertain. Objective: To quantify the cost-effectiveness of CBT versus SGA for initial treatment of depression. Design: Decision analytic model. Data Sources: Relative effectiveness data from a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials; additional clinical and economic data from other publications. Target Population: Adults with newly diagnosed major depressive disorder in the United States. Time Horizon: 1 to 5 years. Perspectives: Health care sector and societal. Intervention: Initial treatment with either an SGA or group and individual CBT. Outcome Measures: Costs in 2014 U.S. dollars, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. Results of Base-Case Analysis: In model projections, CBT produced higher QALYs (3 days more at 1 year and 20 days more at 5 years) with higher costs at 1 year (health care sector, $900; societal, $1500) but lower costs at 5 years (health care sector, -$1800; societal, -$2500). Results of Sensitivity Analysis: In probabilistic sensitivity analyses, SGA had a 64% to 77% likelihood of having an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $100\u00a0000 or less per QALY at 1 year; CBT had a 73% to 77% likelihood at 5 years. Uncertainty in the relative risk for relapse of depression contributed the most to overall uncertainty in the optimal treatment. Limitation: Long-term trials comparing CBT and SGA are lacking. Conclusion: Neither SGAs nor CBT provides consistently superior cost-effectiveness relative to the other. Given many patients' preference for psychotherapy over pharmacotherapy, increasing patient access to CBT may be warranted.

        "Association Between Physician Depressive Symptoms and Medical Errors: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis. Importance: Depression is highly prevalent among physicians and has been associated with increased risk of medical errors. However, questions regarding the magnitude and temporal direction of these associations remain open in recent literature. Objective: To provide summary relative risk (RR) estimates for the associations between physician depressive symptoms and medical errors. Data Sources: A systematic search of Embase, ERIC, PubMed, PsycINFO, Scopus, and Web of Science was performed from database inception to December 31, 2018. Study Selection: Peer-reviewed empirical studies that reported on a valid measure of physician depressive symptoms associated with perceived or observed medical errors were included. No language restrictions were applied. Data Extraction and Synthesis: Study characteristics and RR estimates were extracted from each article. Estimates were pooled using random-effects meta-analysis. Differences by study-level characteristics were estimated using subgroup meta-analysis and metaregression. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guideline was followed. Main Outcomes and Measures: Relative risk estimates for the associations between physician depressive symptoms and medical errors. Results: In total, 11 studies involving 21\u202f517 physicians were included. Data were extracted from 7 longitudinal studies (64%; with 5595 individuals) and 4 cross-sectional studies (36%; with 15\u202f922 individuals). The overall RR for medical errors among physicians with a positive screening for depression was 1.95 (95% CI, 1.63-2.33), with high heterogeneity across the studies (\u03c72\u2009=\u200949.91; P\u2009<\u2009.001; I2\u2009=\u200982%; \u03c42\u2009=\u20090.06). Among the variables assessed, study design explained the most heterogeneity across studies, with lower RR estimates associated with medical errors in longitudinal studies (RR,\u20091.62; 95% CI, 1.43-1.84; \u03c72\u2009=\u20095.77; P\u2009=\u2009.33; I2\u2009=\u200913%; \u03c42\u2009<\u20090.01) and higher RR estimates in cross-sectional studies (RR,\u20092.51; 95% CI, 2.20-2.83; \u03c72\u2009=\u20095.44; P\u2009=\u2009.14; I2\u2009=\u200945%; \u03c42\u2009<\u20090.01). Similar to the results for the meta-analysis of physician depressive symptoms associated with subsequent medical errors, the meta-analysis of 4 longitudinal studies (involving 4462 individuals) found that medical errors associated with subsequent depressive symptoms had a pooled RR of 1.67 (95% CI, 1.48-1.87; \u03c72\u2009=\u20091.85; P\u2009=\u2009.60; I2\u2009=\u20090%; \u03c42\u2009=\u20090), suggesting that the association between physician depressive symptoms and medical errors is bidirectional. Conclusions and Relevance: Results of this study suggest that physicians with a positive screening for depressive symptoms are at higher risk for medical errors. Further research is needed to evaluate whether interventions to reduce physician depressive symptoms could play a role in mitigating medical errors and thus improving physician well-being and patient care.

        "Anxiety disorders predict fasting to control weight: A longitudinal large cohort study of adolescents. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether anxiety disorders are prospectively associated with fasting for weight-loss/to avoid weight-gain, a behaviour that precedes and is typical of anorexia nervosa (AN), during adolescence. METHOD: Participants were 2,406 female adolescents of the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children. Anxiety disorders were assessed when participants were aged 13-14 and 15-16; fasting was measured approximately 2\u2009years after each anxiety assessment. Generalised estimating equation models examined whether anxiety disorders predicted later fasting, across the two longitudinal waves of data. To probe the moderating effect of time, data were stratified by wave and binary logistic regression analyses completed. RESULTS: Across longitudinal waves, anxiety disorder presence predicted increased risk of later fasting. Evidence from wave-stratified analyses supported a positive association between anxiety disorder presence at wave 15-16 and fasting at wave 17-18, however did not indicate an association between anxiety disorders at wave 13-14 and fasting at wave 15-16. DISCUSSION: Anxiety disorder presence in mid-late, but not early, adolescence predicted increased likelihood of later fasting. The differential association could be explained by anxiety being parent-reported at wave 13-14. Findings highlight anxiety disorder pathology as a possible eating disorder prevention target, though the nature of association observed requires clarification. ",
        "Prediction Models of Functional Outcomes for Individuals in the Clinical High-Risk State for Psychosis or With Recent-Onset Depression: A Multimodal, Multisite Machine Learning Analysis. Importance: Social and occupational impairments contribute to the burden of psychosis and depression. There is a need for risk stratification tools to inform personalized functional-disability preventive strategies for individuals in at-risk and early phases of these illnesses. Objective: To determine whether predictors associated with social and role functioning can be identified in patients in clinical high-risk (CHR) states for psychosis or with recent-onset depression (ROD) using clinical, imaging-based, and combined machine learning; assess the geographic, transdiagnostic, and prognostic generalizability of machine learning and compare it with human prognostication; and explore sequential prognosis encompassing clinical and combined machine learning. Design, Setting, and Participants: This multisite naturalistic study followed up patients in CHR states, with ROD, and with recent-onset psychosis, and healthy control participants for 18 months in 7 academic early-recognition services in 5 European countries. Participants were recruited between February 2014 and May 2016, and data were analyzed from April 2017 to January 2018. ain Outcomes and Measures: Performance and generalizability of prognostic models. Results: A total of 116 individuals in CHR states (mean [SD] age, 24.0 [5.1] years; 58 [50.0%] female) and 120 patients with ROD (mean [SD] age, 26.1 [6.1] years; 65 [54.2%] female) were followed up for a mean (SD) of 329 (142) days. Machine learning predicted the 1-year social-functioning outcomes with a balanced accuracy of 76.9% of patients in CHR states and 66.2% of patients with ROD using clinical baseline data. Balanced accuracy in models using structural neuroimaging was 76.2% in patients in CHR states and 65.0% in patients with ROD, and in combined models, it was 82.7% for CHR states and 70.3% for ROD. Lower functioning before study entry was a transdiagnostic predictor. Medial prefrontal and temporo-parieto-occipital gray matter volume (GMV) reductions and cerebellar and dorsolateral prefrontal GMV increments had predictive value in the CHR group; reduced mediotemporal and increased prefrontal-perisylvian GMV had predictive value in patients with ROD. Poor prognoses were associated with increased risk of psychotic, depressive, and anxiety disorders at follow-up in patients in the CHR state but not ones with ROD. Machine learning outperformed expert prognostication. Adding neuroimaging machine learning to clinical machine learning provided a 1.9-fold increase of prognostic certainty in uncertain cases of patients in CHR states, and a 10.5-fold increase of prognostic certainty for patients with ROD. Conclusions and Relevance: Precision medicine tools could augment effective therapeutic strategies aiming at the prevention of social functioning impairments in patients with CHR states or with ROD.

        "Association of Sexual Harassment and Sexual Assault With Midlife Women's Mental and Physical Health. Importance: Sexual harassment and sexual assault are prevalent experiences among women. However, their association with health indices is less well understood. Objective: To investigate the association of history of sexual harassment and sexual assault with blood pressure, mood, anxiety, and sleep among midlife women. Design, Setting, and Participants: Nonsmoking women without cardiovascular disease were recruited from the community to undergo physical measurements (blood pressure, height, weight), medical history, and questionnaire psychosocial assessments (workplace sexual harassment, sexual assault, depression, anxiety, sleep). Exposures: Sexual harassment and sexual assault. Main Outcomes and Measures: Blood pressure, depressive symptoms, anxiety, and sleep characteristics. Results: Among the 304 nonsmoking women aged 40 to 60 years who participated in the study, all were free of clinical cardiovascular disease, and the mean (SD) age was 54.05 (3.99) years. A total of 19% reported a history of workplace sexual harassment (n\u2009=\u200958), and 22% reported a history of sexual assault (n\u2009=\u200967). Sexual harassment was related to significantly greater odds of stage 1 or 2 hypertension among women not taking antihypertensives (odds ratio [OR], 2.36; 95% CI, 1.10-5.06; P\u2009=\u2009.03) as well as clinically poor sleep (OR, 1.89; 95% CI, 1.05-3.42; P\u2009=\u2009.03), after adjusting for covariates. Sexual assault was associated with significantly greater odds of clinically elevated depressive symptoms (OR, 2.86; 95% CI, 1.42-5.77; multivariable P\u2009=\u2009.003), clinically relevant anxiety (OR, 2.26; 95% CI, 1.26-4.06; P\u2009=\u2009.006), and clinically poor sleep (OR, 2.15; 95% CI, 1.23-3.77; multivariable P\u2009=\u2009.007), after adjusting for covariates. Conclusions and Relevance: Sexual harassment and sexual assault are prevalent experiences among midlife women. Sexual harassment was associated with higher blood pressure and poorer sleep. Sexual assault was associated with poorer mental health and sleep. Efforts to improve women's health should target sexual harassment and assault prevention. ",
        "Genetic Predisposition vs Individual-Specific Processes in the Association Between Psychotic-like Experiences and Cannabis Use. Importance: Previous research indicates that cannabis use is associated with psychotic-like experiences (PLEs). However, it is unclear whether this association results from predispositional (ie, shared genetic) factors or individual-specific factors (eg, causal processes, such as cannabis use leading to PLEs). Objectives: To estimate genetic and environmental correlations between cannabis use and PLEs, and to examine PLEs in twin and nontwin sibling pairs discordant for exposure to cannabis use to disentangle predispositional from individual-specific effects. Design, Setting, and Participants: In this cross-sectional analysis, diagnostic interviews and self-reported data were collected from 2 separate population-based samples of twin and nontwin sibling pairs. Data from the Human Connectome Project were collected between August 10, 2012, and September 29, 2015, and data from the Australian Twin Registry Cohort 3 (ATR3) were collected between August 1, 2005, and August 31, 2010. Data were analyzed between August 17, 2017, and July 6, 2018. The study included data from 1188 Human Connectome Project participants and 3486 ATR3 participants, totaling 4674 participants. Main Outcomes and Measures: Three cannabis-involvement variables were examined: frequent use (ie, \u2265100 times), a DSM-IV lifetime cannabis use disorder diagnosis, and current cannabis use. Genetic and environmental correlations between cannabis involvement and PLEs were estimated. Generalized linear mixed models examined PLE differences in twin and nontwin sibling pairs discordant for cannabis use. Results: Among the 4674 participants, the mean (SD) age was 30.5 (3.2) years, and 2923 (62.5%) were female. Data on race/ethnicity were not included as a covariate owing to lack of variability within the ATR3 sample; among the 1188 participants in the Human Connectome Project, 875 (73.7%) were white. Psychotic-like experiences were associated with frequent cannabis use (\u03b2\u2009=\u20090.11; 95% CI, 0.08-0.14), cannabis use disorder (\u03b2\u2009=\u20090.13; 95% CI, 0.09-0.16), and current cannabis use (\u03b2\u2009=\u20090.07; 95% CI, 0.04-0.10) even after adjustment for covariates. Correlated genetic factors explained between 69.2% and 84.1% of this observed association. Within discordant pairs of twins/siblings (Npairs, 308-324), Psychotic-like experiences were more common in cannabis-exposed individuals compared with their relative who used cannabis to a lesser degree (\u03b2\u2009\u2265\u2009.23, P\u2009<\u2009.05; eg, frequent and infrequent cannabis-using relatives significantly differed, z\u2009=\u2009-5.41; P\u2009<\u2009.001). Conclusions and Relevance: Despite the strong contribution of shared genetic factors, frequent and problem cannabis use also appears to be associated with PLEs via person-specific pathways. This study's findings suggest that policy discussions surrounding legalization should consider the influence of escalations in cannabis use on traitlike indices of vulnerability, such as PLEs, which could contribute to pervasive psychological and interpersonal burden.

        "Association of Hydroxylmethyl Glutaryl Coenzyme A Reductase Inhibitors, L-Type Calcium Channel Antagonists, and Biguanides With Rates of Psychiatric Hospitalization and Self-Harm in Individuals With Serious Mental Illness. Importance: Drug repurposing is potentially cost-effective, low risk, and necessary in psychiatric drug development. The availability of large, routine data sets provides the opportunity to evaluate the potential for currently used medication to benefit people with serious mental illness (SMI). Objective: To determine whether hydroxylmethyl glutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (HMG-CoA RIs), L-type calcium channel (LTCC) antagonists, and biguanides are associated with reduced psychiatric hospitalization and self-harm in individuals with SMI. Design, Setting, and Participants: These within-individual cohort studies of patients with SMI compared rates of psychiatric hospitalization and self-harm during periods of exposure and nonexposure to the study drugs, with adjusting for a number of time-varying covariates. Participants included 142\u202f691 individuals from the entire population of Sweden with a diagnosis of bipolar disorder (BPD), schizophrenia, or nonaffective psychosis (NAP) who were 15 years or older and who were treated with psychiatric medication from October 1, 2005, through December 31, 2016. Data were analyzed from April 1 through August 31, 2018. Interventions: Treatment with HMG-CoA RIs, LTCC antagonists, or biguanides. Main Outcomes and Measures: Psychiatric hospitalizations and self-harm admissions. Results: Among the 142\u202f691 eligible participants, the HMG-CoA RI exposure periods were associated with reduced rates of psychiatric hospitalization in BPD (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 0.86; 95% CI, 0.83-0.89; P\u2009<\u2009.001), schizophrenia (aHR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.71-0.79; P\u2009<\u2009.001), and NAP (aHR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.75-0.85; P\u2009<\u2009.001) and reduced self-harm rates in BPD (aHR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.66-0.86; P\u2009<\u2009.001) and schizophrenia (aHR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.45-0.74; P\u2009<\u2009.001). Exposure to LTCC antagonists was associated with reduced rates of psychiatric hospitalization and self-harm in subgroups with BPD (aHRs, 0.92 [95% CI, 0.88-0.96; P\u2009<\u2009.001] and 0.81 [95% CI, 0.68-0.95; P\u2009=\u2009.01], respectively), schizophrenia (aHRs, 0.80 [95% CI, 0.74-0.85; P\u2009<\u2009.001] and 0.30 [95% CI, 0.18-0.48; P\u2009<\u2009.001], respectively), and NAP (aHRs, 0.89 [95% CI, 0.83-0.96; P\u2009=\u2009.002] and 0.56 [95% CI, 0.42-0.74; P\u2009<\u2009.001], respectively). During biguanide exposure, psychiatric hospitalization rates were reduced in subgroups with BPD (aHR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.77-0.84; P\u2009<\u2009.001), schizophrenia (aHR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.69-0.77; P\u2009<\u2009.001), and NAP (aHR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.79-0.92; P\u2009<\u2009.001), and self-harm was reduced in BPD (aHR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.62-0.84; P\u2009<\u2009.001) and schizophrenia (aHR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.48-0.85; P\u2009<\u2009.001). Conclusions and Relevance: This study provides additional evidence that exposure to HMG-CoA RIs, LTCC antagonists, and biguanides might lead to improved outcomes for individuals with SMI. Given the well-known adverse event profiles of these agents, they should be further investigated as repurposed agents for psychiatric symptoms. ",
        "Exploring Comorbidity Within Mental Disorders Among a Danish National Population. Importance: Individuals with mental disorders often develop comorbidity over time. Past studies of comorbidity have often restricted analyses to a subset of disorders and few studies have provided absolute risks of later comorbidity. Objectives: To undertake a comprehensive study of comorbidity within mental disorders, by providing temporally ordered age- and sex-specific pairwise estimates between the major groups of mental disorders, and to develop an interactive website to visualize all results and guide future research and clinical practice. Design, Setting, and Participants: This population-based cohort study included all individuals born in Denmark between January 1, 1900, and December 31, 2015, and living in the country between January 1, 2000, and December 31, 2016. The analyses were conducted between June 2017 and May 2018. Main Outcomes and Measures: Danish health registers were used to identify mental disorders, which were examined within the broad 10-level International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 10th Revision, subchapter groups (eg, codes F00-F09 and F10-F19). For each temporally ordered pair of disorders, overall and lagged hazard ratios and 95% CIs were calculated using Cox proportional hazards regression models. Absolute risks were estimated using competing risks survival analyses. Estimates for each sex were generated. Results: A total of 5\u202f940\u202f778 persons were included in this study (2\u202f958\u202f293 men and 2\u202f982\u202f485 women; mean [SD] age at beginning of follow-up, 32.1 [25.4] years). They were followed up for 83.9 million person-years. All mental disorders were associated with an increased risk of all other mental disorders when adjusting for sex, age, and calendar time (hazard ratios ranging from 2.0 [95% CI, 1.7-2.4] for prior intellectual disabilities and later eating disorders to 48.6 [95% CI, 46.6-50.7] for prior developmental disorders and later intellectual disabilities). The hazard ratios were temporally patterned, with higher estimates during the first year after the onset of the first disorder, but with persistently elevated rates during the entire observation period. Some disorders were associated with substantial absolute risks of developing specific later disorders (eg, 30.6% [95% CI, 29.3%-32.0%] of men and 38.4% [95% CI, 37.5%-39.4%] of women with a diagnosis of mood disorders before age 20 years developed neurotic disorders within the following 5 years). Conclusions and Relevance: Comorbidity within mental disorders is pervasive, and the risk persists over time. This study provides disorder-, sex-, and age-specific relative and absolute risks of the comorbidity of mental disorders. Web-based interactive data visualization tools are provided for clinical utility. ",
        "Association of Childhood Lead Exposure With Adult Personality Traits and Lifelong Mental Health. Importance: Millions of adults now entering middle age were exposed to high levels of lead, a developmental neurotoxin, as children. Although childhood lead exposure has been linked to disrupted behavioral development, the long-term consequences for adult mental and behavioral health have not been fully characterized. Objective: To examine whether childhood lead exposure is associated with greater psychopathology across the life course and difficult adult personality traits. Design, Setting, and Participants: This prospective cohort study was based on a population-representative birth cohort of individuals born between April 1, 1972, and March 31, 1973, in Dunedin, New Zealand, the Dunedin Multidisciplinary Health and Development Study. Members were followed up in December 2012 when they were 38 years of age. Data analysis was performed from March 14, 2018, to October 24, 2018. Exposures: Childhood lead exposure ascertained as blood lead levels measured at 11 years of age. Blood lead levels were unrelated to family socioeconomic status. Main Outcomes and Measures: Primary outcomes were adult mental health disorder symptoms assessed through clinical interview at 18, 21, 26, 32, and 38 years of age and transformed through confirmatory factor analysis into continuous measures of general psychopathology and internalizing, externalizing, and thought disorder symptoms (all standardized to a mean [SD] of 100 [15]) and adult personality assessed through informant report using the Big Five Personality Inventory (assessing neuroticism, extraversion, openness to experience, agreeableness, and conscientiousness) at 26, 32, and 38 years of age (all scores standardized to a mean [SD] of 0 [1]). Hypotheses were formulated after data collection; an analysis plan was posted in advance. Results: Of 1037 original study members, 579 (55.8%) were tested for lead exposure at 11 years of age (311 [53.7%] male). The mean (SD) blood lead level was 11.08 (4.96) \u03bcg/dL. After adjusting for study covariates, each 5-\u03bcg/dL increase in childhood blood lead level was associated with a 1.34-point increase (95% CI, 0.11-2.57; P\u2009=\u2009.03) in general psychopathology, driven by internalizing (b\u2009=\u20091.41; 95% CI, 0.19-2.62; P\u2009=\u2009.02) and thought disorder (b\u2009=\u20091.30; 95% CI, 0.06-2.54; P\u2009=\u2009.04) symptoms. Each 5-\u03bcg/dL increase in childhood blood lead level was also associated with a 0.10-SD increase in neuroticism (95% CI, 0.02-0.08; P\u2009=\u2009.02), a 0.09-SD decrease in agreeableness (95% CI, -0.18 to -0.01; P\u2009=\u2009.03), and a 0.14-SD decrease in conscientiousness (95% CI, -0.25 to -0.03; P\u2009=\u2009.01). There were no statistically significant associations with informant-rated extraversion (b\u2009=\u2009-0.09; 95% CI, -0.17 to 0.004; P\u2009=\u2009.06) and openness to experience (b\u2009=\u2009-0.07; 95% CI, -0.17 to 0.03; P\u2009=\u2009.15). Conclusions and Relevance: In this multidecade, longitudinal study of lead-exposed children, higher childhood blood lead level was associated with greater psychopathology across the life course and difficult adult personality traits. Childhood lead exposure may have long-term consequences for adult mental health and personality. ",
        "Sleep-related symptoms of midlife women with and without type 2 diabetes mellitus. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to determine the associations between type 2 diabetes mellitus and sleep-related symptoms among midlife women from four major racial/ethnic groups in the United States. METHODS: The data from 164 participants of two larger Internet survey studies (62 women diagnosed with type 2 diabetes and 102 women without diabetes) were included. In the original studies, multiple instruments including the questions on background characteristics, health status, and menopause status and the Sleep Index for Midlife Women were used. The data were analyzed using \u03c7 tests, independent t tests, Mann-Whitney U tests, and hierarchical multiple regression analyses. RESULTS: The mean total number of sleep-related symptoms was significantly higher in those with type 2 diabetes (9.95\u200a\u00b1\u200a5.83) than those without diabetes (7.25\u200a\u00b1\u200a6.08) (t\u200a=\u200a2.81, P\u200a=\u200a0.006). The mean total severity score of sleep-related symptoms was also significantly higher in those with type 2 diabetes (33.42\u200a\u00b1\u200a22.41) than those without diabetes (21.87\u200a\u00b1\u200a21.40) (t\u200a=\u200a3.29, P\u200a=\u200a0.001). Among postmenopausal women and Asian women, there were significant differences in total numbers and total severity scores between those with type 2 diabetes and those without diabetes (all P\u200a<\u200a0.05). When background characteristics, health status, and menopause status were controlled, having a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes was positively associated with total numbers (\u03b2=0.143, P\u200a=\u200a0.047) and total severity scores (\u03b2=0.176, P\u200a=\u200a0.014) of sleep-related symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: This secondary analysis supported significant associations of type 2 diabetes to sleep-related symptoms of midlife women from four major racial/ethnic groups in the United States. ",
        "Association of Fetal Growth With General and Specific Mental Health Conditions. Importance: It is unclear if the associations between fetal growth and later mental health conditions remain after controlling for familial factors and psychiatric comorbidity. Objective: To examine the associations between fetal growth and general and specific mental health conditions, controlling for familial factors. Design, Setting, and Participants: This register-based study conducted in Sweden analyzed 546 894 pairs of full siblings born between January 1, 1973, and December 31, 1998. Sibling pairs were followed up through December 31, 2013. First, population-based and within-sibling pair associations (which controlled for time-invariant familial confounders) between fetal growth and the outcomes were estimated. Second, exploratory factor analysis was applied to the outcomes to derive 1 general factor and 4 specific and independent factors. Third, the general and specific factors were regressed on fetal growth. Statistical analysis was performed from March 27, 2017, to October 27, 2018. Main Outcome and Measures: The outcomes were 11 psychiatric diagnoses (depression, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, bipolar disorder, alcohol abuse, drug use, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, autism, schizophrenia, and schizoaffective disorder) and court convictions of violent crimes. Birth weight (in kilograms) statistically adjusted for gestational age was the exposure. Results: The mean (SD) age of the 1\u202f093\u202f788 participants was 27.2 (6.8) years (range, 15.1-40.9 years) and 51.5% were male. Nine outcomes were significantly associated with birth weight in the population at large: depression (odds ratio [OR], 0.96; 95% CI, 0.95-0.98), anxiety (OR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.92-0.95), posttraumatic stress disorder (OR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.89-0.93), bipolar disorder (OR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.89-1.00), alcohol abuse (OR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.87-0.91), drug use (OR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.80-0.85), violent crimes (OR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.83-0.86), attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (OR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.86-0.90), and autism (OR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.92-0.97). Only depression (OR, 0.95; 95% CI 0.92-0.98), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.87-0.99), attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (OR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.82-0.89), and autism (OR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.69-0.76) remained significantly associated within sibling pairs. An exploratory factor analysis indicated that 1 general and 4 specific factors (capturing anxiety, externalizing, neurodevelopmental, and psychotic conditions) fit the outcomes well. Across almost all sensitivity analyses, an increase in birth weight by 1 kg significantly reduced the general (\u03b2, -0.047; 95% CI, -0.071 to -0.023) and the specific neurodevelopmental factors (\u03b2, -0.159; 95% CI, -0.190 to -0.128) within sibling pairs. Conclusions and Relevance: Controlling for familial confounders, reduced fetal growth was associated with a small but significant increase in the general factor of psychopathology and a moderate increase in a specific neurodevelopmental factor.

        "Association Between Recalled Exposure to Gender Identity Conversion Efforts and Psychological Distress and Suicide Attempts Among Transgender Adults. Importance: Gender identity conversion efforts (GICE) have been widely debated as potentially damaging treatment approaches for transgender persons. The association of GICE with mental health outcomes, however, remains largely unknown. Objective: To evaluate associations between recalled exposure to GICE (by a secular or religious professional) and adult mental health outcomes. Design, Setting, and Participants: In this cross-sectional study, a survey was distributed through community-based outreach to transgender adults residing in the United States, with representation from all 50 states, the District of Columbia, American Samoa, Guam, Puerto Rico, and US military bases overseas. Data collection occurred during 34 days between August 19 and September 21, 2015. Data analysis was performed from June 8, 2018, to January 2, 2019. Exposure: Recalled exposure to GICE. Main Outcomes and Measures: Severe psychological distress during the previous month, measured by the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (defined as a score \u226513). Measures of suicidality during the previous year and lifetime, including ideation, attempts, and attempts requiring inpatient hospitalization. Results: Of 27\u202f715 transgender survey respondents (mean [SD] age, 31.2 [13.5] years), 11\u202f857 (42.8%) were assigned male sex at birth. Among the 19\u202f741 (71.3%) who had ever spoken to a professional about their gender identity, 3869 (19.6%; 95% CI, 18.7%-20.5%) reported exposure to GICE in their lifetime. Recalled lifetime exposure was associated with severe psychological distress during the previous month (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.56; 95% CI, 1.09-2.24; P\u2009<\u2009.001) compared with non-GICE therapy. Associations were found between recalled lifetime exposure and higher odds of lifetime suicide attempts (aOR, 2.27; 95% CI, 1.60-3.24; P\u2009<\u2009.001) and recalled exposure before the age of 10 years and increased odds of lifetime suicide attempts (aOR, 4.15; 95% CI, 2.44-7.69; P\u2009<\u2009.001). No significant differences were found when comparing exposure to GICE by secular professionals vs religious advisors. Conclusions and Relevance: The findings suggest that lifetime and childhood exposure to GICE are associated with adverse mental health outcomes in adulthood. These results support policy statements from several professional organizations that have discouraged this practice. ",
        "Suicide Case-Fatality Rates in the United States, 2007 to 2014: A Nationwide Population-Based Study. Background: The suicide case-fatality rate (CFR)-the proportion of suicidal acts that are fatal-depends on the distribution of methods used in suicidal acts and the probability of death given a particular method (method-specific CFR). Objective: To estimate overall and method-specific suicide CFRs and the distribution of methods used in suicidal acts by demographic characteristics. Design: Cross-sectional study. Setting: United States, 2007 to 2014. Participants: Suicide deaths (n\u00a0= 309\u00a0377 records from the National Vital Statistics System) and nonfatal suicide attempts requiring treatment in an emergency department (ED) (n\u00a0= 1\u00a0791\u00a0638 records from the Nationwide Emergency Department Sample) or hospitalization (n\u00a0= 1\u00a0556\u00a0871 records from the National [Nationwide] Inpatient Sample) among persons aged 5 years or older. Measurements: Rates of suicide deaths and nonfatal suicide attempts, overall and method-specific CFRs, and distribution of methods used, by sex, age group, region, and urbanization. Results: Overall, 8.5% of suicidal acts were fatal (14.7% for males vs. 3.3% for females; 3.4% for persons aged 15 to 24 years vs. 35.4% for those aged \u226565 years). Drug poisoning accounted for 59.4% of acts but only 13.5% of deaths; firearms and hanging accounted for only 8.8% of acts but 75.3% of deaths. Firearms were the most lethal method (89.6% of suicidal acts with a firearm resulted in death), followed by drowning (56.4%) and hanging (52.7%). Method-specific CFRs were higher for males and older persons. The distribution of methods varied across demographic groups. Limitations: Results are based on suicidal acts resulting in an ED visit, a hospitalization, or death. Consequently, the reported CFRs are larger than they would have been had the data included nonfatal attempts that did not result in an ED visit. Conclusion: Variation in overall suicide CFR between sexes and across age groups, regions, and urbanization is largely explained by the distribution of methods used in suicidal acts.

        "Long-term Changes in Cognitive Functioning in Individuals With Psychotic Disorders: Findings From the Suffolk County Mental Health Project. Importance: It remains uncertain whether people with psychotic disorders experience progressive cognitive decline or normal cognitive aging after first hospitalization. This information is essential for prognostication in clinical settings, deployment of cognitive remediation, and public health policy. Objective: To examine long-term cognitive changes in individuals with psychotic disorders and to compare age-related differences in cognitive performance between people with psychotic disorders and matched control individuals (ie, individuals who had never had psychotic disorders). Design, Setting, and Participants: The Suffolk County Mental Health Project is an inception cohort study of first-admission patients with psychosis. Cognitive functioning was assessed 2 and 20 years later. Patients were recruited from the 12 inpatient facilities of Suffolk County, New York. At year 20, the control group was recruited by random digit dialing and matched to the clinical cohort on zip code and demographics. Data were collected between September 1991 and July 2015. Analysis began January 2016. Main Outcomes and Measures: Change in cognitive functioning in 6 domains: verbal knowledge (Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised vocabulary test), verbal declarative memory (Verbal Paired Associates test I and II), visual declarative memory (Visual Reproduction test I and II), attention and processing speed (Symbol Digit Modalities Test-written and oral; Trail Making Test [TMT]-A), abstraction-executive function (Trenerry Stroop Color Word Test; TMT-B), and verbal fluency (Controlled Oral Word Association Test). Results: A total of 705 participants were included in the analyses (mean [SD] age at year 20, 49.4 [10.1] years): 445 individuals (63.1%) had psychotic disorders (211 with schizophrenia spectrum [138 (65%) male]; 164 with affective psychoses [76 (46%) male]; 70 with other psychoses [43 (61%) male]); and 260 individuals (36.9%) in the control group (50.5 [9.0] years; 134 [51.5%] male). Cognition in individuals with a psychotic disorder declined on all but 2 tests (average decline: d\u2009=\u20090.31; range, 0.17-0.54; all P\u2009<\u2009.001). Cognitive declines were associated with worsening vocational functioning (Visual Reproduction test II: r\u2009=\u20090.20; Symbol Digit Modalities Test-written: r\u2009=\u20090.25; Stroop: r\u2009=\u20090.24; P\u2009<\u2009.009) and worsening negative symptoms (avolition: Symbol Digit Modalities Test-written: r\u2009=\u2009-0.24; TMT-A: r\u2009=\u2009-0.21; Stroop: r\u2009=\u2009-0.21; all P\u2009<\u2009.009; inexpressivity: Stroop: r\u2009=\u2009-0.22; P\u2009<\u2009.009). Compared with control individuals, people with psychotic disrders showed age-dependent deficits in verbal knowledge, fluency, and abstraction-executive function (vocabulary: \u03b2\u2009=\u2009-0.32; Controlled Oral Word Association Test: \u03b2\u2009=\u2009-0.32; TMT-B: \u03b2\u2009=\u20090.23; all P\u2009<\u2009.05), with the largest gap among participants 50 years or older. Conclusions and Relevance: In individuals with psychotic disorders, most cognitive functions declined over 2 decades after first hospitalization. Observed declines were clinically significant. Some declines were larger than expected due to normal aging, suggesting that cognitive aging in some domains may be accelerated in this population. If confirmed, these findings would highlight cognition as an important target for research and treatment during later phases of psychotic illness. ",
        "Association of Aripiprazole With the Risk for Psychiatric Hospitalization, Self-harm, or Suicide. Importance: Some reports have raised concerns regarding a potential psychiatric worsening associated with first-time use of aripiprazole in patients already treated with other antipsychotic medications. Whether aripiprazole use, particularly in the long term, increases the risk for serious psychiatric events is unclear. Objective: To assess whether switching to or adding aripiprazole is associated with serious psychiatric treatment failure compared with switching to or adding another antipsychotic drug in patients previously exposed to antipsychotic medications. Design, Setting, and Participants: This population-based cohort study was conducted from January 1, 2005, to March 31, 2015. Data were obtained from the United Kingdom Clinical Practice Research Datalink, one of the world's largest computerized databases linked to the Hospital Episodes Statistics repository and the Office for National Statistics (ONS) mortality database. Within a base cohort of new users of antipsychotic drugs, patients switching or adding aripiprazole (n\u2009=\u20091643) were propensity matched 1:1 to patients switching to or adding another antipsychotic medication (n\u2009=\u20091643). All patients were followed up until psychiatric treatment failure, for 365 days (1 year) after cohort entry, until death from any cause other than suicide, until end of registration or linkage with the databases, or end of the study period (March 31, 2016). Main Outcomes and Measures: Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs of serious events of psychiatric treatment failure (psychiatric hospitalizations, self-harm, or suicide) associated with switching to or adding aripiprazole compared with other antipsychotic drugs. In addition to propensity score matching, all models were adjusted for age, number of psychiatric hospitalizations or self-harm events in the 6 months before cohort entry, number of different antipsychotic drugs before cohort entry, and quintiles of the Index of Multiple Deprivation. Results: The study cohort included 1643 patients (949 [57.8%] were women with a mean [SD] age of 42.1 [16.8] years) starting aripiprazole use; they were matched 1:1 to 1643 patients (871 [53.0%] were women with a mean [SD] age of 42.4 [17.1] years) starting use of another antipsychotic drug. During 2692 person-years of follow-up, 391 incident serious psychiatric treatment failures occurred, with a crude incidence rate of 14.52 (95% CI, 13.16-16.04) per 100 person-years. First-time use of aripiprazole was not associated with an increased rate of psychiatric treatment failure (HR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.71-1.06), psychiatric hospitalizations (HR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.69-1.06), or self-harm or suicide (HR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.68-1.36) compared with starting use of another antipsychotic drug. Results were consistent across several sensitivity analyses. Conclusions and Relevance: Initiating aripiprazole use, compared with another antipsychotic medication, after a previous antipsychotic exposure did not appear to be associated with psychiatric hospitalization, self-harm, or suicide; these findings warrant replication in large observational studies.

        "Efficacy and Safety of Lumateperone for Treatment of Schizophrenia: A Randomized Clinical Trial. Importance: Individuals living with schizophrenia are affected by cardiometabolic, endocrine, and motor adverse effects of current antipsychotic medications. Lumateperone is a serotonin, dopamine, and glutamate modulator with the potential to treat schizophrenia with few adverse effects. Objective: To examine the efficacy and safety of lumateperone for the short-term treatment of schizophrenia. Design, Setting, and Participants: This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 clinical trial was conducted from November 13, 2014, to July 20, 2015, with data analyses performed from August 13 to September 15, 2015. Patients with schizophrenia who were aged 18 to 60 years and were experiencing an acute exacerbation of psychosis were enrolled from 12 clinical sites in the United States. Interventions: Patients were randomized 1:1:1 (150 patients in each arm) to receive lumateperone tosylate, 60 mg; lumateperone tosylate, 40 mg (equivalent to 42 or 28 mg, respectively, of the active moiety lumateperone); or placebo once daily for 4 weeks. Main Outcomes and Measures: The prespecified primary efficacy end point was mean change from baseline to day 28 in the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total score vs placebo. The key secondary efficacy measure was the Clinical Global Impression-Severity of Illness (CGI-S) score. The PANSS subscale scores, social function, safety, and tolerability were also assessed. Results: The study comprised 450 patients (mean [SD] age, 42.4 [10.2] years; 346 [77.1%] male; mean [SD] baseline PANSS score, 89.8 [10.3]; mean [SD] baseline CGI-S score, 4.8 [0.6]). In the prespecified modified intent-to-treat efficacy analysis (n\u2009=\u2009435), 42 mg of lumateperone met the primary and key secondary efficacy objectives, demonstrating a statistically significant improvement vs placebo from baseline to day 28 on the PANSS total score (least-squares mean difference [LSMD], -4.2; 95% CI, -7.8 to -0.6; P\u2009=\u2009.02; effect size [ES], -0.3) and the CGI-S (LSMD, -0.3; 95% CI, -0.5 to -0.1; P\u2009=\u2009.003; ES, -0.4). For 28 mg of lumateperone, the LSMD from baseline to day 28 was -2.6 (95% CI, -6.2 to 1.1; P\u2009=\u2009.16; ES, -0.2) on the PANSS total score and -0.2 (95% CI, -0.5 to 0.0; P\u2009=\u2009.02; ES, -0.3) on the CGI-S. Both lumateperone doses were well tolerated without clinically significant treatment-emergent motor adverse effects or changes in cardiometabolic or endocrine factors vs placebo. Conclusions and Relevance: Lumateperone demonstrated efficacy for improving the symptoms of schizophrenia and had a favorable safety profile.

        "Clinical Features and Outcomes of Patients With Malignancy and Takotsubo Syndrome: Observations From the International Takotsubo Registry. Background Clinical characteristics and outcomes of takotsubo syndrome (TTS) patients with malignancy have not been fully elucidated. This study sought to explore differences in clinical characteristics and to investigate short- and long-term outcomes in TTS patients with or without malignancy. Methods and Results TTS patients were enrolled from the International Takotsubo Registry. The TTS cohort was divided into patients with and without malignancy to investigate differences in clinical characteristics and to assess short- and long-term mortality. A subanalysis was performed comparing long-term mortality between a subset of TTS patients with or without malignancy and acute coronary syndrome (ACS) patients with or without malignancy. Malignancy was observed in 16.6% of 1604 TTS patients. Patients with malignancy were older and more likely to have physical triggers, but less likely to have emotional triggers compared with those without malignancy. Long-term mortality was higher in patients with malignancy (P<0.001), while short-term outcome was comparable (P=0.17). In a subanalysis, long-term mortality was comparable between TTS patients with malignancies and ACS patients with malignancies (P=0.13). Malignancy emerged as an independent predictor of long-term mortality. Conclusions A substantial number of TTS patients show an association with malignancy. History of malignancy might increase the risk for TTS, and therefore, appropriate screening for malignancy should be considered in these patients.

        "Medications associated with fracture risk in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. OBJECTIVE: To examine the fracture risk with use of disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), statins, proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), opioids, non-opioid analgesics and psychotropic medications in a US-wide observational rheumatoid arthritis (RA) cohort. METHODS: Patients with RA without prior fracture from 2001 through 2017 in FORWARD, a longitudinal observational registry, were assessed for osteoporosis-related site fractures (vertebra, hip, forearm and humerus). DMARD exposure was assessed in four mutually exclusive groups: (1) methotrexate monotherapy-reference, (2) tumour necrosis factor-\u03b1 inhibitors (TNFi), (3) non-TNFi biologics and (4) others. Non-DMARDs and glucocorticoids were classified as current/ever use and based on treatment duration. Fracture Risk Assessment Tool (FRAX) scores estimating for 10-year major osteoporotic fractures were calculated. Cox proportional hazard models stratified by FRAX were used to adjust for confounders. RESULTS: During median (IQR) 3.0 (1.5-6.0) years of follow-up in 11\u2009412 patients, 914 fractures were observed. The adjusted models showed a significant fracture risk increase with use of any dose glucocorticoids \u22653 months (HR (95% CI) for <7.5 mg/day 1.26 (1.07 to 1.48) and for \u22657.5 mg/day 1.57 (1.27 to 1.94)), opioids (for weak: 1.37 (1.18 to 1.59); strong: 1.53 (1.24 to 1.88)) and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) (1.37 (1.15 to 1.63)). Fracture risk with opioids increased within 1 month of use (1.66 (1.36 to 2.04)) and with SSRIs >3 months of use (1.25 (1.01 to 1.55)). Statins (0.77 (0.62 to 0.96)) and TNFi (0.72 (0.54 to 0.97)) were associated with reduction in vertebral fracture risk only. PPIs and other psychotropic medications were not associated with increased fracture risk. CONCLUSION: Use of opioids, SSRIs and glucocorticoids were associated with increased risk of any fracture in patients with RA, whereas statins and TNFi were associated with decreased vertebral fractures.

        "Consensus-based recommendations for the management of juvenile localised scleroderma. In 2012, a European initiative called Single Hub and Access point for paediatric Rheumatology in Europe (SHARE) was launched to optimise and disseminate diagnostic and management regimens in Europe for children and young adults with rheumatic diseases. Juvenile localised scleroderma (JLS) is a rare disease within the group of paediatric rheumatic diseases (PRD) and can lead to significant morbidity. Evidence-based guidelines are sparse and management is mostly based on physicians' experience. This study aims to provide recommendations for assessment and treatment of JLS. Recommendations were developed by an evidence-informed consensus process using the European League Against Rheumatism standard operating procedures. A committee was formed, mainly from Europe, and consisted of 15 experienced paediatric rheumatologists and two young fellows. Recommendations derived from a validated systematic literature review were evaluated by an online survey and subsequently discussed at two consensus meetings using a nominal group technique. Recommendations were accepted if \u226580% agreement was reached. In total, 1 overarching principle, 10 recommendations on assessment and 6 recommendations on therapy were accepted with \u226580% agreement among experts. Topics covered include assessment of skin and extracutaneous involvement and suggested treatment pathways. The SHARE initiative aims to identify best practices for treatment of patients suffering from PRDs. Within this remit, recommendations for the assessment and treatment of JLS have been formulated by an evidence-informed consensus process to produce a standard of care for patients with JLS throughout Europe.

        "Mortality Among Professional American-Style Football Players and Professional American Baseball Players. Importance: Studies of American-style football players have suggested lower overall mortality rates compared with general populations, but with possibly increased neurodegenerative mortality. However, comparisons with general populations can introduce bias. This study compared mortality between US National Football League (NFL) and US Major League Baseball (MLB) players, a more appropriate comparison group of professional athletes. Objective: To compare all-cause and cause-specific mortality between NFL and MLB players. Design, Setting, and Participants: In this retrospective cohort study, the setting was US mortality from January 1, 1979, through December 31, 2013. The dates of analysis were January 2016 to April 2019. Participants were 3419 NFL and 2708 MLB players with at least 5 playing seasons. Exposures: Participation in the NFL compared with the MLB. Main Outcomes and Measures: Vital status and causes of death from the National Death Index from 1979 through 2013 were obtained. Cox proportional hazards regression models using age as the timescale were used to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs to examine all-cause and cause-specific mortality among NFL players compared with MLB players, adjusted for race and decade of birth. Results: By the end of follow-up, there were 517 deaths (mean [SD] age, 59.6 [13.2] years) in the NFL cohort and 431 deaths (mean [SD] age, 66.7 [12.3] years) in the MLB cohort. Cardiovascular and neurodegenerative conditions, respectively, were noted as underlying or contributing causes in 498 and 39 deaths in the NFL and 225 and 16 deaths in the MLB. Compared with MLB players, NFL players had significantly elevated rates of all-cause (HR, 1.26; 95% CI, 1.10-1.44), cardiovascular disease (HR, 2.40; 95% CI, 2.03-2.84), and neurodegenerative disease (HR, 2.99; 95% CI, 1.64-5.45) mortality. Comparing hypothetical populations of 1000 NFL and 1000 MLB players followed up to age 75 years, there would be an excess 21 all-cause deaths among NFL players, as well as 77 and 11 more deaths with underlying or contributing causes that included cardiovascular and neurodegenerative conditions, respectively. Conclusions and Relevance: This study found that NFL players had elevated all-cause, cardiovascular, and neurodegenerative mortality rates compared with MLB players, although the absolute number of excess neurodegenerative deaths was still small. Factors that vary across these sports (eg, body habitus and head trauma) as opposed to those common across sports (eg, physical activity) could underlie the differences. ",
        "Omega-3, omega-6, and total dietary polyunsaturated fat for prevention and treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials. OBJECTIVE: To assess effects of increasing omega-3, omega-6, and total polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) on diabetes diagnosis and glucose metabolism. DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analyses. DATA SOURCES: Medline, Embase, Cochrane CENTRAL, WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, Clinicaltrials.gov, and trials in relevant systematic reviews. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials of at least 24 weeks' duration assessing effects of increasing \u03b1-linolenic acid, long chain omega-3, omega-6, or total PUFA, which collected data on diabetes diagnoses, fasting glucose or insulin, glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c), and/or homoeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR). DATA SYNTHESIS: Statistical analysis included random effects meta-analyses using relative risk and mean difference, and sensitivity analyses. Funnel plots were examined and subgrouping assessed effects of intervention type, replacement, baseline risk of diabetes and use of antidiabetes drugs, trial duration, and dose. Risk of bias was assessed with the Cochrane tool and quality of evidence with GRADE. RESULTS: 83 randomised controlled trials (mainly assessing effects of supplementary long chain omega-3) were included; 10 were at low summary risk of bias. Long chain omega-3 had little or no effect on likelihood of diagnosis of diabetes (relative risk 1.00, 95% confidence interval 0.85 to 1.17; 58\u2009643 participants, 3.7% developed diabetes) or measures of glucose metabolism (HbA1c mean difference -0.02%, 95% confidence interval -0.07% to 0.04%; plasma glucose 0.04, 0.02 to 0.07, mmol/L; fasting insulin 1.02, -4.34 to 6.37, pmol/L; HOMA-IR 0.06, -0.21 to 0.33). A suggestion of negative outcomes was observed when dose of supplemental long chain omega-3 was above 4.4 g/d. Effects of \u03b1-linolenic acid, omega-6, and total PUFA on diagnosis of diabetes were unclear (as the evidence was of very low quality), but little or no effect on measures of glucose metabolism was seen, except that increasing \u03b1-linolenic acid may increase fasting insulin (by about 7%). No evidence was found that the omega-3/omega-6 ratio is important for diabetes or glucose metabolism. CONCLUSIONS: This is the most extensive systematic review of trials to date to assess effects of polyunsaturated fats on newly diagnosed diabetes and glucose metabolism, including previously unpublished data following contact with authors. Evidence suggests that increasing omega-3, omega-6, or total PUFA has little or no effect on prevention and treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus.

        "Cigarette Smoking and Subclinical Peripheral Arterial Disease in Blacks of the Jackson Heart Study. Background Prevalence of peripheral artery disease ( PAD ) is significantly higher among blacks as compared with non-Hispanic whites, but the role of cigarette smoking in PAD is understudied in blacks. We aimed to evaluate the relationship between cigarette smoking and PAD in blacks in the (JHS) Jackson Heart Study. Methods and Results JHS participants (n=5306) were classified by self-reported baseline smoking status into current, past (smoked at least 400 cigarettes/life), or never smokers. We examined multivariable logistic and robust linear regression models to estimate the associations between baseline smoking status, smoking intensity, and measures of subclinical PAD (ankle-brachial index [visit 1] and aortic calcium by computed tomography [visit 2]) to yield odds ratios and \u03b2-coefficients (estimated adjusted difference) to compare each smoking status with never smokers (reference group). There were 3579 (68%) never smokers, 986 (19%) past smokers, and 693 (13%) current smokers self-identified at baseline. After adjustment for covariates, current smokers had increased risk of ankle-brachial index <1 (odds ratio, 2.2, 95% CI, 1.5-3.3) and increased risk of abdominal aortic (odds ratio, 8.4, 95% CI, 5.8-12.0) and aortoiliac calcium (odds ratio, 9.6, 95% CI, 6.7-13.7). When stratifying by smoking intensity, those smoking more than 20 cigarettes daily (1 pack) had higher likelihood of subclinical PAD by all of these measures compared with lower-intensity use, suggesting a dose-dependent relationship. Conclusions In a large black cohort, cigarette smoking was associated with measures of subclinical PAD in a dose-dependent manner. These findings highlight the association between smoking and PAD in blacks and support further research exploring the impact of interventions on smoking cessation to reduce PAD in this population. ",
        "Opioid Prescriptions at Hospital Discharge Are Associated With More Postdischarge Healthcare Utilization. Background Many patients use opioids for nonmalignant pain, and opioid use in the general population has been associated with poor long-term outcomes. The use of high-risk medications, including opioid analgesics, may increase the risk of unplanned healthcare utilization. Methods and Results We performed a nested evaluation in the VICS (Vanderbilt Inpatient Cohort Study) (N=3000) on patients with an admitting diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome and/or acute decompensated heart failure. Patient enrollment occurred from October 2011 until December 2015 and involved a single investigational site, Vanderbilt University Medical Center (Nashville, TN). Of the 2495 eligible patients, 501 (20%) were discharged with an opioid prescription and were predominantly white and men, with a median age of 59 (interquartile range, 53-67) years. Our primary outcome was unplanned healthcare utilization, which included emergency department presentation or readmission. Secondary outcomes included mortality and a composite of planned utilization behaviors: cardiac rehabilitation and provider follow-up within 30\u00a0days. Cox proportional hazards models did not show a statistically significant association with increased unplanned utilization (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.06; 95% CI, 0.87-1.28) or mortality (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.08; 95% CI , 0.84-1.39), compared with those without opioids at discharge. Patients discharged with opioids were less likely to complete planned healthcare utilization (adjusted odds ratio, 0.69; 95% CI , 0.52-0.91). Conclusions There are decreased odds of planned healthcare utilization among patients with acute coronary syndrome and acute decompensated heart failure discharged with opioid medication. It is imperative to understand how opioid use can affect a patient's relationship with the healthcare system. ",
        "Efficacy and Safety of Antibiotic Therapy in Early Cutaneous Lyme Borreliosis: A Network Meta-analysis. Importance: Controversies about the choice of antibiotic agent and treatment modality exist in the management of erythema migrans in early cutaneous Lyme borreliosis (LB). Objective: To conduct a network meta-analysis (NMA) of all randomized clinical trials on various antibiotic agents and treatment modalities in early cutaneous LB. Data Sources: Electronic searches in MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were conducted from inception until July 2017. The reference lists of the included studies were hand searched, authors were contacted, and ongoing trials were searched at ClinicalTrials.gov. Study Selection: One reviewer screened the titles and abstracts of the 9975 reports identified by the electronic searches. Full-text copies of 161 potentially relevant articles were obtained, and 2 reviewers independently assessed those articles for inclusion. Adults with a physician-confirmed early localized skin infection who were treated with antibiotics of any dose or duration were included. Data Extraction and Synthesis: Two reviewers independently extracted data on study, patient, and intervention characteristics. Network meta-analyses on treatment effects and adverse outcomes were calculated with a frequentist approach using the R package netmeta. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation guidance for NMA was used to assess the certainty of evidence. Main Outcomes and Measures: Treatment effects for response to treatment (resolution of symptoms) and treatment-related adverse events. Results: Overall, 19 studies (2532 patients) were included. The mean patient age ranged between 37 and 56 years, and the percentage of female patients ranged from 36% to 60%. The antibiotics investigated were doxycycline, cefuroxime axetil, ceftriaxone, amoxicillin, azithromycin, penicillin V, and minocycline. Pooled effect sizes from NMAs did not suggest any significant differences in treatment response by antibiotic agent (eg, amoxicillin vs doxycycline odds ratio, 1.26; 95% CI, 0.41-3.87), dose, or duration (eg, doxycycline, 200 mg/d for 3 weeks, vs doxycycline, 200 mg/d for 2 weeks, odds ratio, 1.28; 95% CI, 0.49-3.34). Treatment failures were rare at both 2 months (4%; 95% CI, 2%-5%) and 12 months (2%, 95% CI, 1%-3%) after treatment initiation. There were also no differences in the effect sizes among antibiotic agents and treatment modalities for treatment-related adverse outcomes, which were generally mild to moderate. Certainty of evidence was categorized as low and very low mostly because of imprecision, indirectness, and study limitations (high risk of bias) of the included studies. Conclusions and Relevance: This NMA suggests that neither the antibiotic agent nor treatment modality contributed to comparative effectiveness or drug-related adverse outcomes. This finding is relevant for physicians treating patients with LB and for patient decision making. ",
        "Racial/Ethnic Disparities in the Prevalence of Diabetes and Prediabetes by BMI: Patient Outcomes Research To Advance Learning (PORTAL) Multisite Cohort of Adults in the U.S. OBJECTIVE: To examine racial/ethnic disparities in the prevalence of diabetes and prediabetes by BMI category. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In a consortium of three U.S. integrated health care systems, 4,906,238 individuals aged \u226520 years during 2012-2013 were included. Diabetes and prediabetes were ascertained by diagnosis and laboratory results; antihyperglycemic medications were also included for diabetes ascertainment. RESULTS: The age-standardized diabetes and prediabetes prevalence estimates were 15.9% and 33.4%, respectively. Diabetes but not prediabetes prevalence increased across BMI categories among all racial/ethnic groups (P for trend < 0.001). Racial/ethnic minorities reached a given diabetes prevalence at lower BMIs than whites; Hawaiians/Pacific Islanders and Asians had a diabetes prevalence of 24.6% (95% CI 24.1-25.2%) in overweight and 26.5% (26.3-26.8%) in obese class 1, whereas whites had a prevalence of 23.7% (23.5-23.8%) in obese class 2. The age-standardized prediabetes prevalence estimates in overweight among Hispanics (35.6% [35.4-35.7%]), Asians (38.1% [38.0-38.3%]), and Hawaiians/Pacific Islanders (37.5% [36.9-38.2%]) were similar to those in obese class 4 among whites (35.3% [34.5-36.0%]), blacks (36.8% [35.5-38.2%]), and American Indians/Alaskan Natives (34.2% [29.6-38.8%]). In adjusted models, the strength of association between BMI and diabetes was highest among whites (relative risk comparing obese class 4 with normal weight 7.64 [95% CI 7.50-7.79]) and lowest among blacks (3.16 [3.05-3.27]). The association between BMI and prediabetes was less pronounced. CONCLUSIONS: Racial/ethnic minorities had a higher burden of diabetes and prediabetes at lower BMIs than whites, suggesting the role of factors other than obesity in racial/ethnic disparities in diabetes and prediabetes risk and highlighting the need for tailored screening and prevention strategies.

        "Use and Discontinuation of Insulin Treatment Among Adults Aged 75 to 79 Years With Type 2 Diabetes. Importance: Among older individuals with type 2 diabetes, those with poor health have greater risk and derive less benefit from tight glycemic control with insulin. Objective: To examine whether insulin treatment is used less frequently and discontinued more often among older individuals with poor health compared with those in good health. Design, Setting, and Participants: This longitudinal cohort study included 21\u202f531 individuals with type 2 diabetes followed for up to 4 years starting at age 75 years. Electronic health record data from the Kaiser Permanente Northern California Diabetes Registry was collected to characterize insulin treatment and glycemic control over time. Data were collected from January 1, 2009, through December 31, 2017, and analyzed from February 2, 2018, through June 30, 2019. Exposures: Health status was defined as good (<2 comorbid conditions or 2 comorbidities but physically active), intermediate (>2 comorbidities or 2 comorbidities and no self-reported weekly exercise), or poor (having end-stage pulmonary, cardiac, or renal disease; diagnosis of dementia; or metastatic cancer). Main Outcomes and Measures: Insulin use prevalence at age 75 years and discontinuation among insulin users over the next 4 years (or 6 months prior to death if <4 years). Results: Of 21\u202f531 patients, 10\u202f396 (48.3%) were women, and the mean (SD) age was 75 (0) years. Nearly one-fifth of 75-year-olds (4076 [18.9%]) used insulin. Prevalence and adjusted risk ratios (aRRs) of insulin use at age 75 years were higher in individuals with poor health (29.4%; aRR, 2.03; 95% CI, 1.87-2.20; P\u2009<\u2009.01) and intermediate health (27.5%; aRR, 1.85; 95% CI, 1.74-1.97; P\u2009<\u2009.01) relative to good health (10.5% [reference]). One-third (1335 of 4076 [32.7%]) of insulin users at age 75 years discontinued insulin within 4 years of cohort entry (and at least 6 months prior to death). Likelihood of continued insulin use was higher among individuals in poor health (aRR, 1.47; 95% CI, 1.27-1.67; P\u2009<\u2009.01) and intermediate health (aRR, 1.16; 95% CI, 1.05-1.30; P\u2009<\u2009.01) compared with good health (reference). These same prevalence and discontinuation patterns were present in the subset with tight glycemic control (hemoglobin A1c <7.0%). Conclusions and Relevance: In older individuals with type 2 diabetes, insulin use was most prevalent among those in poor health, whereas subsequent insulin discontinuation after age 75 years was most likely in healthier patients. Changes are needed in current practice to better align with guidelines that recommend reducing treatment intensity as health status declines. ",
        "Patient and Health Care Factors Associated With Long-term Diabetes Complications Among Adults With and Without Mental Health and Substance Use Disorders. Importance: Among people with diabetes, co-occurring mental health (MH) or substance use (SU) disorders increase the risk of medical complications. Identifying how to effectively promote long-term medical benefits for at-risk populations, such as people with MH or SU disorders, is essential. Knowing more about how health care accessed before the onset of diabetes is associated with health benefits after the onset of diabetes could inform treatment planning and population health management. Objective: To analyze how preexisting MH or SU disorders and primary care utilization before a new diabetes diagnosis are associated with the long-term severity of diabetes complications. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study analyzed medical record data from US Department of Veterans Affairs health care systems nationwide and used mixed-effects regressions to test associations between prediabetes patient or health care factors and longitudinal progression of diabetes complication severity from 2006 to 2015. Participants included patients who received a new diabetes diagnosis in 2008 and who were aged 18 to 85 years at the time of their diagnosis. Data analysis was conducted from March to August 2017. Exposures: Patients were assigned to groups on the basis of a 2-year look-back period for MH or SU disorders status (MH disorder only, SU disorder only, MH and SU disorder, or no MH or SU disorder diagnoses) and on the basis of the amount of primary care utilization before diabetes was diagnosed. Main Outcomes and Measures: Nine-year trajectories of Diabetes Complication Severity Index (DCSI) scores. Results: Among 122\u202f992 patients with newly diagnosed diabetes, the mean (SD) age was 62.3 (11.1) years, 118\u202f810 (96.6%) were male, and 28\u202f633 (23.3%) had preexisting MH or SU disorders diagnoses. From the onset of diabetes to 7 years later, patients' mean estimated DCSI scores increased from 0.84 (95% CI, 0.82-0.87) to 1.42 (95% CI, 1.36-1.47). Controlling for sociodemographic characteristics and medical comorbidities, SU disorders only (decrease in DCSI score, -0.09; 95% CI, -0.13 to -0.04; P\u2009<\u2009.001) or both MH and SU disorders (decrease in DCSI score, -0.13; 95% CI, -0.16 to -0.09; P\u2009<\u2009.001), but not MH disorders only, were associated with lower DCSI scores at the time of the onset of diabetes compared with no MH or SU disorders. More than 90% of patients with MH or SU disorders had primary care visits before diabetes was newly diagnosed, compared with approximately 58% of patients without MH or SU disorders. Patients who had primary care visits before the onset of diabetes had lower baseline DCSI scores, compared with patients who did not have primary care visits (decrease in DCSI score, -0.41 [95% CI, -0.43 to -0.39] for 1-2 visits, -0.50 [95% CI, -0.52 to -0.48] for 3-4 visits, -0.39 [95% CI, -0.41 to -0.37] for 5-8 visits, and -0.15 [95% CI, -0.17 to -0.12] for \u22659 visits; P\u2009<\u2009.001 for all). Patients with MH or SU disorders had lower overall, but more rapidly progressing, mean DCSI scores through year 7 after the onset of diabetes (MH disorder only, 0.006 [95% CI, 0.005-0.008], P\u2009<\u2009.001; SU disorder only, 0.005 [95% CI, 0.001-0.008], P\u2009=\u2009.004; or both MH and SU disorders, 0.008 [95% CI, 0.006-0.011], P\u2009<\u2009.001), compared with patients without MH or SU disorders. Conclusions and Relevance: Access to and engagement in integrated health care may be associated with modest, albeit impermanent, long-term health benefits for patients with MH and/or SU disorders with newly diagnosed diabetes.

        "Preterm birth and risk of type 1 and type 2 diabetes: a national cohort study. AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Preterm birth (gestational age <37\u00a0weeks) has been associated with insulin resistance early in life. However, no large population-based studies have examined risks of type 1 and type 2 diabetes and potential sex-specific differences from childhood into adulthood. Clinicians will increasingly encounter adults who were born prematurely and will need to understand their long-term risks. We hypothesised that preterm birth is associated with increased risks of type 1 and type 2 diabetes into adulthood. METHODS: A national cohort study was conducted of all 4,193,069 singletons born in Sweden during 1973-2014, who were followed up for type 1 and type 2 diabetes identified from nationwide diagnoses and pharmacy data to the end of 2015 (maximum age 43\u00a0years; median age at the end of follow-up 22.5\u00a0years). Cox regression was used to adjust for potential confounders, and co-sibling analyses assessed the influence of shared familial (genetic and/or environmental) factors. RESULTS: In 92.3 million person-years of follow-up, 27,512 (0.7%) and 5525 (0.1%) people were identified with type 1 and type 2 diabetes, respectively. Gestational age at birth was inversely associated with both type 1 and type 2 diabetes risk. Adjusted HRs for type 1 and type 2 diabetes at age <18\u00a0years associated with preterm birth were 1.21 (95% CI, 1.14, 1.28) and 1.26 (95% CI, 1.01, 1.58), respectively, and at age 18-43\u00a0years were 1.24 (95% CI, 1.13, 1.37) and 1.49 (95% CI, 1.31, 1.68), respectively, compared with full-term birth. The associations between preterm birth and type 2 (but not type 1) diabetes were stronger among females (e.g. at age 18-43\u00a0years, females: adjusted HR, 1.75; 95% CI, 1.47, 2.09; males: 1.28; 95% CI, 1.08, 1.53; p\u00a0<\u20090.01 for additive and multiplicative interaction). These associations were only partially explained by shared genetic or environmental factors in families. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: In this large national cohort, preterm birth was associated with increased risk of type 1 and type 2 diabetes from childhood into early to mid-adulthood. Preterm-born children and adults may need early preventive evaluation and long-term monitoring for diabetes. ",
        "Assessment of a Personalized Approach to Predicting Postprandial Glycemic Responses to Food Among Individuals Without Diabetes. Importance: Emerging evidence suggests that postprandial glycemic responses (PPGRs) to food may be influenced by and predicted according to characteristics unique to each individual, including anthropometric and microbiome variables. Interindividual diversity in PPGRs to food requires a personalized approach for the maintenance of healthy glycemic levels. Objectives: To describe and predict the glycemic responses of individuals to a diverse array of foods using a model that considers the physiology and microbiome of the individual in addition to the characteristics of the foods consumed. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study using a personalized predictive model enrolled 327 individuals without diabetes from October 11, 2016, to December 13, 2017, in Minnesota and Florida to be part of a study lasting 6 days. The study measured anthropometric variables, described the gut microbial composition, and assessed blood glucose levels every 5 minutes using a continuous glucose monitor. Participants logged their food and activity information for the duration of the study. A predictive model of individualized PPGRs to a diverse array of foods was trained and applied. Main Outcomes and Measures: Glycemic responses to food consumed over 6 days for each participant. The predictive model of personalized PPGRs considered individual features, including the microbiome, in addition to the features of the foods consumed. Results: Postprandial response to the same foods varied across 327 individuals (mean [SD] age, 45 [12] years; 78.0% female). A model predicting each individual's responses to food that considers several individual factors in addition to food features had better overall performance (R\u2009=\u20090.62) than current standard-of-care approaches using nutritional content alone (R\u2009=\u20090.34 for calories and R\u2009=\u20090.40 for carbohydrates) to control postprandial glycemic levels. Conclusions and Relevance: Across the cohort of adults without diabetes who were examined, a personalized predictive model that considers unique features of the individual, such as clinical characteristics, physiological variables, and the microbiome, in addition to nutrient content was more predictive than current dietary approaches that focus only on the calorie or carbohydrate content of foods. Providing individuals with tools to manage their glycemic responses to food based on personalized predictions of their PPGRs may allow them to maintain their blood glucose levels within limits associated with good health.

        "Breast cancer risk in transgender people receiving hormone treatment: nationwide cohort study in the Netherlands. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the incidence and characteristics of breast cancer in transgender people in the Netherlands compared with the general Dutch population. DESIGN: Retrospective, nationwide cohort study. SETTING: Specialised tertiary gender clinic in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. PARTICIPANTS: 2260 adult trans women (male sex assigned at birth, female gender identity) and 1229 adult trans men (female sex assigned at birth, male gender identity) who received gender affirming hormone treatment. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Incidence and characteristics (eg, histology, hormone receptor status) of breast cancer in transgender people. RESULTS: The total person time in this cohort was 33\u2009991 years for trans women and 14\u2009883 years for trans men. In the 2260 trans women in the cohort, 15 cases of invasive breast cancer were identified (median duration of hormone treatment 18 years, range 7-37 years). This was 46-fold higher than in cisgender men (standardised incidence ratio 46.7, 95% confidence interval 27.2 to 75.4) but lower than in cisgender women (0.3, 0.2 to 0.4). Most tumours were of ductal origin and oestrogen and progesterone receptor positive, and 8.3% were human epidermal growth factor 2 (HER2) positive. In 1229 trans men, four cases of invasive breast cancer were identified (median duration of hormone treatment 15 years, range 2-17 years). This was lower than expected compared with cisgender women (standardised incidence ratio 0.2, 95% confidence interval 0.1 to 0.5). CONCLUSIONS: This study showed an increased risk of breast cancer in trans women compared with cisgender men, and a lower risk in trans men compared with cisgender women. In trans women, the risk of breast cancer increased during a relatively short duration of hormone treatment and the characteristics of the breast cancer resembled a more female pattern. These results suggest that breast cancer screening guidelines for cisgender people are sufficient for transgender people using hormone treatment. ",
        "Effect of Folic Acid and Zinc Supplementation in Men on Semen Quality and Live Birth Among Couples Undergoing Infertility Treatment: A Randomized Clinical Trial. Importance: Dietary supplements marketed for male fertility commonly contain folic acid and zinc based on limited prior evidence for improving semen quality. However, no large-scale trial has examined the efficacy of this therapy for improving semen quality or live birth. Objective: To determine the effect of daily folic acid and zinc supplementation on semen quality and live birth. Design, Setting, and Participants: The Folic Acid and Zinc Supplementation Trial was a multicenter randomized clinical trial. Couples (n\u2009=\u20092370; men aged \u226518 years and women aged 18-45 years) planning infertility treatment were enrolled at 4 US reproductive endocrinology and infertility care study centers between June 2013 and December 2017. The last 6-month study visit for semen collection occurred during August 2018, with chart abstraction of live birth and pregnancy information completed during April 2019. Interventions: Men were block randomized by study center and planned infertility treatment (in vitro fertilization, other treatment at a study site, and other treatment at an outside clinic) to receive either 5 mg of folic acid and 30 mg of elemental zinc (n\u2009=\u20091185) or placebo (n\u2009=\u20091185) daily for 6 months. Main Outcomes and Measures: The co-primary outcomes were live birth (resulting from pregnancies occurring within 9 months of randomization) and semen quality parameters (sperm concentration, motility, morphology, volume, DNA fragmentation, and total motile sperm count) at 6 months after randomization. Results: Among 2370 men who were randomized (mean age, 33 years), 1773 (75%) attended the final 6-month study visit. Live birth outcomes were available for all couples, and 1629 men (69%) had semen available for analysis at 6 months after randomization. Live birth was not significantly different between treatment groups (404 [34%] in the folic acid and zinc group and 416 [35%] in the placebo group; risk difference, -0.9% [95% CI, -4.7% to 2.8%]). Most of the semen quality parameters (sperm concentration, motility, morphology, volume, and total motile sperm count) were not significantly different between treatment groups at 6 months after randomization. A statistically significant increase in DNA fragmentation was observed with folic acid and zinc supplementation (mean of 29.7% for percentage of DNA fragmentation in the folic acid and zinc group and 27.2% in the placebo group; mean difference, 2.4% [95% CI, 0.5% to 4.4%]). Gastrointestinal symptoms were more common with folic acid and zinc supplementation compared with placebo (abdominal discomfort or pain: 66 [6%] vs 40 [3%], respectively; nausea: 50 [4%] vs 24 [2%]; and vomiting: 32 [3%] vs 17 [1%]). Conclusions and Relevance: Among a general population of couples seeking infertility treatment, the use of folic acid and zinc supplementation by male partners, compared with placebo, did not significantly improve semen quality or couples' live birth rates. These findings do not support the use of folic acid and zinc supplementation by male partners in the treatment of infertility. Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01857310. ",
        "2 years of calorie restriction and cardiometabolic risk (CALERIE): exploratory outcomes of a multicentre, phase 2, randomised controlled trial. BACKGROUND: For several cardiometabolic risk factors, values considered within normal range are associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. We aimed to investigate the short-term and long-term effects of calorie restriction with adequate nutrition on these risk factors in healthy, lean, or slightly overweight young and middle-aged individuals. METHODS: CALERIE was a phase 2, multicentre, randomised controlled trial in young and middle-aged (21-50 years), healthy non-obese (BMI 22\u00b70-27\u00b79 kg/m2) men and women done in three clinical centres in the USA. Participants were randomly assigned (2:1) to a 25% calorie restriction diet or an ad libitum control diet. Exploratory cardiometabolic risk factor responses to a prescribed 25% calorie restriction diet for 2 years were evaluated (systolic, diastolic, and mean blood pressure; plasma lipids; high-sensitivity C-reactive protein; metabolic syndrome score; and glucose homoeostasis measures of fasting insulin, glucose, insulin resistance, and 2-h glucose, area-under-the curve for glucose, and insulin from an oral glucose tolerance test) analysed in the intention-to-treat population. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00427193. FINDINGS: From May 8, 2007, to Feb 26, 2010, of 238 participants that were assessed, 218 were randomly assigned to and started a 25% calorie restriction diet (n=143, 66%) or an ad libitum control diet (n=75, 34%). Individuals in the calorie restriction group achieved a mean reduction in calorie intake of 11\u00b79% (SE 0\u00b77; from 2467 kcal to 2170 kcal) versus 0\u00b78% (1\u00b70) in the control group, and a sustained mean weight reduction of 7\u00b75 kg (SE 0\u00b74) versus an increase of 0\u00b71 kg (0\u00b75) in the control group, of which 71% (mean change in fat mass 5\u00b73 kg [SE 0\u00b73] divided by mean change in weight 7\u00b75 kg [0\u00b74]) was fat mass loss. Calorie restriction caused a persistent and significant reduction from baseline to 2 years of all measured conventional cardiometabolic risk factors, including change scores for LDL-cholesterol (p<0\u00b70001), total cholesterol to HDL-cholesterol ratio (p<0\u00b70001), and systolic (p<0\u00b70011) and diastolic (p<0\u00b70001) blood pressure. In addition, calorie restriction resulted in a significant improvement at 2 years in C-reactive protein (p=0\u00b7012), insulin sensitivity index (p<0\u00b70001), and metabolic syndrome score (p<0\u00b70001) relative to control. A sensitivity analysis revealed the responses to be robust after controlling for relative weight loss changes. INTERPRETATION: 2 years of moderate calorie restriction significantly reduced multiple cardiometabolic risk factors in young, non-obese adults. These findings suggest the potential for a substantial advantage for cardiovascular health of practicing moderate calorie restriction in young and middle-aged healthy individuals, and they offer promise for pronounced long-term population health benefits.

        "Reoperations After Bariatric Surgery in 26 Years of Follow-up of the Swedish Obese Subjects Study. Importance: Bariatric surgery is an established treatment for obesity, but knowledge on the long-term incidence of revisional surgery is scarce. Objective: To determine the incidence and type of revisional surgery after bariatric surgery in 26 years of follow-up of participants in the Swedish Obese Subjects (SOS) study. Design, Setting, and Participants: The SOS study is a prospective nonrandomized controlled study comparing bariatric surgery (banding, vertical banded gastroplasty [VBG], and gastric bypass [GBP]) with usual care. The bariatric surgeries in the SOS study were conducted at 25 public surgical departments in Sweden. Men with body mass index values of 34 or higher and women with body mass indexes of 38 or higher were recruited to the surgery group of the SOS study between September 1, 1987, and January 31, 2001, and follow-up continued until December 31, 2014. Data analysis occurred from November 2016 to April 2018. Interventions: Banding, VBG, or GBP. Main Outcomes and Measures: Revisional surgeries, analyzed using data from questionnaires, hospital records, and the Swedish National Patient register through December 31, 2014. Results: A total of 2010 participants underwent surgery. The age range was 37 to 60 years. A total of 376 participants underwent banding (18.7%), while 1365 had VBG (67.9%) and 266 had GBP (13.2%). During a median follow-up of 19 years, 559 participants (27.8%) underwent first-time revisional surgery, including 354 conversions to other bariatric procedures (17.6%), 114 corrective surgeries (5.6%), and 91 reversals to normal anatomy (4.5%). Revisional surgeries (conversions, corrective surgery, and reversals) were common after banding (153 of 376 [40.7%]) and VBG (386 of 1365 [28.3%]) but relatively rare after GBP (20 of 266 [7.5%]). Patients who had banding and VBG primarily underwent conversions to GBP or reversals. Incidence of reversals was 5 times higher after banding than after VBG (40.7% vs 7.5%; unadjusted hazard ratio, 5.19 [95% CI, 3.43-7.87]; P\u2009<\u2009.001). Corrective surgeries were equally common irrespective of the index surgery (72 of 1365 patients who had VBG [5.3%]; 23 of 376 patients who had banding [6.1%]; 19 of 266 patients who had GBP [7.1%]). Revisional surgery indications, including inadequate weight loss, band-associated complications (migration, stenosis, and slippage), staple-line disruptions, and postsurgical morbidity, varied depending on index surgery subgroup. Most corrections occurred within the first 10 years, whereas conversions and reversals occurred over the entire follow-up period. Conclusions and Relevance: Corrective surgeries occur mainly within the first 10 years and with similar incidences across all 3 surgical subgroups, but indications varied. Conversions (mainly to GBP) and reversals occurred after many years and were most frequent after banding and VBG, reflecting a higher overall revisional surgery demand after these operations. ",
        "The Effect of Liquid Meal Replacements on Cardiometabolic Risk Factors in Overweight/Obese Individuals With Type 2 Diabetes: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials. OBJECTIVE: The evidence for liquid meal replacements in diabetes has not been summarized. Our objective was to synthesize the evidence of the effect of liquid meal replacements on cardiometabolic risk factors in overweight/obese individuals with type 2 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Data sources included MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library through 10 December 2018. We included randomized trials of \u22652 weeks assessing the effect of liquid meal replacements in weight loss diets compared with traditional weight loss diets on cardiometabolic risk factors in overweight/obese subjects with type 2 diabetes. Two independent reviewers extracted relevant data and assessed risk of bias. Data were pooled using the inverse variance method. The overall certainty of the evidence was evaluated using GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation). RESULTS: Nine trial comparisons (N = 961 [median follow-up 24 weeks]) met eligibility criteria. Mean differences were for body weight -2.37 kg (95% CI -3.30 to -1.44), BMI -0.87 kg/m2 (-1.31 to -0.42), body fat -1.66% (-2.17 to -1.15), waist circumference -2.24 cm (-3.72 to -0.77), HbA1c -0.43% (-0.66 to -0.19) (-4.7 mmol/mol [-7.2 to -2.1]), fasting glucose -0.63 mmol/L (-0.99 to -0.27), fasting insulin -11.83 pmol/L (-23.11 to -0.54), systolic blood pressure -4.97mmHg (-7.32 to -2.62), and diastolic blood pressure -1.98 mmHg (-3.05 to -0.91). There was no effect on blood lipids. The overall certainty of the evidence was low to moderate owing to imprecision and/or inconsistency. CONCLUSIONS: Liquid meal replacements in weight loss diets lead to modest reductions in body weight, BMI, and systolic blood pressure, and reductions of marginal clinical significance in body fat, waist circumference, HbA1c, fasting glucose, fasting insulin, and diastolic blood pressure. More high-quality trials are needed to improve the certainty in our estimates. ",
        "Effect of Platelet-Rich Plasma Injection for Rejuvenation of Photoaged Facial Skin: A Randomized Clinical Trial. Importance: There remains little experimental evidence and no randomized clinical trial to date to confirm the benefit of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) for facial rejuvenation. Objective: To investigate whether PRP injection improves the visual appearance, including texture and color, of photodamaged facial skin. Design, Setting, and Participants: In this randomized clinical trial, participants and raters were masked to groupings. The setting was an academic-based, urban outpatient dermatology practice in Chicago, Illinois. Participants were adults aged 18 to 70 years with bilateral cheek rhytids of Glogau class II or greater. The duration of the study was August 21, 2012, to February 16, 2016. Interventions: Each participant received 3 mL intradermal injections of PRP to one cheek and sterile normal saline to the contralateral cheek. Main Outcomes and Measures: Primary outcomes were photoaging scores (with subscores for fine lines, mottled pigmentation, roughness, and sallowness) as rated by 2 masked dermatologists. Secondary outcomes included participant self-assessment scores of improvement on a 5-point scale (worsening, no change, mild improvement, moderate improvement, or significant improvement), participant overall satisfaction scores on a 4-point scale (not satisfied, slightly satisfied, moderately satisfied, or very satisfied), and participant-reported or investigator-observed adverse events. Results: Of 27 enrolled participants, 19 (mean [SD] age, 46.37 [10.88] years; 17 female) were analyzed. Reported adverse events, which were not associated with the study agent, included redness (n\u2009=\u200918), swelling (n\u2009=\u200916), bruising (n\u2009=\u200914), pruritus (n\u2009=\u20091), skin scaling (n\u2009=\u20091), and dryness of skin (n\u2009=\u20091). No participants reported any adverse events at 12 months. Mean (SD) photoaging scores rated by 2 dermatologists showed no significant difference between PRP and normal saline for fine lines (baseline, 1.00 [0.75] vs 1.05 [0.78]; 2 weeks, 0.95 [0.71] vs 0.95 [0.71]; 3 months, 0.95 [0.71] vs 0.95 [0.71]; 6 months, 0.95 [0.71] vs 0.95 [0.71]), mottled pigmentation (baseline, 1.21 [0.53] vs 1.21 [0.54]; 2 weeks, 1.16 [0.60] vs 1.16 [0.60]; 3 months, 1.00 [0.47] vs 1.11 [0.46]; 6 months, 1.16 [0.69] vs 1.16 [0.69]), skin roughness (baseline, 0.47 [0.61] vs 0.47 [0.61]; 2 weeks, 0.47 [0.61] vs 0.47 [0.61]; 3 months, 0.47 [0.61] vs 0.47 [0.61]; 6 months, 0.37 [0.60] vs 0.37 [0.68]), and skin sallowness (baseline, 1.11 [0.88] vs 1.11 [0.88]; 2 weeks, 0.95 [0.85] vs 0.95 [0.85]; 3 months, 0.58 [0.61] vs 0.58 [0.61]; 6 months, 0.37 [0.68] vs 0.37 [0.68]). At 6 months after a single treatment, participants rated the PRP-treated side as significantly more improved compared with normal saline for texture (mean [SD] self-assessment score, 2.00 [1.20] vs 1.21 [0.54]; P\u2009=\u2009.02) and wrinkles (mean [SD] self-assessment score, 1.74 [0.99] vs 1.21 [0.54]; P\u2009=\u2009.03). Conclusions and Relevance: Masked participants noted that both fine and coarse texture improved significantly more with a single treatment of PRP than with normal saline. Both participants and raters found PRP to be nominally but not significantly superior to normal saline. Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01372566. ",
        "Fracture Risk After Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass vs Adjustable Gastric Banding Among Medicare Beneficiaries. Importance: Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) is associated with significant bone loss and may increase fracture risk, whereas substantial bone loss and increased fracture risk have not been reported after adjustable gastric banding (AGB). Previous studies have had little representation of patients aged 65 years or older, and it is currently unknown how age modifies fracture risk. Objective: To compare fracture risk after RYGB and AGB procedures in a large, nationally representative cohort enriched for older adults. Design, Setting, and Participants: This population-based retrospective cohort analysis used Medicare claims data from January 1, 2006, to December 31, 2014, from 42\u202f345 severely obese adults, of whom 29\u202f624 received RYGB and 12 721 received AGB. Data analysis was performed from April 2017 to November 2018. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was incident nonvertebral (ie, wrist, humerus, pelvis, and hip) fractures after RYGB and AGB surgery defined using a combination of International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Edition and Current Procedural Terminology 4 codes. Results: Of 42\u202f345 participants, 33\u202f254 (78.5%) were women. With a mean (SD) age of 51 (12) years, recipients of RYGB were younger than AGB recipients (55 [12] years). Both groups had similar comorbidities, medication use, and health care utilization in the 365 days before surgery. Over a mean (SD) follow-up of 3.5 (2.1) years, 658 nonvertebral fractures were documented. The fracture incidence rate was 6.6 (95% CI, 6.0-7.2) after RYGB and 4.6 (95% CI, 3.9-5.3) after AGB, which translated to a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.73 (95% CI, 1.45-2.08) after multivariable adjustment. Site-specific analyses demonstrated an increased fracture risk at the hip (HR, 2.81; 95% CI, 1.82-4.49), wrist (HR, 1.70; 95% CI, 1.33-2.14), and pelvis (HR, 1.48; 95% CI, 1.08-2.07) among RYGB recipients. No significant interactions of fracture risk with age, sex, diabetes status, or race were found. In particular, adults 65 years and older showed similar patterns of fracture risk to younger adults. Sensitivity analyses using propensity score matching showed similar results (nonvertebral fracture: HR 1.75; 95% CI, 1.22-2.52). Conclusions and Relevance: This study of a large, US population-based cohort including a substantial population of older adults found a 73% increased risk of nonvertebral fracture after RYGB compared with AGB, including increased risk of hip, wrist, and pelvis fractures. Fracture risk was consistently increased among RYGB patients vs AGB across different subgroups, and to a similar degree among older and younger adults. Increased fracture risk appears to be an important unintended consequence of RYGB. ",
        "Changes in Age Distribution of Obesity-Associated Cancers. Importance: Recent studies have documented an association between overweight and obesity and certain cancers, as well as an increased incidence of obesity-associated cancers (OACs) in younger individuals. However, although important for cancer-control efforts, it is not known which subgroups of the population are most affected by these changes. Objective: To examine temporal shifts in age distribution of OACs and non-OACs across race/ethnicity- and sex-specific strata. Design, Setting, and Participants: This population-based, cross-sectional study assessed individuals residing in Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results sites who were diagnosed with incident OACs and non-OACs from January 1, 2000, to December 31, 2016. Data analysis was performed from August 1, 2018, to June 30, 2019. Exposure: Study years. Main Outcomes and Measures: Changes in the age distribution of incident cases across race/ethnicity- and sex-specific strata over time. For all OACs and non-OACs, changes in the incidence rates, the number of incident cases, and the distribution of the cases across population subgroups were studied. Race/ethnicity- and sex-stratified logistic regression analysis was performed to determine whether the annual change in the odds associated with an age group increased (or decreased) to a greater (or lesser) extent in OACs than in non-OACs. Heat maps were created to highlight the change in the number of cases during the study period for each OAC and select non-OACs. Results: The study population included 2\u202f665\u202f574 incident OAC cases (70.3% women) and 3\u202f448\u202f126 incident non-OAC cases (32.0% women). From 2000 to 2016, the distribution by age showed that the percentage of incident cases increased in the 50- to 64-year age group for both OACs and non-OACs. The increase in the number of OACs in this age group ranged from 25.3% in non-Hispanic white women to 197.8% in Hispanic men. The change in the number of OACs in the 20- to 49-year age group ranged from -5.9% in non-Hispanic white women to 94.6% in Hispanic women, and the increase in the number of OACs in the 65 years or older group ranged from 2.5% in non-Hispanic white women to 102.0% in Hispanic women. Logistic regression analysis revealed a greater annual increase in the odds for OACs than for non-OACs for individuals in the 50- to 64-year age group but a decrease for individuals in the 65 years or older group. Among men in the 50- to 64-year age group, the OAC to non-OAC ratio of odds ratios (ORs) ranged from 1.005 (95% CI, 1.002-1.008) in non-Hispanic black men to 1.013 (95% CI, 1.012-1.014) in non-Hispanic white men, implying that the annual increase was 0.5% higher for OACs than for non-OACs in non-Hispanic black men and 1.3% higher for OACs than for non-OACs in non-Hispanic white men. Among women in the 50- to 64-year age group, the OAC to non-OAC ratio of ORs ranged from 1.002 (95% CI, 0.999-1.006) in Hispanic women to 1.005 (95% CI, 1.002-1.009) in non-Hispanic black women. In men and women aged 65 or older, the OAC vs non-OAC ratio of ORs was consistently less than 1.000 for all race/ethnicity groups, indicating that whereas the OAC group experienced a decrease in this age group, the non-OACs experienced either a smaller decrease or an increase over time. Conclusions and Relevance: This study indicates that from 2000 to 2016, a shift toward younger age groups occurred in incident OACs. The findings have important public health implications and suggest that interventions to reduce obesity and to implement individualized screening programs are needed. ",
        "Effect of Aerobic or Resistance Exercise, or Both, on Bone Mineral Density and Bone Metabolism in Obese Older Adults While Dieting: A Randomized Controlled Trial. Weight loss therapy of older adults with obesity is limited by weight loss-induced decrease in bone mineral density (BMD), which could exacerbate ongoing age-related bone loss and increase the risk for fractures. Therefore, it is recommended that weight loss therapy of older adults with obesity should include an intervention such as regular exercise to reduce the concomitant bone loss. However, the most appropriate exercise types to combine with weight loss therapy in this older population is unknown. In a randomized controlled trial, we performed a head-to-head comparison of aerobic or resistance exercise, or both, during matched ~10% weight loss in 160 older adults with obesity. We measured changes in BMD (total hip, femoral neck, trochanter, intertrochanter, one-third radius, lumbar spine) and bone markers. Changes between groups were analyzed using mixed-model repeated measures analyses of variance. After 6\u2009months of intensive lifestyle interventions, BMD decreased less in the resistance group (-0.006\u2009g/cm2 [-0.7%]) and combination group (-0.012\u2009g/cm2 [-1.1%]) than in the aerobic group (-0.027\u2009g/cm2 [-2.6%]) (p = 0.001 for between-group comparisons). Serum C-telopeptide, procollagen type 1\u2009N-propeptide, and osteocalcin concentrations increased more in the aerobic group (33%, 16%, and 16%, respectively) than in the resistance group (7%, 2%, and 0%, respectively) and combination group (11%, 2%, and 5%, respectively) (p = 0.004 to 0.048 for between-group comparisons). Multiple regression analyses revealed that the decline in whole body mass and serum leptin were the independent predictors of the decline in hip BMD (multiple R = 0.45 [p\u2009<\u2009.001]). These findings indicate that compared with aerobic exercise, resistance and combined aerobic and resistance exercise are associated with less weight loss-induced decrease in hip BMD and less weight loss-induced increase in bone turnover. Therefore, both resistance and combined aerobic and resistance exercise can be recommended to protect against bone loss during weight loss therapy of older adults with obesity.

        "Projected U.S. State-Level Prevalence of Adult Obesity and Severe Obesity. BACKGROUND: Although the national obesity epidemic has been well documented, less is known about obesity at the U.S. state level. Current estimates are based on body measures reported by persons themselves that underestimate the prevalence of obesity, especially severe obesity. METHODS: We developed methods to correct for self-reporting bias and to estimate state-specific and demographic subgroup-specific trends and projections of the prevalence of categories of body-mass index (BMI). BMI data reported by 6,264,226 adults (18 years of age or older) who participated in the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System Survey (1993-1994 and 1999-2016) were obtained and corrected for quantile-specific self-reporting bias with the use of measured data from 57,131 adults who participated in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. We fitted multinomial regressions for each state and subgroup to estimate the prevalence of four BMI categories from 1990 through 2030: underweight or normal weight (BMI [the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters], <25), overweight (25 to <30), moderate obesity (30 to <35), and severe obesity (\u226535). We evaluated the accuracy of our approach using data from 1990 through 2010 to predict 2016 outcomes. RESULTS: The findings from our approach suggest with high predictive accuracy that by 2030 nearly 1 in 2 adults will have obesity (48.9%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 47.7 to 50.1), and the prevalence will be higher than 50% in 29 states and not below 35% in any state. Nearly 1 in 4 adults is projected to have severe obesity by 2030 (24.2%; 95% CI, 22.9 to 25.5), and the prevalence will be higher than 25% in 25 states. We predict that, nationally, severe obesity is likely to become the most common BMI category among women (27.6%; 95% CI, 26.1 to 29.2), non-Hispanic black adults (31.7%; 95% CI, 29.9 to 33.4), and low-income adults (31.7%; 95% CI, 30.2 to 33.2). CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis indicates that the prevalence of adult obesity and severe obesity will continue to increase nationwide, with large disparities across states and demographic subgroups.

        "Comparison of Risk of Osteoporotic Fracture in Denosumab vs Alendronate Treatment Within 3 Years of Initiation. Importance: Head-to-head randomized clinical trials showed greater efficacy of denosumab vs alendronate in improving bone mineral density. Although there is an association of changes in bone mineral density with reductions in fracture risk, the magnitude of the association is not well established. Objective: To compare the risk of hip and any fracture in patients treated with denosumab and alendronate in routine practice settings. Design, Setting, and Participants: This Danish nationwide, population-based, historical cohort study of a population with universal access to health care used prospectively collected, individually linked data from Danish health registries with complete follow-up. Cohorts consisted of 92\u202f355 individuals 50 years or older who were new users of denosumab (n\u2009=\u20094624) or alendronate (n\u2009=\u200987\u202f731) from May 2010 to December 2017 after at least 1 year without an antiosteoporosis medication dispensing. Exposures: Initiation of denosumab or alendronate. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was hospitalization for hip fracture, and the secondary outcome was hospitalization for any fracture. Inverse probability of treatment weights and the intention-to-treat approach were used to calculate cumulative incidences and adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) with 95% CIs. Results: Of the 92\u202f355 included patients, 75\u202f046 (81.3%) were women, and the mean (SD) age was 71 (10) years. The denosumab cohort had a lower proportion of men than the alendronate cohort (12.7% [589] vs 19.0% [16\u202f700]), while age distributions were similar in the 2 cohorts. Within 3 years of follow-up, initiation of denosumab or alendronate was associated with cumulative incidences of 3.7% and 3.1%, respectively, for hip fracture and 9.0% and 9.0%, respectively, for any fracture. Overall, the aHRs for denosumab vs alendronate were 1.08 (95% CI, 0.92-1.28) for hip fracture and 0.92 (95% CI, 0.83-1.02) for any fracture. The aHR of denosumab vs alendronate for hip fracture was 1.07 (95% CI, 0.85-1.34) among patients with a history of any fracture and 1.05 (95% CI, 0.83-1.32) among patients without history of fracture. The aHR for any fracture for denosumab vs alendronate was 0.84 (95% CI, 0.71-0.98) among patients with a history of any fracture and 0.77 (95% CI, 0.64-0.93) among patients with no history of fracture. Conclusions and Relevance: Treatment with denosumab and alendronate was associated with similar risks of hip or any fracture over a 3-year period, regardless of fracture history. ",
        "Psychosocial stress and bone loss among postmenopausal women: results from the Women's Health Initiative. BACKGROUND: Bone loss is a major public health concern with large proportions of older women experiencing osteoporotic fractures. Previous research has established a relationship between psychosocial stressors and fractures. However, few studies have investigated bone loss as an intermediary in this relationship. This study investigates whether social stress is associated with bone loss during a 6-year period in postmenopausal women. METHODS: Data from 11\u2009020 postmenopausal women from the USA was used to examine self-reported psychosocial stress in relation to change in bone mineral density (BMD) measured at the femoral neck, lumbar spine and total hip. Linear regression models were used to examine associations between social measures of psychosocial stress (social strain, social functioning and social support) and per cent change in BMD over 6\u2009years. RESULTS: High social stress was associated with decreased BMD over 6\u2009years. After adjustment for confounders, each point higher in social strain was associated with 0.082% greater loss of femoral neck BMD, 0.108% greater loss of total hip BMD and 0.069% greater loss of lumbar spine BMD (p<0.05). Low social functioning and low social support were associated with greater decreases in femoral neck BMD, and low social functioning was associated with greater decreases in total hip BMD. CONCLUSION: The findings provide evidence for an association between high social stress and greater bone loss over 6\u2009years of follow-up. In agreement with the prior literature, the findings for social strain and social functioning suggest that poor quality of social relationships may be associated with bone loss in postmenopausal women.

        "Changes in Bone Mineral Density After Prophylactic Bilateral Salpingo-Oophorectomy in Carriers of a BRCA Mutation. Importance: Preventive surgery is strongly recommended for individuals with a BRCA mutation at a young age to prevent ovarian cancer and improve overall survival. The overall effect of early surgical menopause on various health outcomes, including bone health, has not been clearly elucidated. Objective: To evaluate the association of prophylactic bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy with bone mineral density (BMD) loss among individuals with a BRCA mutation. Design, Setting, and Participants: This retrospective cohort study of participants with a BRCA mutation who underwent oophorectomy through the University Health Network, Toronto, Ontario, Canada, recruited participants from January 2000 to May 2013. Eligibility criteria included having a BRCA mutation, at least 1 ovary intact prior to surgery, and no history of any cancer other than breast cancer. Bone mineral density was measured using dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry before and after surgery. Data analysis began in December 2018 and finished in January 2019. Main Outcomes and Measures: The annual change in BMD from baseline to follow-up was calculated for the following 3 anatomical locations: (1) lumbar spine, (2) femoral neck, and (3) total hip. Results: A total of 95 women had both a baseline and postsurgery BMD measurement with a mean (SD) follow-up period of 22.0 (12.7) months. The mean (SD) age at oophorectomy was 48.0 (7.4) years. Among women who were premenopausal at time of surgery (50 [53%]), there was a decrease in BMD from baseline to follow-up across the lumbar spine (annual change, -3.45%; 95% CI, -4.61% to -2.29%), femoral neck (annual change, -2.85%; 95% CI, -3.79% to -1.91%), and total hip (annual change, -2.24%; 95% CI, -3.11% to -1.38%). Self-reported hormone therapy use was associated with significantly less bone loss at the lumbar spine (-2.00% vs -4.69%; P\u2009=\u2009.02) and total hip (-1.38% vs -3.21; P\u2009=\u2009.04) compared with no hormone therapy use. Among postmenopausal women at time of surgery (45 [47%]), there was also a significant decrease in BMD across the lumbar spine (annual change, -0.82%; 95% CI, -1.42% to -0.23%) and femoral neck (annual change, -0.68%; 95% CI, -1.33% to -0.04%) but not total hip (annual change, -0.18%; 95% CI, -0.82% to 0.46%). Conclusions and Relevance: This study found that oophorectomy was associated with postoperative bone loss, especially among women who were premenopausal at the time of surgery. Targeted management strategies should include routine BMD assessment and hormone therapy use to improve management of bone health in this population. ",
        "Association Between Drug Treatments for Patients With Osteoporosis and Overall Mortality Rates: A Meta-analysis. Importance: Previous studies have reported that drug treatments, particularly treatment with bisphosphonates, is associated with reduced overall mortality rates in addition to decreased fracture risk. If so, drug treatments should be recommended for this reason alone, regardless of a patient's risk of fracture. Objective: To assess whether randomized clinical trials demonstrate that treatment with bisphosphonates, particularly zoledronate, is associated with reduced mortality rates. Data Sources: Science Direct, MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Library were searched for randomized placebo-controlled clinical trials of drug treatments for osteoporosis published after 2009 and published or in press before April 19, 2019. Conference abstracts from annual osteoporosis society meetings were also included in the search. Study Selection: Included studies were clinical trials that (1) were randomized and placebo-controlled; (2) studied drug treatments with proven antifracture efficacy; (3) used agents at the approved dose for treatment of osteoporosis; and (4) had a duration of 1 year or more. Abstracts from the literature searches were reviewed for inclusion and exclusion criteria, and mortality rate data were abstracted from the article by 1 researcher and validated by a second. A total of 2045 records were screened; 38 (1.8%) were included in the meta-analyses. Data Extraction and Synthesis: The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) checklist was followed for abstracting data and assessing data quality and validity. Data were pooled using random-effects models, and between-study variability was assessed using the I2 index. The risk of bias for each study was assessed, and funnel plots and Egger and Begg statistics were used to evaluate publication bias. Main Outcomes and Measures: Associations of all drug treatments, particularly bisphosphonate and zoledronate treatments, with overall mortality. Results: Of 38 clinical trials that included 101\u202f642 unique participants, 38 were included in the meta-analyses of all drug treatments (45\u202f594 participants randomized to placebo; 56\u202f048 to treatment); 21 clinical trials, of bisphosphonate treatments (20\u202f244 participants randomized to placebo; 22\u202f623 to treatment); and 6 clinical trials, of zoledronate treatments (6944 participants randomized to placebo; 6926 to treatment). No significant association was found between all drug treatments for osteoporosis and overall mortality rate (risk ratio [RR], 0.98; 95% CI, 0.91-1.05; I2\u2009=\u20090%). Clinical trials of bisphosphonate treatment (RR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.86-1.04) showed no significant association with overall mortality. Also, clinical trials of zoledronate treatment (RR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.68-1.13) showed no association with overall mortality rate; however, evidence existed for heterogeneity of the results (I2\u2009=\u200948.2%). Conclusions and Relevance: Results of this meta-analysis suggest that bisphosphonate treatment may not be associated with reduced overall mortality rates in addition to decreased fracture risk and should only be recommended to reduce fracture risk. Additional trials are needed to clarify whether treatment with zoledronate reduces mortality rates. ",
        "Effect of High-Dose Vitamin D Supplementation on Volumetric Bone Density and Bone Strength: A Randomized Clinical Trial. Importance: Few studies have assessed the effects of daily vitamin D doses at or above the tolerable upper intake level for 12 months or greater, yet 3% of US adults report vitamin D intakes of at least 4000 IU per day. Objective: To assess the dose-dependent effect of vitamin D supplementation on volumetric bone mineral density (BMD) and strength. Design, Setting, and Participants: Three-year, double-blind, randomized clinical trial conducted in a single center in Calgary, Canada, from August 2013 to December 2017, including 311 community-dwelling healthy adults without osteoporosis, aged 55 to 70 years, with baseline levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) of 30 to 125 nmol/L. Interventions: Daily doses of vitamin D3 for 3 years at 400 IU (n\u2009=\u2009109), 4000 IU (n\u2009=\u2009100), or 10\u202f000 IU (n\u2009=\u2009102). Calcium supplementation was provided to participants with dietary intake of less than 1200 mg per day. Main Outcomes and Measures: Co-primary outcomes were total volumetric BMD at radius and tibia, assessed with high resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography, and bone strength (failure load) at radius and tibia estimated by finite element analysis. Results: Of 311 participants who were randomized (53% men; mean [SD] age, 62.2 [4.2] years), 287 (92%) completed the study. Baseline, 3-month, and 3-year levels of 25(OH)D were 76.3, 76.7, and 77.4 nmol/L for the 400-IU group; 81.3, 115.3, and 132.2 for the 4000-IU group; and 78.4, 188.0, and 144.4 for the 10\u202f000-IU group. There were significant group\u2009\u00d7\u2009time interactions for volumetric BMD. At trial end, radial volumetric BMD was lower for the 4000 IU group (-3.9 mg HA/cm3 [95% CI, -6.5 to -1.3]) and 10\u202f000 IU group (-7.5 mg HA/cm3 [95% CI, -10.1 to -5.0]) compared with the 400 IU group with mean percent change in volumetric BMD of -1.2% (400 IU group), -2.4% (4000 IU group), and -3.5% (10\u202f000 IU group). Tibial volumetric BMD differences from the 400 IU group were -1.8 mg HA/cm3 (95% CI, -3.7 to 0.1) in the 4000 IU group and -4.1 mg HA/cm3 in the 10\u202f000 IU group (95% CI, -6.0 to -2.2), with mean percent change values of -0.4% (400 IU), -1.0% (4000 IU), and -1.7% (10\u202f000 IU). There were no significant differences for changes in failure load (radius, P\u2009=\u2009.06; tibia, P\u2009=\u2009.12). Conclusions and Relevance: Among healthy adults, treatment with vitamin D for 3 years at a dose of 4000 IU per day or 10\u202f000 IU per day, compared with 400 IU per day, resulted in statistically significant lower radial BMD; tibial BMD was significantly lower only with the 10\u202f000 IU per day dose. There were no significant differences in bone strength at either the radius or tibia. These findings do not support a benefit of high-dose vitamin D supplementation for bone health; further research would be needed to determine whether it is harmful.

Patients: 150 patients aged 18 to 79 years with persistent Hashimoto-related symptoms despite euthyroid status while receiving hormone replacement therapy and with serum antithyroid peroxidase (anti-TPO) antibody titers greater than 1000 IU/mL. Intervention: Total thyroidectomy or medical management with hormone substitution to secure euthyroid status in both groups. Measurements: The primary outcome was general health score on the Short Form-36 Health Survey (SF-36) at 18 months. Secondary outcomes were adverse effects of surgery, the other 7 SF-36 subscores, fatigue questionnaire scores, and serum anti-TPO antibody titers at 6, 12, and 18 months. Results: During follow-up, only the surgical group demonstrated improvement: Mean general health score increased from 38 to 64 points, for a between-group difference of 29 points (95% CI, 22 to 35 points) at 18 months. Fatigue score decreased from 23 to 14 points, for a between-group difference of 9.3 points (CI, 7.4 to 11.2 points). Chronic fatigue frequency decreased from 82% to 35%, for a between-group difference of 39 percentage points (CI, 23 to 53 percentage points). Median serum anti-TPO antibody titers decreased from 2232 to 152 IU/mL, for a between-group difference of 1148 IU/mL (CI, 1080 to 1304 IU/mL). In multivariable regression analyses, the adjusted treatment effects remained similar to the unadjusted effects. Limitation: Results are applicable only to a subgroup of patients with Hashimoto disease, and follow-up was limited to 18 months. Conclusion: Total thyroidectomy improved health-related quality of life and fatigue, whereas medical therapy did not. This improvement, along with concomitant elimination of serum anti-TPO antibodies, may elucidate disease mechanisms. Primary Funding Source: Telemark Hospital. ",
        "Association of Systemic Antibiotic Treatment of Acne With Skin Microbiota Characteristics. Importance: Given the widespread use of systemic antibiotics for treatment of moderate to severe acne, it is important to understand the associations of such antibiotic use with changes not only in Cutibacterium acnes (formerly Propionibacterium acnes) but also in the complete bacterial community of the skin. Objective: To examine the composition, diversity, and resilience of skin microbiota associated with systemic antibiotic perturbation in individuals with acne. Design, Setting, and Participants: This longitudinal cohort study conducted at an academic referral center in Maryland from February 11 to September 23, 2014, included 4 female participants who had received a recent diagnosis of acne vulgaris, showed comedonal and inflammatory acne on the face, were at least 18 years old, and had no recent use of systemic or topical treatments for acne, including antibiotics and retinoids. Data analysis was performed between July 5, 2017, and November 7, 2018. Interventions: Participants were prescribed oral minocycline, 100 mg, twice daily for 4 weeks. Skin areas on the forehead, cheek, and chin were sampled for 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing at baseline, 4 weeks after starting minocycline treatment, and then 1 week and 8 weeks after discontinuation of treatment. Main Outcomes and Measures: Skin microbiota examined with respect to relative abundance of bacterial taxa, \u03b1 diversity (represents within-sample microbial diversity), and \u03b2 diversity (represents between-sample microbial diversity). Acne status evaluated with photography and lesion count. Results: Of the 4 patients included in this study, 2 were 25 years old, 1 was 29 years old, and 1 was 35 years old; 2 were white women, 1 was an African American woman, and 1 was an Asian woman. Across all 4 patients, antibiotic treatment was associated with a 1.4-fold reduction in the level of C acnes (difference, -10.3%; 95% CI, -19.9% to -0.7%; P\u2009=\u2009.04) with recovery following cessation of treatment. Distinct patterns of change were identified in multiple bacterial genera, including a transient 5.6-fold increase in the relative abundance of Pseudomonas species (difference, 2.2%; 95% CI, 0.9%-3.4%; P\u2009<\u2009.001) immediately following antibiotic treatment, as well as a persistent 1.7-fold increase in the relative abundance of Streptococcus species (difference, 5.4%; 95% CI, 0.3%-10.6%; P\u2009=\u2009.04) and a 4.7-fold decrease in the relative abundance of Lactobacillus species (difference, -0.8%; 95% CI, -1.4% to -0.2%; P\u2009=\u2009.02) 8 weeks following antibiotic treatment withdrawal. In general, antibiotic administration was associated with an initial decrease from baseline of bacterial diversity followed by recovery. Principal coordinates analysis results showed moderate clustering of samples by patient (analysis of similarity, R\u2009=\u20090.424; P\u2009=\u2009.001) and significant clustering of samples by time in one participant (analysis of similarity, R\u2009=\u20090.733; P\u2009=\u2009.001). Conclusions and Relevance: In this study, systemic antibiotic treatment of acne was associated with changes in the composition and diversity of skin microbiota, with variable rates of recovery across individual patients and parallel changes in specific bacterial populations. Understanding the association between systemic antibiotic use and skin microbiota may help clinicians decrease the likelihood of skin comorbidities related to microbial dysbiosis. ",
        "Patient Eligibility for Transoral Endocrine Surgery Procedures in the United States. Importance: Transoral endocrine surgery (TES) allows thyroid and parathyroid operations to be performed without leaving any visible scar on the body. Controversy regarding the value of TES remains, in part owing to the common belief that TES is only applicable to a small, select group of patients. Knowledge of the overall applicability of these procedures is essential to understand the operation, as well as to decide the amount of effort and resources that should be allocated to further study the safety, efficacy, and value of these operations. Objective: To determine what percentage of US patients undergoing thyroid and parathyroid surgery are eligible for TES using currently accepted exclusion criteria. Design, Setting, and Participants: Cross-sectional study of 1000 consecutive thyroid and parathyroid operations (with or without neck dissection) performed between July 1, 2015, and July 1, 2018, at 3 high-volume academic US thyroid- and parathyroid-focused surgical practices (2 general surgery, 1 otolaryngology-head and neck endocrine surgery). Eligibility for TES was determined by retrospectively applying previously published exclusion criteria to the cases. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was the percentage of thyroid and parathyroid cases eligible for TES. Secondary outcomes were a subgroup analysis of the percentage of specific types of cases eligible and the reasons for ineligibility. Results: The mean (SD) age of the 1000 surgical patients was 53 (15) years, mean (SD) body mass index (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) was 29 (7), and 747 (75.0%) of the patients were women. Five hundred fifty-eight (55.8%) of the patients were eligible for TES. Most patients with thyroid nodules with cytologically indeterminate behavior (165 of 217 [76.0%]), benign thyroid conditions (166 of 240 [69.2%]), and primary hyperparathyroidism (158 of 273 [57.9%]) were eligible for TES, but only 67 of 231 (29.0%) of patients with thyroid cancer were eligible. Among all 1000 cases reviewed, previous neck operation (97 of 441 [22.0%]), nonlocalized primary hyperparathyroidism (78 of 441 [17.7%]), and need for neck dissection (66 of 441 [15.0%]) were the most common reasons for ineligibility. Conclusions and Relevance: More than half of all patients undergoing thyroid and parathyroid surgery in this study were eligible for TES. This broad applicability suggests that a prospective multicenter trial is reasonable to definitively study the safety, outcomes, and cost of TES. ",
        "Association of Radioactive Iodine Treatment With Cancer Mortality in Patients With Hyperthyroidism. Importance: Radioactive iodine (RAI) has been used extensively to treat hyperthyroidism since the 1940s. Although widely considered a safe and effective therapy, RAI has been associated with elevated risks of total and site-specific cancer death among patients with hypothyroidism. Objective: To determine whether greater organ- or tissue-absorbed doses from RAI treatment are associated with overall and site-specific cancer mortality in patients with hyperthyroidism. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study is a 24-year extension of the multicenter Cooperative Thyrotoxicosis Therapy Follow-up Study, which has followed up US and UK patients diagnosed and treated for hyperthyroidism for nearly 7 decades, beginning in 1946. Patients were traced using records from the National Death Index, Social Security Administration, and other resources. After exclusions, 18\u202f805 patients who were treated with RAI and had no history of cancer at the time of the first treatment were eligible for the current analysis. Excess relative risks (ERRs) per 100-mGy dose to the organ or tissue were calculated using multivariable-adjusted linear dose-response models and were converted to relative risks (RR\u2009=\u20091 + ERR). The current analyses were conducted from April 28, 2017, to January 30, 2019. Exposures: Mean total administered activity of sodium iodide I 131 was 375 MBq for patients with Graves disease and 653 MBq for patients with toxic nodular goiter. Mean organ or tissue dose estimates ranged from 20 to 99 mGy (colon or rectum, ovary, uterus, prostate, bladder, and brain/central nervous system), to 100 to 400 mGy (pancreas, kidney, liver, stomach, female breast, lung, oral mucosa, and marrow), to 1.6 Gy (esophagus), and to 130 Gy (thyroid gland). Main Outcomes and Measures: Site-specific and all solid-cancer mortality. Results: A total of 18\u202f805 patients were included in the study cohort, and the mean (SD) entry age was 49 (14) years. Most patients were women (14\u202f671 [78.0%]), and most had a Graves disease diagnosis (17\u202f615 [93.7%]). Statistically significant positive associations were observed for all solid cancer mortality (n\u2009=\u20091984; RR at 100-mGy dose to the stomach\u2009=\u20091.06; 95% CI, 1.02-1.10; P\u2009=\u2009.002), including female breast cancer (n\u2009=\u2009291; RR at 100-mGy dose to the breast\u2009=\u20091.12; 95% CI, 1.003-1.32; P\u2009=\u2009.04) and all other solid cancers combined (n\u2009=\u20091693; RR at 100-mGy dose to the stomach\u2009=\u20091.05; 95% CI, 1.01-1.10; P\u2009=\u2009.01). The 100-mGy dose to the stomach and breast corresponded to a mean (SD) administered activity of 243 (35) MBq and 266 (58) MBq in patients with Graves disease. For every 1000 patients with hyperthyroidism receiving typical doses to the stomach (150 to 250 mGy), an estimated lifetime excess of 19 (95% CI, 3-40) to 32 (95% CI, 5-66) solid cancer deaths could occur. Conclusions and Relevance: In RAI-treated patients with hyperthyroidism, greater organ-absorbed doses appeared to be modestly positively associated with risk of death from solid cancer, including breast cancer. Additional studies are needed of the risks and advantages of all major treatment options available to patients with hyperthyroidism. ",
        "Diagnosis and Management of Primary Hyperparathyroidism Across the Veterans Affairs Health Care System. Importance: Untreated primary hyperparathyroidism impairs quality of life and incurs substantial costs. Parathyroidectomy is a low-risk, high-success, definitive intervention. Objectives: To determine the appropriateness of diagnostic evaluation for primary hyperparathyroidism in patients with hypercalcemia and the use of parathyroidectomy for the treatment of primary hyperparathyroidism across the Veterans Affairs (VA) health care system. Design, Setting, and Participants: A retrospective cohort study of veterans with hypercalcemia and primary hyperparathyroidism was conducted from January 1, 2000, through September 30, 2015, using the VA Corporate Data Warehouse, a national electronic health record-based repository. The study included 371\u202f370 veterans with chronic hypercalcemia and 47\u202f158 veterans with biochemical evidence of primary hyperparathyroidism diagnosed by hypercalcemia, elevated serum parathyroid hormone levels, and near-normal serum creatinine levels. Statistical analysis was performed from April 21, 2017, to April 10, 2019. Main Outcomes and Measures: The proportion of veterans with hypercalcemia who have parathyroid hormone levels evaluated, the proportion of veterans with hyperparathyroidism who are treated surgically, and the factors associated with parathyroidectomy using generalized linear latent and mixed model regression. Results: Of 371\u202f370 patients with chronic hypercalcemia, 86\u202f887 (23.4%) received further testing with parathyroid hormone level. Of 47\u202f158 patients meeting diagnostic criteria for primary hyperparathyroidism (42\u202f737 men [90.6%] and 4421 women [9.4%]; mean [SD] age, 67.3 [11.8] years), 6048 (12.8%) underwent parathyroidectomy. Of 5793 patients with primary hyperparathyroidism presenting with a serum calcium level more than 1 mg/dL above the upper limit of normal, 1501 (25.9%) underwent parathyroidectomy. There was a decreasing trend in the use of parathyroidectomy over time. Factors positively associated with parathyroidectomy were nephrolithiasis (odds ratio [OR], 2.23; 95% CI, 1.90-2.61) and non-Hispanic white race/ethnicity (OR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.17-1.46), while age (OR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.95-0.96), Elixhauser Comorbidity Index score (OR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.72-0.80), decreased estimated glomerular filtration rate (OR, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.45-0.60), and diagnosis of osteoporosis (OR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.52-0.80) were inversely related to surgery. Conclusions and Relevance: From this study's findings, parathyroid hormone level is infrequently tested in patients with hypercalcemia, suggesting underdiagnosis of primary hyperparathyroidism. Patients meeting diagnostic criteria for primary hyperparathyroidism are undertreated with recommended parathyroidectomy. Similar gaps have previously been observed in non-VA care of primary hyperparathyroidism, suggesting the need for a systematic evaluation of barriers to diagnosis and treatment that informs intervention design.

        "Maternal Thyroid Hormone Replacement Therapy Exposure and Language and Communication Skills of Offspring at 8 Years of Age. Importance: Hypothyroidism during pregnancy is associated with neurodevelopmental delays in the offspring. However, it remains unknown whether prenatal thyroid hormone replacement therapy (THRT) has benefits regarding children's language and communication skills. Objective: To quantify associations between prenatal THRT exposure and risk of language impairment diagnosis and parent-reported symptoms of language and communication skill deficits in offspring at 8 years of age. Design, Setting, and Participants: The Norwegian Mother, Father and Child Cohort Study (MoBa), a nationwide population-based cohort study, recruited pregnant women from throughout Norway between June 1999 and December 2008. MoBa was linked to several nationwide registries: the Norwegian Medical Birth Registry, Norwegian Prescription Database, and Norwegian Patient Registry. For this study, the analyzed cohort was restricted to singleton pregnancies resulting in a live-born infant, enrolled in the MoBa between 2005 and 2008. Statistical analysis was performed from January 2 to May 7, 2019. Exposures: In both study samples, mother-child pairs were categorized into 3 mutually exclusive groups: THRT exposure during pregnancy, based on dispensed prescription records; unexposed to THRT during pregnancy (population comparison); and mothers initiating THRT after delivery (THRT after delivery), comprising incident postpartum THRT users. Main Outcomes and Measures: Two defined study samples were analyzed with different outcome measures. In the Norwegian Patient Registry sample, outcome was defined by a diagnosis of language and speech impairment. In the MoBa sample, children were followed up until age 8 years via parental self-completed questionnaires. Hazard ratios were calculated for language impairment diagnosis, estimated by Cox proportional hazards regression. Standardized mean score (\u03b2) was calculated for parent-reported symptoms of language and communication deficits, estimated using generalized linear models. Results: The Norwegian Patient Registry sample included 53\u202f862 mother-child pairs (mean [SD] age, 30.4 [4.6] years; offspring, 26 145 girls and 27\u202f717 boys; 1204 pairs exposed to THRT [2.2%]) and the MoBa sample included 23\u202f686 mother-child pairs (mean [SD] age, 30.8 [4.4] years; offspring, 11\u202f536 girls and 12\u202f150 boys; 532 pairs exposed to THRT [2.2%]). Language and speech impairment diagnosis was not significantly associated with prenatal THRT exposure compared with the unexposed group (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.38-1.43) or the THRT after delivery group (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.26-1.53). Language outcomes also did not significantly differ between these groups. Conclusions and Relevance: There was no significant difference in child outcomes between children exposed to THRT in the prenatal period compared with children in the population comparison group. These results support current guidelines recommending hypothyroidism treatment during pregnancy. Future research should further examine the use of THRT after delivery or a proper disease comparison group. ",

        "Lentiviral Gene Therapy Combined with Low-Dose Busulfan in Infants with SCID-X1. BACKGROUND: Allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation for X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID-X1) often fails to reconstitute immunity associated with T cells, B cells, and natural killer (NK) cells when matched sibling donors are unavailable unless high-dose chemotherapy is given. In previous studies, autologous gene therapy with \u03b3-retroviral vectors failed to reconstitute B-cell and NK-cell immunity and was complicated by vector-related leukemia. METHODS: We performed a dual-center, phase 1-2 safety and efficacy study of a lentiviral vector to transfer IL2RG complementary DNA to bone marrow stem cells after low-exposure, targeted busulfan conditioning in eight infants with newly diagnosed SCID-X1. RESULTS: Eight infants with SCID-X1 were followed for a median of 16.4 months. Bone marrow harvest, busulfan conditioning, and cell infusion had no unexpected side effects. In seven infants, the numbers of CD3+, CD4+, and naive CD4+ T cells and NK cells normalized by 3 to 4 months after infusion and were accompanied by vector marking in T cells, B cells, NK cells, myeloid cells, and bone marrow progenitors. The eighth infant had an insufficient T-cell count initially, but T cells developed in this infant after a boost of gene-corrected cells without busulfan conditioning. Previous infections cleared in all infants, and all continued to grow normally. IgM levels normalized in seven of the eight infants, of whom four discontinued intravenous immune globulin supplementation; three of these four infants had a response to vaccines. Vector insertion-site analysis was performed in seven infants and showed polyclonal patterns without clonal dominance in all seven. CONCLUSIONS: Lentiviral vector gene therapy combined with low-exposure, targeted busulfan conditioning in infants with newly diagnosed SCID-X1 had low-grade acute toxic effects and resulted in multilineage engraftment of transduced cells, reconstitution of functional T cells and B cells, and normalization of NK-cell counts during a median follow-up of 16 months.

        "Overall Survival with Fulvestrant plus Anastrozole in Metastatic Breast Cancer. BACKGROUND: We previously reported prolonged progression-free survival and marginally prolonged overall survival among postmenopausal patients with hormone receptor-positive metastatic breast cancer who had been randomly assigned to receive the aromatase inhibitor anastrozole plus the selective estrogen-receptor down-regulator fulvestrant, as compared with anastrozole alone, as first-line therapy. We now report final survival outcomes. METHODS: We randomly assigned patients to receive either anastrozole or fulvestrant plus anastrozole. Randomization was stratified according to adjuvant tamoxifen use. Analysis of survival was performed by means of two-sided stratified log-rank tests and Cox regression. Efficacy and safety were compared between the two groups, both overall and in subgroups. RESULTS: Of 707 patients who had undergone randomization, 694 had data available for analysis. The combination-therapy group had 247 deaths among 349 women (71%) and a median overall survival of 49.8 months, as compared with 261 deaths among 345 women (76%) and a median overall survival of 42.0 months in the anastrozole-alone group, a significant difference (hazard ratio for death, 0.82; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.69 to 0.98; P\u2009=\u20090.03 by the log-rank test). In a subgroup analysis of the two strata, overall survival among women who had not received tamoxifen previously was longer with the combination therapy than with anastrozole alone (median, 52.2 months and 40.3 months, respectively; hazard ratio, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.58 to 0.92); among women who had received tamoxifen previously, overall survival was similar in the two groups (median, 48.2 months and 43.5 months, respectively; hazard ratio, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.74 to 1.27) (P\u2009=\u20090.09 for interaction). The incidence of long-term toxic effects of grade 3 to 5 was similar in the two groups. Approximately 45% of the patients in the anastrozole-alone group crossed over to receive fulvestrant. CONCLUSIONS: The addition of fulvestrant to anastrozole was associated with increased long-term survival as compared with anastrozole alone, despite substantial crossover to fulvestrant after progression during therapy with anastrozole alone. The results suggest that the benefit was particularly notable in patients without previous exposure to adjuvant endocrine therapy.

        "Colorectal Cancer Care among Young Adult Patients after the Dependent Coverage Expansion under the Affordable Care Act. The impact of the Dependent Coverage Expansion (DCE) under the Affordable Care Act (ACA) on receipt of colorectal cancer treatment has yet to be determined. We identified newly diagnosed DCE-eligible (aged 19-25 years, n\u2009=\u20091,924) and DCE-ineligible (aged 27-34 years, n\u2009=\u20098,313) colorectal cancer patients from the National Cancer Database during 2007-2013. All statistical tests were two-sided. Post-ACA, there was a statistically significant increase in early stage diagnosis among DCE-eligible (15 percentage points increase, p<.001), but not DCE-ineligible (p\u2009=\u2009.09) patients. DCE-eligible patients resected for IIB-IIIC colorectal cancer were more likely to receive timely adjuvant chemotherapy (HR\u2009=\u20091.34, CI\u2009=\u20091.05, 1.71; 7.0 days decrease in restricted mean time from surgery to chemotherapy, p=.01), with no differences in DCE-ineligible patients (HR\u2009=\u20091.10, CI\u2009=\u20090.98, 1.24; 2.1 days decrease, p=.41) post-ACA. Our findings highlight the role of the ACA in improving access to potentially life-saving cancer care, including a shift to early-stage diagnosis and more timely receipt of adjuvant chemotherapy. ",
        "Prospective Study of Cardiac Events During Proteasome Inhibitor Therapy for Relapsed Multiple Myeloma. PURPOSE: Cardiovascular adverse events (CVAEs) can occur during proteasome inhibitor (PI) therapy. We conducted a prospective, observational, multi-institutional study to define risk factors and outcomes in patients with multiple myeloma (MM) receiving PIs. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with relapsed MM initiating carfilzomib- or bortezomib-based therapy underwent baseline assessments and repeated assessments at regular intervals over 6 months, including cardiac biomarkers (troponin I or T, brain natriuretic peptide [BNP], and N-terminal proBNP), ECG, and echocardiography. Monitoring occurred over 18 months for development of CVAEs. RESULTS: Of 95 patients enrolled, 65 received carfilzomib and 30 received bortezomib, with median 25 months of follow-up. Sixty-four CVAEs occurred, with 55% grade 3 or greater in severity. CVAEs occurred in 51% of patients treated with carfilzomib and 17% of those treated with bortezomib (P = .002). Median time to first CVAE from treatment start was 31 days, and 86% occurred within the first 3 months. Patients receiving carfilzomib-based therapy with a baseline elevated BNP level higher than 100 pg/mL or N-terminal proBNP level higher than 125 pg/mL had increased risk for CVAE (odds ratio, 10.8; P < .001). Elevated natriuretic peptides occurring mid-first cycle of treatment with carfilzomib were associated with a substantially higher risk of CVAEs (odds ratio, 36.0; P < .001). Patients who experienced a CVAE had inferior progression-free survival (log-rank P = .01) and overall survival (log-rank P < .001). PI therapy was safely resumed in 89% of patients, although 41% required chemotherapy modifications. CONCLUSION: CVAEs are common during PI therapy for relapsed MM, especially with carfilzomib, particularly within the first 3 months of therapy. CVAEs were associated with worse overall outcomes, but usually, discontinuation of therapy was not required. Natriuretic peptides were highly predictive of CVAEs; however, validation of this finding is necessary before uniform incorporation into the routine management of patients receiving carfilzomib. ",
        "Preparing the Cardiovascular Workforce to Care for Oncology Patients: JACC Review Topic of the Week. Cardiovascular disease and cancer are the 2 main causes of death in the United States. They intersect on multiple levels, sharing common causal mechanisms and epidemiological risk factors. The growing prevalence and complexity of cardiovascular disease and cancer have resulted in the development of the discipline of cardio-oncology. Preparing the cardiovascular workforce for the care of a growing population of cancer patients is necessary to enhance the delivery of high-quality cardiovascular care for patients with cancer. The goal of this review is to present the dedicated efforts of the cardio-oncology community to meet the growing need for education and training of cardiovascular practitioners providing care to cancer patients and survivors. Integration in general cardiology training programs and the efforts of the stakeholder organizations serve as an example of how a multidimensional, innovative approach can address provider education and training needs in a relatively new discipline.

        "Randomized Trial of Four Treatment Approaches for Actinic Keratosis. BACKGROUND: Actinic keratosis is the most frequent premalignant skin disease in the white population. In current guidelines, no clear recommendations are made about which treatment is preferred. METHODS: We investigated the effectiveness of four frequently used field-directed treatments (for multiple lesions in a continuous area). Patients with a clinical diagnosis of five or more actinic keratosis lesions on the head, involving one continuous area of 25 to 100 cm2, were enrolled at four Dutch hospitals. Patients were randomly assigned to treatment with 5% fluorouracil cream, 5% imiquimod cream, methyl aminolevulinate photodynamic therapy (MAL-PDT), or 0.015% ingenol mebutate gel. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients with a reduction of 75% or more in the number of actinic keratosis lesions from baseline to 12 months after the end of treatment. Both a modified intention-to-treat analysis and a per-protocol analysis were performed. RESULTS: A total of 624 patients were included from November 2014 through March 2017. At 12 months after the end of treatment, the cumulative probability of remaining free from treatment failure was significantly higher among patients who received fluorouracil (74.7%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 66.8 to 81.0) than among those who received imiquimod (53.9%; 95% CI, 45.4 to 61.6), MAL-PDT (37.7%; 95% CI, 30.0 to 45.3), or ingenol mebutate (28.9%; 95% CI, 21.8 to 36.3). As compared with fluorouracil, the hazard ratio for treatment failure was 2.03 (95% CI, 1.36 to 3.04) with imiquimod, 2.73 (95% CI, 1.87 to 3.99) with MAL-PDT, and 3.33 (95% CI, 2.29 to 4.85) with ingenol mebutate (P\u22640.001 for all comparisons). No unexpected toxic effects were documented. CONCLUSIONS: At 12 months after the end of treatment in patients with multiple actinic keratosis lesions on the head, 5% fluorouracil cream was the most effective of four field-directed treatments.

        "Assessment of Rapid Response Teams at Top-Performing Hospitals for In-Hospital Cardiac Arrest. Importance: Rapid response teams (RRTs) are foundational to hospital response to deteriorating conditions of patients. However, little is known about differences in RRT organization and function across top-performing and non-top-performing hospitals for in-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) care. Objective: To evaluate differences in design and implementation of RRTs at top-performing and non-top-performing sites for survival of IHCA, which is known to be associated with hospital performance on IHCA incidence. Design, Setting, and Participants: A qualitative analysis was performed of data from semistructured interviews of 158 hospital staff members (nurses, physicians, administrators, and staff) during site visits to 9 hospitals participating in the Get With The Guidelines-Resuscitation program and consistently ranked in the top, middle, and bottom quartiles for IHCA survival during 2012-2014. Site visits were conducted from April 19, 2016, to July 27, 2017. Data analysis was completed in January 2019. Main Outcomes and Measures: Semistructured in-depth interviews were performed and thematic analysis was conducted on strategies for IHCA prevention, including RRT roles and responsibilities. Results: Of the 158 participants, 72 were nurses (45.6%), 27 physicians (17.1%), 27 clinical staff (17.1%), and 32 administrators (20.3%). Between 12 and 30 people at each hospital participated in interviews. Differences in RRTs at top-performing and non-top-performing sites were found in the following 4 domains: team design and composition, RRT engagement in surveillance of at-risk patients, empowerment of bedside nurses to activate the RRT, and collaboration with bedside nurses during and after a rapid response. At top-performing hospitals, RRTs were typically staffed with dedicated team members without competing clinical responsibilities, who provided expertise to bedside nurses in managing patients who were at risk for deterioration, and collaborated with nurses during and after a rapid response. Bedside nurses were empowered to activate RRTs based on their judgment and experience without fear of reprisal from physicians or hospital staff. In contrast, RRT members at non-top-performing hospitals had competing clinical responsibilities and were generally less engaged with bedside nurses. Nurses at non-top-performing hospitals reported concerns about potential consequences from activating the RRT. Conclusions and Relevance: This qualitative study's findings suggest that top-performing hospitals feature RRTs with dedicated staff without competing clinical responsibilities, that work collaboratively with bedside nurses, and that can be activated without fear of reprisal. These findings provide unique insights into RRTs at hospitals with better IHCA outcomes. ",
        "Discrimination, Abuse, Harassment, and Burnout in Surgical Residency Training. BACKGROUND: Physicians, particularly trainees and those in surgical subspecialties, are at risk for burnout. Mistreatment (i.e., discrimination, verbal or physical abuse, and sexual harassment) may contribute to burnout and suicidal thoughts. METHODS: A cross-sectional national survey of general surgery residents administered with the 2018 American Board of Surgery In-Training Examination assessed mistreatment, burnout (evaluated with the use of the modified Maslach Burnout Inventory), and suicidal thoughts during the past year. We used multivariable logistic-regression models to assess the association of mistreatment with burnout and suicidal thoughts. The survey asked residents to report their gender. RESULTS: Among 7409 residents (99.3% of the eligible residents) from all 262 surgical residency programs, 31.9% reported discrimination based on their self-identified gender, 16.6% reported racial discrimination, 30.3% reported verbal or physical abuse (or both), and 10.3% reported sexual harassment. Rates of all mistreatment measures were higher among women; 65.1% of the women reported gender discrimination and 19.9% reported sexual harassment. Patients and patients' families were the most frequent sources of gender discrimination (as reported by 43.6% of residents) and racial discrimination (47.4%), whereas attending surgeons were the most frequent sources of sexual harassment (27.2%) and abuse (51.9%). Proportion of residents reporting mistreatment varied considerably among residency programs (e.g., ranging from 0 to 66.7% for verbal abuse). Weekly burnout symptoms were reported by 38.5% of residents, and 4.5% reported having had suicidal thoughts during the past year. Residents who reported exposure to discrimination, abuse, or harassment at least a few times per month were more likely than residents with no reported mistreatment exposures to have symptoms of burnout (odds ratio, 2.94; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.58 to 3.36) and suicidal thoughts (odds ratio, 3.07; 95% CI, 2.25 to 4.19). Although models that were not adjusted for mistreatment showed that women were more likely than men to report burnout symptoms (42.4% vs. 35.9%; odds ratio, 1.33; 95% CI, 1.20 to 1.48), the difference was no longer evident after the models were adjusted for mistreatment (odds ratio, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.80 to 1.00). CONCLUSIONS: Mistreatment occurs frequently among general surgery residents, especially women, and is associated with burnout and suicidal thoughts. ",
        "Decolonization to Reduce Postdischarge Infection Risk among MRSA Carriers. BACKGROUND: Hospitalized patients who are colonized with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) are at high risk for infection after discharge. METHODS: We conducted a multicenter, randomized, controlled trial of postdischarge hygiene education, as compared with education plus decolonization, in patients colonized with MRSA (carriers). Decolonization involved chlorhexidine mouthwash, baths or showers with chlorhexidine, and nasal mupirocin for 5 days twice per month for 6 months. Participants were followed for 1 year. The primary outcome was MRSA infection as defined according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) criteria. Secondary outcomes included MRSA infection determined on the basis of clinical judgment, infection from any cause, and infection-related hospitalization. All analyses were performed with the use of proportional-hazards models in the per-protocol population (all participants who underwent randomization, met the inclusion criteria, and survived beyond the recruitment hospitalization) and as-treated population (participants stratified according to adherence). RESULTS: In the per-protocol population, MRSA infection occurred in 98 of 1063 participants (9.2%) in the education group and in 67 of 1058 (6.3%) in the decolonization group; 84.8% of the MRSA infections led to hospitalization. Infection from any cause occurred in 23.7% of the participants in the education group and 19.6% of those in the decolonization group; 85.8% of the infections led to hospitalization. The hazard of MRSA infection was significantly lower in the decolonization group than in the education group (hazard ratio, 0.70; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.52 to 0.96; P=0.03; number needed to treat to prevent one infection, 30; 95% CI, 18 to 230); this lower hazard led to a lower risk of hospitalization due to MRSA infection (hazard ratio, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.51 to 0.99). The decolonization group had lower likelihoods of clinically judged infection from any cause (hazard ratio, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.70 to 0.99) and infection-related hospitalization (hazard ratio, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.62 to 0.93); treatment effects for secondary outcomes should be interpreted with caution owing to a lack of prespecified adjustment for multiple comparisons. In as-treated analyses, participants in the decolonization group who adhered fully to the regimen had 44% fewer MRSA infections than the education group (hazard ratio, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.36 to 0.86) and had 40% fewer infections from any cause (hazard ratio, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.46 to 0.78). Side effects (all mild) occurred in 4.2% of the participants. CONCLUSIONS: Postdischarge MRSA decolonization with chlorhexidine and mupirocin led to a 30% lower risk of MRSA infection than education alone.

        "Surveillance for Hepatocellular Carcinoma: Current Best Practice and Future Direction. Hepatocellular cancer (HCC) is the fourth leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide and the fastest growing cause of cancer deaths in the United States. The overall prognosis of HCC remains dismal, except for the subset of patients who are diagnosed at early stage and receive potentially curative therapies, such as surgical resection and liver transplantation. Given this, expert society guidelines recommend HCC surveillance every 6 months in at-risk individuals. Despite these recommendations, the effectiveness of HCC surveillance remains a subject of debate. We discuss current best practices for HCC surveillance and the evidence that support these recommendations. We also describe several initiatives that are underway to improve HCC surveillance and outline areas that may serve as high-yield targets for future research. Overall, we believe these efforts will help the field move toward precision surveillance, where surveillance tests and intervals are tailored to individual HCC risk. Doing so can maximize surveillance benefits, minimize surveillance harms, and optimize overall value for all patients. ",
        "Investigation of a Cluster of Sphingomonas koreensis Infections. BACKGROUND: Plumbing systems are an infrequent but known reservoir for opportunistic microbial pathogens that can infect hospitalized patients. In 2016, a cluster of clinical sphingomonas infections prompted an investigation. METHODS: We performed whole-genome DNA sequencing on clinical isolates of multidrug-resistant Sphingomonas koreensis identified from 2006 through 2016 at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Clinical Center. We cultured S. koreensis from the sinks in patient rooms and performed both whole-genome and shotgun metagenomic sequencing to identify a reservoir within the infrastructure of the hospital. These isolates were compared with clinical and environmental S. koreensis isolates obtained from other institutions. RESULTS: The investigation showed that two isolates of S. koreensis obtained from the six patients identified in the 2016 cluster were unrelated, but four isolates shared more than 99.92% genetic similarity and were resistant to multiple antibiotic agents. Retrospective analysis of banked clinical isolates of sphingomonas from the NIH Clinical Center revealed the intermittent recovery of a clonal strain over the past decade. Unique single-nucleotide variants identified in strains of S. koreensis elucidated the existence of a reservoir in the hospital plumbing. Clinical S. koreensis isolates from other facilities were genetically distinct from the NIH isolates. Hospital remediation strategies were guided by results of microbiologic culturing and fine-scale genomic analyses. CONCLUSIONS: This genomic and epidemiologic investigation suggests that S. koreensis is an opportunistic human pathogen that both persisted in the NIH Clinical Center infrastructure across time and space and caused health care-associated infections.

        "Effect of a Self-management Support Intervention on Asthma Outcomes in Older Adults: The SAMBA Study Randomized Clinical Trial. Importance: Older adults with asthma have worse control and outcomes than younger adults. Interventions to address suboptimal self-management among older adults with asthma are typically not tailored to the specific needs of the patient. Objective: To test the effect of a comprehensive, patient-tailored asthma self-management support intervention for older adults on clinical and self-management outcomes. Design, Setting, and Participants: Three-arm randomized clinical trial conducted between February 2014 and December 2017 at primary care practices and personal residences in New York City. Adults 60 years and older with persistent, uncontrolled asthma were identified from electronic medical records at an academic medical center and a federally qualified health center. Of 1349 patients assessed for eligibility, 406 met eligibility criteria, consented to participate, and were randomized to 1 of 3 groups: home-based intervention, clinic-based intervention, or control (usual care). A total of 391 patients received the allocated treatment. Interventions: Screening for psychosocial, physical, cognitive, and environmental barriers to asthma control and self-management with actions to address identified barriers. The intervention was delivered in the home or primary care practices by asthma care coaches. Main Outcomes and Measures: Primary outcomes were the Asthma Control Test, Mini Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire, Medication Adherence Rating Scale, metered dose inhaler technique, and emergency department visits for asthma care. Primary analyses compared intervention (home or clinic based) with usual care. Results: Of the 391 patients who received treatment, 58 (15.1%) were men, and the mean (SD) age was 67.8 (7.4) years. After accounting for baseline scores, scores on the asthma control test were better in the intervention groups vs the control group (difference-in-differences at 3 months, 1.2; 95% CI, 0.2-2.2; P\u2009=\u2009.02; 6 months, 1.0; 95% CI, 0.0-2.1; P\u2009=\u2009.049; 12 months, 0.6; 95% CI, -0.5 to 1.8; P\u2009=\u2009.28; and overall, \u03c72\u2009=\u200913.4, with 4 degrees of freedom; P\u2009=\u2009.01). Emergency department visits were lower at 12 months for the intervention groups vs the control group (16 [6.2%] vs 17 [12.7%]; P\u2009=\u2009.03; adjusted odds ratio, 0.8; 95% CI, 0.6-0.99; P\u2009=\u2009.03). Statistically significant improvements were observed for the intervention vs control patients in quality of life (overall effect: \u03c72\u2009=\u200910.5, with 4 degrees of freedom; P\u2009=\u2009.01), medication adherence (overall effect: \u03c72\u2009=\u20099.5, with 4 degrees of freedom; P\u2009=\u2009.049), and inhaler technique (metered-dose inhaler technique, correctly completed steps at 12 months, median [range]: 75% [0%-100%] vs 58% [0%-100%]). No significant differences in outcomes were observed between patients receiving the intervention in home vs practice settings. Conclusions and Relevance: An intervention directed by patients' needs and barriers improved asthma outcomes and self-management behaviors among older adults.

        "Association of Lifestyle and Genetic Risk With Incidence of Dementia. Importance: Genetic factors increase risk of dementia, but the extent to which this can be offset by lifestyle factors is unknown. Objective: To investigate whether a healthy lifestyle is associated with lower risk of dementia regardless of genetic risk. Design, Setting, and Participants: A retrospective cohort study that included adults of European ancestry aged at least 60 years without cognitive impairment or dementia at baseline. Participants joined the UK Biobank study from 2006 to 2010 and were followed up until 2016 or 2017. Exposures: A polygenic risk score for dementia with low (lowest quintile), intermediate (quintiles 2 to 4), and high (highest quintile) risk categories and a weighted healthy lifestyle score, including no current smoking, regular physical activity, healthy diet, and moderate alcohol consumption, categorized into favorable, intermediate, and unfavorable lifestyles. Main Outcomes and Measures: Incident all-cause dementia, ascertained through hospital inpatient and death records. Results: A total of 196\u202f383 individuals (mean [SD] age, 64.1 [2.9] years; 52.7% were women) were followed up for 1\u202f545\u202f433 person-years (median [interquartile range] follow-up, 8.0 [7.4-8.6] years). Overall, 68.1% of participants followed a favorable lifestyle, 23.6% followed an intermediate lifestyle, and 8.2% followed an unfavorable lifestyle. Twenty percent had high polygenic risk scores, 60% had intermediate risk scores, and 20% had low risk scores. Of the participants with high genetic risk, 1.23% (95% CI, 1.13%-1.35%) developed dementia compared with 0.63% (95% CI, 0.56%-0.71%) of the participants with low genetic risk (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.91 [95% CI, 1.64-2.23]). Of the participants with a high genetic risk and unfavorable lifestyle, 1.78% (95% CI, 1.38%-2.28%) developed dementia compared with 0.56% (95% CI, 0.48%-0.66%) of participants with low genetic risk and favorable lifestyle (hazard ratio, 2.83 [95% CI, 2.09-3.83]). There was no significant interaction between genetic risk and lifestyle factors (P\u2009=\u2009.99). Among participants with high genetic risk, 1.13% (95% CI, 1.01%-1.26%) of those with a favorable lifestyle developed dementia compared with 1.78% (95% CI, 1.38%-2.28%) with an unfavorable lifestyle (hazard ratio, 0.68 [95% CI, 0.51-0.90]). Conclusions and Relevance: Among older adults without cognitive impairment or dementia, both an unfavorable lifestyle and high genetic risk were significantly associated with higher dementia risk. A favorable lifestyle was associated with a lower dementia risk among participants with high genetic risk. ",
        "Association of Lifespan Cognitive Reserve Indicator With Dementia Risk in the Presence of Brain Pathologies. Importance: Evidence on the association of lifespan cognitive reserve (CR) with dementia is limited, and the strength of this association in the presence of brain pathologies is unknown. Objective: To examine the association of lifespan CR with dementia risk, taking brain pathologies into account. Design, Setting, and Participants: This study used data from 2022 participants in the Rush Memory and Aging Project, an ongoing community-based cohort study with annual follow-up from 1997 to 2018 (mean follow-up, 6 years; maximum follow-up, 20 years). After excluding 420 individuals who had prevalent dementia, missing data on CR, or dropped out, 1602 dementia-free adults were identified at baseline and evaluated to detect incident dementia. During follow-up, 611 died and underwent autopsies. Data were analyzed from May to September 2018. Exposures: Information on CR factors (education; early-life, midlife, and late-life cognitive activities; and social activities in late life) was obtained at baseline. Based on these factors, lifespan CR scores were captured using a latent variable from a structural equation model and was divided into tertiles (lowest, middle, and highest). Main Outcomes and Measures: Dementia was diagnosed following international criteria. Neuropathologic evaluations for Alzheimer disease and other brain pathologies were performed in autopsied participants. The association of lifespan CR with dementia or brain pathologies was estimated using Cox regression models or logistic regression. Results: Of the 1602 included participants, 1216 (75.9%) were women, and the mean (SD) age was 79.6 (7.5) years. During follow-up, 386 participants developed dementia (24.1%), including 357 participants with Alzheimer disease-related dementia (22.3%). The multiadjusted hazards ratios (HRs) of dementia were 0.77 (95% CI, 0.59-0.99) for participants in the middle CR score tertile and 0.61 (95% CI, 0.47-0.81) for those in the highest CR score tertile compared with those in the lowest CR score tertile. In autopsied participants, CR was not associated with most brain pathologies, and the association of CR with dementia remained significant after additional adjustment for brain pathologies (HR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.42-0.86). The highest CR score tertile was associated with a reduction in dementia risk, even among participants with high Alzheimer disease pathology (HR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.37-0.87) and any gross infarcts (HR, 0.34; 95% CI, 0.18-0.62). Conclusions and Relevance: High lifespan CR is associated with a reduction in dementia risk, even in the presence of high brain pathologies. Our findings highlight the importance of lifespan CR accumulation in dementia prevention. ",
        "Association of Extracellular Vesicle Biomarkers With Alzheimer Disease in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging. Importance: Blood biomarkers able to diagnose Alzheimer disease (AD) at the preclinical stage would enable trial enrollment when the disease is potentially reversible. Plasma neuronal-enriched extracellular vesicles (nEVs) of patients with AD were reported to exhibit elevated levels of phosphorylated (p) tau, A\u03b242, and phosphorylated insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1). Objective: To validate nEV biomarkers as AD predictors. Design, Setting, Participants: This case-control study included longitudinal plasma samples from cognitively normal participants in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA) cohort who developed AD up to January 2015 and age- and sex-matched controls who remained cognitively normal over a similar length of follow-up. Repeated samples were blindly analyzed over 1 year from participants with clinical AD and controls from the Johns Hopkins Alzheimer Disease Research Center (JHADRC). Data were collected from September 2016 to January 2018. Analyses were conducted in March 2019. Main Outcomes and Measures: Neuronal-enriched extracellular vesicles were immunoprecipitated; tau, A\u03b242, and IRS-1 biomarkers were quantified by immunoassays; and nEV concentration and diameter were determined by nanoparticle tracking analysis. Levels and longitudinal trajectories of nEV biomarkers between participants with future AD and control participants were compared. Results: Overall, 887 longitudinal plasma samples from 128 BLSA participants who eventually developed AD and 222 age and sex-matched controls who remained cognitively normal were analyzed. Participants were followed up (from earliest sample to AD symptom onset) for a mean (SD) of 3.5 (2.31) years (range, 0-9.73 years). Overall, 161 participants were included in the training set, and 80 were in the test set. Participants in the BLSA cohort with future AD (mean [SD] age, 79.09 [7.02] years; 68 women [53.13%]) had longitudinally higher p-tau181, p-tau231, pSer312-IRS-1, pY-IRS-1, and nEV diameter than controls (mean [SD] age, 76.2 [7.36] years; 110 women [50.45%]) but had similar A\u03b242, total tau, TSG101, and nEV concentration. In the training BLSA set, a model combining preclinical longitudinal data achieved 89.6% area under curve (AUC), 81.8% sensitivity, and 85.8% specificity for predicting AD. The model was validated in the test BLSA set (80% AUC, 55.6% sensitivity, 88.7% specificity). Preclinical levels of nEV biomarkers were associated with cognitive performance. In addition, 128 repeated samples over 1 year from 64 JHADRC participants with clinical AD and controls were analyzed. In the JHADRC cohort (35 participants with AD: mean [SD] age, 74.03 [8.73] years; 18 women [51.43%] and 29 controls: mean [SD] age, 72.14 [7.86] years; 23 women [79.31%]), nEV biomarkers achieved discrimination with 98.9% AUC, 100% sensitivity, and 94.7% specificity in the training set and 76.7% AUC, 91.7% sensitivity, and 60% specificity in the test set. Conclusions and Relevance: We validated nEV biomarker candidates and further demonstrated that their preclinical longitudinal trajectories can predict AD diagnosis. These findings motivate further development of nEV biomarkers toward a clinical blood test for AD. ",
        "Associations of Physical Activity and \u03b2-Amyloid With Longitudinal Cognition and Neurodegeneration in Clinically Normal Older Adults. Importance: In the absence of disease-modifying therapies for Alzheimer disease, there is a critical need to identify modifiable risk factors that may delay the progression of Alzheimer disease. Objective: To examine whether physical activity moderates the association of \u03b2-amyloid (A\u03b2) burden with longitudinal cognitive decline and neurodegeneration in clinically normal individuals and to examine whether these associations are independent of vascular risk. Design, Setting, and Participants: This longitudinal observational study included clinically normal participants from the Harvard Aging Brain Study. Participants were required to have baseline A\u03b2 positron emission tomography data, baseline medical data to quantify vascular risk, and longitudinal neuropsychological and structural magnetic resonance imaging data. Data were collected from April 2010 to June 2018. Data were analyzed from August to December 2018. Main Outcomes and Measures: Baseline physical activity was quantified with a pedometer (mean steps per day). Baseline A\u03b2 burden was measured with carbon 11-labeled Pittsburgh Compound B positron emission tomography. Cognition was measured annually with the Preclinical Alzheimer Cognitive Composite (PACC; median [interquartile range] follow-up, 6.0 [4.3-6.3] years). Neurodegeneration was assessed with longitudinal structural magnetic resonance imaging (2 to 5 scans per participant; median [interquartile range] follow-up, 4.5 [3.0-5.0] years), with a focus on total gray matter volume and regional cortical thickness. Physical activity and A\u03b2 burden were examined as interactive predictors of PACC decline and volume loss in separate linear mixed models, adjusting for age, sex, education, apolipoprotein E \u03b54 status, and, where appropriate, intracranial volume. Secondary models adjusted for vascular risk and its interaction with A\u03b2 burden. Results: Of the 182 included participants, 103 (56.6%) were female, and the mean (SD) age was 73.4 (6.2) years. In models examining PACC decline and volume loss, there was a significant interaction of physical activity with A\u03b2 burden, such that greater physical activity was associated with slower A\u03b2-related cognitive decline (\u03b2, 0.03; 95% CI, 0.02-0.05; P\u2009<\u2009.001) and volume loss (\u03b2, 482.07; 95% CI, 189.40-774.74; P\u2009=\u2009.002). Adjusting for vascular risk did not alter these associations. In these models, lower vascular risk was independently associated with slower A\u03b2-related PACC decline (\u03b2, -0.04; 95% CI, -0.06 to -0.02; P\u2009<\u2009.001) and volume loss (\u03b2, -483.41; 95% CI, -855.63 to -111.20; P\u2009=\u2009.01). Conclusions and Relevance: Greater physical activity and lower vascular risk independently attenuated the negative association of A\u03b2 burden with cognitive decline and neurodegeneration in asymptomatic individuals. These findings suggest that engaging in physical activity and lowering vascular risk may have additive protective effects on delaying the progression of Alzheimer disease. ",
        "Psychiatric Adverse Events in Patients Taking Isotretinoin as Reported in a Food and Drug Administration Database From 1997 to 2017. Importance: Isotretinoin is a highly effective medication for severe acne. Although no causal link between isotretinoin and psychiatric adverse effects has been established, widespread media reporting of depression and suicidality with use of isotretinoin have raised concerns in both patients and clinicians and generated numerous cases of costly litigation. Objective: To evaluate reports of psychiatric adverse events associated with isotretinoin use submitted to the US Food and Drug Administration from January 1, 1997, through December 31, 2017. Design, Setting, and Participants: This retrospective study evaluated reports of psychiatric adverse events with isotretinoin as the primary suspect drug in the US Food and Drug Administration's Adverse Event Reporting System from 1997 through 2017. Publicly available data on number of patients enrolled in the iPLEDGE program were used to calculate rates of completed suicide per 100\u202f000 patients enrolled in iPLEDGE in 2009 and 2010. All data were analyzed between July 1, 2018, and January 31, 2019. Main Outcomes and Measures: The main outcomes were frequency and type of psychiatric adverse events in patients taking isotretinoin. Secondary analyses were stratification by age and sex and evaluation of completed suicide rates. Results: Between 1997 and 2017, 17\u202f829 psychiatric adverse events with isotretinoin use were reported to the US Food and Drug Administration, with depressive disorders, emotional lability, and anxiety disorders reported most frequently. Of these events, 8936 (50.1%) were reported among men and 8362 (46.9%) among women; the sex of the individual was not reported for 531 events (3.0%). Of the 13\u202f553 reports that included patient age, the mean (SD) age was 22.1 (8.6) years. More than half (52.5%) of all events occurred in 10- to 19-year-old individuals. Whereas depression and anxiety were reported equally between sexes, eating disorders were more common in females (58 of 85 [68.2%]), while attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (55 of 83 events [66.3%]) and completed suicides (290 of 368 [78.8%]) were more common in males. The rates of completed suicide were 8.4 and 5.6 suicides per 100\u202f000 patients enrolled in iPLEDGE in 2009 and 2010, respectively. Conclusions and Relevance: Although depressive disorders and suicidality were frequently reported with isotretinoin use, these reports must be considered in the context of elevated rates of depression and suicide among patients with acne at large. These data suggest that the rate of completed suicide in patients taking isotretinoin may be lower than that of the general US population. Many psychiatric adverse events unrelated to depression and suicidality were also reported, but it is unclear if they were a result of isotretinoin therapy. Although no causal link between isotretinoin and psychiatric risk has been established, patients taking the drug appear vulnerable to psychiatric concerns. Mandated monthly iPLEDGE visits may provide an opportunity to screen patients for psychiatric conditions and improve outcomes. ",
        "Staging \u03b2-Amyloid Pathology With Amyloid Positron Emission Tomography. Importance: Different brain regions appear to be involved during \u03b2-amyloid (A\u03b2) accumulation in Alzheimer disease (AD), but a longitudinally valid system to track A\u03b2 stages in vivo using positron emission tomography (PET) is lacking. Objective: To construct a longitudinally valid in vivo staging system for AD using amyloid PET. Design, Setting, and Participants: Longitudinal multicenter cohort study using data accessed on August 20, 2018, from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative database of scans performed from June 9, 2010, to July 12, 2018, from 741 persons: 304 without cognitive impairment, 384 with mild cognitive impairment, and 53 with AD dementia. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) A\u03b242 and fluorine 18-labeled florbetapir (18F-florbetapir) data were used to determine early, intermediate, and late regions of A\u03b2 accumulation. \u03b2-Amyloid stages ranging from 0 to 3 were constructed using these composites. Each subsequent stage required involvement of more advanced regions. Patients were followed up at 2, 4, and 6 years. Replication and validation were conducted using an independent cohort (Swedish BioFINDER) and gene expression information from the Allen Human Brain Atlas database. Analyses were conducted August 21, 2018, to May 24, 2019. Main Outcomes and Measures: The main outcome was change in stage. Stages were compared for diagnosis, CSF biomarkers of tau, and longitudinal atrophy, cognitive measures, and regional gene expression. Transitions between stages were tested using longitudinal 18F-florbetapir data. Results: Among 641 participants with CSF A\u03b242 data and at least two 18F-florbetapir scans, 335 (52.3%) were male. The early region of A\u03b2 accumulation included the precuneus, posterior cingulate, isthmus cingulate, insula, and medial and lateral orbitofrontal cortices. The late region included the lingual, pericalcarine, paracentral, precentral, and postcentral cortices. The intermediate region included remaining brain regions with increased accumulation rates. In 2072 PET scans from 741 participants, 2039 (98.4%) were unambiguously staged. At baseline, participants with stage 0 (n\u2009=\u2009402) had a 14.7% (95% CI, 11.2%-18.1%) probability of progression to a higher stage; stage 1 (n\u2009=\u200921), 71.4% (95% CI, 50.0%-90.9%); and stage 2 (n\u2009=\u200979), 53.1% (95% CI, 42.2%-64.0%). Seven of the 741 participants (0.9%) reverted to a lower stage. Higher stages were associated with lower CSF A\u03b242 concentrations (from stage 1 at baseline), greater CSF P-tau (from stage 1) and CSF T-tau (from stage 2), and accelerated cognitive decline (from stage 2) and atrophy (from stage 3), even when adjusting for clinical diagnosis. Key findings were replicated in the BioFINDER cohort (N\u2009=\u2009474). The regions of different stages differed by gene expression profiles when using the transcriptome from the Allen Human Brain Atlas, especially involving genes associated with voltage-gated ion channel activity especially involving genes associated with voltage-gated ion channel activity, but also blood circulation, axon guidance, and lipid transportation. Conclusions and Relevance: Results of this study suggest that this robust staging system of A\u03b2 accumulation may be useful for monitoring patients throughout the course of AD. Progression through stages may depend on underlying selective vulnerability in different brain regions. ",
        "Step-Up Therapy in Black Children and Adults with Poorly Controlled Asthma. BACKGROUND: Morbidity from asthma is disproportionately higher among black patients than among white patients, and black patients constitute the minority of participants in trials informing treatment. Data indicate that patients with inadequately controlled asthma benefit more from addition of a long-acting beta-agonist (LABA) than from increased glucocorticoids; however, these data may not be informative for treatment in black patients. METHODS: We conducted two prospective, randomized, double-blind trials: one involving children and the other involving adolescents and adults. In both trials, the patients had at least one grandparent who identified as black and had asthma that was inadequately controlled with low-dose inhaled glucocorticoids. We compared combinations of therapy, which included the addition of a LABA (salmeterol) to an inhaled glucocorticoid (fluticasone propionate), a step-up to double to quintuple the dose of fluticasone, or both. The treatments were compared with the use of a composite measure that evaluated asthma exacerbations, asthma-control days, and lung function; data were stratified according to genotypic African ancestry. RESULTS: When quintupling the dose of fluticasone (to 250 \u03bcg twice a day) was compared with adding salmeterol (50 \u03bcg twice a day) and doubling the fluticasone (to 100 \u03bcg twice a day), a superior response occurred in 46% of the children with quintupling the fluticasone and in 46% of the children with doubling the fluticasone and adding salmeterol (P\u2009=\u20090.99). In contrast, more adolescents and adults had a superior response to added salmeterol than to an increase in fluticasone (salmeterol-low-dose fluticasone vs. medium-dose fluticasone, 49% vs. 28% [P\u2009=\u20090.003]; salmeterol-medium-dose fluticasone vs. high-dose fluticasone, 49% vs. 31% [P\u2009=\u20090.02]). Neither the degree of African ancestry nor baseline biomarkers predicted a superior response to specific treatments. The increased dose of inhaled glucocorticoids was associated with a decrease in the ratio of urinary cortisol to creatinine in children younger than 8 years of age. CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to black adolescents and adults, almost half the black children with poorly controlled asthma had a superior response to an increase in the dose of an inhaled glucocorticoid and almost half had a superior response to the addition of a LABA.

        "The Effects of Armed Conflict on Children. More than 1 in 10 children worldwide are affected by armed conflict. The effects are both direct and indirect and are associated with immediate and long-term harm. The direct effects of conflict include death, physical and psychological trauma, and displacement. Indirect effects are related to a large number of factors, including inadequate and unsafe living conditions, environmental hazards, caregiver mental health, separation from family, displacement-related health risks, and the destruction of health, public health, education, and economic infrastructure. Children and health workers are targeted by combatants during attacks, and children are recruited or forced to take part in combat in a variety of ways. Armed conflict is both a toxic stress and a significant social determinant of child health. In this Technical Report, we review the available knowledge on the effects of armed conflict on children and support the recommendations in the accompanying Policy Statement on children and armed conflict.

        "ACOG Practice Bulletin No. 212 Summary: Pregnancy and Heart Disease. Maternal heart disease has emerged as a major threat to safe motherhood and women's long-term cardiovascular health. In the United States, disease and dysfunction of the heart and vascular system as \"cardiovascular disease\" is now the leading cause of death in pregnant women and women in the postpartum period () accounting for 4.23 deaths per 100,000 live births, a rate almost twice that of the United Kingdom (). The most recent data indicate that cardiovascular diseases constitute 26.5% of U.S. pregnancy-related deaths (). Of further concern are the disparities in cardiovascular disease outcomes, with higher rates of morbidity and mortality among nonwhite and lower-income women. Contributing factors include barriers to prepregnancy cardiovascular disease assessment, missed opportunities to identify cardiovascular disease risk factors during prenatal care, gaps in high-risk intrapartum care, and delays in recognition of cardiovascular disease symptoms during the puerperium. The purpose of this document is to 1) describe the prevalence and effect of heart disease among pregnant and postpartum women; 2) provide guidance for early antepartum and postpartum risk factor identification and modification; 3) outline common cardiovascular disorders that cause morbidity and mortality during pregnancy and the puerperium; 4) describe recommendations for care for pregnant and postpartum women with preexisting or new-onset acquired heart disease; and 5) present a comprehensive interpregnancy care plan for women with heart disease.

        "Vitamin D Supplementation and Prevention of Type 2 Diabetes. BACKGROUND: Observational studies support an association between a low blood 25-hydroxyvitamin D level and the risk of type 2 diabetes. However, whether vitamin D supplementation lowers the risk of diabetes is unknown. METHODS: We randomly assigned adults who met at least two of three glycemic criteria for prediabetes (fasting plasma glucose level, 100 to 125 mg per deciliter; plasma glucose level 2 hours after a 75-g oral glucose load, 140 to 199 mg per deciliter; and glycated hemoglobin level, 5.7 to 6.4%) and no diagnostic criteria for diabetes to receive 4000 IU per day of vitamin D3 or placebo, regardless of the baseline serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level. The primary outcome in this time-to-event analysis was new-onset diabetes, and the trial design was event-driven, with a target number of diabetes events of 508. RESULTS: A total of 2423 participants underwent randomization (1211 to the vitamin D group and 1212 to the placebo group). By month 24, the mean serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level in the vitamin D group was 54.3 ng per milliliter (from 27.7 ng per milliliter at baseline), as compared with 28.8 ng per milliliter in the placebo group (from 28.2 ng per milliliter at baseline). After a median follow-up of 2.5 years, the primary outcome of diabetes occurred in 293 participants in the vitamin D group and 323 in the placebo group (9.39 and 10.66 events per 100 person-years, respectively). The hazard ratio for vitamin D as compared with placebo was 0.88 (95% confidence interval, 0.75 to 1.04; P\u2009=\u20090.12). The incidence of adverse events did not differ significantly between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: Among persons at high risk for type 2 diabetes not selected for vitamin D insufficiency, vitamin D3 supplementation at a dose of 4000 IU per day did not result in a significantly lower risk of diabetes than placebo.

        "Clinical Targets for Continuous Glucose Monitoring Data Interpretation: Recommendations From the International Consensus on Time in Range. Improvements in sensor accuracy, greater convenience and ease of use, and expanding reimbursement have led to growing adoption of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM). However, successful utilization of CGM technology in routine clinical practice remains relatively low. This may be due in part to the lack of clear and agreed-upon glycemic targets that both diabetes teams and people with diabetes can work toward. Although unified recommendations for use of key CGM metrics have been established in three separate peer-reviewed articles, formal adoption by diabetes professional organizations and guidance in the practical application of these metrics in clinical practice have been lacking. In February 2019, the Advanced Technologies & Treatments for Diabetes (ATTD) Congress convened an international panel of physicians, researchers, and individuals with diabetes who are expert in CGM technologies to address this issue. This article summarizes the ATTD consensus recommendations for relevant aspects of CGM data utilization and reporting among the various diabetes populations. ",
        "An Anti-CD3 Antibody, Teplizumab, in Relatives at Risk for Type 1 Diabetes. BACKGROUND: Type 1 diabetes is a chronic autoimmune disease that leads to destruction of insulin-producing beta cells and dependence on exogenous insulin for survival. Some interventions have delayed the loss of insulin production in patients with type 1 diabetes, but interventions that might affect clinical progression before diagnosis are needed. METHODS: We conducted a phase 2, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial of teplizumab (an Fc receptor-nonbinding anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody) involving relatives of patients with type 1 diabetes who did not have diabetes but were at high risk for development of clinical disease. Patients were randomly assigned to a single 14-day course of teplizumab or placebo, and follow-up for progression to clinical type 1 diabetes was performed with the use of oral glucose-tolerance tests at 6-month intervals. RESULTS: A total of 76 participants (55 [72%] of whom were \u226418 years of age) underwent randomization - 44 to the teplizumab group and 32 to the placebo group. The median time to the diagnosis of type 1 diabetes was 48.4 months in the teplizumab group and 24.4 months in the placebo group; the disease was diagnosed in 19 (43%) of the participants who received teplizumab and in 23 (72%) of those who received placebo. The hazard ratio for the diagnosis of type 1 diabetes (teplizumab vs. placebo) was 0.41 (95% confidence interval, 0.22 to 0.78; P\u2009=\u20090.006 by adjusted Cox proportional-hazards model). The annualized rates of diagnosis of diabetes were 14.9% per year in the teplizumab group and 35.9% per year in the placebo group. There were expected adverse events of rash and transient lymphopenia. KLRG1+TIGIT+CD8+ T cells were more common in the teplizumab group than in the placebo group. Among the participants who were HLA-DR3-negative, HLA-DR4-positive, or anti-zinc transporter 8 antibody-negative, fewer participants in the teplizumab group than in the placebo group had diabetes diagnosed. CONCLUSIONS: Teplizumab delayed progression to clinical type 1 diabetes in high-risk participants. (Funded by the National Institutes of Health and others; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01030861.).

        "Oral Semaglutide and Cardiovascular Outcomes in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes. BACKGROUND: Establishing cardiovascular safety of new therapies for type 2 diabetes is important. Safety data are available for the subcutaneous form of the glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist semaglutide but are needed for oral semaglutide. METHODS: We assessed cardiovascular outcomes of once-daily oral semaglutide in an event-driven, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial involving patients at high cardiovascular risk (age of \u226550 years with established cardiovascular or chronic kidney disease, or age of \u226560 years with cardiovascular risk factors only). The primary outcome in a time-to-event analysis was the first occurrence of a major adverse cardiovascular event (death from cardiovascular causes, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke). The trial was designed to rule out 80% excess cardiovascular risk as compared with placebo (noninferiority margin of 1.8 for the upper boundary of the 95% confidence interval for the hazard ratio for the primary outcome). RESULTS: A total of 3183 patients were randomly assigned to receive oral semaglutide or placebo. The mean age of the patients was 66 years; 2695 patients (84.7%) were 50 years of age or older and had cardiovascular or chronic kidney disease. The median time in the trial was 15.9 months. Major adverse cardiovascular events occurred in 61 of 1591 patients (3.8%) in the oral semaglutide group and 76 of 1592 (4.8%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.79; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.57 to 1.11; P<0.001 for noninferiority). Results for components of the primary outcome were as follows: death from cardiovascular causes, 15 of 1591 patients (0.9%) in the oral semaglutide group and 30 of 1592 (1.9%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.27 to 0.92); nonfatal myocardial infarction, 37 of 1591 patients (2.3%) and 31 of 1592 (1.9%), respectively (hazard ratio, 1.18; 95% CI, 0.73 to 1.90); and nonfatal stroke, 12 of 1591 patients (0.8%) and 16 of 1592 (1.0%), respectively (hazard ratio, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.35 to 1.57). Death from any cause occurred in 23 of 1591 patients (1.4%) in the oral semaglutide group and 45 of 1592 (2.8%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.31 to 0.84). Gastrointestinal adverse events leading to discontinuation of oral semaglutide or placebo were more common with oral semaglutide. CONCLUSIONS: In this trial involving patients with type 2 diabetes, the cardiovascular risk profile of oral semaglutide was not inferior to that of placebo.

        "Low-Dose Methotrexate for the Prevention of Atherosclerotic Events. BACKGROUND: Inflammation is causally related to atherothrombosis. Treatment with canakinumab, a monoclonal antibody that inhibits inflammation by neutralizing interleukin-1\u03b2, resulted in a lower rate of cardiovascular events than placebo in a previous randomized trial. We sought to determine whether an alternative approach to inflammation inhibition with low-dose methotrexate might provide similar benefit. METHODS: We conducted a randomized, double-blind trial of low-dose methotrexate (at a target dose of 15 to 20 mg weekly) or matching placebo in 4786 patients with previous myocardial infarction or multivessel coronary disease who additionally had either type 2 diabetes or the metabolic syndrome. All participants received 1 mg of folate daily. The primary end point at the onset of the trial was a composite of nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, or cardiovascular death. Near the conclusion of the trial, but before unblinding, hospitalization for unstable angina that led to urgent revascularization was added to the primary end point. RESULTS: The trial was stopped after a median follow-up of 2.3 years. Methotrexate did not result in lower interleukin-1\u03b2, interleukin-6, or C-reactive protein levels than placebo. The final primary end point occurred in 201 patients in the methotrexate group and in 207 in the placebo group (incidence rate, 4.13 vs. 4.31 per 100 person-years; hazard ratio, 0.96; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.79 to 1.16). The original primary end point occurred in 170 patients in the methotrexate group and in 167 in the placebo group (incidence rate, 3.46 vs. 3.43 per 100 person-years; hazard ratio, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.82 to 1.25). Methotrexate was associated with elevations in liver-enzyme levels, reductions in leukocyte counts and hematocrit levels, and a higher incidence of non-basal-cell skin cancers than placebo. CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with stable atherosclerosis, low-dose methotrexate did not reduce levels of interleukin-1\u03b2, interleukin-6, or C-reactive protein and did not result in fewer cardiovascular events than placebo.

        "Apple cider vinegar soaks [0.5%] as a treatment for atopic dermatitis do not improve skin barrier integrity. BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a common chronic inflammatory skin condition associated with high transepidermal water loss, high skin pH, and Staphylococcus aureus skin colonization. The treatment of AD with bath additives remains highly debated. Recent evidence suggests that dilute apple cider vinegar (ACV) may improve skin barrier integrity in AD, but its safety and efficacy are not well studied. This pilot split-arm study analyzed the effect of dilute apple cider vinegar soaks on skin barrier integrity in patients with atopic dermatitis as measured by skin transepidermal water loss and skin pH. METHODS: A total of 22 subjects (11 AD and 11 healthy controls) were enrolled. Subjects soaked both of their forearms for 14\u00a0days, with one arm in dilute ACV (0.5% acetic acid) and the other in water 10\u00a0minutes daily. Transepidermal water loss and pH were measured pre- and post-treatment. RESULTS: In both groups, transepidermal water loss increased and pH decreased at 0\u00a0minutes post-ACV treatment, but these effects were not sustained at 60\u00a0minutes. In total, 72.7% (16/22) of subjects reported mild side effects from ACV with improvement after discontinuing the soaks. CONCLUSIONS: Dilute ACV soaks have no significant effect on skin barrier integrity but caused skin irritation in a majority of subjects. Study limitations include analysis of a single brand, dilution, and application of ACV. Future studies are needed to explore whether lower concentrations of ACV soaks or other applications such as a leave-on acidic ointment could improve skin barrier integrity in a safe, nonirritating way.

        "Cardiovascular Risk Reduction with Icosapent Ethyl for Hypertriglyceridemia. BACKGROUND: Patients with elevated triglyceride levels are at increased risk for ischemic events. Icosapent ethyl, a highly purified eicosapentaenoic acid ethyl ester, lowers triglyceride levels, but data are needed to determine its effects on ischemic events. METHODS: We performed a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial involving patients with established cardiovascular disease or with diabetes and other risk factors, who had been receiving statin therapy and who had a fasting triglyceride level of 135 to 499 mg per deciliter (1.52 to 5.63 mmol per liter) and a low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level of 41 to 100 mg per deciliter (1.06 to 2.59 mmol per liter). The patients were randomly assigned to receive 2 g of icosapent ethyl twice daily (total daily dose, 4 g) or placebo. The primary end point was a composite of cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, coronary revascularization, or unstable angina. The key secondary end point was a composite of cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke. RESULTS: A total of 8179 patients were enrolled (70.7% for secondary prevention of cardiovascular events) and were followed for a median of 4.9 years. A primary end-point event occurred in 17.2% of the patients in the icosapent ethyl group, as compared with 22.0% of the patients in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.75; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.68 to 0.83; P<0.001); the corresponding rates of the key secondary end point were 11.2% and 14.8% (hazard ratio, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.65 to 0.83; P<0.001). The rates of additional ischemic end points, as assessed according to a prespecified hierarchical schema, were significantly lower in the icosapent ethyl group than in the placebo group, including the rate of cardiovascular death (4.3% vs. 5.2%; hazard ratio, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.66 to 0.98; P=0.03). A larger percentage of patients in the icosapent ethyl group than in the placebo group were hospitalized for atrial fibrillation or flutter (3.1% vs. 2.1%, P=0.004). Serious bleeding events occurred in 2.7% of the patients in the icosapent ethyl group and in 2.1% in the placebo group (P=0.06). CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with elevated triglyceride levels despite the use of statins, the risk of ischemic events, including cardiovascular death, was significantly lower among those who received 2 g of icosapent ethyl twice daily than among those who received placebo.

        "Effects of Sacubitril-Valsartan Versus Valsartan in Women Compared With Men With Heart Failure and Preserved Ejection Fraction: Insights From PARAGON-HF. BACKGROUND: Unlike heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, there is no approved treatment for heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, the predominant phenotype in women. Therefore, there is a greater heart failure therapeutic deficit in women compared with men. METHODS: In a prespecified subgroup analysis, we examined outcomes according to sex in the PARAGON-HF trial (Prospective Comparison of ARNI With ARB Global Outcomes in Heart Failure With Preserved Ejection Fraction), which compared sacubitril-valsartan and valsartan in patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. The primary outcome was a composite of first and recurrent hospitalizations for heart failure and death from cardiovascular causes. We also report secondary efficacy and safety outcomes. RESULTS: Overall, 2479 women (51.7%) and 2317 men (48.3%) were randomized. Women were older and had more obesity, less coronary disease, and lower estimated glomerular filtration rate and NT-proBNP (N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide) levels than men. For the primary outcome, the rate ratio for sacubitril-valsartan versus valsartan was 0.73 (95% CI, 0.59-0.90) in women and 1.03 (95% CI, 0.84-1.25) in men (P interaction = 0.017). The benefit from sacubitril-valsartan was attributable to reduction in heart failure hospitalization. The improvement in New York Heart Association class and renal function with sacubitril-valsartan was similar in women and men, whereas the improvement in Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire clinical summary score was less in women than in men. The difference in adverse events between sacubitril-valsartan and valsartan was similar in women and men. CONCLUSIONS: As compared with valsartan, sacubitril-valsartan seemed to reduce the risk of heart failure hospitalization more in women than in men. Whereas the possible sex-related modification of the effect of treatment has several potential explanations, the present study does not provide a definite mechanistic basis for this finding.

        "A Comparison of Two LDL Cholesterol Targets after Ischemic Stroke. BACKGROUND: The use of intensive lipid-lowering therapy by means of statin medications is recommended after transient ischemic attack (TIA) and ischemic stroke of atherosclerotic origin. The target level for low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol to reduce cardiovascular events after stroke has not been well studied. METHODS: In this parallel-group trial conducted in France and South Korea, we randomly assigned patients with ischemic stroke in the previous 3 months or a TIA within the previous 15 days to a target LDL cholesterol level of less than 70 mg per deciliter (1.8 mmol per liter) (lower-target group) or to a target range of 90 mg to 110 mg per deciliter (2.3 to 2.8 mmol per liter) (higher-target group). All the patients had evidence of cerebrovascular or coronary-artery atherosclerosis and received a statin, ezetimibe, or both. The composite primary end point of major cardiovascular events included ischemic stroke, myocardial infarction, new symptoms leading to urgent coronary or carotid revascularization, or death from cardiovascular causes. RESULTS: A total of 2860 patients were enrolled and followed for a median of 3.5 years; 1430 were assigned to each LDL cholesterol target group. The mean LDL cholesterol level at baseline was 135 mg per deciliter (3.5 mmol per liter), and the mean achieved LDL cholesterol level was 65 mg per deciliter (1.7 mmol per liter) in the lower-target group and 96 mg per deciliter (2.5 mmol per liter) in the higher-target group. The trial was stopped for administrative reasons after 277 of an anticipated 385 end-point events had occurred. The composite primary end point occurred in 121 patients (8.5%) in the lower-target group and in 156 (10.9%) in the higher-target group (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.78; 95% confidence interval, 0.61 to 0.98; P\u2009=\u20090.04). The incidence of intracranial hemorrhage and newly diagnosed diabetes did not differ significantly between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: After an ischemic stroke or TIA with evidence of atherosclerosis, patients who had a target LDL cholesterol level of less than 70 mg per deciliter had a lower risk of subsequent cardiovascular events than those who had a target range of 90 mg to 110 mg per deciliter.

        "Early Surgery or Conservative Care for Asymptomatic Aortic Stenosis. BACKGROUND: The timing and indications for surgical intervention in asymptomatic patients with severe aortic stenosis remain controversial. METHODS: In a multicenter trial, we randomly assigned 145 asymptomatic patients with very severe aortic stenosis (defined as an aortic-valve area of \u22640.75 cm2 with either an aortic jet velocity of \u22654.5 m per second or a mean transaortic gradient of \u226550 mm Hg) to early surgery or to conservative care according to the recommendations of current guidelines. The primary end point was a composite of death during or within 30 days after surgery (often called operative mortality) or death from cardiovascular causes during the entire follow-up period. The major secondary end point was death from any cause during follow-up. RESULTS: In the early-surgery group, 69 of 73 patients (95%) underwent surgery within 2 months after randomization, and there was no operative mortality. In an intention-to-treat analysis, a primary end-point event occurred in 1 patient in the early-surgery group (1%) and in 11 of 72 patients in the conservative-care group (15%) (hazard ratio, 0.09; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.01 to 0.67; P\u2009=\u20090.003). Death from any cause occurred in 5 patients in the early-surgery group (7%) and in 15 patients in the conservative-care group (21%) (hazard ratio, 0.33; 95% CI, 0.12 to 0.90). In the conservative-care group, the cumulative incidence of sudden death was 4% at 4 years and 14% at 8 years. CONCLUSIONS: Among asymptomatic patients with very severe aortic stenosis, the incidence of the composite of operative mortality or death from cardiovascular causes during the follow-up period was significantly lower among those who underwent early aortic-valve replacement surgery than among those who received conservative care.

        "Results of the FUEL Trial. BACKGROUND: The Fontan operation creates a total cavopulmonary connection, a circulation in which the importance of pulmonary vascular resistance is magnified. Over time, this circulation leads to deterioration of cardiovascular efficiency associated with a decline in exercise performance. Rigorous clinical trials aimed at improving physiology and guiding pharmacotherapy are lacking. METHODS: The FUEL trial (Fontan Udenafil Exercise Longitudinal) was a phase III clinical trial conducted at 30 centers. Participants were randomly assigned udenafil, 87.5 mg twice daily, or placebo in a 1:1 ratio. The primary outcome was the between-group difference in change in oxygen consumption at peak exercise. Secondary outcomes included between-group differences in changes in submaximal exercise at the ventilatory anaerobic threshold, the myocardial performance index, the natural log of the reactive hyperemia index, and serum brain-type natriuretic peptide. RESULTS: Between 2017 and 2019, 30 clinical sites in North America and the Republic of Korea randomly assigned 400 participants with Fontan physiology. The mean age at randomization was 15.5\u00b12 years; 60% of participants were male, and 81% were white. All 400 participants were included in the primary analysis with imputation of the 26-week end point for 21 participants with missing data (11 randomly assigned to udenafil and 10 to placebo). Among randomly assigned participants, peak oxygen consumption increased by 44\u00b1245 mL/min (2.8%) in the udenafil group and declined by 3.7\u00b1228 mL/min (-0.2%) in the placebo group (P=0.071). Analysis at ventilatory anaerobic threshold demonstrated improvements in the udenafil group versus the placebo group in oxygen consumption (+33\u00b1185 [3.2%] versus -9\u00b1193 [-0.9%] mL/min, P=0.012), ventilatory equivalents of carbon dioxide (-0.8 versus -0.06, P=0.014), and work rate (+3.8 versus +0.34 W, P=0.021). There was no difference in change of myocardial performance index, the natural log of the reactive hyperemia index, or serum brain-type natriuretic peptide level. CONCLUSIONS: In the FUEL trial, treatment with udenafil (87.5 mg twice daily) was not associated with an improvement in oxygen consumption at peak exercise but was associated with improvements in multiple measures of exercise performance at the ventilatory anaerobic threshold.

        "Burosumab Therapy in Children with X-Linked Hypophosphatemia. BACKGROUND: X-linked hypophosphatemia is characterized by increased secretion of fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF-23), which leads to hypophosphatemia and consequently rickets, osteomalacia, and skeletal deformities. We investigated burosumab, a monoclonal antibody that targets FGF-23, in patients with X-linked hypophosphatemia. METHODS: In an open-label, phase 2 trial, we randomly assigned 52 children with X-linked hypophosphatemia, in a 1:1 ratio, to receive subcutaneous burosumab either every 2 weeks or every 4 weeks; the dose was adjusted to achieve a serum phosphorus level at the low end of the normal range. The primary end point was the change from baseline to weeks 40 and 64 in the Thacher rickets severity total score (ranging from 0 to 10, with higher scores indicating greater disease severity). In addition, the Radiographic Global Impression of Change was used to evaluate rachitic changes from baseline to week 40 and to week 64. Additional end points were changes in pharmacodynamic markers, linear growth, physical ability, and patient-reported outcomes and the incidence of adverse events. RESULTS: The mean Thacher rickets severity total score decreased from 1.9 at baseline to 0.8 at week 40 with every-2-week dosing and from 1.7 at baseline to 1.1 at week 40 with every-4-week dosing (P<0.001 for both comparisons); these improvements persisted at week 64. The mean serum phosphorus level increased after the first dose in both groups, and more than half the patients in both groups had levels within the normal range (3.2 to 6.1 mg per deciliter [1.0 to 2.0 mmol per liter]) by week 6. Stable serum phosphorus levels were maintained through week 64 with every-2-week dosing. Renal tubular phosphate reabsorption increased from baseline in both groups, with an overall mean increase of 0.98 mg per deciliter (0.32 mmol per liter). The mean dose of burosumab at week 40 was 0.98 mg per kilogram of body weight with every-2-week dosing and 1.50 mg per kilogram with every-4-week dosing. Across both groups, the mean serum alkaline phosphatase level decreased from 459 U per liter at baseline to 369 U per liter at week 64. The mean standing-height z score increased in both groups, with greater improvement seen at all time points with every-2-week dosing (an increase from baseline of 0.19 at week 64) than with every-4-week dosing (an increase from baseline of 0.12 at week 64). Physical ability improved and pain decreased. Nearly all the adverse events were mild or moderate in severity. CONCLUSIONS: In children with X-linked hypophosphatemia, treatment with burosumab improved renal tubular phosphate reabsorption, serum phosphorus levels, linear growth, and physical function and reduced pain and the severity of rickets.

        "Long-Term Effects of Intensive Glycemic and Blood Pressure Control and Fenofibrate Use on Kidney Outcomes. BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: In people with type 2 diabetes, aggressive control of glycemia, BP, and lipids have resulted in conflicting short-term (<5 years) kidney outcomes. We aimed to determine the long-term kidney effects of these interventions. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: The Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD) was a multifactorial intervention study in people with type 2 diabetes at high risk for cardiovascular disease (n=10,251), to examine the effects of intensive glycemic control (hemoglobin A1c <6.0% versus 7%-7.9%), BP control (systolic BP <120 mm Hg versus <140 mm Hg) or fenofibrate versus placebo added to simvastatin on cardiovascular events and death. The glycemia trial lasted 3.7 years and participants were followed for another 6.5 years in ACCORDION, the ACCORD Follow-On Study. The post hoc primary composite kidney outcome was defined as incident macroalbuminuria, creatinine doubling, need for dialysis, or death by any cause. Cox proportional hazards regression estimated the effect of each intervention on the composite outcome and individual components. In secondary outcome analyses, competing risk regression was used to account for the risk of death in incident kidney outcomes. Analyses were adjusted for sociodemographics, randomization groups, and clinical factors. RESULTS: There were 988 cases of incident macroalbuminuria, 954 with doubling of creatinine, 351 requiring dialysis, and 1905 deaths. Hazard ratios (HRs) for the composite outcome with intensive glycemic, BP control, and fenofibrate use compared with standard therapy were 0.92 (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 0.86 to 0.98), 1.16 (95% CI, 1.05 to 1.28), and 1.16 (95% CI, 1.06 to 1.27). Multivariable, secondary outcome analyses showed that in the glycemia trial, only macroalbuminuria was significantly decreased (HR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.59 to 0.77). In the BP and lipid trials, only creatinine doubling was affected (HR, 1.64; 95% CI, 1.30 to 2.06 and HR, 2.00; 95% CI, 1.61 to 2.49, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: In people with type 2 diabetes at high risk for cardiovascular disease, intensive glycemic control may result in a long-term reduction in macroalbuminuria; however, intensive BP control and fenofibrates may increase the risk for adverse kidney events.

        "Association of Baclofen With Encephalopathy in Patients With Chronic Kidney Disease. Importance: At least 30 case reports have linked the muscle relaxant baclofen to encephalopathy in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Objective: To compare the 30-day risk of encephalopathy in patients with CKD and newly prescribed baclofen at greater than or equal to 20 mg per day vs less than 20 mg per day. The secondary objective was to compare the risk of encephalopathy in baclofen users vs nonusers. Design, Setting, and Participants: Retrospective population-based cohort study in Ontario, Canada (2007-2018) using linked health care data. Participants comprised 15\u202f942 older adults (aged 66 years or older) with CKD (defined as an estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] <60 mL/min/1.73 m2 but not receiving dialysis). The primary cohort was restricted to patients who were newly prescribed baclofen; participants in the secondary cohort were new users and nonusers. Exposures: Prescription for oral baclofen greater than or equal to 20 mg per day vs less than 20 mg per day. Main Outcomes and Measures: Hospital admission with encephalopathy, defined as a main diagnosis of delirium, disorientation, transient alteration of awareness, transient cerebral ischemic attack, or unspecified dementia within 30 days of starting baclofen. Inverse probability of treatment weighting on the propensity score was used to balance comparison groups on indicators of baseline health. Weighted risk ratios (RRs) were obtained using modified Poisson regression and weighted risk differences (RDs) using binomial regression. Prespecified subgroup analyses were conducted by eGFR category. Results: The primary cohort comprised 15\u202f942 patients with CKD (9699 [61%] women; median age, 77 years [interquartile range, 71-82]; 9707 [61%] patients started baclofen at \u226520 mg/d and 6235 [39%] at <20 mg/d). The primary outcome, hospitalization with encephalopathy, occurred in 108/9707 (1.11%) patients who started baclofen at greater than or equal to 20 mg per day and in 26/6235 (0.42%) who started baclofen at less than 20 mg per day; weighted RR, 3.54 (95% CI, 2.24 to 5.59); weighted RD, 0.80% (95% CI, 0.55% to 1.04%). In subgroup analysis, the absolute risk increased progressively at lower eGFR (weighted RD eGFR 45-59, 0.42% [95% CI, 0.19%-0.64%]; eGFR 30-44, 1.23% [95% CI, 0.62%-1.84%]; eGFR <30, 2.90% [95% CI, 1.30%-4.49%]; P for interaction, <.001]). In the secondary comparison with 284\u202f263 nonusers, both groups of baclofen users had a higher risk of encephalopathy (<20 mg/d weighted RR, 5.90 [95% CI, 3.59 to 9.70] and \u226520 mg/d weighted RR, 19.8 [95% CI, 14.0 to 28.0]). Conclusions and Relevance: Among older patients with CKD who were newly prescribed baclofen, the 30-day incidence of encephalopathy was increased among those prescribed higher doses compared with lower doses. If verified, these risks should be balanced against the benefits of baclofen use. ",
        "Derivation, Validation, and Potential Treatment Implications of Novel Clinical Phenotypes for Sepsis. Importance: Sepsis is a heterogeneous syndrome. Identification of distinct clinical phenotypes may allow more precise therapy and improve care. Objective: To derive sepsis phenotypes from clinical data, determine their reproducibility and correlation with host-response biomarkers and clinical outcomes, and assess the potential causal relationship with results from randomized clinical trials (RCTs). Design, Settings, and Participants: Retrospective analysis of data sets using statistical, machine learning, and simulation tools. Phenotypes were derived among 20\u202f189 total patients (16\u202f552 unique patients) who met Sepsis-3 criteria within 6 hours of hospital presentation at 12 Pennsylvania hospitals (2010-2012) using consensus k means clustering applied to 29 variables. Reproducibility and correlation with biological parameters and clinical outcomes were assessed in a second database (2013-2014; n\u2009=\u200943\u202f086 total patients and n\u2009=\u200931\u202f160 unique patients), in a prospective cohort study of sepsis due to pneumonia (n\u2009=\u2009583), and in 3 sepsis RCTs (n\u2009=\u20094737). Exposures: All clinical and laboratory variables in the electronic health record. Main Outcomes and Measures: Derived phenotype (\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3, and \u03b4) frequency, host-response biomarkers, 28-day and 365-day mortality, and RCT simulation outputs. Results: The derivation cohort included 20\u202f189 patients with sepsis (mean age, 64 [SD, 17] years; 10\u202f022 [50%] male; mean maximum 24-hour Sequential Organ Failure Assessment [SOFA] score, 3.9 [SD, 2.4]). The validation cohort included 43\u202f086 patients (mean age, 67 [SD, 17] years; 21\u202f993 [51%] male; mean maximum 24-hour SOFA score, 3.6 [SD, 2.0]). Of the 4 derived phenotypes, the \u03b1 phenotype was the most common (n\u2009=\u20096625; 33%) and included patients with the lowest administration of a vasopressor; in the \u03b2 phenotype (n\u2009=\u20095512; 27%), patients were older and had more chronic illness and renal dysfunction; in the \u03b3 phenotype (n\u2009=\u20095385; 27%), patients had more inflammation and pulmonary dysfunction; and in the \u03b4 phenotype (n\u2009=\u20092667; 13%), patients had more liver dysfunction and septic shock. Phenotype distributions were similar in the validation cohort. There were consistent differences in biomarker patterns by phenotype. In the derivation cohort, cumulative 28-day mortality was 287 deaths of 5691 unique patients (5%) for the \u03b1 phenotype; 561 of 4420 (13%) for the \u03b2 phenotype; 1031 of 4318 (24%) for the \u03b3 phenotype; and 897 of 2223 (40%) for the \u03b4 phenotype. Across all cohorts and trials, 28-day and 365-day mortality were highest among the \u03b4 phenotype vs the other 3 phenotypes (P\u2009<\u2009.001). In simulation models, the proportion of RCTs reporting benefit, harm, or no effect changed considerably (eg, varying the phenotype frequencies within an RCT of early goal-directed therapy changed the results from >33% chance of benefit to >60% chance of harm). Conclusions and Relevance: In this retrospective analysis of data sets from patients with sepsis, 4 clinical phenotypes were identified that correlated with host-response patterns and clinical outcomes, and simulations suggested these phenotypes may help in understanding heterogeneity of treatment effects. Further research is needed to determine the utility of these phenotypes in clinical care and for informing trial design and interpretation. ",
        "Effect of a Recombinant Human Soluble Thrombomodulin on Mortality in Patients With Sepsis-Associated Coagulopathy: The SCARLET Randomized Clinical Trial. Importance: Previous research suggested that soluble human recombinant thrombomodulin may reduce mortality among patients with sepsis-associated coagulopathy. Objective: To determine the effect of human recombinant thrombomodulin vs placebo on 28-day all-cause mortality among patients with sepsis-associated coagulopathy. Design, Setting, and Participants: The SCARLET trial was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multinational, multicenter phase 3 study conducted in intensive care units at 159 sites in 26 countries. All adult patients admitted to one of the participating intensive care units between October 2012 and March 2018 with sepsis-associated coagulopathy and concomitant cardiovascular and/or respiratory failure, defined as an international normalized ratio greater than 1.40 without other known etiology and a platelet count in the range of 30 to 150\u2009\u00d7\u2009109/L or a greater than 30% decrease in platelet count within 24 hours, were considered for inclusion. The final date of follow-up was February 28, 2019. Interventions: Patients with sepsis-associated coagulopathy were randomized and treated with an intravenous bolus or a 15-minute infusion of thrombomodulin (0.06 mg/kg/d [maximum, 6 mg/d]; n\u2009=\u2009395) or matching placebo (n\u2009=\u2009405) once daily for 6 days. Main Outcome and Measures: The primary end point was 28-day all-cause mortality. Results: Among 816 randomized patients, 800 (mean age, 60.7 years; 437 [54.6%] men) completed the study and were included in the full analysis set. In these patients, the 28-day all-cause mortality rate was not statistically significantly different between the thrombomodulin group and the placebo group (106 of 395 patients [26.8%] vs 119 of 405 patients [29.4%], respectively; P\u2009=\u2009.32). The absolute risk difference was 2.55% (95% CI, -3.68% to 8.77%). The incidence of serious major bleeding adverse events (defined as any intracranial hemorrhage; life-threatening bleeding; or bleeding event classified as serious by the investigator, with administration of at least 1440 mL [typically 6 units] of packed red blood cells over 2 consecutive days) was 23 of 396 patients (5.8%) in the thrombomodulin group and 16 of 404 (4.0%) in the placebo group. Conclusions and Relevance: Among patients with sepsis-associated coagulopathy, administration of a human recombinant thrombomodulin, compared with placebo, did not significantly reduce 28-day all-cause mortality.

        "Effectiveness of Online vs In-Person Care for Adults With Psoriasis: A Randomized Clinical Trial. Importance: Innovative, online models of specialty-care delivery are critical to improving patient access and outcomes. Objective: To determine whether an online, collaborative connected-health model results in equivalent clinical improvements in psoriasis compared with in-person care. Design, Setting, and Participants: The Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute Psoriasis Teledermatology Trial is a 12-month, pragmatic, randomized clinical equivalency trial to evaluate the effect of an online model for psoriasis compared with in-person care. Participant recruitment and study visits took place at multicenter ambulatory clinics from February 2, 2015, to August 18, 2017. Participants were adults with psoriasis in Northern California, Southern California, and Colorado. The eligibility criteria were an age of 18 years or older, having physician-diagnosed psoriasis, access to the internet and a digital camera or mobile phone with a camera, and having a primary care physician. Analyses were on an intention-to-treat basis. Interventions: Participants were randomized 1:1 to receive online or in-person care (148 randomized to online care and 148 randomized to in-person care). The online model enabled patients and primary care physicians to access dermatologists online asynchronously. The dermatologists provided assessments, recommendations, education, and prescriptions online. The in-person group sought care in person. The frequency of online or in-person visits was determined by medical necessity. All participants were exposed to their respective interventions for 12 months. Main Outcomes and Measures: The prespecified primary outcome was the difference in improvement in the self-administered Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) score between the online and in-person groups. Prespecified secondary outcomes included body surface area (BSA) affected by psoriasis and the patient global assessment score. Results: Of the 296 randomized participants, 147 were women, 149 were men, 187 were white, and the mean (SD) age was 49 (14) years. The adjusted difference between the online and in-person groups in the mean change in the self-administered PASI score during the 12-month study period was -0.27 (95% CI, -0.85 to 0.31). The difference in the mean change in BSA affected by psoriasis between the 2 groups was -0.05% (95% CI, -1.58% to 1.48%). Between-group differences in the PASI score and BSA were within prespecified equivalence margins, which demonstrated equivalence between the 2 interventions. The difference in the mean change in the patient global assessment score between the 2 groups was -0.11 (95% CI, -0.32 to 0.10), which exceeded the equivalence margin, with the online group displaying greater improvement. Conclusions and Relevance: The online, collaborative connected-health model was as effective as in-person management in improving clinical outcomes among patients with psoriasis. Innovative telehealth delivery models that emphasize collaboration, quality, and efficiency can be transformative to improving patient-centered outcomes in chronic diseases.

        "Nintedanib for Systemic Sclerosis-Associated Interstitial Lung Disease. BACKGROUND: Interstitial lung disease (ILD) is a common manifestation of systemic sclerosis and a leading cause of systemic sclerosis-related death. Nintedanib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, has been shown to have antifibrotic and antiinflammatory effects in preclinical models of systemic sclerosis and ILD. METHODS: We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to investigate the efficacy and safety of nintedanib in patients with ILD associated with systemic sclerosis. Patients who had systemic sclerosis with an onset of the first non-Raynaud's symptom within the past 7 years and a high-resolution computed tomographic scan that showed fibrosis affecting at least 10% of the lungs were randomly assigned, in a 1:1 ratio, to receive 150 mg of nintedanib, administered orally twice daily, or placebo. The primary end point was the annual rate of decline in forced vital capacity (FVC), assessed over a 52-week period. Key secondary end points were absolute changes from baseline in the modified Rodnan skin score and in the total score on the St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) at week 52. RESULTS: A total of 576 patients received at least one dose of nintedanib or placebo; 51.9% had diffuse cutaneous systemic sclerosis, and 48.4% were receiving mycophenolate at baseline. In the primary end-point analysis, the adjusted annual rate of change in FVC was -52.4 ml per year in the nintedanib group and -93.3 ml per year in the placebo group (difference, 41.0 ml per year; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.9 to 79.0; P\u2009=\u20090.04). Sensitivity analyses based on multiple imputation for missing data yielded P values for the primary end point ranging from 0.06 to 0.10. The change from baseline in the modified Rodnan skin score and the total score on the SGRQ at week 52 did not differ significantly between the trial groups, with differences of -0.21 (95% CI, -0.94 to 0.53; P\u2009=\u20090.58) and 1.69 (95% CI, -0.73 to 4.12 [not adjusted for multiple comparisons]), respectively. Diarrhea, the most common adverse event, was reported in 75.7% of the patients in the nintedanib group and in 31.6% of those in the placebo group. CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with ILD associated with systemic sclerosis, the annual rate of decline in FVC was lower with nintedanib than with placebo; no clinical benefit of nintedanib was observed for other manifestations of systemic sclerosis. The adverse-event profile of nintedanib observed in this trial was similar to that observed in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis; gastrointestinal adverse events, including diarrhea, were more common with nintedanib than with placebo.

        "Dapagliflozin in Patients with Heart Failure and Reduced Ejection Fraction. BACKGROUND: In patients with type 2 diabetes, inhibitors of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) reduce the risk of a first hospitalization for heart failure, possibly through glucose-independent mechanisms. More data are needed regarding the effects of SGLT2 inhibitors in patients with established heart failure and a reduced ejection fraction, regardless of the presence or absence of type 2 diabetes. METHODS: In this phase 3, placebo-controlled trial, we randomly assigned 4744 patients with New York Heart Association class II, III, or IV heart failure and an ejection fraction of 40% or less to receive either dapagliflozin (at a dose of 10 mg once daily) or placebo, in addition to recommended therapy. The primary outcome was a composite of worsening heart failure (hospitalization or an urgent visit resulting in intravenous therapy for heart failure) or cardiovascular death. RESULTS: Over a median of 18.2 months, the primary outcome occurred in 386 of 2373 patients (16.3%) in the dapagliflozin group and in 502 of 2371 patients (21.2%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.74; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.65 to 0.85; P<0.001). A first worsening heart failure event occurred in 237 patients (10.0%) in the dapagliflozin group and in 326 patients (13.7%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.59 to 0.83). Death from cardiovascular causes occurred in 227 patients (9.6%) in the dapagliflozin group and in 273 patients (11.5%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.69 to 0.98); 276 patients (11.6%) and 329 patients (13.9%), respectively, died from any cause (hazard ratio, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.71 to 0.97). Findings in patients with diabetes were similar to those in patients without diabetes. The frequency of adverse events related to volume depletion, renal dysfunction, and hypoglycemia did not differ between treatment groups. CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with heart failure and a reduced ejection fraction, the risk of worsening heart failure or death from cardiovascular causes was lower among those who received dapagliflozin than among those who received placebo, regardless of the presence or absence of diabetes.

        "Levothyroxine in Women with Thyroid Peroxidase Antibodies before Conception. BACKGROUND: Thyroid peroxidase antibodies are associated with an increased risk of miscarriage and preterm birth, even when thyroid function is normal. Small trials indicate that the use of levothyroxine could reduce the incidence of such adverse outcomes. METHODS: We conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to investigate whether levothyroxine treatment would increase live-birth rates among euthyroid women who had thyroid peroxidase antibodies and a history of miscarriage or infertility. A total of 19,585 women from 49 hospitals in the United Kingdom underwent testing for thyroid peroxidase antibodies and thyroid function. We randomly assigned 952 women to receive either 50 \u03bcg once daily of levothyroxine (476 women) or placebo (476 women) before conception through the end of pregnancy. The primary outcome was live birth after at least 34 weeks of gestation. RESULTS: The follow-up rate for the primary outcome was 98.7% (940 of 952 women). A total of 266 of 470 women in the levothyroxine group (56.6%) and 274 of 470 women in the placebo group (58.3%) became pregnant. The live-birth rate was 37.4% (176 of 470 women) in the levothyroxine group and 37.9% (178 of 470 women) in the placebo group (relative risk, 0.97; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.83 to 1.14, P\u2009=\u20090.74; absolute difference, -0.4 percentage points; 95% CI, -6.6 to 5.8). There were no significant between-group differences in other pregnancy outcomes, including pregnancy loss or preterm birth, or in neonatal outcomes. Serious adverse events occurred in 5.9% of women in the levothyroxine group and 3.8% in the placebo group (P\u2009=\u20090.14). CONCLUSIONS: The use of levothyroxine in euthyroid women with thyroid peroxidase antibodies did not result in a higher rate of live births than placebo.

        "Effect of Additional Oral Semaglutide vs Sitagliptin on Glycated Hemoglobin in Adults With Type 2 Diabetes Uncontrolled With Metformin Alone or With Sulfonylurea: The PIONEER 3 Randomized Clinical Trial. Importance: Phase 3 trials have not compared oral semaglutide, a glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist, with other classes of glucose-lowering therapy. Objective: To compare efficacy and assess long-term adverse event profiles of once-daily oral semaglutide vs sitagliptin, 100 mg added on to metformin with or without sulfonylurea, in patients with type 2 diabetes. Design, Setting, and Participants: Randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, parallel-group, phase 3a trial conducted at 206 sites in 14 countries over 78 weeks from February 2016 to March 2018. Of 2463 patients screened, 1864 adults with type 2 diabetes uncontrolled with metformin with or without sulfonylurea were randomized. Interventions: Patients were randomized to receive once-daily oral semaglutide, 3 mg (n\u2009=\u2009466), 7 mg (n\u2009=\u2009466), or 14 mg (n\u2009=\u2009465), or sitagliptin, 100 mg (n\u2009=\u2009467). Semaglutide was initiated at 3 mg/d and escalated every 4 weeks, first to 7 mg/d then to 14 mg/d, until the randomized dosage was achieved. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary end point was change in glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), and the key secondary end point was change in body weight, both from baseline to week 26. Both were assessed at weeks 52 and 78 as additional secondary end points. End points were tested for noninferiority with respect to HbA1c (noninferiority margin, 0.3%) prior to testing for superiority of HbA1c and body weight. Results: Among 1864 patients randomized (mean age, 58 [SD, 10] years; mean baseline HbA1c, 8.3% [SD, 0.9%]; mean body mass index, 32.5 [SD, 6.4]; n=879 [47.2%] women), 1758 (94.3%) completed the trial and 298 prematurely discontinued treatment (16.7% for semaglutide, 3 mg/d; 15.0% for semaglutide, 7 mg/d; 19.1% for semaglutide, 14 mg/d; and 13.1% for sitagliptin). Semaglutide, 7 and 14 mg/d, compared with sitagliptin, significantly reduced HbA1c (differences, -0.3% [95% CI, -0.4% to -0.1%] and -0.5% [95% CI, -0.6% to -0.4%], respectively; P\u2009<\u2009.001 for both) and body weight (differences, -1.6 kg [95% CI, -2.0 to -1.1 kg] and -2.5 kg [95% CI, -3.0 to -2.0 kg], respectively; P\u2009<\u2009.001 for both) from baseline to week 26. Noninferiority of semaglutide, 3 mg/d, with respect to HbA1c was not demonstrated. Week 78 reductions in both end points were statistically significantly greater with semaglutide, 14 mg/d, vs sitagliptin. Conclusions and Relevance: Among adults with type 2 diabetes uncontrolled with metformin with or without sulfonylurea, oral semaglutide, 7 mg/d and 14 mg/d, compared with sitagliptin, resulted in significantly greater reductions in HbA1c over 26 weeks, but there was no significant benefit with the 3-mg/d dosage. Further research is needed to assess effectiveness in a clinical setting. Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02607865. ",
        "Angiotensin-Neprilysin Inhibition in Heart Failure with Preserved Ejection Fraction. BACKGROUND: The angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitor sacubitril-valsartan led to a reduced risk of hospitalization for heart failure or death from cardiovascular causes among patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction. The effect of angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibition in patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction is unclear. METHODS: We randomly assigned 4822 patients with New York Heart Association (NYHA) class II to IV heart failure, ejection fraction of 45% or higher, elevated level of natriuretic peptides, and structural heart disease to receive sacubitril-valsartan (target dose, 97 mg of sacubitril with 103 mg of valsartan twice daily) or valsartan (target dose, 160 mg twice daily). The primary outcome was a composite of total hospitalizations for heart failure and death from cardiovascular causes. Primary outcome components, secondary outcomes (including NYHA class change, worsening renal function, and change in Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire [KCCQ] clinical summary score [scale, 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating fewer symptoms and physical limitations]), and safety were also assessed. RESULTS: There were 894 primary events in 526 patients in the sacubitril-valsartan group and 1009 primary events in 557 patients in the valsartan group (rate ratio, 0.87; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.75 to 1.01; P\u2009=\u20090.06). The incidence of death from cardiovascular causes was 8.5% in the sacubitril-valsartan group and 8.9% in the valsartan group (hazard ratio, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.79 to 1.16); there were 690 and 797 total hospitalizations for heart failure, respectively (rate ratio, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.72 to 1.00). NYHA class improved in 15.0% of the patients in the sacubitril-valsartan group and in 12.6% of those in the valsartan group (odds ratio, 1.45; 95% CI, 1.13 to 1.86); renal function worsened in 1.4% and 2.7%, respectively (hazard ratio, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.33 to 0.77). The mean change in the KCCQ clinical summary score at 8 months was 1.0 point (95% CI, 0.0 to 2.1) higher in the sacubitril-valsartan group. Patients in the sacubitril-valsartan group had a higher incidence of hypotension and angioedema and a lower incidence of hyperkalemia. Among 12 prespecified subgroups, there was suggestion of heterogeneity with possible benefit with sacubitril-valsartan in patients with lower ejection fraction and in women. CONCLUSIONS: Sacubitril-valsartan did not result in a significantly lower rate of total hospitalizations for heart failure and death from cardiovascular causes among patients with heart failure and an ejection fraction of 45% or higher.

        "Complete Revascularization with Multivessel PCI for Myocardial Infarction. BACKGROUND: In patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) of the culprit lesion reduces the risk of cardiovascular death or myocardial infarction. Whether PCI of nonculprit lesions further reduces the risk of such events is unclear. METHODS: We randomly assigned patients with STEMI and multivessel coronary artery disease who had undergone successful culprit-lesion PCI to a strategy of either complete revascularization with PCI of angiographically significant nonculprit lesions or no further revascularization. Randomization was stratified according to the intended timing of nonculprit-lesion PCI (either during or after the index hospitalization). The first coprimary outcome was the composite of cardiovascular death or myocardial infarction; the second coprimary outcome was the composite of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or ischemia-driven revascularization. RESULTS: At a median follow-up of 3 years, the first coprimary outcome had occurred in 158 of the 2016 patients (7.8%) in the complete-revascularization group as compared with 213 of the 2025 patients (10.5%) in the culprit-lesion-only PCI group (hazard ratio, 0.74; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.60 to 0.91; P\u2009=\u20090.004). The second coprimary outcome had occurred in 179 patients (8.9%) in the complete-revascularization group as compared with 339 patients (16.7%) in the culprit-lesion-only PCI group (hazard ratio, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.43 to 0.61; P<0.001). For both coprimary outcomes, the benefit of complete revascularization was consistently observed regardless of the intended timing of nonculprit-lesion PCI (P\u2009=\u20090.62 and P\u2009=\u20090.27 for interaction for the first and second coprimary outcomes, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with STEMI and multivessel coronary artery disease, complete revascularization was superior to culprit-lesion-only PCI in reducing the risk of cardiovascular death or myocardial infarction, as well as the risk of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or ischemia-driven revascularization.

        "Ticagrelor or Prasugrel in Patients with Acute Coronary Syndromes. BACKGROUND: The relative merits of ticagrelor as compared with prasugrel in patients with acute coronary syndromes for whom invasive evaluation is planned are uncertain. METHODS: In this multicenter, randomized, open-label trial, we randomly assigned patients who presented with acute coronary syndromes and for whom invasive evaluation was planned to receive either ticagrelor or prasugrel. The primary end point was the composite of death, myocardial infarction, or stroke at 1 year. A major secondary end point (the safety end point) was bleeding. RESULTS: A total of 4018 patients underwent randomization. A primary end-point event occurred in 184 of 2012 patients (9.3%) in the ticagrelor group and in 137 of 2006 patients (6.9%) in the prasugrel group (hazard ratio, 1.36; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.09 to 1.70; P\u2009=\u20090.006). The respective incidences of the individual components of the primary end point in the ticagrelor group and the prasugrel group were as follows: death, 4.5% and 3.7%; myocardial infarction, 4.8% and 3.0%; and stroke, 1.1% and 1.0%. Definite or probable stent thrombosis occurred in 1.3% of patients assigned to ticagrelor and 1.0% of patients assigned to prasugrel, and definite stent thrombosis occurred in 1.1% and 0.6%, respectively. Major bleeding (as defined by the Bleeding Academic Research Consortium scale) was observed in 5.4% of patients in the ticagrelor group and in 4.8% of patients in the prasugrel group (hazard ratio, 1.12; 95% CI, 0.83 to 1.51; P\u2009=\u20090.46). CONCLUSIONS: Among patients who presented with acute coronary syndromes with or without ST-segment elevation, the incidence of death, myocardial infarction, or stroke was significantly lower among those who received prasugrel than among those who received ticagrelor, and the incidence of major bleeding was not significantly different between the two groups.

        "A Genotype-Guided Strategy for Oral P2Y12 Inhibitors in Primary PCI. BACKGROUND: It is unknown whether patients undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) benefit from genotype-guided selection of oral P2Y12 inhibitors. METHODS: We conducted a randomized, open-label, assessor-blinded trial in which patients undergoing primary PCI with stent implantation were assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either a P2Y12 inhibitor on the basis of early CYP2C19 genetic testing (genotype-guided group) or standard treatment with either ticagrelor or prasugrel (standard-treatment group) for 12 months. In the genotype-guided group, carriers of CYP2C19*2 or CYP2C19*3 loss-of-function alleles received ticagrelor or prasugrel, and noncarriers received clopidogrel. The two primary outcomes were net adverse clinical events - defined as death from any cause, myocardial infarction, definite stent thrombosis, stroke, or major bleeding defined according to Platelet Inhibition and Patient Outcomes (PLATO) criteria - at 12 months (primary combined outcome; tested for noninferiority, with a noninferiority margin of 2 percentage points for the absolute difference) and PLATO major or minor bleeding at 12 months (primary bleeding outcome). RESULTS: For the primary analysis, 2488 patients were included: 1242 in the genotype-guided group and 1246 in the standard-treatment group. The primary combined outcome occurred in 63 patients (5.1%) in the genotype-guided group and in 73 patients (5.9%) in the standard-treatment group (absolute difference, -0.7 percentage points; 95% confidence interval [CI], -2.0 to 0.7; P<0.001 for noninferiority). The primary bleeding outcome occurred in 122 patients (9.8%) in the genotype-guided group and in 156 patients (12.5%) in the standard-treatment group (hazard ratio, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.61 to 0.98; P\u2009=\u20090.04). CONCLUSIONS: In patients undergoing primary PCI, a CYP2C19 genotype-guided strategy for selection of oral P2Y12 inhibitor therapy was noninferior to standard treatment with ticagrelor or prasugrel at 12 months with respect to thrombotic events and resulted in a lower incidence of bleeding.

        "Association of Genetic Variants Related to Combined Exposure to Lower Low-Density Lipoproteins and Lower Systolic Blood Pressure With Lifetime Risk of Cardiovascular Disease. Importance: The relationship between exposure to lower low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and lower systolic blood pressure (SBP) with the risk of cardiovascular disease has not been reliably quantified. Objective: To assess the association of lifetime exposure to the combination of both lower LDL-C and lower SBP with the lifetime risk of cardiovascular disease. Design, Setting, and Participants: Among 438\u202f952 participants enrolled in the UK Biobank between 2006 and 2010 and followed up through 2018, genetic LDL-C and SBP scores were used as instruments to divide participants into groups with lifetime exposure to lower LDL-C, lower SBP, or both. Differences in plasma LDL-C, SBP, and cardiovascular event rates between the groups were compared to estimate associations with lifetime risk of cardiovascular disease. Exposures: Differences in plasma LDL-C and SBP compared with participants with both genetic scores below the median. Genetic risk scores higher than the median were associated with lower LDL-C and lower SBP. Main Outcomes and Measures: Odds ratio (OR) for major coronary events, defined as coronary death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or coronary revascularization. Results: The mean age of the 438 952 participants was 65.2 years (range, 40.4-80.0 years), 54.1% were women, and 24\u202f980 experienced a first major coronary event. Compared with the reference group, participants with LDL-C genetic scores higher than the median had 14.7-mg/dL lower LDL-C levels and an OR of 0.73 for major coronary events (95% CI, 0.70-0.75; P\u2009<\u2009.001). Participants with SBP genetic scores higher than the median had 2.9-mm Hg lower SBP and an OR of 0.82 for major coronary events (95% CI, 0.79-0.85, P\u2009<\u2009.001). Participants in the group with both genetic scores higher than the median had 13.9-mg/dL lower LDL-C, 3.1-mm Hg lower SBP, and an OR of 0.61 for major coronary events (95% CI, 0.59-0.64; P\u2009<\u2009.001). In a 4\u2009\u00d7\u20094 factorial analysis, exposure to increasing genetic risk scores and lower LDL-C levels and SBP was associated with dose-dependent lower risks of major coronary events. In a meta-regression analysis, combined exposure to 38.67-mg/dL lower LDL-C and 10-mm Hg lower SBP was associated with an OR of 0.22 for major coronary events (95% CI, 0.17-0.26; P\u2009<\u2009.001), and 0.32 for cardiovascular death (95% CI, 0.25-0.40; P\u2009<\u2009.001). Conclusions and Relevance: Lifelong genetic exposure to lower levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and lower systolic blood pressure was associated with lower cardiovascular risk. However, these findings cannot be assumed to represent the magnitude of benefit achievable from treatment of these risk factors. ",
        "Cabazitaxel versus Abiraterone or Enzalutamide in Metastatic Prostate Cancer. BACKGROUND: The efficacy and safety of cabazitaxel, as compared with an androgen-signaling-targeted inhibitor (abiraterone or enzalutamide), in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer who were previously treated with docetaxel and had progression within 12 months while receiving the alternative inhibitor (abiraterone or enzalutamide) are unclear. METHODS: We randomly assigned, in a 1:1 ratio, patients who had previously received docetaxel and an androgen-signaling-targeted inhibitor (abiraterone or enzalutamide) to receive cabazitaxel (at a dose of 25 mg per square meter of body-surface area intravenously every 3 weeks, plus prednisone daily and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor) or the other androgen-signaling-targeted inhibitor (either 1000 mg of abiraterone plus prednisone daily or 160 mg of enzalutamide daily). The primary end point was imaging-based progression-free survival. Secondary end points of survival, response, and safety were assessed. RESULTS: A total of 255 patients underwent randomization. After a median follow-up of 9.2 months, imaging-based progression or death was reported in 95 of 129 patients (73.6%) in the cabazitaxel group, as compared with 101 of 126 patients (80.2%) in the group that received an androgen-signaling-targeted inhibitor (hazard ratio, 0.54; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.40 to 0.73; P<0.001). The median imaging-based progression-free survival was 8.0 months with cabazitaxel and 3.7 months with the androgen-signaling-targeted inhibitor. The median overall survival was 13.6 months with cabazitaxel and 11.0 months with the androgen-signaling-targeted inhibitor (hazard ratio for death, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.46 to 0.89; P\u2009=\u20090.008). The median progression-free survival was 4.4 months with cabazitaxel and 2.7 months with an androgen-signaling-targeted inhibitor (hazard ratio for progression or death, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.40 to 0.68; P<0.001), a prostate-specific antigen response occurred in 35.7% and 13.5% of the patients, respectively (P<0.001), and tumor response was noted in 36.5% and 11.5% (P\u2009=\u20090.004). Adverse events of grade 3 or higher occurred in 56.3% of patients receiving cabazitaxel and in 52.4% of those receiving an androgen-signaling-targeted inhibitor. No new safety signals were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Cabazitaxel significantly improved a number of clinical outcomes, as compared with the androgen-signaling-targeted inhibitor (abiraterone or enzalutamide), in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer who had been previously treated with docetaxel and the alternative androgen-signaling-targeted agent (abiraterone or enzalutamide).

        "The Effect of Coconut Oil Consumption on Cardiovascular Risk Factors: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Clinical Trials. BACKGROUND: Coconut oil is high in saturated fat and may, therefore, raise serum cholesterol concentrations, but beneficial effects on other cardiovascular risk factors have also been suggested. Therefore, we conducted a systematic review of the effect of coconut oil consumption on blood lipids and other cardiovascular risk factors compared with other cooking oils using data from clinical trials. METHODS: We searched PubMed, SCOPUS, Cochrane Registry, and Web of Science through June 2019. We selected trials that compared the effects of coconut oil consumption with other fats that lasted at least 2 weeks. Two reviewers independently screened articles, extracted data, and assessed the study quality according to the PRISMA guidelines (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses). The main outcomes included low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-cholesterol), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-cholesterol), total cholesterol, triglycerides, measures of body fatness, markers of inflammation, and glycemia. Data were pooled using random-effects meta-analysis. RESULTS: 16 articles were included in the meta-analysis. Results were available from all trials on blood lipids, 8 trials on body weight, 5 trials on percentage body fat, 4 trials on waist circumference, 4 trials on fasting plasma glucose, and 5 trials on C-reactive protein. Coconut oil consumption significantly increased LDL-cholesterol by 10.47 mg/dL (95% CI: 3.01, 17.94; I2 = 84%, N=16) and HDL-cholesterol by 4.00 mg/dL (95% CI: 2.26, 5.73; I2 = 72%, N=16) as compared with nontropical vegetable oils. These effects remained significant after excluding nonrandomized trials, or trials of poor quality (Jadad score <3). Coconut oil consumption did not significantly affect markers of glycemia, inflammation, and adiposity as compared with nontropical vegetable oils. CONCLUSIONS: Coconut oil consumption results in significantly higher LDL-cholesterol than nontropical vegetable oils. This should inform choices about coconut oil consumption. ",
        "Use of Intravenous Iodinated Contrast Media in Patients with Kidney Disease: Consensus Statements from the American College of Radiology and the National Kidney Foundation. Intravenous iodinated contrast media are commonly used with CT to evaluate disease and to determine treatment response. The risk of acute kidney injury (AKI) developing in patients with reduced kidney function following exposure to intravenous iodinated contrast media has been overstated. This is due primarily to historic lack of control groups sufficient to separate contrast-induced AKI (CI-AKI; ie, AKI caused by contrast media administration) from contrast-associated AKI (CA-AKI; ie, AKI coincident to contrast media administration). Although the true risk of CI-AKI remains uncertain for patients with severe kidney disease, prophylaxis with intravenous normal saline is indicated for patients who have AKI or an estimated glomerular filtration rate less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 who are not undergoing maintenance dialysis. In individual high-risk circumstances, prophylaxis may be considered in patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate of 30-44 mL/min/1.73 m2 at the discretion of the ordering clinician.

        "Patient-Reported Outcomes Through 5 Years for Active Surveillance, Surgery, Brachytherapy, or External Beam Radiation With or Without Androgen Deprivation Therapy for Localized Prostate Cancer. Importance: Understanding adverse effects of contemporary treatment approaches for men with favorable-risk and unfavorable-risk localized prostate cancer could inform treatment selection. Objective: To compare functional outcomes associated with prostate cancer treatments over 5 years after treatment. Design, Setting, and Participants: Prospective, population-based cohort study of 1386 men with favorable-risk (clinical stage cT1 to cT2bN0M0, prostate-specific antigen [PSA] \u226420 ng/mL, and Grade Group 1-2) prostate cancer and 619 men with unfavorable-risk (clinical stage cT2cN0M0, PSA of 20-50 ng/mL, or Grade Group 3-5) prostate cancer diagnosed in 2011 through 2012, accrued from 5 Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results Program sites and a US prostate cancer registry, with surveys through September 2017. Exposures: Treatment with active surveillance (n\u2009=\u2009363), nerve-sparing prostatectomy (n\u2009=\u2009675), external beam radiation therapy (EBRT; n\u2009=\u2009261), or low-dose-rate brachytherapy (n\u2009=\u200987) for men with favorable-risk disease and treatment with prostatectomy (n\u2009=\u2009402) or EBRT with androgen deprivation therapy (n\u2009=\u2009217) for men with unfavorable-risk disease. Main Outcomes and Measures: Patient-reported function, based on the 26-item Expanded Prostate Index Composite (range, 0-100), 5 years after treatment. Regression models were adjusted for baseline function and patient and tumor characteristics. Minimum clinically important difference was 10 to 12 for sexual function, 6 to 9 for urinary incontinence, 5 to 7 for urinary irritative symptoms, and 4 to 6 for bowel and hormonal function. Results: A total of 2005 men met inclusion criteria and completed the baseline and at least 1 postbaseline survey (median [interquartile range] age, 64 [59-70] years; 1529 of 1993 participants [77%] were non-Hispanic white). For men with favorable-risk prostate cancer, nerve-sparing prostatectomy was associated with worse urinary incontinence at 5 years (adjusted mean difference, -10.9 [95% CI, -14.2 to -7.6]) and sexual function at 3 years (adjusted mean difference, -15.2 [95% CI, -18.8 to -11.5]) compared with active surveillance. Low-dose-rate brachytherapy was associated with worse urinary irritative (adjusted mean difference, -7.0 [95% CI, -10.1 to -3.9]), sexual (adjusted mean difference, -10.1 [95% CI, -14.6 to -5.7]), and bowel (adjusted mean difference, -5.0 [95% CI, -7.6 to -2.4]) function at 1 year compared with active surveillance. EBRT was associated with urinary, sexual, and bowel function changes not clinically different from active surveillance at any time point through 5 years. For men with unfavorable-risk disease, EBRT with ADT was associated with lower hormonal function at 6 months (adjusted mean difference, -5.3 [95% CI, -8.2 to -2.4]) and bowel function at 1 year (adjusted mean difference, -4.1 [95% CI, -6.3 to -1.9]), but better sexual function at 5 years (adjusted mean difference, 12.5 [95% CI, 6.2-18.7]) and incontinence at each time point through 5 years (adjusted mean difference, 23.2 [95% CI, 17.7-28.7]), than prostatectomy. Conclusions and Relevance: In this cohort of men with localized prostate cancer, most functional differences associated with contemporary management options attenuated by 5 years. However, men undergoing prostatectomy reported clinically meaningful worse incontinence through 5 years compared with all other options, and men undergoing prostatectomy for unfavorable-risk disease reported worse sexual function at 5 years compared with men who underwent EBRT with ADT.

        "Effect of generic glatiramer acetate on spending and use of drugs for multiple sclerosis. OBJECTIVE: To estimate changes in costs and utilization trends for disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) from 2011 to 2017 in the US Medicaid program. METHODS: Using quarterly Medicaid State Drug Utilization Data from 2011 to 2017, we summarize trends in spending, utilization, and costs per prescription for 15 multiple sclerosis (MS) DMTs including brand and generic versions of glatiramer acetate. We use interrupted time series regression to estimate the effect of market entry of generic glatiramer acetate on cost per prescription of other self-administered DMTs. RESULTS: Gross annual expenditures on MS DMTs increased from $453 million to $1.32 billion between 2011 and 2017 within the Medicaid program. Increased spending was primarily driven by increases in per prescription costs, which doubled during the study period. Although total utilization was stable, product specific utilization shifted from injectable to oral DMTs. However, throughout the study, the plurality of utilization was glatiramer acetate. The introduction of generic glatiramer acetate in Q2 of 2015 was associated with an immediate increase of $441 (95% confidence interval [CI] $184-$697; p < 0.001) in the cost per prescription of branded glatiramer acetate followed by a gradual $52 per prescription reduction (95% CI -$86 to -$18) over time. There were minimal changes in the costs for the other DMTs. CONCLUSIONS: Spending on MS DMTs in the Medicaid program have more than doubled over the last 7 years primarily as a function of higher costs per prescription. Introduction of a generic glatiramer acetate product in 2015 had nominal effects on overall price trajectories and utilization within the class. ",
        "Transcriptomic signatures related to the obesity paradox in patients with clear cell renal cell carcinoma: a cohort study. BACKGROUND: Obesity is associated with an increased risk of developing clear cell renal cell carcinoma (RCC) but, paradoxically, obesity is also associated with improved oncological outcomes in this cancer. Because the biological mechanisms underlying this paradoxical association are poorly understood, we aimed to identify transcriptomic differences in primary tumour and peritumoral adipose tissue between obese patients and those at a normal weight. METHODS: In this cohort study, we assessed data from five independent clinical cohorts of patients with clear cell RCC aged 18 years and older. Overweight patients were excluded from each cohort for our analysis. We assessed patients from the COMPARZ phase 3 clinical trial, a cohort from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), and a Memorial Sloan Kettering (MSK) observational immunotherapy cohort for their inclusion into our study. We assessed overall survival in obese patients (those with a body-mass index [BMI] \u226530 kg/m2) and in patients with a normal weight (BMI 18\u00b75-24\u00b79 kg/m2, as per WHO's BMI categories), defined as the time from treatment initiation (in the COMPARZ and MSK immunotherapy cohorts) or surgery (in the TCGA cohort) to the date of any-cause death or of censoring on the day of the last follow-up. We also evaluated and validated transcriptomic differences in the primary tumours of obese patients compared with those of a normal weight. We compared gene-expression differences in peritumoral adipose tissue and tumour tissue in an additional, prospectively collected cohort of patients with non-metastatic clear cell RCC (the MSK peritumoral adipose tissue cohort). We analysed differences in gene expression between obese patients and those at a normal weight in the COMPARZ, TCGA, and peritumoral adipose tissue cohorts. We also assessed the tumour immune microenvironment in a prospective cohort of patients who had nephrectomy for localised RCC at MSK. FINDINGS: Of the 453 patients in the COMPARZ trial, 375 (83%) patients had available microarray data, pretreatment BMI measurements, and overall survival data for analyses, and we excluded 119 (26%) overweight patients, leaving a final cohort of 256 (68%) patients from this study for our analyses. From 332 patients in the TCGA cohort, we evaluated clinical and demographic data from 152 (46%) patients with advanced (ie, stages III and IV) clear cell RCC treated by nephrectomy; after exclusion of 59 (39%) overweight patients, our final cohort consisted of 93 (61%) patients. After exclusion of 74 (36%) overweight patients from the initial MSK immunotherapy study population of 203 participants, our final cohort for overall survival analysis comprised 129 (64%) participants. We found that overall survival was longer in obese patients than in those with normal weight in the TCGA cohort, after adjustment for stage or grade (adjusted HR 0\u00b741, 95% CI 0\u00b722-0\u00b775), and in the COMPARZ clinical trial after adjustment for International Metastatic RCC Database (IMDC) risk score (0\u00b768, 0\u00b748-0\u00b796). In the MSK immunotherapy cohort, the inverse association of BMI with mortality (HR 0\u00b754, 95% CI 0\u00b731-0\u00b795) was not significant after adjustment for IMDC risk score (adjusted HR 0\u00b772, 95% CI 0\u00b740-1\u00b730). Tumours of obese patients showed higher angiogenic scores on gene-set enrichment analysis-derived hallmark gene set angiogenesis signatures than did those of patients at a normal weight, but the degree of immune cell infiltration did not differ by BMI. We found increased peritumoral adipose tissue inflammation in obese patients relative to those at a normal weight, especially in peritumoral fat near the tumour. INTERPRETATION: We found aspects of the tumour microenvironment that vary by BMI in the tumour and peritumoral adipose tissue, which might contribute to the apparent survival advantage in obese patients with clear cell RCC compared with patients at a normal weight. The complex interplay between the clear cell RCC tumour and peritumoral adipose tissue microenvironment might have clinical relevance and warrants further investigation.

        "First Experience of Transcatheter Leak Occlusion With Detachable Coils Following Left\u00a0Atrial\u00a0Appendage Closure. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to assess the feasibility and efficacy of transcatheter leak closure with detachable coils in patients with incomplete left atrial appendage (LAA) closure. BACKGROUND: Incomplete LAA closure is common after interventional therapies targeting the LAA, potentially hindering effective thromboembolic prevention. Detachable coils have found a wide range of applications for transcatheter vascular occlusion and embolization procedures. METHODS: Thirty consecutive patients at high thromboembolic risk with clinically relevant residual leaks (mean age 72\u00a0\u00b1 9 years, 73.3% men, mean CHA2DS2-VASc score 4.4 \u00b1 1.4, mean HAS-BLED score 3.6 \u00b1 0.8) underwent percutaneous closure of the LAA patency using embolization coils. Transesophageal echocardiography was performed at 60\u00a0\u00b1\u00a015\u00a0days post-procedure. RESULTS: LAA closure had been previously attempted with the Watchman device in 25 patients, the Amulet device in 2\u00a0patients, and the LARIAT device in 3 patients. Baseline transesophageal echocardiography documented moderate and severe leaks in 20 (66.7%) and 10 (33.3%) patients, respectively. After a single procedure, 25 patients (83.3%) showed complete LAA sealing or minimal leaks. Five patients (16.7%) had moderate residual leaks; 3 patients of them were offered repeat procedures. Mean procedure and fluoroscopy times were 76 \u00b1 41 min and 21 \u00b1 14\u00a0min, respectively; the mean volume of iodinated contrast medium used was 80 \u00b1 47\u00a0ml. Coil deployment was successful in all cases. The overall complication rate was 6.1%. After a median follow-up period of 54\u00a0days (range 43 to 265\u00a0days) and an average of 1.1\u00a0procedures/patient, transesophageal echocardiography revealed complete LAA sealing or negligible residual leaks in 28\u00a0patients (93.3%; 25 with no residual leak, 3 patients with minimal to mild residual leaks) and moderate residual leaks in 2 patients (6.7%). CONCLUSIONS: Transcatheter LAA leak occlusion using endovascular coils appears to be a safe, effective, and promising approach in patients at high echo time risk with incomplete LAA closure.

        "Medical cannabis and insomnia in older adults with chronic pain: a cross-sectional study. OBJECTIVES: Medical cannabis (MC) is increasingly being used for treatment of chronic pain symptoms. Among patients there is also a growing preference for the use of MC to manage sleep problems. The aim of the current study was to examine the associations between use of whole plant cannabis and sleep problems among chronic pain patients. METHODS: A total of 128 individuals with chronic pain over the age of 50 years were recruited from the Rambam Institute for Pain Medicine in Haifa, Israel. Of them, 66 were MC users and 62 were non-users. Regression models tested the differences in sleep problems between the two groups. Furthermore, Pearson correlations between MC use measures (dose, length and frequency of use, number of strains used, tetrahydrocannabinol/cannabidiol levels) and sleep problems were assessed among MC users. RESULTS: After adjustment for age, sex, pain level and use of sleep and anti-depressant medications, MC use was associated with less problems with waking up at night compared with non-MC use. No group differences were found for problems with falling asleep or waking up early without managing to fall back asleep. Frequent MC use was associated with more problems waking up at night and falling asleep. CONCLUSIONS: MC use may have an overall positive effect on maintaining sleep throughout the night in chronic pain patients. At the same time, tolerance towards potential sleep-inducing properties of MC may occur with frequent use. More research based on randomised control trials and other longitudinal designs is warranted. ",
        "Association of Blood Biomarkers With Acute Sport-Related Concussion in Collegiate Athletes: Findings From the NCAA and Department of Defense CARE Consortium. Importance: There is potential scientific and clinical value in validation of objective biomarkers for sport-related concussion (SRC). Objective: To investigate the association of acute-phase blood biomarker levels with SRC in collegiate athletes. Design, Setting, and Participants: This multicenter, prospective, case-control study was conducted by the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) and the US Department of Defense Concussion Assessment, Research, and Education (CARE) Consortium from February 20, 2015, to May 31, 2018, at 6 CARE Advanced Research Core sites. A total of 504 collegiate athletes with concussion, contact sport control athletes, and non-contact sport control athletes completed clinical testing and blood collection at preseason baseline, the acute postinjury period, 24 to 48 hours after injury, the point of reporting being asymptomatic, and 7 days after return to play. Data analysis was conducted from March 1 to November 30, 2019. Main Outcomes and Measures: Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase-L1 (UCH-L1), neurofilament light chain, and tau were quantified using the Quanterix Simoa multiplex assay. Clinical outcome measures included the Sport Concussion Assessment Tool-Third Edition (SCAT-3) symptom evaluation, Standardized Assessment of Concussion, Balance Error Scoring System, and Brief Symptom Inventory 18. Results: A total of 264 athletes with concussion (mean [SD] age, 19.08 [1.24] years; 211 [79.9%] male), 138 contact sport controls (mean [SD] age, 19.03 [1.27] years; 107 [77.5%] male), and 102 non-contact sport controls (mean [SD] age, 19.39 [1.25] years; 82 [80.4%] male) were included in the study. Athletes with concussion had significant elevation in GFAP (mean difference, 0.430 pg/mL; 95% CI, 0.339-0.521 pg/mL; P\u2009<\u2009.001), UCH-L1 (mean difference, 0.449 pg/mL; 95% CI, 0.167-0.732 pg/mL; P\u2009<\u2009.001), and tau levels (mean difference, 0.221 pg/mL; 95% CI, 0.046-0.396 pg/mL; P\u2009=\u2009.004) at the acute postinjury time point compared with preseason baseline. Longitudinally, a significant interaction (group\u2009\u00d7\u2009visit) was found for GFAP (F7,1507.36\u2009=\u200916.18, P\u2009<\u2009.001), UCH-L1 (F7,1153.09\u2009=\u20095.71, P\u2009<\u2009.001), and tau (F7,1480.55\u2009=\u20096.81, P\u2009<\u2009.001); the interaction for neurofilament light chain was not significant (F7,1506.90\u2009=\u20091.33, P\u2009=\u2009.23). The area under the curve for the combination of GFAP and UCH-L1 in differentiating athletes with concussion from contact sport controls at the acute postinjury period was 0.71 (95% CI,\u20090.64-0.78; P\u2009<\u2009.001); the acute postinjury area under the curve for all 4 biomarkers combined was 0.72 (95% CI,\u20090.65-0.79; P\u2009<\u2009.001). Beyond SCAT-3 symptom score, GFAP at the acute postinjury time point was associated with the classification of athletes with concussion from contact controls (\u03b2\u2009=\u200912.298; 95% CI, 2.776-54.481; P\u2009=\u2009.001) and non-contact sport controls (\u03b2\u2009=\u20095.438; 95% CI, 1.676-17.645; P\u2009=\u2009.005). Athletes with concussion with loss of consciousness or posttraumatic amnesia had significantly higher levels of GFAP than athletes with concussion with neither loss of consciousness nor posttraumatic amnesia at the acute postinjury time point (mean difference, 0.583 pg/mL; 95% CI, 0.369-0.797 pg/mL; P\u2009<\u2009.001). Conclusions and Relevance: The results suggest that blood biomarkers can be used as research tools to inform the underlying pathophysiological mechanism of concussion and provide additional support for future studies to optimize and validate biomarkers for potential clinical use in SRC.

        "The Effect and Relationship of Frailty\u00a0Indices on Survival After Transcatheter Aortic\u00a0Valve\u00a0Replacement. OBJECTIVES: This study sought to evaluate the ability of individual markers of frailty to predict outcomes after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) and of their discriminatory value in different age groups. BACKGROUND: Appropriate patient selection for TAVR remains a dilemma, especially among the most elderly and potentially frail. METHODS: The study evaluated patients\u00a0\u226565 years of age in the Society of Thoracic Surgeons/American College of Cardiology Transcatheter Valve Therapy registry, linked to Centers for Medicare and Medicaid administrative claims data, receiving elective TAVR from November 2011 to June 2016 (n\u00a0=\u00a036,242). Indices of frailty included anemia, albumin level, and 5-m walk speed. We performed Cox proportional hazards regression for 30-day and 1-year mortality, adjusting for\u00a0risk factors known to be predictive of 30-day mortality in the Transcatheter Valve Therapy registry, as well as survival\u00a0analysis. RESULTS: These indices are independently associated with mortality at 30\u00a0days and 1 year and provide incremental value in risk stratification for mortality, with low albumin providing the largest value (hazard ratio: 1.52). Those with low albumin and slower walking speed had longer lengths of stay and higher rates of bleeding and readmission (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Those with anemia also had higher rates of bleeding, readmission, and subsequent myocardial infarction (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). CONCLUSIONS: This represents the largest study to date of the role of frailty indices after TAVR, further facilitating\u00a0robust modeling and adjusting for a large number of confounders. These simple indices are easily attainable, and clinically relevant markers of frailty that may meaningfully stratify patients at risk for mortality after TAVR. ",
        "Utilization and Outcomes of Measuring Fractional Flow Reserve in Patients With Stable Ischemic Heart Disease. BACKGROUND: The use and clinical outcomes of fractional flow reserve (FFR) measurement in patients with stable ischemic heart disease (SIHD) are uncertain, as prior studies have been based on selected populations. OBJECTIVES: This study sought to evaluate contemporary, real-world patterns of FFR use and its effect on outcomes among unselected patients with SIHD and angiographically intermediate stenoses. METHODS: The authors used data from the Veterans Affairs Clinical Assessment, Reporting, and Tracking (CART) Program to analyze patients who underwent coronary angiography between January 1, 2009, and September 30, 2017, and had SIHD with angiographically intermediate disease (40% to 69% diameter stenosis on visual inspection). The authors documented trends in FFR utilization and evaluated predictors using generalized mixed models. They applied Cox proportional hazards models to determine the association between an FFR-guided revascularization strategy and all-cause mortality at 1 year. RESULTS: A total of 17,989 patients at 66 sites were included. The rate of FFR use gradually increased from 14.8% to 18.5% among all patients with intermediate lesions, and from 44% to 75% among patients who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention. One-year mortality was 2.8% in the FFR group and 5.9% in the angiography-only group (p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001). After adjustment for patient, site-level, and procedural factors, FFR-guided revascularization was associated with a 43% lower risk of mortality at 1 year compared with angiography-only revascularization (hazard ratio: 0.57; 95% confidence interval: 0.45 to 0.71; p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001). CONCLUSIONS: In patients with SIHD and angiographically intermediate stenoses, use of FFR has slowly risen, and was associated with significantly lower 1-year mortality. ",
        "Association of Isolated Diastolic Hypertension as Defined by the 2017 ACC/AHA Blood Pressure Guideline With Incident Cardiovascular Outcomes. Importance: In the 2017 American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA) guideline, the definition of hypertension was lowered from a blood pressure (BP) of greater than or equal to 140/90 to greater than or equal to 130/80 mm Hg. The new diastolic BP threshold of 80 mm Hg was recommended based on expert opinion and changes the definition of isolated diastolic hypertension (IDH). Objective: To compare the prevalence of IDH in the United States, by 2017 ACC/AHA and 2003 Joint National Committee (JNC7) definitions, and to characterize cross-sectional and longitudinal associations of IDH with outcomes. Design, Setting, and Participants: Cross-sectional analyses of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES 2013-2016) and longitudinal analyses of the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study (baseline 1990-1992, with follow-up through December 31, 2017). Longitudinal results were validated in 2 external cohorts: (1) the NHANES III (1988-1994) and NHANES 1999-2014 and (2) the Give Us a Clue to Cancer and Heart Disease (CLUE) II cohort (baseline 1989). Exposures: IDH, by 2017 ACC/AHA (systolic BP <130 mm Hg, diastolic BP \u226580 mm Hg) and by JNC7 (systolic BP <140 mm Hg, diastolic BP \u226590 mm Hg) definitions. Main Outcomes and Measures: Weighted estimates for prevalence of IDH in US adults and prevalence of US adults recommended BP pharmacotherapy by the 2017 ACC/AHA guideline based solely on the presence of IDH. Risk of incident atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), heart failure (HF), and chronic kidney disease (CKD) in the ARIC Study. Results: The study population included 9590 adults from the NHANES (mean [SD] baseline age, 49.6 [17.6] years; 5016 women [52.3%]) and 8703 adults from the ARIC Study (mean [SD] baseline age, 56.0 [5.6] years; 4977 women [57.2%]). The estimated prevalence of IDH in the NHANES was 6.5% by the 2017 ACC/AHA definition and 1.3% by the JNC7 definition (absolute difference, 5.2% [95% CI, 4.7%-5.7%]). Among those newly classified as having IDH, an estimated 0.6% (95% CI, 0.5%-0.6%) also met the guideline threshold for antihypertensive therapy. Compared with normotensive ARIC participants, IDH by the 2017 ACC/AHA definition was not significantly associated with incident ASCVD (n\u2009=\u20091386 events; median follow-up, 25.2 years; hazard ratio [HR], 1.06 [95% CI, 0.89-1.26]), HF (n\u2009=\u20091396 events; HR, 0.91 [95% CI, 0.76-1.09]), or CKD (n\u2009=\u20092433 events; HR, 0.98 [95% CI, 0.65-1.11]). Results were also null for cardiovascular mortality in the 2 external cohorts (eg, HRs of IDH by the 2017 ACC/AHA definition were 1.17 [95% CI, 0.87-1.56] in the NHANES [n\u2009=\u20091012 events] and 1.02 [95% CI, 0.92-1.14] in CLUE II [n\u2009=\u20091497 events]). Conclusions and Relevance: In this analysis of US adults, the estimated prevalence of IDH was more common when defined by the 2017 ACC/AHA BP guideline compared with the JNC7 guideline. However, IDH was not significantly associated with increased risk for cardiovascular outcomes. ",
        "Behavioral effects of multiple-dose oxytocin treatment in autism: a randomized, placebo-controlled trial with long-term follow-up. Background: Intranasal administration of the \"prosocial\" neuropeptide oxytocin is increasingly explored as a potential treatment for targeting the core characteristics of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). However, long-term follow-up studies, evaluating the possibility of long-lasting retention effects, are currently lacking. Methods: Using a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel design, this pilot clinical trial explored the possibility of long-lasting behavioral effects of 4 weeks of intranasal oxytocin treatment (24 International Units once daily in the morning) in 40 adult men with ASD. To do so, self-report and informant-based questionnaires assessing core autism symptoms and characterizations of attachment were administered at baseline, immediately after 4 weeks of treatment (approximately 24 h after the last nasal spray administration), and at two follow-up sessions, 4 weeks and 1 year post-treatment. Results: No treatment-specific effects were identified in the primary outcome assessing social symptoms (Social Responsiveness Scale, self- and informant-rated). In particular, with respect to self-reported social responsiveness, improvements were evident both in the oxytocin and in the placebo group, yielding no significant between-group difference (p = .37). Also informant-rated improvements in social responsiveness were not significantly larger in the oxytocin, compared to the placebo group (between-group difference: p = .19). Among the secondary outcome measures, treatment-specific improvements were identified in the Repetitive Behavior Scale and State Adult Attachment Measure, indicating reductions in self-reported repetitive behaviors (p = .04) and reduced feelings of avoidance toward others (p = .03) in the oxytocin group compared to the placebo group, up to 1 month and even 1 year post-treatment. Treatment-specific effects were also revealed in screenings of mood states (Profile of Mood States), indicating higher reports of \"vigor\" (feeling energetic, active, lively) in the oxytocin, compared to the placebo group (p = .03). Conclusions: While no treatment-specific improvements were evident in terms of core social symptoms, the current observations of long-term beneficial effects on repetitive behaviors and feelings of avoidance are promising and suggestive of a therapeutic potential of oxytocin treatment for ASD. However, given the exploratory nature of this pilot study, future studies are warranted to evaluate the long-term effects of OT administration further. Trial registration: The trial was registered with the European Clinical Trial Registry (Eudract 2014-000586-45) on January 22, 2014 (https://www.clinicaltrialsregister.eu/ctr-search/trial/2014-000586-45/BE).

        "Cannabinoids for adult cancer-related pain: systematic review and meta-analysis. OBJECTIVES: There is increased interest in cannabinoids for cancer pain management and legislative changes are in progress in many countries. This study aims to determine the beneficial and adverse effects of cannabis/cannabinoids compared with placebo/other active agents for the treatment of cancer-related pain in adults. METHODS: Systematic review and meta-analysis to identify randomised controlled trials of cannabinoids compared with placebo/other active agents for the treatment of cancer-related pain in adults to determine the effect on pain intensity (primary outcome) and adverse effects, including dropouts. Searches included Embase, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Web of Science, ClinicalTrials.gov, Cochrane and grey literature. Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines were followed. RESULTS: We identified 2805 unique records, of which six randomised controlled trials were included in this systematic review (n=1460 participants). Five studies were included in the meta-analysis (1442 participants). All had a low risk of bias. There was no difference between cannabinoids and placebo for the difference in the change in average Numeric Rating Scale pain scores (mean difference -0.21 (-0.48 to 0.07, p=0.14)); this remained when only phase III studies were meta-analysed: mean difference -0.02 (-0.21 to 0.16, p=0.80). Cannabinoids had a higher risk of adverse events when compared with placebo, especially somnolence (OR 2.69 (1.54 to 4.71), p<0.001) and dizziness (OR 1.58 (0.99 to 2.51), p=0.05). No treatment-related deaths were reported. Dropouts and mortality rates were high. CONCLUSIONS: Studies with a low risk of bias showed that for adults with advanced cancer, the addition of cannabinoids to opioids did not reduce cancer pain.

        "Myocardial fibrosis and the effect of primary prophylactic defibrillator implantation in patients with non-ischemic systolic heart failure-DANISH-MRI. AIMS: Patients with non-ischemic systolic heart failure have an increased risk of sudden cardiac death (SCD). Myocardial fibrosis, detected as late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) with cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR), has been shown to predict all-cause mortality. We hypothesized that LGE can identify patients with non-ischemic heart failure who will benefit from ICD implantation. METHODS AND RESULTS: In this prospective observational sub-study of the Danish Study to Assess the Efficacy of ICDs in Patients with Nonischemic Systolic Heart Failure on Mortality (DANISH), 252 patients underwent CMR. LGE was quantified by the full width/half maximum method. The primary endpoint was all-cause mortality. LGE could be adequately assessed in 236 patients, median age was 61 years and median duration of heart failure was 14 months; there were 108 patients (46%) randomized to ICD. Median follow-up time was 5.3 years. Median left ventricular ejection fraction on CMR was 35%. In all, 50 patients died. LGE was present in 113 patients (48%). The presence of LGE was an independent predictor of all-cause mortality (HR 1.82; 95% CI 1.002-3.29; P\u202f=\u202f.049) after adjusting for known cardiovascular risk factors. ICD implantation did not impact all-cause mortality, for either patients with LGE (HR 1.18; 95% CI 0.59-2.38; P\u202f=\u202f.63), or for patients without LGE (HR 1.00; 95% CI 0.39-2.53; P\u202f=\u202f.99), (P for interaction =0.79). CONCLUSION: In patients with non-ischemic systolic heart failure, LGE predicted all-cause mortality. However, in this cohort, LGE did not identify a group of patients who survived longer by receiving an ICD. ",
        "An fMRI-based neural marker for migraine without aura. OBJECTIVE: To identify and validate an fMRI-based neural marker for migraine without aura (MwoA) and to examine its association with treatment response. METHODS: We conducted cross-sectional studies with resting-state fMRI data from 230 participants and machine learning analyses. In studies 1 through 3, we identified, cross-validated, independently validated, and cross-sectionally validated an fMRI-based neural marker for MwoA. In study 4, we assessed the relationship between the neural marker and treatment responses in migraineurs who received a 4-week real or sham acupuncture treatment, or were waitlisted, in a registered clinical trial. RESULTS: In study 1 (n = 116), we identified a neural marker with abnormal functional connectivity within the visual, default mode, sensorimotor, and frontal-parietal networks that could discriminate migraineurs from healthy controls (HCs) with 93% sensitivity and 89% specificity. In study 2 (n = 38), we investigated the generalizability of the marker by applying it to an independent cohort of migraineurs and HCs and achieved 84% sensitivity and specificity. In study 3 (n = 76), we verified the specificity of the marker with new datasets of migraineurs and patients with other chronic pain disorders (chronic low back pain and fibromyalgia) and demonstrated 78% sensitivity and 76% specificity for discriminating migraineurs from nonmigraineurs. In study 4 (n = 116), we found that the changes in the marker responses showed significant correlation with the changes in headache frequency in response to real acupuncture. CONCLUSION: We identified an fMRI-based neural marker that captures distinct characteristics of MwoA and can link disease pattern changes to brain changes. ",
        "Abatacept in rheumatoid arthritis: survival on drug, clinical outcomes, and their predictors-data from a large national quality register. BACKGROUND: There are limited data regarding efficacy of abatacept treatment for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) outside clinical trials. Quality registers have been useful for observational studies on tumor necrosis factor inhibition in clinical practice. The aim of this study was to investigate clinical efficacy and tolerability of abatacept in RA, using a national register. METHODS: RA patients that started abatacept between 2006 and 2017 and were included in the Swedish Rheumatology Quality register (N\u2009=\u20092716) were investigated. Survival on drug was estimated using Kaplan-Meier analysis. The European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) good response and Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) response (improvement of \u2265\u20090.3) rates (LUNDEX corrected for drug survival) at 6 and at 12\u2009months were assessed. Predictors of discontinuation were investigated by Cox regression analyses, and predictors of clinical response by logistic regression. Significance-based backward stepwise selection of variables was used for the final multivariate models. RESULTS: There was a significant difference in drug survival by previous biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (bDMARD) exposure (p\u2009<\u20090.001), with longer survival in biona\u00efve patients. Men (hazard ratio (HR) 0.86, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.74-0.98) and methotrexate users (HR 0.85, 95% CI 0.76-0.95) were less likely to discontinue abatacept, whereas a high pain score predicted discontinuation (HR 1.14 per standard deviation, 95% CI 1.07-1.20). The absence of previous bDMARD exposure, male sex, and a low HAQ score were independently associated with LUNDEX-corrected EULAR good response. The absence of previous bDMARD exposure also predicted LUNDEX-corrected HAQ response. CONCLUSIONS: In this population-based study of RA, bDMARD na\u00efve patients and male patients were more likely to remain on abatacept with a major clinical response. ",
        "Dietary flavonols and risk of Alzheimer dementia. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether dietary intake of flavonols is associated with Alzheimer dementia. METHODS: The study was conducted among 921 participants of the Rush Memory and Aging Project (MAP), an ongoing community-based, prospective cohort. Participants completed annual neurologic evaluations and dietary assessments using a validated food frequency questionnaire. RESULTS: Among 921 MAP participants who initially had no dementia in the analyzed sample, 220 developed Alzheimer dementia. The mean age of the sample was 81.2 years (SD 7.2), with the majority (n = 691, 75%) being female. Participants with the highest intake of total flavonols had higher levels of education and more participation in physical and cognitive activities. In Cox proportional hazards models, dietary intakes of flavonols were inversely associated with incident Alzheimer dementia in models adjusted for age, sex, education, APOE \u025b4, and participation in cognitive and physical activities. Hazard ratios (HRs) for the fifth vs first quintiles of intake were as follows: for total flavonol, 0.52 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.33-0.84); for kaempferol, 0.49 (95% CI, 0.31-0.77); for myricetin, 0.62 (95% CI, 0.4-0.97); and for isorhamnetin, 0.62 (95% CI, 0.39-0.98). Quercetin was not associated with Alzheimer dementia (HR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.43-1.09). CONCLUSION: Higher dietary intakes of flavonols may be associated with reduced risk of developing Alzheimer dementia. ",
        "Family History of Gastric Cancer and Helicobacter pylori Treatment. BACKGROUND: Helicobacter pylori infection and a family history of gastric cancer are the main risk factors for gastric cancer. Whether treatment to eradicate H. pylori can reduce the risk of gastric cancer in persons with a family history of gastric cancer in first-degree relatives is unknown. METHODS: In this single-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, we screened 3100 first-degree relatives of patients with gastric cancer. We randomly assigned 1838 participants with H. pylori infection to receive either eradication therapy (lansoprazole [30 mg], amoxicillin [1000 mg], and clarithromycin [500 mg], each taken twice daily for 7 days) or placebo. The primary outcome was development of gastric cancer. A prespecified secondary outcome was development of gastric cancer according to H. pylori eradication status, assessed during the follow-up period. RESULTS: A total of 1676 participants were included in the modified intention-to-treat population for the analysis of the primary outcome (832 in the treatment group and 844 in the placebo group). During a median follow-up of 9.2 years, gastric cancer developed in 10 participants (1.2%) in the treatment group and in 23 (2.7%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.45; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.21 to 0.94; P\u2009=\u20090.03 by log-rank test). Among the 10 participants in the treatment group in whom gastric cancer developed, 5 (50.0%) had persistent H. pylori infection. Gastric cancer developed in 0.8% of participants (5 of 608) in whom H. pylori infection was eradicated and in 2.9% of participants (28 of 979) who had persistent infection (hazard ratio, 0.27; 95% CI, 0.10 to 0.70). Adverse events were mild and were more common in the treatment group than in the placebo group (53.0% vs. 19.1%; P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Among persons with H. pylori infection who had a family history of gastric cancer in first-degree relatives, H. pylori eradication treatment reduced the risk of gastric cancer.

        "Sex Differences in Blood Pressure Trajectories Over the Life Course. Importance: If we assume that women and men exhibit variations of the same fundamental vascular physiology, then conventional analyses of subclinical measures would suggest that women catch up to men by midlife in the extent of potentially important vascular disease. Alternatively, under the assumption that vascular physiology may fundamentally differ between women and men, a sex-specific analysis of existing data could offer new insights and augment our understanding of sex differences in cardiovascular diseases. Objective: To evaluate whether longitudinal patterns of blood pressure (BP) elevation differ between women and men during the life course when considering baseline BP levels as the reference. Design Setting, and Participants: We conducted sex-specific analyses of longitudinal BP measures (144\u202f599 observations) collected for a period of 43 years (1971 to 2014) in 4 community-based US cohort studies. The combined total included 32\u202f833 participants (54% female) spanning ages 5 to 98 years. Data were analyzed between May 4, 2019, and August 5, 2019. Exposures: Age and serially assessed longitudinal BP measures: systolic BP, diastolic BP, mean arterial pressure (MAP), and pulse pressure (PP). Main Outcomes and Measures: Sex-specific change in each primary BP measure compared with baseline BP levels, derived from multilevel longitudinal models fitted over the age span, and new-onset cardiovascular disease events. Results: Of the 32\u202f833 participants, 17\u202f733 were women (54%). Women compared with men exhibited a steeper increase in BP that began as early as in the third decade and continued through the life course (likelihood ratio test \u03c72\u2009=\u2009531 for systolic BP; \u03c72\u2009=\u2009123 for diastolic BP; \u03c72\u2009=\u2009325 for MAP; and \u03c72\u2009=\u2009572 for PP; P for all <.001). After adjustment for multiple cardiovascular disease risk factors, these between-sex differences in all BP trajectories persisted (likelihood ratio test \u03c72 = 314 for systolic BP; \u03c72 = 31 for diastolic BP; \u03c72 = 129 for MAP; and \u03c72 = 485 for PP; P for all <.001). Conclusions and Relevance: In contrast with the notion that important vascular disease processes in women lag behind men by 10 to 20 years, sex-specific analyses indicate that BP measures actually progress more rapidly in women than in men, beginning early in life. This early-onset sexual dimorphism may set the stage for later-life cardiovascular diseases that tend to present differently, not simply later, in women compared with men. ",
        "Estimating the magnitude of cancer overdiagnosis in Australia. OBJECTIVES: To estimate the proportion of cancer diagnoses in Australia that might reasonably be attributed to overdiagnosis by comparing current and past lifetime risks of cancer. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Routinely collected Australian Institute of Health and Welfare national data were analysed to estimate recent (2012) and historical (1982) lifetime risks (adjusted for competing risk of death and changes in risk factors) of diagnoses with five cancers: prostate, breast, renal, thyroid cancers, and melanoma. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Difference in lifetime risks of cancer diagnosis between 1982 and 2012, interpreted as probable overdiagnosis. RESULTS: For women, absolute lifetime risk increased by 3.4 percentage points for breast cancer (invasive cancers, 1.7 percentage points), 0.6 percentage point for renal cancer, 1.0 percentage point for thyroid cancer, and 5.1 percentage points for melanoma (invasive melanoma, 0.7 percentage point). An estimated 22% of breast cancers (invasive cancers, 13%), 58% of renal cancers, 73% of thyroid cancers, and 54% of melanomas (invasive melanoma, 15%) were overdiagnosed, or 18% of all cancer diagnoses (8% of invasive cancer diagnoses). For men, absolute lifetime risk increased by 8.2 percentage points for prostate cancer, 0.8 percentage point for renal cancer, 0.4 percentage point for thyroid cancer, and 8.0 percentage points for melanoma (invasive melanoma, 1.5 percentage points). An estimated 42% of prostate cancers, 42% of renal cancers, 73% of thyroid cancers, and 58% of melanomas (invasive melanomas, 22%) were overdiagnosed, or 24% of all cancer diagnoses (16% of invasive cancer diagnoses). Alternative assumptions slightly modified the estimates for overdiagnosis of breast cancer and melanoma. CONCLUSIONS: About 11 000 cancers in women and 18\u00a0000 in men may be overdiagnosed each year. Rates of overdiagnosis need to be reduced and health services should monitor emerging areas of overdiagnosis. ",
        "Survival, Nonrelapse Mortality, and Relapse-Related Mortality After Allogeneic Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation: Comparing 2003-2007 Versus 2013-2017 Cohorts. Background: Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation is indicated for refractory hematologic cancer and some nonmalignant disorders. Survival is limited by recurrent cancer and organ toxicity. Objective: To determine whether survival has improved over the past decade and note impediments to better outcomes. Design: The authors compared cohorts that had transplants during 2003 to 2007 versus 2013 to 2017. Survival outcome measures were analyzed, along with transplant-related complications. Setting: A center performing allogeneic transplant procedures. Participants: All recipients of a first allogeneic transplant during 2003 to 2007 and 2013 to 2017. Intervention: Patients received a conditioning regimen, infusion of donor hematopoietic cells, then immunosuppressive drugs and antimicrobial approaches to infection control. Measurements: Day-200 nonrelapse mortality (NRM), recurrence or progression of cancer, relapse-related mortality, and overall mortality, adjusted for comorbidity scores, source of donor cells, donor type, patient age, disease severity, conditioning regimen, patient and donor sex, and cytomegalovirus serostatus. Results: During the 2003-to-2007 and 2013-to-2017 periods, 1148 and 1131 patients, respectively, received their first transplant. Over the decade, decreases were seen in the adjusted hazards of day-200 NRM (hazard ratio [HR], 0.66 [95% CI, 0.48 to 0.89]), relapse of cancer (HR, 0.76 [CI, 0.61 to 0.94]), relapse-related mortality (HR, 0.69 [CI, 0.54 to 0.87]), and overall mortality (HR, 0.66 [CI, 0.56 to 0.78]). The degree of reduction in overall mortality was similar for patients who received myeloablative versus reduced-intensity conditioning, as well as for patients whose allograft came from a matched sibling versus an unrelated donor. Reductions were also seen in the frequency of jaundice, renal insufficiency, mechanical ventilation, high-level cytomegalovirus viremia, gram-negative bacteremia, invasive mold infection, acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease, and prednisone exposure. Limitation: Cohort studies cannot determine causality, and current disease severity criteria were not available for patients in the 2003-to-2007 cohort. Conclusion: Improvement in survival and reduction in complications were substantial after allogeneic transplant. Relapse of cancer remains the largest obstacle to better survival outcomes.

        "Symptom improvement in children with autism spectrum disorder following bumetanide administration is associated with decreased GABA/glutamate ratios. Bumetanide has been reported to alter synaptic excitation-inhibition (E-I) balance by potentiating the action of \u03b3-aminobutyric acid (GABA), thereby attenuating the severity of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in animal models. However, clinical evidence of its efficacy in young patients with ASD is limited. This was investigated in the present clinical trial of 83 patients, randomised to the bumetanide group (bumetanide treatment, 0.5\u2009mg twice daily) or the control group (no bumetanide treatment). Primary [Children Autism Rating Scale (CARS)], secondary [Clinical Global Impressions (CGI)], and exploratory [inhibitory (\u03b3-aminobutyric acid, GABA) and excitatory (glutamate, Glx) neurotransmitter concentrations measured in the insular cortex (IC) and visual cortex (VC) by magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS)] outcome measures were evaluated at baseline and at the 3-month follow-up. Side effects were monitored throughout the treatment course. Compared with the control group, the bumetanide group showed significant reduction in symptom severity, as indicated by both total CARS score and number of items assigned a score\u2009\u2265\u20093. The improvement in clinical symptoms was confirmed by CGI. GABA/Glx ratio in both the IC and VC decreased more rapidly over the 3-month period in the bumetanide group than that in the control group. This decrease in the IC was associated with the symptom improvement in the bumetanide group. Our study confirmed the clinical efficacy of bumetanide on alleviating the core symptoms of ASD in young children and it is the first demonstration that the improvement is associated with reduction in GABA/Glx ratios. This study suggests that the GABA/Glx ratio measured by MRS may provide a neuroimaging biomarker for assessing treatment efficacy for bumetanide. ",
        "Five-Year Outcomes of Transcatheter or Surgical Aortic-Valve Replacement. BACKGROUND: There are scant data on long-term clinical outcomes and bioprosthetic-valve function after transcatheter aortic-valve replacement (TAVR) as compared with surgical aortic-valve replacement in patients with severe aortic stenosis and intermediate surgical risk. METHODS: We enrolled 2032 intermediate-risk patients with severe, symptomatic aortic stenosis at 57 centers. Patients were stratified according to intended transfemoral or transthoracic access (76.3% and 23.7%, respectively) and were randomly assigned to undergo either TAVR or surgical replacement. Clinical, echocardiographic, and health-status outcomes were followed for 5 years. The primary end point was death from any cause or disabling stroke. RESULTS: At 5 years, there was no significant difference in the incidence of death from any cause or disabling stroke between the TAVR group and the surgery group (47.9% and 43.4%, respectively; hazard ratio, 1.09; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.95 to 1.25; P\u2009=\u20090.21). Results were similar for the transfemoral-access cohort (44.5% and 42.0%, respectively; hazard ratio, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.87 to 1.20), but the incidence of death or disabling stroke was higher after TAVR than after surgery in the transthoracic-access cohort (59.3% vs. 48.3%; hazard ratio, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.02 to 1.71). At 5 years, more patients in the TAVR group than in the surgery group had at least mild paravalvular aortic regurgitation (33.3% vs. 6.3%). Repeat hospitalizations were more frequent after TAVR than after surgery (33.3% vs. 25.2%), as were aortic-valve reinterventions (3.2% vs. 0.8%). Improvement in health status at 5 years was similar for TAVR and surgery. CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with aortic stenosis who were at intermediate surgical risk, there was no significant difference in the incidence of death or disabling stroke at 5 years after TAVR as compared with surgical aortic-valve replacement.

        "The American Heart Association 2030 Impact Goal: A Presidential Advisory From the American Heart Association. Each decade, the American Heart Association (AHA) develops an Impact Goal to guide its overall strategic direction and investments in its research, quality improvement, advocacy, and public health programs. Guided by the AHA's new Mission Statement, to be a relentless force for a world of longer, healthier lives, the 2030 Impact Goal is anchored in an understanding that to achieve cardiovascular health for all, the AHA must include a broader vision of health and well-being and emphasize health equity. In the next decade, by 2030, the AHA will strive to equitably increase healthy life expectancy beyond current projections, with global and local collaborators, from 66 years of age to at least 68 years of age across the United States and from 64 years of age to at least 67 years of age worldwide. The AHA commits to developing additional targets for equity and well-being to accompany this overarching Impact Goal. To attain the 2030 Impact Goal, we recommend a thoughtful evaluation of interventions available to the public, patients, providers, healthcare delivery systems, communities, policy makers, and legislators. This presidential advisory summarizes the task force's main considerations in determining the 2030 Impact Goal and the metrics to monitor progress. It describes the aspiration that these goals will be achieved by working with a diverse community of volunteers, patients, scientists, healthcare professionals, and partner organizations needed to ensure success. Recommendations for Cardiovascular Health and Disease Surveillance for 2030 and Beyond: A Policy Statement From the American Heart Association. The release of the American Heart Association's 2030 Impact Goal and associated metrics for success underscores the importance of cardiovascular health and cardiovascular disease surveillance systems for the acquisition of information sufficient to support implementation and evaluation. The aim of this policy statement is to review and comment on existing recommendations for and current approaches to cardiovascular surveillance, identify gaps, and formulate policy implications and pragmatic recommendations for transforming surveillance of cardiovascular disease and cardiovascular health in the United States. The development of community platforms coupled with widespread use of digital technologies, electronic health records, and mobile health has created new opportunities that could greatly modernize surveillance if coordinated in a pragmatic matter. However, technology and public health and scientific mandates must be merged into action. We describe the action and components necessary to create the cardiovascular health and cardiovascular disease surveillance system of the future, steps in development, and challenges that federal, state, and local governments will need to address. Development of robust policies and commitment to collaboration among professional organizations, community partners, and policy makers are critical to ultimately reduce the burden of cardiovascular disease and improve cardiovascular health and to evaluate whether national health goals are achieved.

        "Kidney Structural Features from Living Donors Predict Graft Failure in the Recipient. BACKGROUND: Nephrosclerosis, nephron size, and nephron number vary among kidneys transplanted from living donors. However, whether these structural features predict kidney transplant recipient outcomes is unclear. METHODS: Our study used computed tomography (CT) and implantation biopsy to investigate donated kidney features as predictors of death-censored graft failure at three transplant centers participating in the Aging Kidney Anatomy study. We used global glomerulosclerosis, interstitial fibrosis/tubular atrophy, artery luminal stenosis, and arteriolar hyalinosis to measure nephrosclerosis; mean glomerular volume, cortex volume per glomerulus, and mean cross-sectional tubular area to measure nephron size; and calculations from CT cortical volume and glomerular density on biopsy to assess nephron number. We also determined the death-censored risk of graft failure with each structural feature after adjusting for the predictive clinical characteristics of donor and recipient. RESULTS: The analysis involved 2293 donor-recipient pairs. Mean recipient follow-up was 6.3 years, during which 287 death-censored graft failures and 424 deaths occurred. Factors that predicted death-censored graft failure independent of both donor and recipient clinical characteristics included interstitial fibrosis/tubular atrophy, larger cortical nephron size (but not nephron number), and smaller medullary volume. In a subset with 12 biopsy section slides, arteriolar hyalinosis also predicted death-censored graft failure. CONCLUSIONS: Subclinical nephrosclerosis, larger cortical nephron size, and smaller medullary volume in healthy donors modestly predict death-censored graft failure in the recipient, independent of donor or recipient clinical characteristics. These findings provide insights into a graft's \"intrinsic quality\" at the time of donation, and further support the use of intraoperative biopsies to identify kidney grafts that are at higher risk for failure.

        "Associations of Processed Meat, Unprocessed Red Meat, Poultry, or Fish Intake With Incident Cardiovascular Disease and All-Cause Mortality. Importance: Although the associations between processed meat intake and cardiovascular disease (CVD) and all-cause mortality have been established, the associations of unprocessed red meat, poultry, or fish consumption with CVD and all-cause mortality are still uncertain. Objective: To identify the associations of processed meat, unprocessed red meat, poultry, or fish intake with incident CVD and all-cause mortality. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study analyzed individual-level data of adult participants in 6 prospective cohort studies in the United States. Baseline diet data from 1985 to 2002 were collected. Participants were followed up until August 31, 2016. Data analyses were performed from March 25, 2019, to November 17, 2019. Exposures: Processed meat, unprocessed red meat, poultry, or fish intake as continuous variables. Main Outcomes and Measures: Hazard ratio (HR) and 30-year absolute risk difference (ARD) for incident CVD (composite end point of coronary heart disease, stroke, heart failure, and CVD deaths) and all-cause mortality, based on each additional intake of 2 servings per week for monotonic associations or 2 vs 0 servings per week for nonmonotonic associations. Results: Among the 29 682 participants (mean [SD] age at baseline, 53.7 [15.7] years; 13 168 [44.4%] men; and 9101 [30.7%] self-identified as non-white), 6963 incident CVD events and 8875 all-cause deaths were adjudicated during a median (interquartile range) follow-up of 19.0 (14.1-23.7) years. The associations of processed meat, unprocessed red meat, poultry, or fish intake with incident CVD and all-cause mortality were monotonic (P for nonlinearity\u2009\u2265\u2009.25), except for the nonmonotonic association between processed meat intake and incident CVD (P for nonlinearity\u2009=\u2009.006). Intake of processed meat (adjusted HR, 1.07 [95% CI, 1.04-1.11]; adjusted ARD, 1.74% [95% CI, 0.85%-2.63%]), unprocessed red meat (adjusted HR, 1.03 [95% CI, 1.01-1.06]; adjusted ARD, 0.62% [95% CI, 0.07%-1.16%]), or poultry (adjusted HR, 1.04 [95% CI, 1.01-1.06]; adjusted ARD, 1.03% [95% CI, 0.36%-1.70%]) was significantly associated with incident CVD. Fish intake was not significantly associated with incident CVD (adjusted HR, 1.00 [95% CI, 0.98-1.02]; adjusted ARD, 0.12% [95% CI, -0.40% to 0.65%]). Intake of processed meat (adjusted HR, 1.03 [95% CI, 1.02-1.05]; adjusted ARD, 0.90% [95% CI, 0.43%-1.38%]) or unprocessed red meat (adjusted HR, 1.03 [95% CI, 1.01-1.05]; adjusted ARD, 0.76% [95% CI, 0.19%-1.33%]) was significantly associated with all-cause mortality. Intake of poultry (adjusted HR, 0.99 [95% CI, 0.97-1.02]; adjusted ARD, -0.28% [95% CI, -1.00% to 0.44%]) or fish (adjusted HR, 0.99 [95% CI, 0.97-1.01]; adjusted ARD, -0.34% [95% CI, -0.88% to 0.20%]) was not significantly associated with all-cause mortality. Conclusions and Relevance: These findings suggest that, among US adults, higher intake of processed meat, unprocessed red meat, or poultry, but not fish, was significantly associated with a small increased risk of incident CVD, whereas higher intake of processed meat or unprocessed red meat, but not poultry or fish, was significantly associated with a small increased risk of all-cause mortality. These findings have important public health implications and should warrant further investigations. ",
        "Development and validation of the Cambridge Multimorbidity Score. BACKGROUND: Health services have failed to respond to the pressures of multimorbidity. Improved measures of multimorbidity are needed for conducting research, planning services and allocating resources. METHODS: We modelled the association between 37 morbidities and 3 key outcomes (primary care consultations, unplanned hospital admission, death) at 1 and 5 years. We extracted development (n = 300 000) and validation (n = 150 000) samples from the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink. We constructed a general-outcome multimorbidity score by averaging the standardized weights of the separate outcome scores. We compared performance with the Charlson Comorbidity Index. RESULTS: Models that included all 37 conditions were acceptable predictors of general practitioner consultations (C-index 0.732, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.731-0.734), unplanned hospital admission (C-index 0.742, 95% CI 0.737-0.747) and death at 1 year (C-index 0.912, 95% CI 0.905-0.918). Models reduced to the 20 conditions with the greatest combined prevalence/weight showed similar predictive ability (C-indices 0.727, 95% CI 0.725-0.728; 0.738, 95% CI 0.732-0.743; and 0.910, 95% CI 0.904-0.917, respectively). They also predicted 5-year outcomes similarly for consultations and death (C-indices 0.735, 95% CI 0.734-0.736, and 0.889, 95% CI 0.885-0.892, respectively) but performed less well for admissions (C-index 0.708, 95% CI 0.705-0.712). The performance of the general-outcome score was similar to that of the outcome-specific models. These models performed significantly better than those based on the Charlson Comorbidity Index for consultations (C-index 0.691, 95% CI 0.690-0.693) and admissions (C-index 0.703, 95% CI 0.697-0.709) and similarly for mortality (C-index 0.907, 95% CI 0.900-0.914). INTERPRETATION: The Cambridge Multimorbidity Score is robust and can be either tailored or not tailored to specific health outcomes. It will be valuable to those planning clinical services, policymakers allocating resources and researchers seeking to account for the effect of multimorbidity. ",
        "Blood Pressure Thresholds and Neurologic Outcomes After Endovascular Therapy for Acute Ischemic Stroke: An Analysis of Individual Patient Data From 3 Randomized Clinical Trials. Importance: The optimal blood pressure targets during endovascular therapy (EVT) for acute ischemic stroke (AIS) are unknown. Objective: To study whether procedural blood pressure parameters, including specific blood pressure thresholds, are associated with neurologic outcomes after EVT. Design, Setting, and Participants: This retrospective cohort study included adults with anterior-circulation AIS who were enrolled in randomized clinical trials assessing anesthetic strategy for EVT between February 2014 and February 2017. The trials had comparable blood pressure protocols, and patients were followed up for 90 days. A total of 3630 patients were initially approached, and 3265 patients were excluded. Exposure: Endovascular therapy. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary efficacy variable was functional outcome as defined by the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score at 90 days. Associations of blood pressure parameters and time less than and greater than mean arterial blood pressure (MABP) thresholds with outcome were analyzed. Results: Of the 365 patients included in the analysis, the mean (SD) age was 71.4 (13.0) years, 163 were women (44.6%), and the median National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score was 17 (interquartile range [IQR], 14-21). For the entire cohort, 182 (49.9%) received general anesthesia and 183 (50.1%) received procedural sedation. A cumulated period of minimum 10 minutes with less than 70 mm Hg MABP (adjusted OR, 1.51; 95% CI, 1.02-2.22) and a continuous episode of minimum 20 minutes with less than 70 mm Hg MABP (adjusted OR, 2.30; 95% CI, 1.11-4.75) were associated with a shift toward higher 90-day mRS scores, corresponding to a number needed to harm of 10 and 4, respectively. A cumulated period of minimum 45 minutes with greater than 90 mm Hg MABP (adjusted OR, 1.49; 95% CI, 1.11-2.02) and a continuous episode of minimum 115 minutes with greater than 90 mm Hg MABP (adjusted OR, 1.89; 95% CI, 1.01-3.54) were associated with a shift toward higher 90-day mRS scores, corresponding to a number needed to harm of 10 and 6, respectively. Conclusions and Relevance: Critical MABP thresholds and durations for poor outcome were found to be MABP less than 70 mm Hg for more than 10 minutes and MABP greater than 90 mm Hg for more than 45 minutes, both durations with a number needed to harm of 10 patients. Mean arterial blood pressure may be a modifiable therapeutic target to prevent or reduce poor functional outcome after EVT. ",
        "Association Between Neurological Disorders and Death by Suicide in Denmark. Importance: Neurological disorders have been linked to suicide, but the risk across a broad spectrum of neurological disorders remains to be assessed. Objectives: To examine whether people with neurological disorders die by suicide more often than other people and to assess for temporal associations. Design, Setting, and Participants: Nationwide, retrospective cohort study on all persons 15 years or older living in Denmark, from 1980 through 2016 (N\u2009=\u20097\u202f300\u202f395). Exposures: Medical contact for head injury, stroke, epilepsy, polyneuropathy, diseases of myoneural junction, Parkinson disease, multiple sclerosis, central nervous system infections, meningitis, encephalitis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Huntington disease, dementia, intellectual disability, and other brain diseases from 1977 through 2016 (n\u2009=\u20091\u202f248\u202f252). Main Outcomes and Measures: Death by suicide during 1980-2016. Adjusted incidence rate ratio (IRRs) were estimated using Poisson regressions, adjusted for sociodemographics, comorbidity, psychiatric diagnoses, and self-harm. Results: Of the more than 7.3 million individuals observed over 161\u202f935\u202f233 person-years (49.1% males), 35\u202f483 died by suicide (median duration of follow-up, 23.6 years; interquartile range, 10.0-37.0 years; mean age, 51.9 years; SD, 17.9 years). Of those, 77.4% were males, and 14.7% (n\u2009=\u20095141) were diagnosed with a neurological disorder, equivalent to a suicide rate of 44.0 per 100\u202f000 person-years compared with 20.1 per 100\u202f000 person-years among individuals not diagnosed with a neurological disorder. People diagnosed with a neurological disorder had an adjusted IRR of 1.8 (95% CI, 1.7-1.8) compared with those not diagnosed. The excess adjusted IRRs were 4.9 (95% CI, 3.5-6.9) for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, 4.9 (95% CI, 3.1-7.7) for Huntington disease, 2.2 (95% CI, 1.9-2.6) for multiple sclerosis, 1.7 (95% CI, 1.6-1.7) for head injury, 1.3 (95% CI, 1.2-1.3) for stroke, and 1.7 (95% CI, 1.6-1.8) for epilepsy. The association varied according to time since diagnosis with an adjusted IRR for 1 to 3 months of 3.1 (95% CI, 2.7-3.6) and for 10 or more years, 1.5 (95% CI, 1.4 to 1.6, P\u2009<\u2009.001). Compared with those who were not diagnosed with a neurological disorder, those with dementia had a lower overall adjusted IRR of 0.8 (95% CI, 0.7-0.9), which was elevated during the first month after diagnosis to 3.0 (95% CI, 1.9-4.6; P\u2009<\u2009.001). The absolute risk of suicide for people with Huntington disease was 1.6% (95% CI, 1.0%-2.5%). Conclusions and Relevance: In Denmark from 1980 through 2016, there was a significantly higher rate of suicide among those with a diagnosed neurological disorder than persons not diagnosed with a neurological disorder. However, the absolute risk difference was small. ",
        "Reproducibility of Deceased Donor Kidney Procurement Biopsies. BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Unfavorable histology on procurement biopsies is the most common reason for deceased donor kidney discard. We sought to assess the reproducibility of procurement biopsy findings. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: We compiled a continuous cohort of deceased donor kidneys transplanted at our institution from 1/1/2006 to 12/31/2016 that had at least one procurement biopsy performed, and excluded cases with missing biopsy reports and those used in multiorgan transplants. Suboptimal histology was defined as the presence of advanced sclerosis in greater than or equal to one biopsy compartment (glomeruli, tubules/interstitium, vessels). We calculated \u03ba coefficients to assess agreement in optimal versus suboptimal classification between sequential biopsy reports for kidneys that underwent multiple procurement biopsies and used time-to-event analysis to evaluate the association between first versus second biopsies and patient and allograft survival. RESULTS: Of the 1011 kidneys included in our cohort, 606 (60%) had multiple procurement biopsies; 98% had first biopsy performed at another organ procurement organization and their second biopsy performed locally. Categorical agreement was highest for vascular disease (\u03ba=0.17) followed by interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy (\u03ba=0.12) and glomerulosclerosis (\u03ba=0.12). Overall histologic agreement (optimal versus suboptimal) was \u03ba=0.15. First biopsy histology had no association with allograft survival in unadjusted or adjusted analyses. However, second biopsy optimal histology was associated with a higher probability of death-censored allograft survival, even after adjusting for donor and recipient factors (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.50; 95% confidence interval, 0.34 to 0.75; P=0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Deceased donor kidneys that underwent multiple procurement biopsies often displayed substantial differences in histologic categorization in sequential biopsies, and there was no association between first biopsy findings and post-transplant outcomes.

        "Responses to addiction help-seeking from Alexa, Siri, Google Assistant, Cortana, and Bixby intelligent virtual assistants. We investigated how intelligent virtual assistants (IVA), including Amazon's Alexa, Apple's Siri, Google Assistant, Microsoft's Cortana, and Samsung's Bixby, responded to addiction help-seeking queries. We recorded if IVAs provided a singular response and if so, did they link users to treatment or treatment referral services. Only 4 of the 70 help-seeking queries presented to the five IVAs returned singular responses, with the remainder prompting confusion (e.g., \"did I say something wrong?\"). When asked \"help me quit drugs\" Alexa responded with a definition for the word drugs. \"Help me quit\u2026smoking\" or \"tobacco\" on Google Assistant returned Dr. QuitNow (a cessation app), while on Siri \"help me quit pot\" promoted a marijuana retailer. IVAs should be revised to promote free, remote, federally sponsored addiction services, such as SAMSHA's 1-800-662-HELP helpline. This would benefit millions of IVA users now and more to come as IVAs displace existing information-seeking engines. ",
        "Lifestyle Changes in Relation to Initiation of Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Medication: A Cohort Study. Background Lifestyle modification is a key component of cardiovascular disease prevention before and concurrently with pharmacologic interventions. We evaluated whether lifestyle factors change in relation to the initiation of antihypertensive or lipid-lowering medication (statins). Methods and Results The study population comprised 41\u00a0225 participants of the FPS (Finnish Public Sector) study aged \u226540\u00a0years who were free of cardiovascular disease at baseline and responded to \u22652 consecutive surveys administered in 4-year intervals in 2000-2013. Medication use was ascertained through pharmacy-claims data. Using a series of pre-post data sets, we compared changes in body mass index, physical activity, alcohol consumption, and smoking between 8837 initiators and 46\u00a0021 noninitiators of antihypertensive medications or statins. In participants who initiated medication use, body mass index increased more (difference in change 0.19; 95% CI, 0.16-0.22) and physical activity declined (-0.09 metabolic equivalent of task hour/day; 95% CI, -0.16 to -0.02) compared with noninitiators. The likelihood of becoming obese (odds ratio: 1.82; 95% CI, 1.63-2.03) and physically inactive (odds ratio: 1.08; 95% CI, 1.01-1.17) was higher in initiators. However, medication initiation was associated with greater decline in average alcohol consumption (-1.85\u00a0g/week; 95% CI, -3.67 to -0.14) and higher odds of quitting smoking (odds ratio for current smoking in the second survey: 0.74; 95% CI, 0.64-0.85). Conclusions These findings suggest that initiation of antihypertensive and statin medication is associated with lifestyle changes, some favorable and others unfavorable. Weight management and physical activity should be encouraged in individuals prescribed these medications. ",
        "Lung cancer incidence in young women vs. young men: A systematic analysis in 40 countries. Previous studies have reported converging lung cancer rates between sexes. We examine lung cancer incidence rates in young women vs. young men in 40 countries across five continents. Lung and bronchial cancer cases by 5-year age group (ages 30-64) and 5-year calendar period (1993-2012) were extracted from Cancer Incidence in Five Continents. Female-to-male incidence rate ratios (IRRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95%CIs) were calculated by age group and birth cohort. Among men, age-specific lung cancer incidence rates generally decreased in all countries, while in women the rates varied across countries with the trends in most countries stable or declining, albeit at a slower pace compared to those in men. As a result, the female-to-male IRRs increased among recent birth cohorts, with IRRs significantly greater than unity in Canada, Denmark, Germany, New Zealand, the Netherlands and the United States. For example, the IRRs in ages 45-49\u2009year in the Netherlands increased from 0.7 (95% CI: 0.6-0.8) to 1.5 (95% CI: 1.4-1.7) in those born circa 1948 and 1963, respectively. Similar patterns, though nonsignificant, were found in 23 additional countries. These crossovers were largely driven by increasing adenocarcinoma incidence rates in women. For those countries with historical smoking data, smoking prevalence in women approached, but rarely exceeded, those of men. In conclusion, the emerging higher lung cancer incidence rates in young women compared to young men is widespread and not fully explained by sex differences in smoking patterns. Future studies are needed to identify reasons for the elevated incidence of lung cancer among young women. ",
        "Characteristics and conflicts of interests of public speakers at the Psychopharmacologic Drug and Advisory Committee meetings regarding psychiatric drugs. The Psychopharmacologic Drug Advisory Committee (PDAC) is one of 33 advisory committees of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). During committee meetings, an open public hearing takes place where speakers provide testimonies about the drug in question and are asked, not required, to disclose any conflicts of interests (COIs) before speaking. These speakers may present with COIs which include, but are not limited to, reimbursement for travel and lodging by the pharmaceutical company to attend the meeting; previous or current payments for consulting from the pharmaceutical company and compensation as a paid investigator in previously conducted clinical trials for the drug under review. Our study aimed to investigate the characteristics and COIs of public speakers at PDAC meetings of the FDA. We evaluated 145 public speakers at FDA committee meetings over a 10-year period. We found a total of 52 public speakers disclosed a COI with travel and lodging being the most prominent. Among these speakers, 82.4% provided a positive testimony regarding the psychiatric drug in question. Speakers who had the condition in question were not more likely to provide a positive statement than those who did not. Our results showed that disclosing a COI was associated with increased odds of public speakers providing a favourable testimony for the recommendation of psychiatric drugs. The implications of these findings are concerning since COIs have the potential to skew public speaker's testimonies and persuade committee members to recommend a drug through emotionally charged tactics.

        "Transcranial Pulse Stimulation with Ultrasound in Alzheimer's Disease-A New Navigated Focal Brain Therapy. Ultrasound-based brain stimulation techniques may become a powerful new technique to modulate the human brain in a focal and targeted manner. However, for clinical brain stimulation no certified systems exist and the current techniques have to be further developed. Here, a clinical sonication technique is introduced, based on single ultrashort ultrasound pulses (transcranial pulse stimulation, TPS) which markedly differs from existing focused ultrasound techniques. In addition, a first clinical study using ultrasound brain stimulation and first observations of long term effects are presented. Comprehensive feasibility, safety, and efficacy data are provided. They consist of simulation data, laboratory measurements with rat and human skulls and brains, in vivo modulations of somatosensory evoked potentials (SEP) in healthy subjects (sham controlled) and clinical pilot data in 35 patients with Alzheimer's disease acquired in a multicenter setting (including neuropsychological scores and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)). Preclinical results show large safety margins and dose dependent neuromodulation. Patient investigations reveal high treatment tolerability and no major side effects. Neuropsychological scores improve significantly after TPS treatment and improvement lasts up to three months and correlates with an upregulation of the memory network (fMRI data). The results encourage broad neuroscientific application and translation of the method to clinical therapy and randomized sham-controlled clinical studies. ",
        "Tobacco smoking and somatic mutations in human bronchial epithelium. Tobacco smoking causes lung cancer1-3, a process that is driven by more than 60 carcinogens in cigarette smoke that directly damage and mutate DNA4,5. The profound effects of tobacco on the genome of lung cancer cells are well-documented6-10, but equivalent data for normal bronchial cells are lacking. Here we sequenced whole genomes of 632 colonies derived from single bronchial epithelial cells across 16 subjects. Tobacco smoking was the major influence on mutational burden, typically adding from 1,000 to 10,000 mutations per cell; massively increasing the variance both within and between subjects; and generating several distinct mutational signatures of substitutions and of insertions and deletions. A population of cells in individuals with a history of smoking had mutational burdens that were equivalent to those expected for people who had never smoked: these cells had less damage from tobacco-specific mutational processes, were fourfold more frequent in ex-smokers than current smokers and had considerably longer telomeres than their more-mutated counterparts. Driver mutations increased in frequency with age, affecting 4-14% of cells in middle-aged subjects who had never smoked. In current smokers, at least 25% of cells carried driver mutations and 0-6% of cells had two or even three drivers. Thus, tobacco smoking increases mutational burden, cell-to-cell heterogeneity and driver mutations, but quitting promotes replenishment of the bronchial epithelium from mitotically quiescent cells that have avoided tobacco mutagenesis.

        "Gastrointestinal bleeding and the risk of colorectal cancer in anticoagulated patients with atrial fibrillation. AIMS: Gastrointestinal bleeding (GI-bleeding) is frequent in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) treated with oral anticoagulation (OAC) therapy. We sought to investigate to what extent lower GI-bleeding represents the unmasking of an occult colorectal cancer. METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 125\u00a0418 Danish AF patients initiating OAC therapy were identified using Danish administrative registers. Non-parametric estimation and semi-parametric absolute risk regression were used to estimate the absolute risks of colorectal cancer in patients with and without lower GI-bleeding. During a maximum of 3 years of follow-up, we identified 2576 patients with lower GI-bleeding of whom 140 patients were subsequently diagnosed with colorectal cancer within the first year of lower GI-bleeding. In all age groups, we observed high risks of colorectal cancer after lower GI-bleeding. The absolute 1-year risk ranged from 3.7% [95% confidence interval (CI) 2.2-6.2] to 8.1% (95% CI 6.1-10.6) in the age groups \u226465 and 76-80\u2009years of age, respectively. When comparing patients with and without lower GI-bleeding, we found increased risk ratios of colorectal cancer across all age groups with a risk ratio of 24.2 (95% CI 14.5-40.4) and 12.3 (95% CI 7.9-19.0) for the youngest and oldest age group of \u226465 and >85\u2009years, respectively. CONCLUSION: In anticoagulated AF patients, lower GI-bleeding conferred high absolute risks of incident colorectal cancer. Lower GI-bleeding should not be dismissed as a benign consequence of OAC therapy but always examined for a potential underlying malignant cause. ",
        "Outcomes of Online Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy for Patients With Residual Depressive Symptoms: A Randomized Clinical Trial. Importance: Patients with residual depressive symptoms face a gap in care because few resources, to date, are available to manage the lingering effects of their illness. Objective: To evaluate the effectiveness for treating residual depressive symptoms with Mindful Mood Balance (MMB), a web-based application that delivers mindfulness-based cognitive therapy, plus usual depression care compared with usual depression care only. Design, Setting, and Participants: This randomized clinical trial was conducted in primary care and behavioral health clinics at Kaiser Permanente Colorado, Denver. Adults identified with residual depressive symptoms were recruited between March 2, 2015, and November 30, 2018. Outcomes were assessed for a 15-month period, comprising a 3-month intervention interval and a 12-month follow-up period. Interventions: Patients were randomized to receive usual depression care (UDC; n\u2009=\u2009230) or MMB plus UDC (n\u2009=\u2009230), which included 8 sessions delivered online for a 3-month interval plus minimal phone or email coaching support. Main Outcomes and Measures: Primary outcomes were reduction in residual depressive symptom severity, assessed using the Patient Health Questionaire-9 (PHQ-9); rates of depressive relapse (PHQ-9 scores \u226515); and rates of remission (PHQ-9 scores <5). Secondary outcomes included depression-free days, anxiety symptoms (General Anxiety Disorder-7 Item Scale), and functional status (12-Item Short Form Survey). Results: Among 460 randomized participants (mean [SD] age, 48.30 [14.89] years; 346 women [75.6%]), data were analyzed for the intent-to-treat sample, which included 362 participants (78.7%) at 3 months and 330 (71.7%) at 15 months. Participants who received MMB plus UDC had significantly greater reductions in residual depressive symptoms than did those receiving UDC only (mean [SE] PHQ-9 score, 0.95 [0.39], P\u2009<\u2009.02). A significantly greater proportion of patients achieved remission in the MMB plus UDC group compared with the UDC only group (PHQ-9 score, <5: \u03b2 [SE], 0.38 [0.14], P\u2009=\u2009.008), and rates of depressive relapse were significantly lower in the MMB plus UDC group compared with the UDC only group (hazard ratio, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.39-0.95; P\u2009<\u2009.03). Compared with the UDC only group, the MMB plus UDC group had decreased depression-free days (mean [SD], 281.14 [164.99] days vs 247.54 [158.32] days; difference, -33.60 [154.14] days; t\u2009=\u2009-2.33; P\u2009=\u2009.02), decreased anxiety (mean [SE] General Anxiety Disorder-7 Item Scale score, 1.21 [0.42], P\u2009=\u2009.004), and improved mental functioning (mean [SE] 12-Item Short Form Survey score, -5.10 [1.37], P\u2009<\u2009.001), but there was no statistically significant difference in physical functioning. Conclusions and Relevance: Use of MMB plus UDC resulted in significant improvement in depression and functional outcomes compared with UDC only. The MMB web-based treatment may offer a scalable approach for the management of residual depressive symptoms. Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02190968. "
