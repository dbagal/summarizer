        "Long-term Monocular Deprivation during Juvenile Critical Period Disrupts Binocular Integration in Mouse Visual Thalamus. Study of the neural deficits caused by mismatched binocular vision in early childhood has predominantly focused on circuits in the primary visual cortex (V1). Recent evidence has revealed that neurons in mouse dorsolateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) can undergo rapid ocular dominance plasticity following monocular deprivation (MD). It remains unclear, however, whether the long-lasting deficits attributed to MD during the critical period originate in the thalamus. Using in vivo two-photon Ca2+ imaging of dLGN afferents in superficial layers of V1 in female and male mice, we demonstrate that 14 d MD during the critical period leads to a chronic loss of binocular dLGN inputs while sparing response strength and spatial acuity. Importantly, MD leads to profoundly mismatched visual tuning properties in remaining binocular dLGN afferents. Furthermore, MD impairs binocular modulation, reducing facilitation of responses of both binocular and monocular dLGN inputs during binocular viewing. As predicted by our findings in thalamic inputs, Ca2+ imaging from V1 neurons revealed spared spatial acuity but impaired binocularity in L4 neurons. V1 L2/3 neurons in contrast displayed deficits in both binocularity and spatial acuity. Our data demonstrate that critical-period MD produces long-lasting disruptions in binocular integration beginning in early binocular circuits in dLGN, whereas spatial acuity deficits first arise from circuits further downstream in V1. Our findings indicate that the development of normal binocular vision and spatial acuity depend upon experience-dependent refinement of distinct stages in the mammalian visual system.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Abnormal binocular vision and reduced acuity are hallmarks of amblyopia, a disorder that affects 2%-5% of the population. It is widely thought that the neural deficits underlying amblyopia begin in the circuits of primary visual cortex. Using in vivo two-photon calcium imaging of thalamocortical axons in mice, we show that depriving one eye of input during a critical period in development chronically impairs binocular integration in thalamic inputs to primary visual cortex. In contrast, visual acuity is spared in thalamic inputs. These findings shed new light on the role for developmental mechanisms in the thalamus in establishing binocular vision and may have critical implications for amblyopia. ",
        "Calcitonin Receptor Neurons in the Mouse Nucleus Tractus Solitarius Control Energy Balance via the Non-aversive Suppression of Feeding. To understand hindbrain pathways involved in the control of food intake, we examined roles for calcitonin receptor (CALCR)-containing neurons in the NTS. Ablation of NTS Calcr abrogated the long-term suppression of food intake, but not aversive responses,\u00a0by CALCR agonists. Similarly, activating CalcrNTS neurons decreased food intake and body weight but (unlike neighboring CckNTS cells) failed to promote aversion, revealing that CalcrNTS neurons mediate a non-aversive suppression of food intake. While both CalcrNTS and CckNTS neurons decreased feeding via projections to the PBN, CckNTS cells activated aversive CGRPPBN cells while CalcrNTS cells activated distinct non-CGRP PBN cells. Hence, CalcrNTS cells suppress feeding via non-aversive, non-CGRP PBN targets. Additionally, silencing CalcrNTS cells blunted food intake suppression by gut peptides and nutrients, increasing food intake and promoting obesity. Hence, CalcrNTS neurons define a hindbrain system that participates in physiological energy balance and suppresses food intake without activating aversive systems. ",
        "\u03949-tetrahydrocannabinol exposure during rat pregnancy leads to symmetrical fetal growth restriction and labyrinth-specific vascular defects in the placenta. 1 in 5 women report cannabis use during pregnancy, with nausea cited as their primary motivation. Studies show that (-)-\u25b39-tetrahydrocannabinol (\u03949-THC), the major psychoactive ingredient in cannabis, causes fetal growth restriction, though the mechanisms are not well understood. Given the critical role of the placenta to transfer oxygen and nutrients from mother, to the fetus, any compromise in the development of fetal-placental circulation significantly affects maternal-fetal exchange and thereby, fetal growth. The goal of this study was to examine, in rats, the impact of maternal \u03949-THC exposure on fetal development, neonatal outcomes, and placental development. Dams received a daily intraperitoneal injection (i.p.) of vehicle control or \u03949-THC (3\u2009mg/kg) from embryonic (E)6.5 through 22. Dams were allowed to deliver normally to measure pregnancy and neonatal outcomes, with a subset sacrificed at E19.5 for placenta assessment via immunohistochemistry and qPCR. Gestational \u03949-THC exposure resulted in pups born with symmetrical fetal growth restriction, with catch up growth by post-natal day (PND)21. During pregnancy there were no changes to maternal food intake, maternal weight gain, litter size, or gestational length. E19.5 placentas from \u03949-THC-exposed pregnancies exhibited a phenotype characterized by increased labyrinth area, reduced Epcam expression (marker of labyrinth trophoblast progenitors), altered maternal blood space, decreased fetal capillary area and an increased recruitment of pericytes with greater collagen deposition, when compared to vehicle controls. Further, at E19.5 labyrinth trophoblast had reduced glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) and glucocorticoid receptor (GR) expression in response to \u03949-THC exposure. In conclusion, maternal exposure to \u03949-THC effectively compromised fetal growth, which may be a result of the adversely affected labyrinth zone development. These findings implicate GLUT1 as a \u03949-THC target and provide a potential mechanism for the fetal growth restriction observed in women who use cannabis during pregnancy. ",
        "Sexual dimorphism and the role of estrogen in the immune microenvironment of liver metastases. Liver metastases (LM) remain a major cause of cancer-associated death and a clinical challenge. Here we explore a sexual dimorphism observed in the regulation of the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) of LM, wherein the accumulation of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) and regulatory T cells in colon and lung carcinoma LM is TNFR2-dependent in female, but not in male mice. In ovariectomized mice, a marked reduction is observed in colorectal, lung and pancreatic carcinoma LM that is reversible by estradiol reconstitution. This is associated with reduced liver MDSC accumulation, increased interferon-gamma\u00a0(IFN-\u03b3) and granzyme B production in CD8+ T cells and reduced TNFR2, IDO2, TDO and Serpin B9 expression levels. Treatment with tamoxifen increases liver cytotoxic T cell accumulation and reduces colon cancer LM. The results identify estrogen as a regulator of a pro-metastatic immune microenvironment in the liver and a potential target in the management of liver metastatic disease. ",
        "Enhancing Hematopoiesis from Murine Embryonic Stem Cells through MLL1-Induced Activation of a Rac/Rho/Integrin Signaling Axis. The Mixed Lineage Leukemia (MLL1, KMT2A) gene is critical for development and maintenance of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs),\u00a0however, whether this protein is limiting for HSC development is unknown due to lack of physiologic model systems.\u00a0Here, we develop an MLL1-inducible embryonic stem cell (ESC) system and show that induction of wild-type MLL1 during ESC differentiation selectively increases hematopoietic potential from a transitional c-Kit+/Cd41+ population in the embryoid body\u00a0and also at sites of hematopoiesis in embryos. Single-cell sequencing analysis illustrates inherent heterogeneity of the c-Kit+/Cd41+ population and demonstrates that MLL1 induction shifts its composition toward multilineage hematopoietic identities. Surprisingly,\u00a0this does not occur through increasing Hox or other canonical MLL1 targets but through an enhanced Rac/Rho/integrin\u00a0signaling state, which increases responsiveness to Vla4 ligands and enhances hematopoietic commitment. Together, our data implicate a Rac/Rho/integrin signaling axis in the endothelial to hematopoietic transition and demonstrate that MLL1 actives this axis. ",
        "Ribonucleotide reductase inhibitors suppress SAMHD1 ara-CTPase activity enhancing cytarabine efficacy. The deoxycytidine analogue cytarabine (ara-C) remains the backbone treatment of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) as well as other haematological and lymphoid malignancies, but must be combined with other chemotherapeutics to achieve cure. Yet, the underlying mechanism dictating synergistic efficacy of combination chemotherapy remains largely unknown. The dNTPase SAMHD1, which regulates dNTP homoeostasis antagonistically to ribonucleotide reductase (RNR), limits ara-C efficacy by hydrolysing the active triphosphate metabolite ara-CTP. Here, we report that clinically used inhibitors of RNR, such as gemcitabine and hydroxyurea, overcome the SAMHD1-mediated barrier to ara-C efficacy in primary blasts and mouse models of AML, displaying SAMHD1-dependent synergy with ara-C. We present evidence that this is mediated by dNTP pool imbalances leading to allosteric reduction of SAMHD1 ara-CTPase activity. Thus, SAMHD1 constitutes a novel biomarker for combination therapies of ara-C and RNR inhibitors with immediate consequences for clinical practice to improve treatment of AML. ",
        "Overall Mortality After Diagnosis of Breast Cancer in Men vs Women. Importance: Survival differences between male and female patients with breast cancer have been reported, but the underlying factors associated with the disparity have not been fully studied. This understanding is fundamental to developing strategies for cancer treatment and survivorship care. Objective: To compare mortality between male and female patients with breast cancer and quantitatively evaluate the factors associated with sex-based disparity in mortality. Design, Setting, and Participants: This large, nationwide, registry-based cohort study used the National Cancer Database to identify and obtain data on patients who received a breast cancer diagnosis between January 1, 2004, and December 31, 2014. After exclusions, the final study population comprised 1\u202f816\u202f733 patients. Statistical analyses were conducted from September 1, 2018, to January 15, 2019. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was overall survival. Secondary outcomes were 3-year and 5-year mortality. Mortality differences were evaluated by Kaplan-Meier analysis. The roles of race/ethnicity, clinical characteristics, treatments, and access-to-care factors in the association between sex and mortality were estimated by nested Cox proportional hazards regression models with adjustment for age. Results: In total, 16\u202f025 male (mean [SD] age, 63.3 [13.0] years) and 1\u202f800\u202f708 female (mean [SD] age, 59.9 [13.3] years) patients with breast cancer were included in the study. Compared with female patients, male patients had higher mortality across all stages. For men, the overall survival rate was 45.8% (95% CI, 49.5-54.0; P\u2009<\u2009.001), the 3-year rate was 86.4% (95% CI, 85.9-87.0; P\u2009<\u2009.001), and the 5-year rate was 77.6% (95% CI, 76.8-78.3; P\u2009<\u2009.001). For women, the overall survival rate was 60.4% (95% CI, 58.7-62.0; P\u2009<\u2009.001), the 3-year rate was 91.7% (95% CI, 91.7-91.8; P\u2009<\u2009.001), and the 5-year rate was 86.4% (95% CI, 86.4-86.5; P\u2009<\u2009.001). Overall, clinical characteristics and undertreatments were associated with a 63.3% excess mortality rate for male patients. A higher proportion of excess deaths in men were explained by these factors in the first 3 years after breast cancer diagnosis (66.0%) and in all patients with early-stage cancer (30.5% for stage I and 13.6% for stage II). However, sex remained a significant factor associated with overall mortality (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 1.19; 95% CI, 1.16-1.23) as well as mortality at 3-year (adjusted HR,\u20091.15; 95% CI, 1.10-1.21) and 5-year (adjusted HR,\u20091.19; 95% CI, 1.14-1.23) analyses, even after adjustment for clinical characteristics, treatment factors, age, race/ethnicity, and access to care. Conclusions and Relevance: This study found that mortality after cancer diagnosis was higher among male patients with breast cancer compared with their female counterparts. Such disparity appeared to persist after accounting for clinical characteristics, treatment factors, and access to care, suggesting that other factors (particularly additional biological attributes, treatment compliance, and lifestyle factors) should be identified to help in eliminating this disparity.

        "The Reproductive Microbiome: An Emerging Driver of Sexual Selection, Sexual Conflict, Mating Systems, and Reproductive Isolation. All multicellular organisms host microbial communities in and on their bodies, and these microbiomes can have major influences on host biology. Most research has focussed on the oral, skin, and gut microbiomes, whereas relatively little is known about the reproductive microbiome. Here, we review empirical evidence to show that reproductive microbiomes can have significant effects on the reproductive function and performance of males and females. We then discuss the likely repercussions of these effects for evolutionary processes related to sexual selection and sexual conflict, as well as mating systems and reproductive isolation. We argue that knowledge of the reproductive microbiome is fundamental to our understanding of the evolutionary ecology of reproductive strategies and sexual dynamics of host organisms. ",
        "Design of highly stabilized nanocomposite inks based on biodegradable polymer-matrix and gold nanoparticles for Inkjet Printing. Nowadays there is a worldwide growing interest in the Inkjet Printing technology owing to its potentially high levels of geometrical complexity, personalization and resolution. There is also social concern about usage, disposal and accumulation of plastic materials. In this work, it is shown that sugar-based biodegradable polyurethane polymers exhibit outstanding properties as polymer-matrix for gold nanoparticles composites. These materials could reach exceptional stabilization levels, and demonstrated potential as novel robust inks for Inkjet based Printing. Furthermore, a physical comparison among different polymers is discussed based on stability and printability experiments to search for the best ink candidate. The University of Seville logo was printed by employing those inks, and the presence of gold was confirmed by ToF-SIMS. This approach has the potential to open new routes and applications for fabrication of enhanced biomedical nanometallic-sensors using stabilized AuNP. ",
        "Biomimetic Networks with Enhanced Photodynamic Antimicrobial Activity from Conjugated Polythiophene/Polyisocyanide Hybrid Hydrogels. Hybrid biomimetic hydrogels with enhanced reactive oxygen species (ROS)-generation efficiency under 600\u2005nm light show high antibacterial activity. The hybrid gels are composed of helical tri(ethylene glycol)-functionalized polyisocyanides (PICs) and a conformation-sensitive conjugated polythiophene, poly(3-(3'-N,N,N-triethylammonium-1'-propyloxy)-4-methyl-2,5-thiophene chloride) (PMNT). The PIC polymer serves as a scaffold to trap and align the PMNT backbone into a highly ordered conformation, resulting in redshifted, new sharp bands in the absorption and fluorescence spectra. Similar to PIC, the hybrid closely mimics the mechanical properties of biological gels, such as collagen and fibrin, including the strain stiffening properties at low stresses. Moreover, the PMNT/PIC hybrids show much higher ROS production efficiency under red light than PMNT only, leading to an efficient photodynamic antimicrobial effect towards various pathogenic bacteria.

        "Candidate Cancer Driver Mutations in Distal Regulatory Elements and Long-Range Chromatin Interaction Networks. A comprehensive catalog of cancer driver mutations is essential for understanding tumorigenesis and developing therapies. Exome-sequencing studies have mapped many protein-coding drivers, yet few non-coding drivers are known because genome-wide discovery is challenging. We developed a driver discovery method, ActiveDriverWGS, and analyzed 120,788 cis-regulatory modules (CRMs) across 1,844 whole tumor genomes from the ICGC-TCGA PCAWG project. We found 30 CRMs with enriched SNVs and indels (FDR\u00a0< 0.05). These frequently mutated regulatory elements (FMREs) were ubiquitously active in human tissues, showed long-range chromatin interactions and mRNA abundance associations with target genes, and were enriched in motif-rewiring mutations and structural variants. Genomic deletion of one FMRE in human cells caused proliferative deficiencies and transcriptional deregulation of cancer genes CCNB1IP1, CDH1, and CDKN2B, validating observations in FMRE-mutated tumors. Pathway analysis revealed further sub-significant FMREs at cancer genes and processes, indicating an unexplored landscape of infrequent driver mutations in the non-coding genome. ",
        "Temporal Trends in Critical Care Outcomes in U.S. Minority-Serving Hospitals. Rationale: Whether critical care improvements over the last 10 years extend to all hospitals has not been described.Objectives: To examine the temporal trends of critical care outcomes in minority and non-minority-serving hospitals using an inception cohort of critically ill patients.Measurements and Main Results: Using the Philips Health Care electronic ICU Research Institute Database, we identified minority-serving hospitals as those with an African American or Hispanic ICU census more than twice its regional mean. We examined almost 1.1 million critical illness admissions among 208 ICUs from across the United States admitted between 2006 and 2016. Adjusted hospital mortality (primary) and length of hospitalization (secondary) were the main outcomes. Large pluralities of African American (25%, n\u2009=\u200927,242) and Hispanic individuals (48%, n\u2009=\u200926,743) were cared for in minority-serving hospitals, compared with only 5.2% (n\u2009=\u200942,941) of white individuals. Over the last 10 years, although the risk of critical illness mortality steadily decreased by 2% per year (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.97-0.98) in non-minority-serving hospitals, outcomes within minority-serving hospitals did not improve comparably. This disparity in temporal trends was particularly noticeable among African American individuals, where each additional calendar year was associated with a 3% (95% CI, 0.96-0.97) lower adjusted critical illness mortality within a non-minority-serving hospital, but no change within minority-serving hospitals (hazard ratio, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.97-1.01). Similarly, although ICU and hospital lengths of stay decreased by 0.08 (95% CI, -0.08 to -0.07) and 0.16 (95% CI, -0.16 to -0.15) days per additional calendar year, respectively, in non-minority-serving hospitals, there was little temporal change for African American individuals in minority-serving hospitals.Conclusions: Critically ill African American individuals are disproportionately cared for in minority-serving hospitals, which have shown significantly less improvement than non-minority-serving hospitals over the last 10 years.

        "Methylphenidate modifies reward cue responses in adults with ADHD: An fMRI study. Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) has been associated with neural hyposensitivity to reward-predicting cues. Methylphenidate is widely used in the management of the disorder's symptoms, but its effects on reward sensitivity in ADHD are unknown. The current study used fMRI to measure striatal responses to reward-predicting cues in adults with ADHD on and off methylphenidate and a control group, during a classical conditioning task. Responses to cued reward were also explored. Larger differences in the ventral striatum activation to reward cues versus non-reward cues were observed when the ADHD participants were on methylphenidate compared to placebo. In response to cued-reward outcome, an exploratory analysis showed methylphenidate reduced the BOLD time-series correlation between the dorsal striatum and dorsal medial prefrontal cortex. Methylphenidate's therapeutic effects may be mediated by altering reward processing in individuals with ADHD. ",
        "Single-molecule imaging reveals the oligomeric state of functional TNF\u03b1-induced plasma membrane TNFR1 clusters in cells. Ligand-induced tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 (TNFR1) activation controls nuclear factor \u03ba-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-\u03baB) signaling, cell proliferation, programmed cell death, and survival and is crucially involved in inflammation, autoimmune disorders, and cancer progression. Despite the relevance of TNFR1 clustering for signaling, oligomerization of ligand-free and ligand-activated TNFR1 remains controversial. At present, models range from ligand-independent receptor predimerization to ligand-induced oligomerization. Here, we used quantitative, single-molecule superresolution microscopy to study TNFR1 assembly directly in native cellular settings and at physiological cell surface abundance. In the absence of its ligand TNF\u03b1, TNFR1 assembled into monomeric and dimeric receptor units. Upon binding of TNF\u03b1, TNFR1 clustered predominantly not only into trimers but also into higher-order oligomers. A functional mutation in the preligand assembly domain of TNFR1 resulted in only monomeric TNFR1, which exhibited impaired ligand binding. In contrast, a form of TNFR1 with a mutation in the ligand-binding CRD2 subdomain retained the monomer-to-dimer ratio of the unliganded wild-type TNFR1 but exhibited no ligand binding. These results underscore the importance of ligand-independent TNFR1 dimerization in NF-\u03baB signaling. ",
        "Antenatal sildenafil citrate treatment increases offspring blood pressure in the placental-specific Igf2 knockout mouse model of FGR. Fetal growth restriction (FGR), where a fetus fails to reach its genetic growth potential, affects up to 8% of pregnancies and is a major risk factor for stillbirth and adulthood morbidity. There are currently no treatments for FGR, but candidate therapies include the phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor sildenafil citrate (SC). Randomized clinical trials in women demonstrated no effect of SC on fetal growth in cases of severe early onset FGR; however, long-term health outcomes on the offspring are unknown. This study aimed to assess the effect of antenatal SC treatment on metabolic and cardiovascular health in offspring by assessing postnatal weight gain, glucose tolerance, systolic blood pressure, and resistance artery function in a mouse model of FGR, the placental-specific insulin-like growth factor 2 (PO) knockout mouse. SC was administered subcutaneously (10 mg/kg) daily from embryonic day (E)12.5. Antenatal SC treatment did not alter fetal weight or viability but increased postnatal weight gain in wild-type (WT) female offspring (P < 0.05) and reduced glucose sensitivity in both WT (P < 0.01) and P0 (P < 0.05) female offspring compared with controls. Antenatal SC treatment increased systolic blood pressure in both male (WT vs. WT-SC: 117\u2009\u00b1\u20092 vs. 140\u2009\u00b1\u20093 mmHg, P < 0.0001; P0 vs. P0-SC: 113\u2009\u00b1\u20093 vs. 140\u2009\u00b1\u20094 mmHg, P < 0.0001; means\u2009\u00b1\u2009SE) and female (WT vs. WT-SC: 121\u2009\u00b1\u20092 vs. 140\u2009\u00b1\u20092 mmHg, P < 0.0001; P0 vs. P0-SC: 117\u2009\u00b1\u20092 vs. 144\u2009\u00b1\u20094 mmHg, P < 0.0001) offspring at 8 and 13 wk of age. Increased systolic blood pressure was not attributed to altered mesenteric artery function. In utero exposure to SC may result in metabolic dysfunction and elevated blood pressure in later life.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Sildenafil citrate (SC) is currently used to treat fetal growth restriction (FGR). We demonstrate that SC is ineffective at treating FGR, and leads to a substantial increase systolic blood pressure and alterations in glucose homeostasis in offspring. We therefore urge caution and suggest that further studies are required to assess the safety and efficacy of SC in utero, in addition to the implications on long-term health. ",
        "Cognitive problems of breast cancer survivors on proton pump inhibitors. PURPOSE: Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are used in cancer patients to manage treatment-related gastrointestinal symptoms and to prevent damage to the gastric mucosal lining during treatment. However, PPI use may contribute to cognitive problems. To compare PPI-users and non-users, breast cancer survivors reported cognitive problems in three studies. METHODS: In Study 1, breast cancer survivors (N\u2009=\u00a0209; n\u2009=\u00a0173 non-users, n\u2009=\u00a036 PPI-users; stages 0-IIIC) rated their cognitive function on the Kohli scale prior to cancer treatment, as well as one and two years later. In Study 2, women (N\u2009=\u00a0200; n\u2009=\u00a0169 non-users, n\u2009=\u00a031 PPI-users, stages 0-IIIa, M\u2009=\u00a011\u00a0months post-treatment) rated their cognitive function on the Kohli scale and BCPT checklist at three visits over a six-month period. In Study 3, participants (N\u2009=\u00a0142; n\u2009=\u00a0121 non-users, n\u2009=\u00a021 PPI-users; stages I-IIIa, M\u2009=\u00a04\u00a0years post-treatment) rated their cognitive function on the Kohli scale, BCPT checklist, and Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy cognitive scale (FACT-cog). RESULTS: In Study 1, PPI-users reported more severe concentration problems (p\u2009=\u00a00.039) but not memory problems (p\u2009=\u00a00.17) than non-users. In Study 2, PPI-users reported more severe concentration problems (p\u2009=\u00a00.022) than non-users, but not memory problems or symptoms on the BCPT (ps\u2009=\u20090.11). Study 3's PPI-users reported more severe memory problems (p\u2009=\u00a00.002), poorer overall cognitive function (p\u2009=\u00a00.006), lower quality of life related to cognitive problems (p\u2009=\u00a00.005), greater perceived cognitive impairment (p\u2009=\u00a00.013), and poorer cognitive abilities (p\u2009=\u00a00.046), but not more severe concentration problems (p\u2009=\u00a00.16), compared to non-users. CONCLUSIONS/IMPLICATIONS: PPI use may impair breast cancer survivors' memory, concentration, and quality of life. ",
        "TBK1 Is a Synthetic Lethal Target in Cancer with VHL Loss. TANK binding kinase 1 (TBK1) is an important kinase involved in the innate immune response. Here we discover that TBK1 is hyperactivated by von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) loss or hypoxia in cancer cells. Tumors from patients with kidney cancer with VHL loss display elevated TBK1 phosphorylation. Loss of TBK1 via genetic ablation, pharmacologic inhibition, or a new cereblon-based proteolysis targeting chimera specifically inhibits VHL-deficient kidney cancer cell growth, while leaving VHL wild-type cells intact. TBK1 depletion also significantly blunts kidney tumorigenesis in an orthotopic xenograft model in vivo. Mechanistically, TBK1 hydroxylation on Proline 48 triggers VHL as well as the phosphatase PPM1B binding that leads to decreased TBK1 phosphorylation. We identify that TBK1 phosphorylates p62/SQSTM1 on Ser366, which is essential for p62 stability and kidney cancer cell proliferation. Our results establish that TBK1, distinct from its role in innate immune signaling, is a synthetic lethal target in cancer with VHL loss. SIGNIFICANCE: The mechanisms that lead to TBK1 activation in cancer and whether this activation is connected to its role in innate immunity remain unclear. Here, we discover that TBK1, distinct from its role in innate immunity, is activated by VHL loss or hypoxia in cancer.See related commentary by Bakouny and Barbie, p. 348.This article is highlighted in the In This Issue feature, p. 327.

        "Hospitalization, Alzheimer's Disease and Related Neuropathologies, and Cognitive Decline. OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that Alzheimer's disease and related neuropathologies contribute to the association between hospitalization and cognitive decline in old age. METHODS: As part of a longitudinal clinical-pathologic cohort study, 526 older persons (mean age at death = 90.9\u2009years, 71% female) without dementia at baseline completed annual cognitive testing and were autopsied at death. Hospitalization information was obtained from linked Medicare claims records. Neuropathologic examination assessed \u03b2-amyloid burden, tau tangle density, neocortical Lewy bodies, hippocampal sclerosis, chronic gross and microscopic cerebral infarcts, and transactive response DNA binding protein 43 kDa. RESULTS: Over a mean of 5.1\u2009years, a total of 1,383 hospitalizations occurred, and the mean annual rate of hospitalization was 0.5 (standard deviation = 0.6, median = 0.4). Higher rate of hospitalization was not directly related to higher burden for any of the neuropathologic markers. Higher rate of hospitalization was associated with more rapid cognitive decline (estimate = -0.042, standard error [SE] = 0.012, p <\u20090.001), and after controlling for all 7 neuropathologic markers, the association was essentially the same (estimate = -0.040, SE = 0.013, p =\u20090.002). In a multivariable model with 3-way interactions of neuropathologic markers with hospitalization rate and time, the association between hospitalization rate and faster cognitive decline was greater in persons with more tangle pathology (estimate for interaction = -0.007, SE = 0.002, p =\u20090.002) and in persons with neocortical Lewy bodies (estimate for interaction = -0.117, SE = 0.042, p =\u20090.005). INTERPRETATION: Older persons with more hospitalizations experienced faster rates of cognitive decline, and this association was more pronounced in persons with more tau tangle density and with neocortical Lewy body pathologies.

        "Effect of Vitamin C, Hydrocortisone, and Thiamine vs Hydrocortisone Alone on Time Alive and Free of Vasopressor Support Among Patients With Septic Shock: The VITAMINS Randomized Clinical Trial. Importance: It is unclear whether vitamin C, hydrocortisone, and thiamine are more effective than hydrocortisone alone in expediting resolution of septic shock. Objective: To determine whether the combination of vitamin C, hydrocortisone, and thiamine, compared with hydrocortisone alone, improves the duration of time alive and free of vasopressor administration in patients with septic shock. Design, Setting, and Participants: Multicenter, open-label, randomized clinical trial conducted in 10 intensive care units in Australia, New Zealand, and Brazil that recruited 216 patients fulfilling the Sepsis-3 definition of septic shock. The first patient was enrolled on May 8, 2018, and the last on July 9, 2019. The final date of follow-up was October 6, 2019. Interventions: Patients were randomized to the intervention group (n\u2009=\u2009109), consisting of intravenous vitamin C (1.5 g every 6 hours), hydrocortisone (50 mg every 6 hours), and thiamine (200 mg every 12 hours), or to the control group (n\u2009=\u2009107), consisting of intravenous hydrocortisone (50 mg every 6 hours) alone until shock resolution or up to 10 days. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary trial outcome was duration of time alive and free of vasopressor administration up to day 7. Ten secondary outcomes were prespecified, including 90-day mortality. Results: Among 216 patients who were randomized, 211 provided consent and completed the primary outcome measurement (mean age, 61.7 years [SD, 15.0]; 133 men [63%]). Time alive and vasopressor free up to day 7 was 122.1 hours (interquartile range [IQR], 76.3-145.4 hours) in the intervention group and 124.6 hours (IQR, 82.1-147.0 hours) in the control group; the median of all paired differences was -0.6 hours (95% CI, -8.3 to 7.2 hours; P\u2009=\u2009.83). Of 10 prespecified secondary outcomes, 9 showed no statistically significant difference. Ninety-day mortality was 30/105 (28.6%) in the intervention group and 25/102 (24.5%) in the control group (hazard ratio, 1.18; 95% CI, 0.69-2.00). No serious adverse events were reported. Conclusions and Relevance: In patients with septic shock, treatment with intravenous vitamin C, hydrocortisone, and thiamine, compared with intravenous hydrocortisone alone, did not significantly improve the duration of time alive and free of vasopressor administration over 7 days. The finding suggests that treatment with intravenous vitamin C, hydrocortisone, and thiamine does not lead to a more rapid resolution of septic shock compared with intravenous hydrocortisone alone.

        "Abdominal obesity and the risk of recurrent atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease after myocardial infarction. BACKGROUND: The association between abdominal obesity and recurrent atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease after myocardial infarction remains unknown. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to investigate the prevalence of abdominal obesity and its association with recurrent atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease in patients after a first myocardial infarction. DESIGN AND METHODS: In this register-based observational cohort, 22,882 patients were identified from the national Swedish Web-system for Enhancement and Development of Evidence-based Care in Heart Disease Evaluated According to Recommended Therapies (SWEDEHEART) registry at a clinical revisit 4-10 weeks after their first myocardial infarction 2005-2014. Patients were followed for recurrent atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease defined as non-fatal myocardial infarction, coronary heart disease death, non-fatal or fatal ischaemic stroke. Univariate and multivariable-adjusted Cox regression models were used to calculate hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals in quintiles of waist circumference as well as three categories of body mass index including normal weight, overweight and obesity. RESULTS: The majority of patients had abdominal obesity. During a median follow-up time of 3.8 years, 1232 men (7.3%) and 469 women (7.9%) experienced a recurrent atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease event. In the univariate analysis, risk was elevated in the fifth quintile (hazard ratio 1.22, 95% confidence interval 1.07-1.39) compared with the first. In the multivariable-adjusted analysis, risk was elevated in the fourth and fifth quintiles (hazard ratio 1.21, confidence interval 1.03-1.43 and hazard ratio 1.25, confidence interval 1.04-1.50), respectively. Gender-stratified analyses showed similar associations in men, while U-shaped associations were observed in women and the body mass index analyses. CONCLUSIONS: Abdominal obesity was common in post-myocardial infarction patients and larger waist circumference was independently associated with recurrent atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, particularly in men. We recommend utilising waist circumference to identify patients at increased risk of recurrent atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease after myocardial infarction. ",
        "Phenotypic, Transcriptional, and Functional Analysis of Liver Mesenchymal Stromal Cells and Their Immunomodulatory Properties. The liver is an immunologically active organ with a tolerogenic microenvironment at a quiescent state. The immunoregulatory properties of the liver appear to be retained after transplantation because liver allografts can reduce alloresponses against other organs that are simultaneously transplanted. Mechanisms of this phenomenon remain unknown. Given the known immunomodulatory properties of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs), we hypothesized that liver mesenchymal stromal cells (L-MSCs) are superior immunomodulators and contribute to liver-mediated tolerance. L-MSCs, generated from human liver allograft biopsies, were compared with adipose mesenchymal stromal cells (A-MSCs) and bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells (BM-MSCs). Trilineage differentiation of L-MSCs was confirmed by immunohistochemistry. Comparative phenotypic analyses were done by flow cytometry and transcriptome analyses by RNA sequencing in unaltered cell cultures. The in vitro functional analyses were performed using alloreactive T cell proliferation assays. The transcriptome analysis showed that the L-MSCs are different than the A-MSCs and BM-MSCs, with significant enrichment of genes and gene sets associated with immunoregulation. Compared with the others, L-MSCs were found to express higher cell surface levels of several select immunomodulatory molecules. L-MSCs (versus A-MSCs/BM-MSCs) inhibited alloreactive T cell proliferation (22.7% versus 56.4%/58.7%, respectively; P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) and reduced the frequency of interferon \u0264-producing T cells better than other MSCs (52.8% versus 94.4%/155.4%; P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). The antiproliferative impact of L-MSCs was not dependent on cell-to-cell contact, could be reversed incompletely by blocking programmed death ligand 1, and required a higher concentration of the competitive inhibitor of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase for complete reversal. In conclusion, L-MSCs appear to be uniquely well-equipped immunomodulatory cells, and they are more potent than A-MSCs and BM-MSCs in that capacity, which suggests that they may contribute to liver-induced systemic tolerance.

        "Inhibition of the mitochondrial citrate carrier, Slc25a1, reverts steatosis, glucose intolerance, and inflammation in preclinical models of NAFLD/NASH. Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and its evolution to inflammatory steatohepatitis (NASH) are the most common causes of chronic liver damage and transplantation that are reaching epidemic proportions due to the upraising incidence of metabolic syndrome, obesity, and diabetes. Currently, there is no approved treatment for NASH. The mitochondrial citrate carrier, Slc25a1, has been proposed to play an important role in lipid metabolism, suggesting a potential role for this protein in the pathogenesis of this disease. Here, we show that Slc25a1 inhibition with a specific inhibitor compound, CTPI-2, halts salient alterations of NASH reverting steatosis, preventing the evolution to steatohepatitis, reducing inflammatory macrophage infiltration in the liver and adipose tissue, while starkly mitigating obesity induced by a high-fat diet. These effects are differentially recapitulated by a global ablation of one copy of the Slc25a1 gene or by a liver-targeted Slc25a1 knockout, which unravel dose-dependent and tissue-specific functions of this protein. Mechanistically, through citrate-dependent activities, Slc25a1 inhibition rewires the lipogenic program, blunts signaling from peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma, a key regulator of glucose and lipid metabolism, and inhibits the expression of gluconeogenic genes. The combination of these activities leads not only to inhibition of lipid anabolic processes, but also to a normalization of hyperglycemia and glucose intolerance as well. In summary, our data show for the first time that Slc25a1 serves as an important player in the pathogenesis of fatty liver disease and thus, provides a potentially exploitable and novel therapeutic target.

        "Envisioning a Better U.S. Health Care System for All: Coverage and Cost of Care. This paper is part of the American College of Physicians' policy framework to achieve a vision for a better health care system, where everyone has coverage for and access to the care they need, at a cost they and the country can afford. Currently, the United States is the only wealthy industrialized country that has not achieved universal health coverage. The nation's existing health care system is inefficient, unaffordable, unsustainable, and inaccessible to many. Part 1 of this paper discusses why the United States needs to do better in addressing coverage and cost. Part 2 presents 2 potential approaches, a single-payer model and a public choice model, to achieve universal coverage. Part 3 describes how an emphasis on value-based care can reduce costs. ",
        "Association between household food insecurity and mortality in Canada: a population-based retrospective cohort study. BACKGROUND: Food insecurity affects 1 in 8 households in Canada, with serious health consequences. We investigated the association between household food insecurity and all-cause and cause-specific mortality. METHODS: We assessed the food insecurity status of Canadian adults using the Canadian Community Health Survey 2005-2017 and identified premature deaths among the survey respondents using the Canadian Vital Statistics Database 2005-2017. Applying Cox survival analyses to the linked data sets, we compared adults' all-cause and cause-specific mortality hazard by their household food insecurity status. RESULTS: Of the 510 010 adults sampled (3 390 500 person-years), 25 460 died prematurely by 2017. Death rates of food-secure adults and their counterparts experiencing marginal, moderate and severe food insecurity were 736, 752, 834 and 1124 per 100 000 person-years, respectively. The adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) of all-cause premature mortality for marginal, moderate and severe food insecurity were 1.10 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.03-1.18), 1.11 (95% CI 1.05-1.18) and 1.37 (95% CI 1.27-1.47), respectively. Among adults who died prematurely, those experiencing severe food insecurity died on average 9 years earlier than their food-secure counterparts (age 59.5 v. 68.9 yr). Severe food insecurity was consistently associated with higher mortality across all causes of death except cancers; the association was particularly pronounced for infectious-parasitic diseases (adjusted HR 2.24, 95% CI 1.42-3.55), unintentional injuries (adjusted HR 2.69, 95% CI 2.04-3.56) and suicides (adjusted HR 2.21, 95% CI 1.50-3.24). INTERPRETATION: Canadian adults from food-insecure households were more likely to die prematurely than their food-secure counterparts. Efforts to reduce premature mortality should consider food insecurity as a relevant social determinant. ",
        "Hypocapnia Alone Fails to Provoke Important Electrocardiogram Changes in Coronary Artery Diseased Patients. Background: There is still an urgent clinical need to develop non-invasive diagnostic tests for early ischemic heart disease because, once angina occurs, it is too late. Hypocapnia has long been known to cause coronary artery vasoconstriction. Some new cardiology tests are accompanied by the claim that they must have potential diagnostic value if hypocapnia enhances their cardiac effects in healthy subjects. But no previous study has tested whether hypocapnia produces bigger cardiac effects in patients with angina than in healthy subjects. Methods: Severe hypocapnia (a PetCO2 level of 20 mmHg) lasting >15 min was mechanically induced by facemask, while conscious and unmedicated, in 18 healthy subjects and in 10 patients with angina and angiographically confirmed coronary artery disease, awaiting by-pass surgery. Each participant was their own control in normocapnia (where CO2 was added to the inspirate) and the order of normocapnia and hypocapnia was randomized. Twelve lead electrocardiograms (ECG) were recorded and automated measurements were made on all ECG waveforms averaged over >120 beats. 2D echocardiography was also performed on healthy subjects. Results: In the 18 healthy subjects, we confirm that severe hypocapnia (a mean PetCO2 of 20 \u00b1 0 mmHg, P < 0.0001) consistently increased the mean T wave amplitude in leads V1-V3, but by only 31% (P < 0.01), 15% (P < 0.001) and 11% (P < 0.05), respectively. Hypocapnia produced no other significant effects (p > 0.05) on their electro- or echocardiogram. All 10 angina patients tolerated the mechanical hyperventilation well, with minimal discomfort. Hypocpania caused a similar increase in V1 (by 39%, P < 0.05 vs. baseline, but P > 0.05 vs. healthy controls) and did not induce angina. Its effects were no greater in patients who did not take \u03b2-blockers, or did not take organic nitrates, or had the worst Canadian Cardiovascular Society scores. Conclusion: Non-invasive mechanical hyperventilation while awake and unmedicated is safe and acceptable, even to patients with angina. Using it to produce severe and prolonged hypocapnia alone does produce significant ECG changes in angina patients. But its potential diagnostic value for identifying patients with coronary stenosis requires further evaluation. ",
        "Differences in Psychotropic Drug Prescribing Between Ethnic Groups of People with Dementia in the United Kingdom. Purpose: To test hypotheses that minority ethnic people with dementia in the UK receive fewer anti-dementia drugs and more psychotropic and anticholinergic drugs associated with harms. Patients and Methods: We analyzed UK primary care electronic health records from The Health Improvement Network (THIN) database (2014-2016), comparing psychotropic drug prescribing initiation and duration between people with dementia from White, Black, and Asian ethnic groups. We repeated analyses in people (aged 50+) without dementia, to explore whether any differences found reflected prescribing patterns in the general older population, or were specific to dementia. Results: We included 53,718 people with and 1,648,889 people without dementia. Among people with dementia, compared to White ethnic groups, Asian people were less likely to be prescribed anti-dementia drugs when they were potentially indicated (adjusted prevalence rate ratio 0.86 (95% Confidence Interval 0.76-0.98)), and received them for on average 15 days/year less. Compared to White groups, Asian and Black individuals with dementia were no more likely to take an antipsychotic drug, but those that had were prescribed them for 17 and 27 days/year more, respectively (190.8 (179.6-199.1) and 200.7 (191.1-206.5) days). Black people were less likely to be prescribed anxiolytics/hypnotics (0.60 (0.44-0.8)), but the duration these drugs were prescribed was similar across ethnic groups. Asian people were more likely to be prescribed anticholinergic drugs (1.43 (1.19-1.73)), in analyses unadjusted for cardiovascular comorbidities. Among people without dementia, those in the Asian and Black ethnic groups were less likely to be prescribed psychotropic drugs, relative to people from White groups. Conclusion: Among people with dementia, Asian groups received less potentially beneficial symptomatic treatments, and Asian and Black groups were prescribed antipsychotic drugs for longer than White ethnic groups. Our findings may indicate care inequalities. ",
        "A molecularly engineered antiviral banana lectin inhibits fusion and is efficacious against influenza virus infection in vivo. There is a strong need for a new broad-spectrum antiinfluenza therapeutic, as vaccination and existing treatments are only moderately effective. We previously engineered a lectin, H84T banana lectin (H84T), to retain broad-spectrum activity against multiple influenza strains, including pandemic and avian, while largely eliminating the potentially harmful mitogenicity of the parent compound. The amino acid mutation at position 84 from histidine to threonine minimizes the mitogenicity of the wild-type lectin while maintaining antiinfluenza activity in vitro. We now report that in a lethal mouse model H84T is indeed nonmitogenic, and both early and delayed therapeutic administration of H84T intraperitoneally are highly protective, as is H84T administered subcutaneously. Mechanistically, attachment, which we anticipated to be inhibited by H84T, was only somewhat decreased by the lectin. Instead, H84T is internalized into the late endosomal/lysosomal compartment and inhibits virus-endosome fusion. These studies reveal that H84T is efficacious against influenza virus in vivo, and that the loss of mitogenicity seen previously in tissue culture is also seen in vivo, underscoring the potential utility of H84T as a broad-spectrum antiinfluenza agent.

        "mTORC1 directly inhibits AMPK to promote cell proliferation under nutrient stress. Central to cellular metabolism and cell proliferation are highly conserved signalling pathways controlled by mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)1,2, dysregulation of which are implicated in pathogenesis of major human diseases such as cancer and type 2 diabetes. AMPK pathways leading to reduced cell proliferation are well established and, in part, act through inhibition of TOR complex-1 (TORC1) activity. Here we demonstrate reciprocal regulation, specifically that TORC1 directly down-regulates AMPK signalling by phosphorylating the evolutionarily conserved residue Ser367 in the fission yeast AMPK catalytic subunit Ssp2, and AMPK \u03b11Ser347/\u03b12Ser345 in the mammalian homologs, which is associated with reduced phosphorylation of activation loop Thr172. Genetic or pharmacological inhibition of TORC1 signalling led to AMPK activation in the absence of increased AMP:ATP ratios; under nutrient stress conditions this was associated with growth limitation in both yeast and human cell cultures. Our findings reveal fundamental, bi-directional regulation between two major metabolic signalling networks and uncover new opportunity for cancer treatment strategies aimed at suppressing cell proliferation in the nutrient-poor tumor microenvironment.

        "Rapid Memory Reactivation at Movie Event Boundaries Promotes Episodic Encoding. Segmentation of continuous experience into discrete events is driven by rapid fluctuations in encoding stability at context shifts (i.e., event boundaries), yet the mechanisms underlying the online formation of event memories are poorly understood. We investigated the neural per-time point spatial similarity patterns of the scalp electrophysiological (EEG) activity of 30 human participants (male and female) watching a 50 min movie and found that event boundaries triggered the rapid reinstatement of the just-encoded movie event EEG patterns. We also found that the onset of memory reinstatement at boundary onset was accompanied by a left-lateralized anterior negative ERP effect, which likely reflects the detection of a shift in the narrative structure of the movie. A data-driven approach based on Hidden Markov modeling allowed us to detect event boundaries as shifts between stable patterns of brain EEG activity during encoding, and to identify their reactivation during a free recall task. These results provide the first neurophysiological underpinnings for how the memory systems segment a continuous long stream of experience into episodic events.SIGNIFICANCE OF STATEMENT Memory for specific episodic events are the building blocks of our autobiographical memory. However, it is still unclear how the memory systems structure the unfolding experience into discrete event units that can be understood and remembered at the long-term. Here, we show that the detection of context shifts, or event boundaries, during a 50 min movie viewing triggers the rapid memory reactivation of the just-encoded event to promote its successful encoding into long-term memory. By finding that memory reactivation, a neural mechanism critical for episodic memory formation and consolidation, takes place under these ecologically valid experimental circumstances, our results provide valuable insights into how the brain shapes the ongoing experience into episodic memories in the real-life.

        "Examining Constructs of Parental Reflective Motivation towards Reducing Unhealthy Food Provision to Young Children. Parents are an ideal target to reduce children's unhealthy food intake. Motivation is one component of behavior change; however, there is a paucity of research exploring parental motivation in unhealthy food provision. This study aimed to understand the relationships between, and relative importance of, constructs of parents' reflective motivation and children's intake of unhealthy foods. An online survey captured parent-rated reflective motivation constructs based on the health action process approach (HAPA) model, and children's intake of unhealthy food using the short food survey. The HAPA model includes constructs of self-efficacy, risk perception, outcome expectancies, intention, and planning. Structural equation modelling was used to examine relationships between constructs and the HAPA model in its structural form. Four-hundred and ninety-five parents of three to seven-year olds completed the study. Model fit statistics (X2 = 210.03, df = 83, p < 0.001; Comparative fit index (CFI) = 0.96; Tucker Lewis index (TLI) = 0.94) supported suitability of the HAPA model. The HAPA model explained 9.2% of the variance in children's unhealthy food intake. Constructs of self-efficacy (action to maintenance \u03b2 = 0.69; maintenance to recovery \u03b2 = 0.70; maintenance to planning \u03b2 = 0.82) were found to be the most important constructs for reducing children's unhealthy food intake, followed by planning (to unhealthy food intake \u03b2 = -0.32) and intention (to planning \u03b2 = 0.21). This study provides an initial insight into parental motivation and identifies primary intervention targets to enhance parental motivation to reduce unhealthy food provision, and subsequently children's unhealthy food intake.

        "Antipsychotic Use Among Youth in Foster Care Enrolled in a Specialized Managed Care Organization Intervention. OBJECTIVE: Little is known about whether interventions implemented by specialized Medicaid managed care organizations (MMCOs) contributed to recent stabilization of antipsychotic prescribing to youths in foster care. This study examined a multimodal antipsychotic intervention implemented by a specialized MMCO for youths in foster care with routine mental health screening, health passports, elective psychiatric consultation line, and retrospective drug utilization reviews to determine whether this multimodal intervention significantly reduced antipsychotic dispensing for youths with conditions without US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved indications. METHOD: Employing a difference-in-differences design, intervention effectiveness for youths in foster care (age 6-17 years) compared with adopted youthss was examined. Analyses were stratified by FDA-indicated conditions, other externalizing conditions, and other internalizing conditions. Outcomes included predicted annual probabilities of any antipsychotic dispensed, antipsychotic dispensed for\u00a0\u226590 consecutive days, and glucose and lipid testing. RESULTS: Intervention-enrolled youths with FDA-indicated conditions, relative to comparison youths, experienced a 0.6% reduction in any antipsychotic dispensed and 3.1% increase for\u00a0\u226590 consecutive days dispensed in the 2 years following implementation, both nonsignificant differences. Youths with other externalizing disorders experienced significant reductions, relative to comparison youths, in any antipsychotic dispensed (-6.3%, p\u00a0< .001) and in\u00a0\u226590 consecutive days dispensed (-5.5%, p\u00a0< .001). Youths with other internalizing disorders experienced a significant reduction, relative to comparison youths, in any antipsychotic dispensed (-7.6%, p\u00a0< .001) and in\u00a0\u226590 consecutive days dispensed (-5.1%, p\u00a0< .001). Glucose and lipid testing increased at statistically comparable rates for both groups. CONCLUSION: MMCO implementation significantly reduced antipsychotic medications without FDA-indicated conditions prescribed to youths, while not significantly affecting antipsychotic medications prescribed to youths with FDA-indicated conditions.

        "Direct healthcare costs of sedentary behaviour in the UK. BACKGROUND: Growing evidence indicates that prolonged sedentary behaviour increases the risk of several chronic health conditions and all-cause mortality. Sedentary behaviour is prevalent among adults in the UK. Quantifying the costs associated with sedentary behaviour is an important step in the development of public health policy. METHODS: National Health Service (NHS) costs associated with prolonged sedentary behaviour (\u22656\u2009hours/day) were estimated over a 1-year period in 2016-2017 costs. We calculated a population attributable fraction (PAF) for five health outcomes (type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease [CVD], colon cancer, endometrial cancer and lung cancer). Adjustments were made for potential double-counting due to comorbidities. We also calculated the avoidable deaths due to prolonged sedentary behaviour using the PAF for all-cause mortality. RESULTS: The total NHS costs attributable to prolonged sedentary behaviour in the UK in 2016-2017 were \u00a30.8\u2009billion, which included expenditure on CVD (\u00a3424\u2009million), type 2 diabetes (\u00a3281\u2009million), colon cancer (\u00a330\u2009million), lung cancer (\u00a319\u2009million) and endometrial cancer (\u00a37\u2009million). After adjustment for potential double-counting, the estimated total was \u00a30.7 billion. If prolonged sedentary behaviour was eliminated, 69\u2009276 UK deaths might have been avoided in 2016. CONCLUSIONS: In this conservative estimate of direct healthcare costs, prolonged sedentary behaviour causes a considerable burden to the NHS in the UK. This estimate may be used by decision makers when prioritising healthcare resources and investing in preventative public health programmes. ",
        "Association of Air Pollution Exposure With Psychotic Experiences During Adolescence. Importance: Urbanicity is a well-established risk factor for clinical (eg, schizophrenia) and subclinical (eg, hearing voices and paranoia) expressions of psychosis. To our knowledge, no studies have examined the association of air pollution with adolescent psychotic experiences, despite air pollution being a major environmental problem in cities. Objectives: To examine the association between exposure to air pollution and adolescent psychotic experiences and test whether exposure mediates the association between urban residency and adolescent psychotic experiences. Design, Setting, and Participants: The Environmental-Risk Longitudinal Twin Study is a population-based cohort study of 2232 children born during the period from January 1, 1994, through December 4, 1995, in England and Wales and followed up from birth through 18 years of age. The cohort represents the geographic and socioeconomic composition of UK households. Of the original cohort, 2066 (92.6%) participated in assessments at 18 years of age, of whom 2063 (99.9%) provided data on psychotic experiences. Generation of the pollution data was completed on October 4, 2017, and data were analyzed from May 4 to November 21, 2018. Exposures: High-resolution annualized estimates of exposure to 4 air pollutants-nitrogen dioxide (NO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and particulate matter with aerodynamic diameters of less than 2.5 (PM2.5) and less than 10 \u03bcm (PM10)-were modeled for 2012 and linked to the home addresses of the sample plus 2 commonly visited locations when the participants were 18 years old. Main Outcomes and Measures: At 18 years of age, participants were privately interviewed regarding adolescent psychotic experiences. Urbanicity was estimated using 2011 census data. Results: Among the 2063 participants who provided data on psychotic experiences, sex was evenly distributed (52.5% female). Six hundred twenty-three participants (30.2%) had at least 1 psychotic experience from 12 to 18 years of age. Psychotic experiences were significantly more common among adolescents with the highest (top quartile) level of annual exposure to NO2 (odds ratio [OR], 1.71; 95% CI, 1.28-2.28), NOx (OR, 1.72; 95% CI, 1.30-2.29), and PM2.5 (OR, 1.45; 95% CI, 1.11-1.90). Together NO2 and NOx statistically explained 60% of the association between urbanicity and adolescent psychotic experiences. No evidence of confounding by family socioeconomic status, family psychiatric history, maternal psychosis, childhood psychotic symptoms, adolescent smoking and substance dependence, or neighborhood socioeconomic status, crime, and social conditions occurred. Conclusions and Relevance: In this study, air pollution exposure-particularly NO2 and NOx-was associated with increased odds of adolescent psychotic experiences, which partly explained the association between urban residency and adolescent psychotic experiences. Biological (eg, neuroinflammation) and psychosocial (eg, stress) mechanisms are plausible. ",
        "Association Among Dietary Supplement Use, Nutrient Intake, and Mortality Among U.S. Adults: A Cohort Study. Background: The health benefits and risks of dietary supplement use are controversial. Objective: To evaluate the association among dietary supplement use, levels of nutrient intake from foods and supplements, and mortality among U.S. adults. Design: Prospective cohort study. Setting: NHANES (National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey) data from 1999 to 2010, linked to National Death Index mortality data. Participants: 30\u00a0899 U.S. adults aged 20 years or older who answered questions on dietary supplement use. Measurements: Dietary supplement use in the previous 30 days and nutrient intake from foods and supplements. Outcomes included mortality from all causes, cardiovascular disease (CVD), and cancer. Results: During a median follow-up of 6.1 years, 3613 deaths occurred, including 945 CVD deaths and 805 cancer deaths. Ever-use of dietary supplements was not associated with mortality outcomes. Adequate intake (at or above the Estimated Average Requirement or the Adequate Intake level) of vitamin A, vitamin K, magnesium, zinc, and copper was associated with reduced all-cause or CVD mortality, but the associations were restricted to nutrient intake from foods. Excess intake of calcium was associated with increased risk for cancer death (above vs. at or below the Tolerable Upper Intake Level: multivariable-adjusted rate ratio, 1.62 [95% CI, 1.07 to 2.45]; multivariable-adjusted rate difference, 1.7 [CI, -0.1 to 3.5] deaths per 1000 person-years), and the association seemed to be related to calcium intake from supplements (\u22651000 mg/d vs. no use: multivariable-adjusted rate ratio, 1.53 [CI, 1.04 to 2.25]; multivariable-adjusted rate difference, 1.5 [CI, -0.1 to 3.1] deaths per 1000 person-years) rather than foods. Limitations: Results from observational data may be affected by residual confounding. Reporting of dietary supplement use is subject to recall bias. Conclusion: Use of dietary supplements is not associated with mortality benefits among U.S. adults. Primary Funding Source: National Institutes of Health. ",
        "Does maternal age at retrieval influence the implantation potential of euploid blastocysts?. BACKGROUND: Age-related decline in reproductive potential is mainly due to the increased incidence of aneuploidy. Furthermore, 2 recent studies have shown that euploid embryos of older women may have a lower implantation potential compared to those of younger women, suggesting that aging might compromise embryos beyond their ploidy status. However, the inherent limitations of these studies preclude solid conclusions. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine whether maternal age at retrieval affects the implantation potential of euploid blastocysts. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort study that was conducted at an academic medical center. Patients who underwent frozen-thawed euploid embryo transfers (FET) between 2013 and 2016 were included. Cycles were divided into the following 5 age groups: <35, 35-37, 38-40, 41-42, and >42 years of age. Blastocysts were assessed before biopsy and assigned the following morphological grades: excellent (3-6AA), good (3-6AB, 3-6BA), average (2-6BB), and poor (3-6BC, 3-6CB, 3-6CC). The main outcome measures were implantation (IR) and live birth (LBR) rates. Both \u03c72 and Fisher exact tests were used to compare categorical variables. Odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated and controlled for confounders. RESULTS: A total of 785 FET cycles (870 blastocysts) were included. Excellent-quality blastocysts were associated with a significantly higher LBR compared with good-quality (78.8% vs 63.8%), average-quality (78.8% vs 54.2%), and poor-quality (78.8% vs 28.3%) counterparts. Poor-quality embryos yielded a higher spontaneous abortion (SAB) rate compared with average-, good-, and excellent-quality blastocysts (25.0%, 9.0%, 6.9%, and 2.4%, respectively). Embryos biopsied on day 5 had a significantly higher LBR compared with those biopsied on day 6 (60.0% vs 46.6%). The 5 age groups (<35, 35-37, 38-40, 41-42, and >42 years) had comparable IRs (56.5%, 52.9%, 55.4%, 59.1%, and 71.4%, respectively), LBRs (55.1%, 51.3%, 53.5%, 52.4%, and 61.9%, respectively), and SAB rates (8.8%, 7.9%, 8.3%, 14.3, and 13.3%, respectively). Older women had fewer euploid embryos, but they were of comparable morphology and developed at a similar rate to the blastocyst stage as compared to those of younger women. CONCLUSION: Maternal age at retrieval influences the number of euploid embryos; however, contrary to previously published studies, it does not affect their implantation potential. The morphodynamic characteristics of embryos, as reflected by blastocyst morphology and speed of development, are critical for selecting among euploid embryos. ",
        "Multivascular networks and functional intravascular topologies within biocompatible hydrogels. Solid organs transport fluids through distinct vascular networks that are biophysically and biochemically entangled, creating complex three-dimensional (3D) transport regimes that have remained difficult to produce and study. We establish intravascular and multivascular design freedoms with photopolymerizable hydrogels by using food dye additives as biocompatible yet potent photoabsorbers for projection stereolithography. We demonstrate monolithic transparent hydrogels, produced in minutes, comprising efficient intravascular 3D fluid mixers and functional bicuspid valves. We further elaborate entangled vascular networks from space-filling mathematical topologies and explore the oxygenation and flow of human red blood cells during tidal ventilation and distension of a proximate airway. In addition, we deploy structured biodegradable hydrogel carriers in a rodent model of chronic liver injury to highlight the potential translational utility of this materials innovation. ",
        "Measles outbreak in Gothenburg urban area, Sweden, 2017 to 2018: low viral load in breakthrough infections. In an outbreak of measles in Gothenburg, Sweden, breakthrough infections (i.e. infections in individuals with a history of vaccination) were common. The objective of this study was to compare measles RNA levels between na\u00efve (i.e. primary) and breakthrough infections. We also propose a fast provisional classification of breakthrough infections. Medical records were reviewed and real-time PCR-positive samples genotyped. Cases were classified as na\u00efve, breakthrough or vaccine infections. We compared clinical symptoms and measles RNA cycle threshold (Ct) values between breakthrough and na\u00efve infections. Sixteen of 28 confirmed cases of measles in this outbreak were breakthrough infections. A fast provisional classification, based on previous history of measles vaccination and detectable levels of measles IgG in acute serum, correctly identified 14 of the 16 breakthrough infections, confirmed by IgG avidity testing. Measles viral load was significantly lower in nasopharyngeal samples from individuals with breakthrough compared with na\u00efve infections (median Ct-values: 32 and 19, respectively, p\u2009<\u20090.0001). No onward transmission from breakthrough infections was identified. Our results indicate that a high risk of onward transmission is limited to na\u00efve infections. We propose a fast provisional classification of breakthrough measles that can guide contact tracing in outbreak settings. ",
        "Novel Metabolites Are Associated With Augmentation Index and Pulse Wave Velocity: Findings From the Bogalusa Heart Study. BACKGROUND: Metabolomics study may help identify novel mechanisms underlying arterial stiffening. METHODS: We performed untargeted metabolomics profiling among 1,239 participants of the Bogalusa Heart Study. After quality control, 1,202 metabolites were evaluated for associations with augmentation index (AI) and pulse wave velocity (PWV), using multivariate linear regression adjusting for age, sex, race, education, smoking, drinking, body weight, body height, physical activity, and estimated glomerular filtration rate. Heart rate, blood pressure and antihypertensive medication usage, lipids, and fasting glucose were sequentially adjusted in the sensitivity analyses for significant metabolites. Weighted correlation network analysis was applied to build metabolite networks. RESULTS: Six novel metabolites were negatively associated with AI, of which, 3-methyl-2-oxobutyrate had the lowest P value and the largest effect size (\u03b2 = -6.67, P = 5.99 \u00d7 10-6). Heart rate contributed to a large proportion (25%-58%) of the association for each metabolite. Twenty-one novel metabolites were identified for PWV, of which, fructose (\u03b2 = 0.61, P = 6.18 \u00d7 10-10) was most significant, and histidine had the largest effect size (\u03b2 = -1.09, P = 2.51 \u00d7 10-7). Blood pressure played a major contribution (9%-54%) to the association for each metabolite. Furthermore, 16 metabolites were associated with arterial stiffness independent of traditional risk factors. Network analysis identified 2 modules associated with both AI and PWV (P < 8.00 \u00d7 10-4). One was composed of metabolites from the glycerolipids synthesis and recycling pathway, and the other was involved in valine, leucine, and isoleucine metabolism. One module related to sphingomyelin metabolism was associated with PWV only (P = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: This study has identified novel and important metabolites and metabolic networks associated with arterial stiffness. ",
        "Maternal vitamin D and E intakes in pregnancy and asthma to age 15 years: A cohort study. This study investigated whether the previously reported associations in this birth cohort between maternal vitamin D and E intakes during pregnancy and childhood wheeze/asthma outcomes at age 5 and 10 years are still evident at age 15 years. In a prospective study of 1924 children recruited in utero, maternal vitamin D and E intakes during pregnancy were assessed by food frequency questionnaire and the children completed raespiratory questionnaire at age 15 years. Treatment for asthma at age 15 was also ascertained using healthcare data. Maternal vitamin D and E intakes were also related to combined childhood asthma data collected at 1, 2, 5, 10, and 15 years of age. Symptom data were available for 747 (39%) 15-year olds and healthcare data for 1689 (88%). There were no associations between maternal vitamin D and E intakes and childhood wheeze and asthma at age 15. Analysis of combined data collected between 1 and 15 years of age demonstrated that higher maternal vitamin D and E intakes during pregnancy were associated with a reduced likelihood of being diagnosed with asthma in the first 15 years: hazard ratio (95%CI) per quartile increase in vitamin intake of 0.87 (0.78,0.98) and 0.88 (0.78,0.98), respectively. Lower maternal vitamin D and E intakes during pregnancy are associated with increased risk of children wheezing and being diagnosed with asthma in the first 10 years but not after puberty, suggesting that post-natal exposures predominate in the etiology of incident asthma as children transition through puberty into adulthood.

        "Encapsulation with an interfacial liquid layer: Robust and efficient liquid-liquid wrapping. HYPOTHESIS: We developed an impact driven liquid-based encapsulation method by utilizing the fundamental thermodynamic tendency of a suitable three-liquid combination towards formation of a core-shell structure. EXPERIMENTS: Stable wrapping is achieved by impinging a core drop from a vertical separation on an interfacial liquid film floating on a host liquid bath. The resulting interfacial dynamics is captured using a high-speed camera. Several combinations of impact height and interfacial film thickness are investigated for a quantitative description of the phenomena. FINDINGS: The stability and integrity of the liquid encapsulating layer are confirmed both experimentally (by analyzing the under-liquid wetting signature) and theoretically (by equilibrium thermodynamic analysis). Effect of viscous dissipation on the dynamics is explained and a consequent theoretical threshold for minimum allowable drop size is provided. A non-dimensional experimental regime is also constructed for successful encapsulation in terms of impact kinetic energy and interfacial layer thickness. Additionally, the encapsulating layer is shown to protect the core drop even when the core and host liquids are miscible. The demonstrated method is simple to implement yet robust, offers flexibility regarding varying both the size and the material properties of the core and shell liquids and consistently produces stable monodispersed encapsulated drops in an ultrafast manner.

        "Cannabinoid Signaling in the Skin: Therapeutic Potential of the \"C(ut)annabinoid\" System. The endocannabinoid system (ECS) has lately been proven to be an important, multifaceted homeostatic regulator, which influences a wide-variety of physiological processes all over the body. Its members, the endocannabinoids (eCBs; e.g., anandamide), the eCB-responsive receptors (e.g., CB\u2081, CB\u2082), as well as the complex enzyme and transporter apparatus involved in the metabolism of the ligands were shown to be expressed in several tissues, including the skin. Although the best studied functions over the ECS are related to the central nervous system and to immune processes, experimental efforts over the last two decades have unambiguously confirmed that cutaneous cannabinoid (\"c[ut]annabinoid\") signaling is deeply involved in the maintenance of skin homeostasis, barrier formation and regeneration, and its dysregulation was implicated to contribute to several highly prevalent diseases and disorders, e.g., atopic dermatitis, psoriasis, scleroderma, acne, hair growth and pigmentation disorders, keratin diseases, various tumors, and itch. The current review aims to give an overview of the available skin-relevant endo- and phytocannabinoid literature with a special emphasis on the putative translational potential, and to highlight promising future research directions as well as existing challenges.

        "Impact of weather and climate change with indoor and outdoor air quality in asthma: A Work Group Report of the AAAAI Environmental Exposure and Respiratory Health Committee. Weather and climate change are constant and ever-changing processes that affect allergy and asthma. The purpose of this report is to provide information since the last climate change review with a focus on asthmatic disease. PubMed and Internet searches for topics included climate and weather change, air pollution, particulates, greenhouse gasses, traffic, insect habitat, and mitigation in addition to references contributed by the individual authors. Changes in patterns of outdoor aeroallergens caused by increasing temperatures and amounts of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere are major factors linked to increased duration of pollen seasons, increased pollen production, and possibly increased allergenicity of pollen. Indoor air pollution threats anticipated from climate changes include microbial and mold growth secondary to flooding, resulting in displacement of persons and need for respiratory protection of exposed workers. Air pollution from indoor burning of mosquito repellants is a potential anticipatory result of an increase in habitat regions. Air pollution from fossil fuel burning and traffic-related emissions can alter respiratory defense mechanisms and work synergistically with specific allergens to enhance immunogenicity to worsen asthma in susceptible subjects. Community efforts can significantly reduce air pollution, thereby reducing greenhouse gas emission and improving air quality. The allergist's approach to weather pattern changes should be integrated and anticipatory to protect at-risk patients. ",
        "Genomic correlates of clinical outcome in advanced prostate cancer. Heterogeneity in the genomic landscape of metastatic prostate cancer has become apparent through several comprehensive profiling efforts, but little is known about the impact of this heterogeneity on clinical outcome. Here, we report comprehensive genomic and transcriptomic analysis of 429 patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) linked with longitudinal clinical outcomes, integrating findings from whole-exome, transcriptome, and histologic analysis. For 128 patients treated with a first-line next-generation androgen receptor signaling inhibitor (ARSI; abiraterone or enzalutamide), we examined the association of 18 recurrent DNA- and RNA-based genomic alterations, including androgen receptor (AR) variant expression, AR transcriptional output, and neuroendocrine expression signatures, with clinical outcomes. Of these, only RB1 alteration was significantly associated with poor survival, whereas alterations in RB1, AR, and TP53 were associated with shorter time on treatment with an ARSI. This large analysis integrating mCRPC genomics with histology and clinical outcomes identifies RB1 genomic alteration as a potent predictor of poor outcome, and is a community resource for further interrogation of clinical and molecular associations.

        "A Deep Learning Mammography-based Model for Improved Breast Cancer Risk Prediction. Background Mammographic density improves the accuracy of breast cancer risk models. However, the use of breast density is limited by subjective assessment, variation across radiologists, and restricted data. A mammography-based deep learning (DL) model may provide more accurate risk prediction. Purpose To develop a mammography-based DL breast cancer risk model that is more accurate than established clinical breast cancer risk models. Materials and Methods This retrospective study included 88 994 consecutive screening mammograms in 39 571 women between January 1, 2009, and December 31, 2012. For each patient, all examinations were assigned to either training, validation, or test sets, resulting in 71 689, 8554, and 8751 examinations, respectively. Cancer outcomes were obtained through linkage to a regional tumor registry. By using risk factor information from patient questionnaires and electronic medical records review, three models were developed to assess breast cancer risk within 5 years: a risk-factor-based logistic regression model (RF-LR) that used traditional risk factors, a DL model (image-only DL) that used mammograms alone, and a hybrid DL model that used both traditional risk factors and mammograms. Comparisons were made to an established breast cancer risk model that included breast density (Tyrer-Cuzick model, version 8 [TC]). Model performance was compared by using areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUCs) with DeLong test (P < .05). Results The test set included 3937 women, aged 56.20 years \u00b1 10.04. Hybrid DL and image-only DL showed AUCs of 0.70 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.66, 0.75) and 0.68 (95% CI: 0.64, 0.73), respectively. RF-LR and TC showed AUCs of 0.67 (95% CI: 0.62, 0.72) and 0.62 (95% CI: 0.57, 0.66), respectively. Hybrid DL showed a significantly higher AUC (0.70) than TC (0.62; P < .001) and RF-LR (0.67; P = .01). Conclusion Deep learning models that use full-field mammograms yield substantially improved risk discrimination compared with the Tyrer-Cuzick (version 8) model. \u00a9 RSNA, 2019 Online supplemental material is available for this article.

        "Gamma Entrainment Binds Higher-Order Brain Regions and Offers Neuroprotection. Neuronal and synaptic loss is characteristic in many neurodegenerative diseases, such as frontotemporal dementia and Alzheimer's disease. Recently, we showed that inducing gamma oscillations with visual stimulation (gamma entrainment using sensory stimuli, or GENUS) reduced amyloid plaques and phosphorylated tau in multiple mouse models. Whether GENUS can affect neurodegeneration or cognitive performance remains unknown. Here, we demonstrate that GENUS can entrain gamma oscillations in the visual cortex, hippocampus, and prefrontal cortex in Tau P301S and CK-p25 mouse models of neurodegeneration. Tau P301S and CK-p25 mice subjected to chronic, daily GENUS from the early stages of neurodegeneration showed a preservation of neuronal and synaptic density across multiple brain areas and modified cognitive performance. Our transcriptomic and phosphoproteomic data suggest that chronic GENUS shifts neurons to a less degenerative state, improving synaptic function, enhancing neuroprotective factors, and reducing DNA damage in neurons while also reducing inflammatory response in microglia.

        "Bladder drug mirabegron exacerbates atherosclerosis through activation of brown fat-mediated lipolysis. Mirabegron (Myrbetriq) is a \u03b23-adrenoreceptor agonist approved for treating overactive bladder syndrome in human patients. This drug can activate brown adipose tissue (BAT) in adult humans and rodents through the \u03b23-adrenoreceptor-mediated sympathetic activation. However, the effect of the mirabegron, approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, on atherosclerosis-related cardiovascular disease is unknown. Here, we show that the clinical dose of mirabegron-induced BAT activation and browning of white adipose tissue (WAT) exacerbate atherosclerotic plaque development. In apolipoprotein E-/- (ApoE-/-) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor-/- (Ldlr-/-) mice, oral administration of clinically relevant doses of mirabegron markedly accelerates atherosclerotic plaque growth and instability by a mechanism of increasing plasma levels of both LDL-cholesterol and very LDL-cholesterol remnants. Stimulation of atherosclerotic plaque development by mirabegron is dependent on thermogenesis-triggered lipolysis. Genetic deletion of the critical thermogenesis-dependent protein, uncoupling protein 1, completely abrogates the mirabegron-induced atherosclerosis. Together, our findings suggest that mirabegron may trigger cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases in patients who suffer from atherosclerosis. ",
        "Low ambient humidity impairs barrier function and innate resistance against influenza infection. In the temperate regions, seasonal influenza virus outbreaks correlate closely with decreases in humidity. While low ambient humidity is known to enhance viral transmission, its impact on host response to influenza virus infection and disease outcome remains unclear. Here, we showed that housing Mx1 congenic mice in low relative humidity makes mice more susceptible to severe disease following respiratory challenge with influenza A virus. We find that inhalation of dry air impairs mucociliary clearance, innate antiviral defense, and tissue repair. Moreover, disease exacerbated by low relative humidity was ameliorated in caspase-1/11-deficient Mx1 mice, independent of viral burden. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that induction of IFN-stimulated genes in response to viral infection was diminished in multiple cell types in the lung of mice housed in low humidity condition. These results indicate that exposure to dry air impairs host defense against influenza infection, reduces tissue repair, and inflicts caspase-dependent disease pathology. ",
        "Non-invasive, Brain-controlled Functional Electrical Stimulation for Locomotion Rehabilitation in Individuals with Paraplegia. Spinal cord injury (SCI) impairs the flow of sensory and motor signals between the brain and the areas of the body located below the lesion level. Here, we describe a neurorehabilitation setup combining several approaches that were shown to have a positive effect in patients with SCI: gait training by means of non-invasive, surface functional electrical stimulation (sFES) of the lower-limbs, proprioceptive and tactile feedback, balance control through overground walking and cue-based decoding of cortical motor commands using a brain-machine interface (BMI). The central component of this new approach was the development of a novel muscle stimulation paradigm for step generation using 16 sFES channels taking all sub-phases of physiological gait into account. We also developed a new BMI protocol to identify left and right leg motor imagery that was used to trigger an sFES-generated step movement. Our system was tested and validated with two patients with chronic paraplegia. These patients were able to walk safely with 65-70% body weight support, accumulating a total of 4,580 steps with this setup. We observed cardiovascular improvements and less dependency on walking assistance, but also partial neurological recovery in both patients, with substantial rates of motor improvement for one of them.

        "Targeted and Persistent 8-Oxoguanine Base Damage at Telomeres Promotes Telomere Loss and Crisis. Telomeres are essential for genome stability. Oxidative stress caused by excess reactive oxygen species (ROS) accelerates telomere shortening. Although telomeres are hypersensitive to ROS-mediated 8-oxoguanine (8-oxoG) formation, the biological effect of this common lesion at telomeres is poorly understood because ROS have pleiotropic effects. Here we developed a chemoptogenetic tool that selectively produces 8-oxoG only at telomeres. Acute telomeric 8-oxoG formation increased telomere fragility in cells lacking OGG1, the enzyme that removes 8-oxoG, but did not compromise cell survival. However, chronic telomeric 8-oxoG induction over time shortens telomeres and impairs cell growth. Accumulation of telomeric 8-oxoG in chronically exposed OGG1-deficient cells triggers replication stress, as evidenced by mitotic DNA synthesis at telomeres, and significantly increases telomere losses. These losses generate chromosome fusions, leading to chromatin bridges and micronucleus formation upon cell division. By confining base damage to the telomeres, we show that telomeric 8-oxoG accumulation directly drives telomere crisis. ",
        "Association of Unrecognized Obstructive Sleep Apnea With Postoperative Cardiovascular Events in Patients Undergoing Major Noncardiac Surgery. Importance: Unrecognized obstructive sleep apnea increases cardiovascular risks in the general population, but whether obstructive sleep apnea poses a similar risk in the perioperative period remains uncertain. Objectives: To determine the association between obstructive sleep apnea and 30-day risk of cardiovascular complications after major noncardiac surgery. Design, Setting, and Participants: Prospective cohort study involving adult at-risk patients without prior diagnosis of sleep apnea and undergoing major noncardiac surgery from 8 hospitals in 5 countries between January 2012 and July 2017, with follow-up until August 2017. Postoperative monitoring included nocturnal pulse oximetry and measurement of cardiac troponin concentrations. Exposures: Obstructive sleep apnea was classified as mild (respiratory event index [REI] 5-14.9 events/h), moderate (REI 15-30), and severe (REI >30), based on preoperative portable sleep monitoring. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was a composite of myocardial injury, cardiac death, heart failure, thromboembolism, atrial fibrillation, and stroke within 30 days of surgery. Proportional-hazards analysis was used to determine the association between obstructive sleep apnea and postoperative cardiovascular complications. Results: Among a total of 1364 patients recruited for the study, 1218 patients (mean age, 67 [SD, 9] years; 40.2% women) were included in the analyses. At 30 days after surgery, rates of the primary outcome were 30.1% (41/136) for patients with severe OSA, 22.1% (52/235) for patients with moderate OSA, 19.0% (86/452) for patients with mild OSA, and 14.2% (56/395) for patients with no OSA. OSA was associated with higher risk for the primary outcome (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 1.49 [95% CI, 1.19-2.01]; P\u2009=\u2009.01); however, the association was significant only among patients with severe OSA (adjusted HR, 2.23 [95% CI, 1.49-3.34]; P\u2009=\u2009.001) and not among those with moderate OSA (adjusted HR, 1.47 [95% CI, 0.98-2.09]; P\u2009=\u2009.07) or mild OSA (adjusted HR, 1.36 [95% CI, 0.97-1.91]; P\u2009=\u2009.08) (P\u2009=\u2009.01 for interaction). The mean cumulative duration of oxyhemoglobin desaturation less than 80% during the first 3 postoperative nights in patients with cardiovascular complications (23.1 [95% CI, 15.5-27.7] minutes) was longer than in those without (10.2 [95% CI, 7.8-10.9] minutes) (P\u2009<\u2009.001). No significant interaction effects on perioperative outcomes were observed with type of anesthesia, use of postoperative opioids, and supplemental oxygen therapy. Conclusions and Relevance: Among at-risk adults undergoing major noncardiac surgery, unrecognized severe obstructive sleep apnea was significantly associated with increased risk of 30-day postoperative cardiovascular complications. Further research would be needed to assess whether interventions can modify this risk. ",
        "Graded regulation of cellular quiescence depth between proliferation and senescence by a lysosomal dimmer switch. The reactivation of quiescent cells to proliferate is fundamental to tissue repair and homeostasis in the body. Often referred to as the G0 state, quiescence is, however, not a uniform state but with graded depth. Shallow quiescent cells exhibit a higher tendency to revert to proliferation than deep quiescent cells, while deep quiescent cells are still fully reversible under physiological conditions, distinct from senescent cells. Cellular mechanisms underlying the control of quiescence depth and the connection between quiescence and senescence are poorly characterized, representing a missing link in our understanding of tissue homeostasis and regeneration. Here we measured transcriptome changes as rat embryonic fibroblasts moved from shallow to deep quiescence over time in the absence of growth signals. We found that lysosomal gene expression was significantly up-regulated in deep quiescence, and partially compensated for gradually reduced autophagy flux. Reducing lysosomal function drove cells progressively deeper into quiescence and eventually into a senescence-like irreversibly arrested state; increasing lysosomal function, by lowering oxidative stress, progressively pushed cells into shallower quiescence. That is, lysosomal function modulates graded quiescence depth between proliferation and senescence as a dimmer switch. Finally, we found that a gene-expression signature developed by comparing deep and shallow quiescence in fibroblasts can correctly classify a wide array of senescent and aging cell types in vitro and in vivo, suggesting that while quiescence is generally considered to protect cells from irreversible arrest of senescence, quiescence deepening likely represents a common transition path from cell proliferation to senescence, related to aging.

        "Prophylactic antibiotics in the prevention of infection after operative vaginal delivery (ANODE): a multicentre randomised controlled trial. BACKGROUND: Risk factors for maternal infection are clearly recognised, including caesarean section and operative vaginal birth. Antibiotic prophylaxis at caesarean section is widely recommended because there is clear systematic review evidence that it reduces incidence of maternal infection. Current WHO guidelines do not recommend routine antibiotic prophylaxis for women undergoing operative vaginal birth because of insufficient evidence of effectiveness. We aimed to investigate whether antibiotic prophylaxis prevented maternal infection after operative vaginal birth. METHODS: In a blinded, randomised controlled trial done at 27 UK obstetric units, women (aged \u226516 years) were allocated to receive a single dose of intravenous amoxicillin and clavulanic acid or placebo (saline) following operative vaginal birth at 36 weeks gestation or later. The primary outcome was confirmed or suspected maternal infection within 6 weeks of delivery defined by a new prescription of antibiotics for specific indications, confirmed systemic infection on culture, or endometritis. We did an intention-to-treat analysis. This trial is registered with ISRCTN, number 11166984, and is closed to accrual. FINDINGS: Between March 13, 2016, and June 13, 2018, 3427 women were randomly assigned to treatment: 1719 to amoxicillin and clavulanic acid, and 1708 to placebo. Seven women withdrew, leaving 1715 in the amoxicillin and clavulanic acid group and 1705 in the placebo groups. Primary outcome data were missing for 195 (6%) women. Significantly fewer women allocated to amoxicillin and clavulanic acid had a confirmed or suspected infection (180 [11%] of 1619) than women allocated to placebo (306 [19%] of 1606; risk ratio 0\u00b758, 95% CI 0\u00b749-0\u00b769; p<0\u00b70001). One woman in the placebo group reported a skin rash and two women in the amoxicillin and clavulanic acid reported other allergic reactions, one of which was reported as a serious adverse event. Two other serious adverse events were reported, neither was considered causally related to the treatment. INTERPRETATION: This trial shows benefit of a single dose of prophylactic antibiotic after operative vaginal birth and guidance from WHO and other national organisations should be changed to reflect this.

        "Slowing is slowing: Delayed neural responses to words are linked to abnormally slow resting state activity in primary progressive aphasia. Neurodegenerative disorders are often characterized by neuronal \"slowing,\" which may be assessed in different ways. In the present study, we examined the latency of neural responses to linguistic stimuli in participants diagnosed with primary progressive aphasia (PPA), as well as changes in the power spectra of resting state activity, both measured with MEG. Compared to both age-matched and younger controls, patients with PPA showed a delayed latency of 8-30\u202fHz event-related desynchronization (ERD) in response to semantic anomalies. In addition, resting-state MEG revealed increased power in the lower frequency delta and theta bands, but decreased activity in the higher alpha and beta bands. The task-induced and spontaneous measures of neural dynamics were related, such that increased peak latencies in response to words were correlated with a shift of spontaneous oscillatory dynamics towards lower frequencies. In contrast, older controls showed similar task related ERD latencies as younger controls, but also \"speeding\" of spontaneous activity, i.e. a shift towards faster frequencies. In PPA patients both increased peak latencies on task and increased slow oscillations at rest were associated with less accurate performance on the language task and poorer performance on offline cognitive measures, beyond variance accounted for by structural atrophy. A mediation analysis indicated that increased theta power accounted for the relationship between delayed electrophysiological responses and reduced accuracy in PPA patients. These results indicate that the neuropathological changes in PPA result in slowing of both task-related and spontaneous neuronal activity, linked to functional decline, whereas the speeding of spontaneous activity in healthy aging seems to have a protective or compensatory effect.

        "Singlet molecular oxygen regulates vascular tone and blood pressure in inflammation. Singlet molecular oxygen (1O2) has well-established roles in photosynthetic plants, bacteria and fungi1-3, but not in mammals. Chemically generated 1O2 oxidizes the amino acid tryptophan to precursors of a key metabolite called N-formylkynurenine4, whereas enzymatic oxidation of tryptophan to N-formylkynurenine is catalysed by a family of dioxygenases, including indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 15. Under inflammatory conditions, this haem-containing enzyme is expressed in arterial endothelial cells, where it contributes to the regulation of blood pressure6. However, whether indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 forms 1O2 and whether this contributes to blood pressure control have remained unknown. Here we show that arterial indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 regulates blood pressure via formation of 1O2. We observed that in the presence of hydrogen peroxide, the enzyme generates 1O2 and that this is associated with the stereoselective oxidation of L-tryptophan to a tricyclic hydroperoxide via a previously unrecognized oxidative activation of the dioxygenase activity. The tryptophan-derived hydroperoxide acts in vivo as a signalling molecule, inducing arterial relaxation and decreasing blood pressure; this activity is dependent on Cys42 of protein kinase G1\u03b1. Our findings demonstrate a pathophysiological role for 1O2 in mammals through formation of an amino\u00a0acid-derived hydroperoxide that regulates vascular tone and blood pressure under inflammatory conditions.

        "A saturated reaction in repressor synthesis creates a daytime dead zone in circadian clocks. Negative feedback loops (NFLs) for circadian clocks include light-responsive reactions that allow the clocks to shift their phase depending on the timing of light signals. Phase response curves (PRCs) for light signals in various organisms include a time interval called a dead zone where light signals cause no phase shift during daytime. Although the importance of the dead zone for robust light entrainment is known, how the dead zone arises from the biochemical reactions in an NFL underlying circadian gene expression rhythms remains unclear. In addition, the observation that the light-responsive reactions in the NFL vary between organisms raises the question as to whether the mechanism for dead zone formation is common or distinct between different organisms. Here we reveal by mathematical modeling that the saturation of a biochemical reaction in repressor synthesis in an NFL is a common mechanism of daytime dead zone generation. If light signals increase the degradation of a repressor protein, as in Drosophila, the saturation of repressor mRNA transcription nullifies the effect of light signals, generating a dead zone. In contrast, if light signals induce the transcription of repressor mRNA, as in mammals, the saturation of repressor translation can generate a dead zone by cancelling the influence of excess amount of mRNA induced by light signals. Each of these saturated reactions is located next to the light-responsive reaction in the NFL, suggesting a design principle for daytime dead zone generation. ",
        "Same-Day vs Different-Day Elective Upper and Lower Endoscopic Procedures by Setting. Importance: Performing elective upper and lower endoscopic procedures on the same day is a patient-centered and less costly approach than a 2-stage approach performed on different days, when clinically appropriate. Whether this practice pattern varies based on practice setting has not been studied. Objectives: To estimate the rate of different-day upper and lower endoscopic procedures in 3 types of outpatient settings and investigate the factors associated with the performance of these procedures on different days. Design, Setting, and Participants: A retrospective analysis was conducted of Medicare claims between January 1, 2011, and June 30, 2018, for Medicare beneficiaries who underwent a pair of upper and lower endoscopic procedures performed within 90 days of each other at hospital outpatient departments (HOPDs), freestanding ambulatory surgery centers (ASCs), and physician offices. Main Outcomes and Measures: Undergoing an upper and a lower endoscopic procedure on different days, adjusted for patient characteristics (age, sex, race/ethnicity, residence location and region, comorbidity, and procedure indication) and physician characteristics (sex, years in practice, procedure volume, and primary specialty). Adjusted odds ratios (aORs) and 95% CIs were calculated. Results: A total of 4\u202f028\u202f587 procedure pairs were identified, of which 52.5% were performed in HOPDs, 43.3% in ASCs, and 4.2% in physician offices. The rate of different-day procedures was 13.6% in HOPDs, 22.2% in ASCs, and 47.7% in physician offices. For the 7564 physicians who practiced at both HOPDs and ASCs, their different-day procedure rate changed from 14.1% at HOPDs to 19.4% at ASCs. For the 993 physicians who practiced at both HOPDs and physician offices, their different-day procedure rate changed from 15.8% at HOPDs to 37.4% at physician offices. Patients were more likely to undergo different-day procedures at physician offices and ASCs compared with HOPDs, even after adjusting for patient and physician characteristics (physician office vs HOPD: aOR, 2.02; 95% CI, 1.85-2.20; ASC vs HOPD: aOR, 1.27; 95% CI, 1.23-1.32). Older age (85-94 years vs 65-74 years: aOR, 1.10; 95% CI, 1.08-1.11; 95 years or older vs 65-74 years: aOR, 1.14; 95% CI, 1.03-1.26), black and Hispanic race/ethnicity (black: aOR, 1.15; 95% CI, 1.12-1.17; Hispanic: aOR, 1.12; 95% CI, 1.10-1.14), and residing in the Northeast region (adjusted OR, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.28-1.36) were risk factors for undergoing different-day procedures. Micropolitan location (aOR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.92-0.96) and rural location (aOR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.89-0.93), more comorbidities (\u22655: aOR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.74-0.76), physician's fewer years in practice (aOR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.81-0.87), physician's higher procedure volume (aOR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.62-0.68), and physician's specialty of general surgery (aOR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.80-0.91) were protective factors. Conclusions and Relevance: Physician offices and ASCs had much higher different-day procedure rates compared with HOPDs. This disparity may represent an opportunity for quality improvement and financial savings for common endoscopic procedures. ",
        "Functional connectomics of affective and psychotic pathology. Converging evidence indicates that groups of patients with nominally distinct psychiatric diagnoses are not separated by sharp or discontinuous neurobiological boundaries. In healthy populations, individual differences in behavior are reflected in variability across the collective set of functional brain connections (functional connectome). These data suggest that the spectra of transdiagnostic symptom profiles observed in psychiatric patients may map onto detectable patterns of network function. To examine the manner through which neurobiological variation might underlie clinical presentation, we obtained fMRI data from over 1,000 individuals, including 210 diagnosed with a primary psychotic disorder or affective psychosis (bipolar disorder with psychosis and schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder), 192 presenting with a primary affective disorder without psychosis (unipolar depression, bipolar disorder without psychosis), and 608 demographically matched healthy comparison participants recruited through a large-scale study of brain imaging and genetics. Here, we examine variation in functional connectomes across psychiatric diagnoses, finding striking evidence for disease connectomic \"fingerprints\" that are commonly disrupted across distinct forms of pathology and appear to scale as a function of illness severity. The presence of affective and psychotic illnesses was associated with graded disruptions in frontoparietal network connectivity (encompassing aspects of dorsolateral prefrontal, dorsomedial prefrontal, lateral parietal, and posterior temporal cortices). Conversely, other properties of network connectivity, including default network integrity, were preferentially disrupted in patients with psychotic illness, but not patients without psychotic symptoms. This work allows us to establish key biological and clinical features of the functional connectomes of severe mental disease. ",
        "Television use and its effects on sleep in early childhood. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to investigate the impacts of television (TV) viewing and bedroom TV presence on young children's sleep as measured by actigraphy. DESIGN: Analyses of covariance were run to examine differences in sleep duration and quality among children based on the presence of TVs in their bedrooms and the amount of TV watched. SETTING: Recruited in preschools in Massachusetts; recorded ambulatory (in home, environs). PARTICIPANTS: Participants were 470 children between 33 and 71\u202fmonths of age (M\u202f=\u202f51.02). MEASUREMENTS: Children were instructed to wear an actigraph watch for 16 days. Caregivers reported demographic information, completed behavior questionnaires, and answered questions regarding their child's TV use. RESULTS: Children who watched more TV and had TVs in their bedroom displayed significantly shorter sleep duration and worse sleep, but they also napped significantly longer in the daytime. Nonetheless, total 24-hour sleep was shorter for those who watched more TV and had TVs in their bedroom compared to those who did not have TVs in their bedrooms or watch TV frequently. Children who had TVs in their bedrooms watched TV later at night, watched more adult TV programs, and had higher negative affect than children without TVs in their bedrooms. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that TV use in young children does impact sleep duration and quality as measured by actigraphy, and daytime napping does not offset these negative impacts. ",
        "Evaluating cell lines as models for metastatic breast cancer through integrative analysis of genomic data. Cell lines are widely-used models to study metastatic cancer although the extent to which they recapitulate the disease in patients remains unknown. The recent accumulation of genomic data provides an unprecedented opportunity to evaluate the utility of them for metastatic cancer research. Here, we reveal substantial genomic differences between breast cancer cell lines and metastatic breast cancer patient samples. We also identify cell lines that more closely resemble the different subtypes of metastatic breast cancer seen in the clinic and show that surprisingly, MDA-MB-231 cells bear little genomic similarities to basal-like metastatic breast cancer patient samples. Further comparison suggests that organoids more closely resemble the transcriptome of metastatic breast cancer samples compared to cell lines. Our work provides a guide for cell line selection in the context of breast cancer metastasis and highlights the potential of organoids in these studies. ",
        "Measurement of external food cue responsiveness in preschool-age children: Preliminary evidence for the use of the external food cue responsiveness scale. BACKGROUND: Conditioned eating in response to external food cues may contribute to obesity risk in young children. OBJECTIVES: To develop a brief, parent-reported scale to measure external food cue responsiveness for preschool-age children. METHODS: Focus groups with parents of preschool-age children were conducted to create an initial pool of items reflecting children's behavioral responses to external food cues. Items were included in a nationally-distributed online survey of parents of preschool-age children (n\u202f=\u202f456). Factor analysis was used to reduce the initial item pool, the scale's psychometric properties were assessed, and scores were correlated with reported snacking behaviors. RESULTS: Nine items met inclusion criteria in the final scale, which had high internal consistency (alpha\u202f=\u202f0.86). Final scores were the mean across the nine items. External food cue responsiveness was greater among children with, versus without, usual TV advertisement exposure. Furthermore, greater external food cue responsiveness mediated the relationship between children's usual TV advertisement exposure and snacking during TV viewing. Findings remained statistically significant when adjusted for food responsiveness as measured with the Child Eating Behavior Questionnaire. CONCLUSIONS: Findings provide preliminary evidence that external food cue responsiveness is measurable by parental report in preschool-age children. ",
        "Proportion of cancer cases and deaths attributable to lifestyle risk factors in Brazil. BACKGROUND: Lifestyle risk factors (tobacco smoking, alcohol consumption, overweight and obesity, unhealthy diet, and lack of physical activity) have been associated with increased risk of at least 20 types of cancer. We estimated the proportion of cancer cases and deaths that could be potentially avoided by eliminating or reducing lifestyle risk factors in Brazil. METHODS: We obtained the distribution of lifestyle risk factors by sex and age groups from recent representative health surveys in Brazil; relative risks from pooled analyses of prospective studies and meta-analyses; and cancer cases and deaths in 2012 from GLOBOCAN. RESULTS: We found that 26.5% (114,497 cases) of all cancer cases and 33.6% (63,371 deaths) of all cancer deaths could be potentially avoided by eliminating lifestyle risk factors in Brazil. Plausible reductions in these exposures based on policy targets and cancer prevention recommendations could have potentially avoided 4.5% (19,731 cases) and 6.1% (11,480 deaths) of all cancer cases and deaths, respectively. Tobacco smoking accounted for most of the preventable cancer cases and deaths, followed by high body mass index and alcohol consumption. Larynx, lung, oropharynx, esophagus and colorectum cancer cases and deaths could be at least halved by eliminating these lifestyle risk factors. CONCLUSION: Findings from this study may be useful to inform strategies for cancer prevention and control across Brazil. ",
        "Genetic regulatory variation in populations informs transcriptome analysis in rare disease. Transcriptome data can facilitate the interpretation of the effects of rare genetic variants. Here, we introduce ANEVA (analysis of expression variation) to quantify genetic variation in gene dosage from allelic expression (AE) data in a population. Application of ANEVA to the Genotype-Tissues Expression (GTEx) data showed that this variance estimate is robust and correlated with selective constraint in a gene. Using these variance estimates in a dosage outlier test (ANEVA-DOT) applied to AE data from 70 Mendelian muscular disease patients showed accuracy in detecting genes with pathogenic variants in previously resolved cases and led to one confirmed and several potential new diagnoses. Using our reference estimates from GTEx data, ANEVA-DOT can be incorporated in rare disease diagnostic pipelines to use RNA-sequencing data more effectively. ",
        "Bi-allelic Variants in IQSEC1 Cause Intellectual Disability, Developmental Delay, and Short Stature. We report two consanguineous families with probands that exhibit intellectual disability, developmental delay, short stature, aphasia, and hypotonia in which homozygous non-synonymous variants were identified in IQSEC1 (GenBank: NM_001134382.3). In a Pakistani family, the IQSEC1 segregating variant is c.1028C>T (p.Thr343Met), while in a Saudi Arabian family the variant is c.962G>A (p.Arg321Gln). IQSEC1-3 encode guanine nucleotide exchange factors for the small GTPase ARF6 and their loss affects a variety of actin-dependent cellular processes, including AMPA receptor trafficking at synapses. The ortholog of IQSECs in the fly is schizo and its loss affects growth cone guidance at the midline in the CNS, also an actin-dependent process. Overexpression of the reference IQSEC1 cDNA in wild-type flies is lethal, but overexpression of the two variant IQSEC1 cDNAs did not affect viability. Loss of schizo caused embryonic lethality that could be rescued to 2nd instar larvae by moderate expression of the human reference cDNA. However, the p.Arg321Gln and p.Thr343Met variants failed to rescue embryonic lethality. These data indicate that the variants behave as loss-of-function mutations. We also show that schizo in photoreceptors is required for phototransduction. Finally, mice with a conditional Iqsec1 deletion in cortical neurons exhibited an increased density of dendritic spines with an immature morphology. The phenotypic similarity of the affecteds and the functional experiments in flies and mice indicate that IQSEC1 variants are the cause of a recessive disease with intellectual disability, developmental delay, and short stature, and that axonal guidance and dendritic projection defects as well as dendritic spine dysgenesis may underlie disease pathogenesis.

        "Quitting starts in the brain: a randomized controlled trial of app-based mindfulness shows decreases in neural responses to smoking cues that predict reductions in smoking. Current treatments for smoking yield suboptimal outcomes, partly because of an inability to reduce cue-induced smoking. Mindfulness training (MT) has shown preliminary efficacy for smoking cessation, yet its neurobiological target remains unknown. Our prior work with nonsmokers indicates that MT reduces posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) activity. In individuals who smoke, the PCC, consistently a main hub of the \"default mode network,\" activates in response to smoking cues. In this randomized controlled trial, we tested the effects of app-delivered MT on PCC reactivity to smoking cues and whether individual differences in MT-mediated PCC changes predicted smoking outcomes. Smoking cue-induced PCC reactivity was measured using functional magnetic resonance imaging at baseline and 1 month after receiving smartphone app-based MT (n\u2009=\u200933) vs. an active control (National Cancer Institute's QuitGuide, n\u2009=\u200934). Whether individual differences in treatment-related changes in PCC activity predicted smoking behavior was assessed. The MT group demonstrated a significant correlation between a reduction in PCC reactivity to smoking cues and a decline in cigarette consumption (r\u2009=\u20090.39, p\u2009=\u20090.02). No association was found in the control group (r\u2009=\u20090.08, p\u2009=\u20090.65). No effects of group alone were found in PCC or cigarette reduction. Post hoc analysis revealed this association is sex specific (women, r\u2009=\u20090.49, p\u2009=\u20090.03; men: r\u2009=\u2009-0.08, p\u2009=\u20090.79). This initial report indicates that MT specifically reduces smoking cue-induced PCC activity in a subject-specific manner, and the reduction in PCC activity predicts a concurrent decline in smoking. These findings link the hypothesized behavioral effects of MT for smoking to neural mechanisms particularly in women. This lays the groundwork for identifying individuals who may benefit from targeted digital therapeutic treatments such as smartphone-based MT, yielding improved clinical outcomes. ",
        "Artificial intelligence enabled parabolic response surface platform identifies ultra-rapid near-universal TB drug treatment regimens comprising approved drugs. BACKGROUND: Shorter, more effective treatments for tuberculosis (TB) are urgently needed. While many TB drugs are available, identification of the best regimens is challenging because of the large number of possible drug-dose combinations. We have found consistently that responses of cells or whole animals to drug-dose stimulations fit a parabolic response surface (PRS), allowing us to identify and optimize the best drug combinations by testing only a small fraction of the total search space. Previously, we used PRS methodology to identify three regimens (PRS Regimens I-III) that in murine models are much more effective than the standard regimen used to treat TB. However, PRS Regimens I and II are unsuitable for treating drug-resistant TB and PRS Regimen III includes an experimental drug. Here, we use PRS methodology to identify from an expanded pool of drugs new highly effective near-universal drug regimens comprising only approved drugs. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We evaluated combinations of 15 different drugs in a human macrophage TB model and identified the most promising 4-drug combinations. We then tested 14 of these combinations in Mycobacterium tuberculosis-infected BALB/c mice and chose for PRS dose optimization and further study the two most potent regimens, designated PRS Regimens IV and V, consisting of clofazimine (CFZ), bedaquiline (BDQ), pyrazinamide (PZA), and either amoxicillin/clavulanate (AC) or delamanid (DLM), respectively. We then evaluated the efficacy in mice of optimized PRS Regimens IV and V, as well as a 3-drug regimen, PRS Regimen VI (CFZ, BDQ, and PZA), and compared their efficacy to PRS Regimen III (CFZ, BDQ, PZA, and SQ109), previously shown to reduce the time to achieve relapse-free cure in mice by 80% compared with the Standard Regimen (isoniazid, rifampicin, PZA, and ethambutol). Efficacy measurements included early bactericidal activity, time to lung sterilization, and time to relapse-free cure. PRS Regimens III-VI all rapidly sterilized the lungs and achieved relapse-free cure in 3 weeks (PRS Regimens III, V, and VI) or 5 weeks (PRS Regimen IV). In contrast, mice treated with the Standard Regimen still had high numbers of bacteria in their lungs after 6-weeks treatment and none achieved relapse-free cure in this time-period. CONCLUSIONS: We have identified three new regimens that rapidly sterilize the lungs of mice and dramatically shorten the time required to achieve relapse-free cure. All mouse drug doses in these regimens extrapolate to doses that are readily achievable in humans. Because PRS Regimens IV and V contain only one first line drug (PZA) and exclude fluoroquinolones and aminoglycosides, they should be effective against most TB cases that are multidrug resistant (MDR-TB) and many that are extensively drug-resistant (XDR-TB). Hence, these regimens have potential to shorten dramatically the time required for treatment of both drug-sensitive and drug-resistant TB. If clinical trials confirm that these regimens dramatically shorten the time required to achieve relapse-free cure in humans, then this radically shortened treatment has the potential to improve treatment compliance, decrease the emergence of drug resistance, and decrease the healthcare burden of treating both drug-sensitive and drug-resistant TB.

        "Islands of retroelements are major components of Drosophila centromeres. Centromeres are essential chromosomal regions that mediate kinetochore assembly and spindle attachments during cell division. Despite their functional conservation, centromeres are among the most rapidly evolving genomic regions and can shape karyotype evolution and speciation across taxa. Although significant progress has been made in identifying centromere-associated proteins, the highly repetitive centromeres of metazoans have been refractory to DNA sequencing and assembly, leaving large gaps in our understanding of their functional organization and evolution. Here, we identify the sequence composition and organization of the centromeres of Drosophila melanogaster by combining long-read sequencing, chromatin immunoprecipitation for the centromeric histone CENP-A, and high-resolution chromatin fiber imaging. Contrary to previous models that heralded satellite repeats as the major functional components, we demonstrate that functional centromeres form on islands of complex DNA sequences enriched in retroelements that are flanked by large arrays of satellite repeats. Each centromere displays distinct size and arrangement of its DNA elements but is similar in composition overall. We discover that a specific retroelement, G2/Jockey-3, is the most highly enriched sequence in CENP-A chromatin and is the only element shared among all centromeres. G2/Jockey-3 is also associated with CENP-A in the sister species D. simulans, revealing an unexpected conservation despite the reported turnover of centromeric satellite DNA. Our work reveals the DNA sequence identity of the active centromeres of a premier model organism and implicates retroelements as conserved features of centromeric DNA. ",
        "Orthorexia nervosa: A review of psychosocial risk factors. Orthorexia nervosa (ON) is a condition described as a pathological obsession with healthy eating. This paper will review the prevalence of ON and how ON is measured. The primary objective is to critically analyze findings on the psychosocial risk factors associated with ON, to consider its relation to other mental disorders, and to offer directions for future research. The key words \"orthorexia\" and \"orthorexia nervosa\" were searched in the databases PsycINFO and MEDLINE/PubMed. This paper reviewed peer-reviewed articles published up until December 31st, 2018. Quality assessment was conducted on each study reviewed. Results identified psychometric problems with the most common measure of ON. Gender and self-esteem were generally found to be unrelated to ON. Perfectionism, obsessive-compulsive traits, psychopathology, disordered eating, history of an eating disorder, dieting, poor body image, and drive for thinness were positively associated with greater ON. Findings between ON and the following risk factors were mixed: age, SES, BMI, belonging to a health-related field, exercise engagement, vegetarianism/veganism, body dissatisfaction, and alcohol, tobacco, and drug use. We discuss how the literature on risk factors informs understanding the nature of psychopathology of ON. Strengths and limitations of studies are reviewed and directions for future research are identified. Suggestions are made for more psychometrically valid assessment measures of ON that include questions about impairment, so that ON etiology can be accurately studied. ",
        "Functional linkage of gene fusions to cancer cell fitness assessed by pharmacological and CRISPR-Cas9 screening. Many gene fusions are reported in tumours and for most their role remains unknown. As fusions are used for diagnostic and prognostic purposes, and are targets for treatment, it is crucial to assess their function in cancer. To systematically investigate the role of fusions in tumour cell fitness, we utilized RNA-sequencing data from 1011 human cancer cell lines to functionally link 8354 fusion events with genomic data, sensitivity to\u2009>350 anti-cancer drugs and CRISPR-Cas9 loss-of-fitness effects. Established clinically-relevant fusions were identified. Overall, detection of functional fusions was rare, including those involving cancer driver genes, suggesting that many fusions are dispensable for tumour fitness. Therapeutically actionable fusions involving RAF1, BRD4 and ROS1 were verified in new histologies. In addition, recurrent YAP1-MAML2 fusions were identified as activators of Hippo-pathway signaling in multiple cancer types. Our approach discriminates functional fusions, identifying new drivers of carcinogenesis and fusions that could have clinical implications. ",
        "Distinct modes of cell competition shape mammalian tissue morphogenesis. Cell competition-the sensing and elimination of less fit 'loser' cells by neighbouring 'winner' cells-was first described in Drosophila. Although cell competition has been proposed as a selection mechanism to optimize tissue and organ development, its evolutionary generality remains unclear. Here, by using live imaging, lineage tracing, single-cell transcriptomics and genetics, we identify two cell competition mechanisms that sequentially shape and maintain the architecture of stratified tissue during skin development in mice. In the single-layered epithelium of the early embryonic epidermis, winner progenitors kill and subsequently\u00a0clear neighbouring loser cells by engulfment. Later, as the tissue begins to stratify, the basal layer instead expels losers through upward flux of differentiating progeny. This cell competition switch is physiologically relevant: when it is perturbed, so too is barrier formation. Our findings show that cell competition is a selective force that optimizes vertebrate tissue function, and illuminate how a tissue dynamically adjusts cell competition strategies to preserve fitness as its architectural complexity increases during morphogenesis.

        "Temporal Trends in Ischemic Stroke Incidence in Younger Adults in the Framingham Study. Background and Purpose- Stroke at midlife has a disproportionately large impact on disability-adjusted life-years lost. Ischemic stroke incidence may be increasing at this age. We investigated long-term trends in ischemic stroke incidence and changes in stroke risk factors in a community sample stratified by stroke onset at middle and older age. Methods- In the Framingham Study, surveillance for incident stroke is ongoing since 1948. We examined age-adjusted and sex-adjusted 10-year incidence of ischemic stroke using Cox models in persons aged 35 to 54 and \u226555 years at start of follow-up. Tests for linear trend were performed over 4 epochs, controlling for the distance in time between intervals. Further, we calculated the mean 10-year risk of stroke at each epoch and for both age groups, based on vascular risk factors from the Framingham Stroke Risk Profile. Results- There were 153, 197, 176, and 165 incident ischemic strokes within each epoch beginning in 1962 (n=3966), 1971 (n=5779), 1987 (n=5133), and 1998 (n=6964). Most ischemic strokes at midlife (n=71) were because of atherosclerotic brain infarction (n=50) or cardioembolism (n=19). Using the risk in the 1962 epoch as the reference, the risk of ischemic stroke at midlife did not significantly decline (hazard ratio, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.74-1.02; P trend =0.09). Incidence of ischemic stroke declined in the older group (hazard ratio, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.77-0.88; P trend <0.001). Between epochs 1 and 4, the average 10-year risk of stroke, as estimated by the Framingham Stroke Risk Profile, declined by 0.7% at midlife and 1.1% at older age. Conclusions- Long-term rates of ischemic stroke declined in our community sample; the decline was greater in older as compared with younger adults. Early prevention, focused on modification of cardiovascular risk factors, is important to see sustained declines in stroke incidence and mortality at midlife. ",
        "Non-volatile particle emissions from aircraft turbine engines at ground-idle induce oxidative stress in bronchial cells. Aircraft emissions contribute to local and global air pollution. Health effects of particulate matter (PM) from aircraft engines are largely unknown, since controlled cell exposures at relevant conditions are challenging. We examined the toxicity of non-volatile PM (nvPM) emissions from a CFM56-7B26 turbofan, the world's most used aircraft turbine using an unprecedented exposure setup. We combined direct turbine-exhaust sampling under realistic engine operating conditions and the Nano-Aerosol Chamber for In vitro Toxicity to deposit particles onto air-liquid-interface cultures of human bronchial epithelial cells (BEAS-2B) at physiological conditions. We evaluated acute cellular responses after 1-h exposures to diluted exhaust from conventional or alternative fuel combustion. We show that single, short-term exposures to nvPM impair bronchial epithelial cells, and PM from conventional fuel at ground-idle conditions is the most hazardous. Electron microscopy of soot reveals varying reactivity matching the observed cellular responses. Stronger responses at lower mass concentrations suggest that additional metrics are necessary to evaluate health risks of this increasingly important emission source. ",
        "Hydro-Seq enables contamination-free high-throughput single-cell RNA-sequencing for circulating tumor cells. Molecular analysis of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) at single-cell resolution offers great promise for cancer diagnostics and therapeutics from simple liquid biopsy. Recent development of massively parallel single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) provides a powerful method to resolve the cellular heterogeneity from gene expression and pathway regulation analysis. However, the scarcity of CTCs and the massive contamination of blood cells limit the utility of currently available technologies. Here, we present Hydro-Seq, a scalable hydrodynamic scRNA-seq barcoding technique, for high-throughput CTC analysis. High cell-capture efficiency and contamination removal capability of Hydro-Seq enables successful scRNA-seq of 666 CTCs from 21 breast cancer patient samples at high throughput. We identify breast cancer drug targets for hormone and targeted therapies and tracked individual cells that express markers of cancer stem cells (CSCs) as well as of epithelial/mesenchymal cell state transitions. Transcriptome analysis of these cells provides insights into monitoring target therapeutics and processes underlying tumor metastasis. ",
        "Resistin-like Molecule \u03b1 Provides Vitamin-A-Dependent Antimicrobial Protection in the Skin. Vitamin A deficiency increases susceptibility to skin infection. However, the mechanisms by which vitamin A regulates skin immunity remain unclear. Here, we show that resistin-like molecule \u03b1 (RELM\u03b1), a small secreted cysteine-rich protein, is expressed by epidermal keratinocytes and sebocytes and serves as an antimicrobial protein that is required for vitamin-A-dependent resistance to skin infection. RELM\u03b1 was induced by microbiota colonization of the murine skin, was bactericidal in\u00a0vitro, and was protected against bacterial infection of the skin in\u00a0vivo. RELM\u03b1 expression required dietary vitamin A and was induced by the therapeutic vitamin A analog isotretinoin, which protected against skin infection in a RELM\u03b1-dependent manner. The RELM family member Resistin was expressed in human skin, was induced by vitamin A analogs, and killed skin bacteria, indicating a conserved function for RELM proteins in skin innate immunity. Our findings provide insight into how vitamin A promotes resistance to skin infection. ",
        "A Feasibility Study of Quantitative Motor Assessments in Children Using the Q-Motor Suite. Q-Motor is utilized across various clinical trials in adults with Huntington's disease (HD) to provide quantitative, reliable assessments of motor abilities. With gene-knockdown therapies entering the clinic, development of preventative therapies for pediatric carriers of the HD mutation seems imminent. It is currently unclear if Q-Motor is useful for tracking changes in motor abilities in pediatric HD patients or at-risk youth, as most assessments have never been administered in children. We demonstrate the feasibility of administering Q-Motor tasks in a sample of children recruited from the community, and we show that Q-Motor is sensitive to age-related changes in motor abilities. ",
        "Online repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation during working memory in younger and older adults: A randomized within-subject comparison. Working memory is the ability to perform mental operations on information that is stored in a flexible, limited capacity buffer. The ability to manipulate information in working memory is central to many aspects of human cognition, but also declines with healthy aging. Given the profound importance of such working memory manipulation abilities, there is a concerted effort towards developing approaches to improve them. The current study tested the capacity to enhance working memory manipulation with online repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation in healthy young and older adults. Online high frequency (5Hz) repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation was applied over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex to test the hypothesis that active repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation would lead to significant improvements in memory recall accuracy compared to sham stimulation, and that these effects would be most pronounced in working memory manipulation conditions with the highest cognitive demand in both young and older adults. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation was applied while participants were performing a delayed response alphabetization task with three individually-titrated levels of difficulty. The left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex was identified by combining electric field modeling to individualized functional magnetic resonance imaging activation maps and was targeted during the experiment using stereotactic neuronavigation with real-time robotic guidance, allowing optimal coil placement during the stimulation. As no accuracy differences were found between young and older adults, the results from both groups were collapsed. Subsequent analyses revealed that active stimulation significantly increased accuracy relative to sham stimulation, but only for the hardest condition. These results point towards further investigation of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation for memory enhancement focusing on high difficulty conditions as those most likely to exhibit benefits.

        "BCL2 Amplicon Loss and Transcriptional Remodeling Drives ABT-199 Resistance in B Cell Lymphoma Models. Drug-tolerant \"persister\" tumor cells underlie emergence of drug-resistant clones and contribute to relapse and disease progression. Here we report that resistance to the BCL-2 targeting drug ABT-199 in models of mantle cell lymphoma and double-hit lymphoma evolves from outgrowth of persister clones displaying loss of 18q21 amplicons that harbor BCL2. Further, persister status is generated via adaptive super-enhancer remodeling that reprograms transcription and offers opportunities for overcoming ABT-199 resistance. Notably, pharmacoproteomic and pharmacogenomic screens revealed that persisters are vulnerable to inhibition of the transcriptional machinery and especially to inhibition of cyclin-dependent kinase 7 (CDK7), which is essential for the transcriptional reprogramming that drives and sustains ABT-199 resistance. Thus, transcription-targeting agents offer new approaches to disable drug resistance in B-cell lymphomas. ",
        "Neurophysiological abnormalities in individuals with persistent post-concussion symptoms. Concussion injury results in a rapid onset of transient neurological impairment that can resolve quickly, or sometimes evolve over time, but usually resolve within seven to 10 days. However, a small but noticeable cohort (~10%) of individuals continues to experience persistent lingering effects, particularly fatigue, recognized as post-concussion symptoms (PCS). This study explored neurophysiological mechanisms in people with persistent PCS. Studies involved using self-report post-concussion fatigue scale, transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and somatosensory stimulation in those with diagnosed PCS (n\u202f=\u202f20; 36.1\u202f\u00b1\u202f14.0\u202fyr., 4 female; mean time post-concussion 15.4\u202f\u00b1\u202f7.6\u202fmonths) to fully recovered individuals (n\u202f=\u202f20; 33.8\u202f\u00b1\u202f6.6\u202fyr., 2 female; post-concussion 12.9\u202f\u00b1\u202f6.6\u202fmonths) and healthy controls (n\u202f=\u202f20; 37.7\u202f\u00b1\u202f8.0\u202fyr., 3 female). PCS participants demonstrated a significantly higher self-report fatigue (score: PCS 20.2 [95% CI 17.4-22.9], Recovered 6.2 [3.1-9.3], Control 2.75 [0.6-4.8]). PCS participants showed a worsening of reaction time (F2,57\u202f=\u202f4.214; p\u202f=\u202f0.020) and increased reaction time variability (F2,57\u202f=\u202f5.505; p\u202f=\u202f0.007). Somatosensory differences were observed for amplitude discrimination (F2,57\u202f=\u202f5.166; p\u202f=\u202f0.009), temporal order judgment (F2,57\u202f=\u202f4.606; p\u202f=\u202f0.014) and duration discrimination (F2,57\u202f=\u202f6.081; p\u202f=\u202f0.004). Increased intracortical inhibition in TMS single pulse suprathreshold stimulation (110%: F2,57\u202f=\u202f6.842; p\u202f=\u202f0.002; 130%: F2,57\u202f=\u202f4.900; p\u202f=\u202f0.011; 150%: F2,57\u202f=\u202f4.638; p\u202f=\u202f0.014; 170%: F2,57\u202f=\u202f9.845; p\u202f<\u202f0.001) and paired pulse protocols was also seen (SICI: F2,57\u202f=\u202f23.390; p\u202f<\u202f0.001, and LICI: F2,57\u202f=\u202f21.603; p\u202f<\u202f0.001). Using non-invasive stimulation techniques, this novel study showed increased cortical inhibition and compromised central information processing, suggesting neural mechanisms underpinning ongoing fatigue, allowing for potential clinical rehabilitation strategies.

        "Does Patient Safety Pay? Evaluating the Association Between Surgical Care Improvement Project Performance and Hospital Profitability. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: Financial issues are top concerns for hospital executives. Evolving reimbursement structures focused on value provide an incentive to fully understand how patient safety performance and financial outcomes are connected. To that end, this study examines the relationships between Surgical Care Improvement Project (SCIP) measurements and hospital financial performance.Using multinomial logistic regression, we determined the association between hospital patient safety performances via analysis of eight prophylaxis data elements drawn from the archived Hospital Compare data. The measures are SCIP-Inf-1 (prophylactic antibiotic prophylaxis received within 1 hr prior to surgical incision), SCIP-Inf-2 (prophylactic antibiotic selection for surgical patients), SCIP-Inf-3 (prophylactic antibiotics discontinued within 24 hr after surgery end time), SCIP-Inf-4 (cardiac surgery patients with controlled 6 A.M. postoperative serum glucose management), SCIP-Inf-9 (urinary catheter removal postsurgery), SCIP-Inf-Card-2 (beta-blocker during the perioperative period), and SCIP-Inf-VTE-2 (venous thromboembolism prophylaxis). Data from the American Hospital Association provided two dimensions of organizational profitability: operating margin and net patient revenue. Our results indicate that improved hospital safety performance is associated with a relative risk of higher operating margin and net patient revenue, with some variation noted among the measures of patient safety. Our findings suggest that targeted improvement in patient safety performance, as evaluated in the Hospital Compare data, is associated with improved financial performance at the hospital level. Increased attention to safe care delivery may allow hospitals to generate additional patent care earnings, improve margins, and create capital to advance hospital financial position. ",
        "Neurological toxicities associated with chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy. Chimeric antigen receptor T cell therapy has become an important tool in the treatment of relapsed and refractory malignancy; however, it is associated with significant neurological toxicity. We characterized the neurological toxicity associated with chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy in a consecutive series of 100 patients up to 2 months post transfusion, 28 of whom were obtained from chart review and the others by prospective observation. The underlying neoplasms were lymphoma (74%), myeloma (14%), leukaemia (10%), and sarcoma (2%). The median age of the cohort was 64.5 years old and 39% of patients were female. The most commonly occurring neurological symptoms were encephalopathy (57%), headache (42%), tremor (38%), aphasia (35%) and focal weakness (11%). Focal neurological deficits are frequently observed after chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy and are associated with regional EEG abnormalities, FDG-PET hypometabolism, and elevated velocities on transcranial Doppler ultrasound. In contrast, structural imaging was typically normal. As this form of treatment is more widely adopted, recognition of the frequently encountered symptoms will be of increasing importance for the neurologists and oncologists caring for this growing patient population.

        "Feasibility of pediatric obesity and prediabetes treatment support through Tess, the AI behavioral coaching chatbot. Behavioral intervention technologies (BITs) are unique ways to incorporate the benefits of technology and psychology to address differing health needs through various media, including Internet interventions, mobile apps, and video games. BITs present several possible benefits, including increased dissemination and accessibility, cost-effectiveness, increased engagement, and decreased stigma, especially among youth. A behavioral coaching chatbot, Tess, addresses different facets of behavioral health, such as depression and anxiety. Available 24/7, Tess delivers customized integrative support, psychoeducation, and interventions through brief conversations via existing communication channels (i.e., SMS text messaging and Facebook Messenger). This study assessed the feasibility of integrating Tess in behavioral counseling of adolescent patients (n = 23; Mage = 15.20 years; Rangeage = 9.78-18.54 years; 57% female) coping with weight management and prediabetes symptoms. Tess engaged patients via a preferred method of communication (SMS text messaging) in individualized conversations to promote treatment adherence, behavior change, and overall wellness. Adolescent patients reported experiencing positive progress toward their goals 81% of the time. The 4,123 messages exchanged and patients' reported usefulness ratings (96% of the time) illustrate that adolescents engaged with and viewed this chatbot as helpful. These results highlight the feasibility and benefit of support through artificial intelligence, specifically in a pediatric setting, which could be scaled to serve larger groups of patients. As a partner to clinicians, Tess can continue the therapeutic interaction outside office hours while maintaining patient satisfaction. Due to Tess's capacity for continuous learning, future iterations may have additional features to increase the user experience. ",
        "Mortality in adult-onset and elderly-onset IBD: a nationwide register-based cohort study 1964-2014. OBJECTIVES: To examine all-cause and cause-specific mortality in adult-onset and elderly-onset IBD and to describe time trends in mortality over the past 50 years. DESIGN: Swedish nationwide register-based cohort study 1964-2014, comparing mortality in 82\u2009718 incident IBD cases (inpatient and non-primary outpatient care) with 10 times as many matched general population reference individuals (n=801\u2009180) using multivariable Cox regression to estimate HRs. Among patients with IBD, the number of participants with elderly-onset (\u226560 years) IBD was 17\u2009873. RESULTS: During 984\u2009330 person-years of follow-up, 15 698/82 718 (19%) of all patients with IBD died (15.9/1000 person-years) compared with 121 095/801 180 (15.1%) of reference individuals, corresponding to an HR of 1.5 for IBD (95% CI=1.5\u2009to 1.5 (HR=1.5; 95% CI=1.5 to 1.5 in elderly-onset IBD)) or one extra death each year per 263 patients. Mortality was increased specifically for UC (HR=1.4; 95% CI=1.4 to 1.5), Crohn's disease (HR=1.6; 95% CI=1.6 to 1.7) and IBD-unclasssified (HR=1.6; 95% CI=1.5 to 1.8). IBD was linked to increased rates of multiple causes of death, including cardiovascular disease (HR=1.3; 1.3 to 1.3), malignancy (HR=1.4; 1.4 to 1.5) and digestive disease (HR=5.2; 95% CI=4.9 to 5.5). Relative mortality during the first 5 years of follow-up decreased significantly over time. Incident cases of 2002-2014 had 2.3 years shorter mean estimated life span than matched comparators. CONCLUSIONS: Adult-onset and elderly-onset patients with UC, Crohn's disease and IBD-unclassified were all at increased risk of death. The increased mortality remained also after the introduction of biological therapies but has decreased over time. ",
        "Host diet and evolutionary history explain different aspects of gut microbiome diversity among vertebrate clades. Multiple factors modulate microbial community assembly in the vertebrate gut, though studies disagree as to their relative contribution. One cause may be a reliance on captive animals, which can have very different gut microbiomes compared to their wild counterparts. To resolve this disagreement, we analyze a new, large, and highly diverse animal distal gut 16\u2009S rRNA microbiome dataset, which comprises 80% wild animals and includes members of Mammalia, Aves, Reptilia, Amphibia, and Actinopterygii. We decouple the effects of host evolutionary history and diet on gut microbiome diversity and show that each factor modulates different aspects of diversity. Moreover, we resolve particular microbial taxa associated with host phylogeny or diet and show that Mammalia have a stronger signal of cophylogeny. Finally, we find that environmental filtering and microbe-microbe interactions differ among host clades. These findings provide a robust assessment of the processes driving microbial community assembly in the vertebrate intestine. ",
        "A Site of Vulnerability on the Influenza Virus Hemagglutinin Head Domain Trimer Interface. Here, we describe the discovery of a naturally occurring human antibody (Ab), FluA-20, that recognizes a new site of vulnerability on the hemagglutinin (HA) head domain and reacts with most influenza A viruses. Structural characterization of FluA-20 with H1 and H3 head domains revealed a novel epitope in the HA trimer interface, suggesting previously unrecognized dynamic features of the trimeric HA protein. The critical HA residues recognized by FluA-20 remain conserved across most subtypes of influenza\u00a0A viruses, which explains the Ab's extraordinary breadth. The Ab rapidly disrupted the integrity of HA protein trimers, inhibited cell-to-cell spread of virus in culture, and protected mice against challenge with viruses of H1N1, H3N2, H5N1, or H7N9 subtypes when used as prophylaxis or therapy. The FluA-20 Ab has uncovered an exceedingly conserved protective determinant in the influenza HA head domain trimer interface that is an unexpected new target for anti-influenza therapeutics and vaccines.

        "Ambulatory Management of Childhood Asthma Using a Novel Self-management Application. BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Pediatric ambulatory asthma control is suboptimal, reducing quality of life (QoL) and causing emergency department (ED) and hospital admissions. We assessed the impact of the electronic-AsthmaTracker (e-AT), a self-monitoring application for children with asthma. METHODS: Prospective cohort study with matched controls. Participants were enrolled January 2014 to December 2015 in 11 pediatric clinics for weekly e-AT use for 1 year. Analyses included: (1) longitudinal changes for the child (QoL, asthma control, and interrupted and missed school days) and parents (interrupted and missed work days and satisfaction), (2) comparing ED and hospital admissions and oral corticosteroid (OCS) use pre- and postintervention, and (3) comparing ED and hospital admissions and OCS use between e-AT users and matched controls. RESULTS: A total of 327 children and parents enrolled; e-AT adherence at 12 months was 65%. Compared with baseline, participants had significantly (P < .001) increased QoL, asthma control, and reduced interrupted and missed school and work days at all assessment times. Compared with 1 year preintervention, they had reduced ED and hospital admissions (rate ratio [RR]: 0.68; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.49-0.95) and OCS use (RR: 0.74; 95% CI: 0.61-0.91). Parent satisfaction remained high. Compared with matched controls, participants had reduced ED and hospital admissions (RR: 0.41; 95% CI: 0.22-0.75) and OCS use (RR: 0.65; 95% CI: 0.46-0.93). CONCLUSIONS: e-AT use led to high and sustained participation in self-monitoring and improved asthma outcomes. Dissemination of this care model has potential to broadly improve pediatric ambulatory asthma care. ",
        "Lateral flow urine lipoarabinomannan assay for detecting active tuberculosis in people living with HIV. BACKGROUND: The lateral flow urine lipoarabinomannan (LF-LAM) assay Alere Determine\u2122 TB LAM Ag is recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) to help detect active tuberculosis in HIV-positive people with severe HIV disease. This review update asks the question, \"does new evidence justify the use of LF-LAM in a broader group of people?\", and is part of the WHO process for updating guidance on the use of LF-LAM. OBJECTIVES: To assess the accuracy of LF-LAM for the diagnosis of active tuberculosis among HIV-positive adults with signs and symptoms of tuberculosis (symptomatic participants) and among HIV-positive adults irrespective of signs and symptoms of tuberculosis (unselected participants not assessed for tuberculosis signs and symptoms).The proposed role for LF-LAM is as an add on to clinical judgement and with other tests to assist in diagnosing tuberculosis. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register; MEDLINE, Embase, Science Citation Index, Web of Science, Latin American Caribbean Health Sciences Literature, Scopus, the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, the International Standard Randomized Controlled Trial Number Registry, and ProQuest, without language restriction to 11 May 2018. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomized trials, cross-sectional, and observational cohort studies that evaluated LF-LAM for active tuberculosis (pulmonary and extrapulmonary) in HIV-positive adults. We included studies that used the manufacturer's recommended threshold for test positivity, either the updated reference card with four bands (grade 1 of 4) or the corresponding prior reference card grade with five bands (grade 2 of 5). The reference standard was culture or nucleic acid amplification test from any body site (microbiological). We considered a higher quality reference standard to be one in which two or more specimen types were evaluated for tuberculosis diagnosis and a lower quality reference standard to be one in which only one specimen type was evaluated. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently extracted data using a standardized form and REDCap electronic data capture tools. We appraised the quality of studies using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 (QUADAS-2) tool and performed meta-analyses to estimate pooled sensitivity and specificity using a bivariate random-effects model and a Bayesian approach. We analyzed studies enrolling strictly symptomatic participants separately from those enrolling unselected participants. We investigated pre-defined sources of heterogeneity including the influence of CD4 count and clinical setting on the accuracy estimates. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach. MAIN RESULTS: We included 15 unique studies (nine new studies and six studies from the original review that met the inclusion criteria): eight studies among symptomatic adults and seven studies among unselected adults. All studies were conducted in low- or middle-income countries. Risk of bias was high in the patient selection and reference standard domains, mainly because studies excluded participants unable to produce sputum and used a lower quality reference standard.Participants with tuberculosis symptomsLF-LAM pooled sensitivity (95% credible interval (CrI) ) was 42% (31% to 55%) (moderate-certainty evidence) and pooled specificity was 91% (85% to 95%) (very low-certainty evidence), (8 studies, 3449 participants, 37% with tuberculosis).For a population of 1000 people where 300 have microbiologically-confirmed tuberculosis, the utilization of LF-LAM would result in: 189 to be LF-LAM positive: of these, 63 (33%) would not have tuberculosis (false-positives); and 811 to be LF-LAM negative: of these, 174 (21%) would have tuberculosis (false-negatives).By clinical setting, pooled sensitivity was 52% (40% to 64%) among inpatients versus 29% (17% to 47%) among outpatients; and pooled specificity was 87% (78% to 93%) among inpatients versus 96% (91% to 99%) among outpatients. Stratified by CD4 cell count, pooled sensitivity increased, and specificity decreased with lower CD4 cell count.Unselected participants not assessed for signs and symptoms of tuberculosisLF-LAM pooled sensitivity was 35% (22% to 50%), (moderate-certainty evidence) and pooled specificity was 95% (89% to 96%), (low-certainty evidence), (7 studies, 3365 participants, 13% with tuberculosis).For a population of 1000 people where 100 have microbiologically-confirmed tuberculosis, the utilization of LF-LAM would result in: 80 to be LF-LAM positive: of these, 45 (56%) would not have tuberculosis (false-positives); and 920 to be LF-LAM negative: of these, 65 (7%) would have tuberculosis (false-negatives).By clinical setting, pooled sensitivity was 62% (41% to 83%) among inpatients versus 31% (18% to 47%) among outpatients; pooled specificity was 84% (48% to 96%) among inpatients versus 95% (87% to 99%) among outpatients. Stratified by CD4 cell count, pooled sensitivity increased, and specificity decreased with lower CD4 cell count. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: We found that LF-LAM has a sensitivity of 42% to diagnose tuberculosis in HIV-positive individuals with tuberculosis symptoms and 35% in HIV-positive individuals not assessed for tuberculosis symptoms, consistent with findings reported previously. Regardless of how people are enrolled, sensitivity is higher in inpatients and those with lower CD4 cell, but a concomitant lower specificity. As a simple point-of-care test that does not depend upon sputum evaluation, LF-LAM may assist with the diagnosis of tuberculosis, particularly when a sputum specimen cannot be produced. ",
        "A Flexible Model of Working Memory. Working memory is fundamental to cognition, allowing one to hold information \"in mind.\" A defining characteristic of working memory is its flexibility: we can hold anything in mind. However, typical models of working memory rely on finely tuned, content-specific attractors to persistently maintain neural activity and therefore do not allow for the flexibility observed in behavior. Here, we present a flexible model of working memory that maintains representations through random recurrent connections between two layers of neurons: a structured \"sensory\" layer and a randomly connected, unstructured layer. As the interactions are untuned with respect to the content being stored, the network maintains any arbitrary input. However, in our model, this flexibility comes at a cost: the random connections overlap, leading to interference between representations and limiting the memory capacity of the network. Additionally, our model captures several other key behavioral and neurophysiological characteristics of working memory. ",
        "Automatic diagnosis of neurological diseases using MEG signals with a deep neural network. The application of deep learning to neuroimaging big data will help develop computer-aided diagnosis of neurological diseases. Pattern recognition using deep learning can extract features of neuroimaging signals unique to various neurological diseases, leading to better diagnoses. In this study, we developed MNet, a novel deep neural network to classify multiple neurological diseases using resting-state magnetoencephalography (MEG) signals. We used the MEG signals of 67 healthy subjects, 26 patients with spinal cord injury, and 140 patients with epilepsy to train and test the network using 10-fold cross-validation. The trained MNet succeeded in classifying the healthy subjects and those with the two neurological diseases with an accuracy of 70.7\u2009\u00b1\u200910.6%, which significantly exceeded the accuracy of 63.4\u2009\u00b1\u200912.7% calculated from relative powers of six frequency bands (\u03b4: 1-4\u2009Hz; \u03b8: 4-8\u2009Hz; low-\u03b1: 8-10\u2009Hz; high-\u03b1: 10-13\u2009Hz; \u03b2: 13-30\u2009Hz; low-\u03b3: 30-50\u2009Hz) for each channel using a support vector machine as a classifier (p\u2009=\u20094.2\u2009\u00d7\u200910-2). The specificity of classification for each disease ranged from 86-94%. Our results suggest that this technique would be useful for developing a classifier that will improve neurological diagnoses and allow high specificity in identifying diseases. ",
        "Mechanistic Origin of Cell-Size Control and Homeostasis in Bacteria. Evolutionarily divergent bacteria share a common phenomenological strategy for cell-size homeostasis under steady-state conditions. In the presence of inherent physiological stochasticity, cells following this \"adder\" principle gradually return to their steady-state size by adding a constant volume between birth and division, regardless of their size at birth. However, the mechanism of the adder has been unknown despite intense efforts. In this work, we show that the adder is a direct consequence of two general processes in biology: (1) threshold-accumulation of initiators and precursors required for cell division to a respective fixed number-and (2) balanced biosynthesis-maintenance of their production proportional to volume growth. This mechanism is naturally robust to static growth inhibition but also allows us to \"reprogram\" cell-size homeostasis in a quantitatively predictive manner in both Gram-negative Escherichia coli and Gram-positive Bacillus subtilis. By generating dynamic oscillations in the concentration of the division protein FtsZ, we were able to oscillate cell size at division and systematically break the adder. In contrast, periodic induction of replication initiator protein DnaA caused oscillations in cell size at initiation but did not alter division size or the adder. Finally, we were able to restore the adder phenotype in slow-growing E.\u00a0coli, the only known steady-state growth condition wherein E.\u00a0coli significantly deviates from the adder, by repressing active degradation of division proteins. Together, these results show that cell division and replication initiation are independently controlled at the gene-expression level and that division processes exclusively drive cell-size homeostasis in bacteria.

        "Tracing the origin of adult intestinal stem cells. Adult intestinal stem cells are located at the bottom of crypts of Lieberk\u00fchn, where they express markers such as LGR51,2 and fuel the constant replenishment of the intestinal epithelium1. Although fetal LGR5-expressing cells can give rise to adult intestinal stem cells3,4, it remains unclear whether this population in the patterned epithelium represents unique intestinal stem-cell precursors. Here\u00a0we show, using unbiased quantitative lineage-tracing approaches, biophysical modelling and intestinal transplantation, that all cells of the mouse intestinal epithelium-irrespective of their location and pattern of LGR5 expression in the fetal gut tube-contribute actively to the adult intestinal stem cell pool. Using 3D imaging, we find that during fetal development the villus undergoes gross remodelling and fission. This brings epithelial cells from the non-proliferative villus into the proliferative intervillus region, which\u00a0enables them to contribute to the adult stem-cell niche. Our results demonstrate that large-scale remodelling of the intestinal wall and cell-fate specification are closely linked. Moreover, these findings provide a direct link between the observed plasticity and cellular reprogramming of differentiating cells in adult tissues following damage5-9, revealing that stem-cell identity is an induced rather than a hardwired property.

        "The role of neurocognitive functioning, substance use variables and the DSM-5 severity scale in cocaine relapse: A prospective study. BACKGROUND: The severity of substance use disorder (SUD) is currently defined by the sum of DSM-5 criteria. However, little is known about the validity of this framework or the role of additional severity indicators in relapse prediction. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between DSM-5 criteria, neurocognitive functioning, substance use variables and cocaine relapse among inpatients with cocaine use disorder (CUD). METHODS: 128 adults aged between 18 and 45 years were evaluated; 68 (59 males, 9 females) had CUD and 60 (52 males, 8 females) were healthy controls. For the group with CUD, the use of other substances was not an exclusion criterion. Participants were tested using a battery of neurocognitive tests. Cocaine relapse was evaluated 3 months after discharge. RESULTS: Scores for attention span and working memory were worse in patients compared to controls. Earlier onset and duration of cocaine use were related to poorer inhibitory control and global executive functioning, respectively; recent use was related to worse performance in inhibitory control, attention span and working memory. More DSM-5 criteria at baseline were significantly associated with relapse. CONCLUSIONS: Recent cocaine use was the most predictive variable for neurocognitive impairments, while DSM-5 criteria predicted cocaine relapse at three months post treatment. The integration of neurocognitive measures, DSM-5 criteria and cocaine use variables in CUD diagnosis could improve severity differentiation. Longitudinal studies using additional biomarkers are needed to disentangle the different roles of severity indicators in relapse prediction and to achieve more individualized and effective treatment strategies for these patients.

        "Diacylglycerol Lipase-\u03b2 Is Required for TNF-\u03b1 Response but Not CD8+ T Cell Priming Capacity of Dendritic Cells. Diacylglycerol lipase-\u03b2 (DAGL\u03b2) hydrolyzes arachidonic acid (AA)-esterified diacylglycerols to produce 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) and downstream prostanoids that mediate inflammatory responses of macrophages. Here, we utilized DAGL-tailored activity-based protein profiling and genetic disruption models to discover that DAGL\u03b2 regulates inflammatory lipid and protein signaling pathways in primary dendritic cells (DCs). DCs serve as an important link between innate and adaptive immune pathways by relaying innate signals and antigen to drive T\u00a0cell clonal expansion and prime antigen-specific immunity. We discovered that disruption of DAGL\u03b2 in DCs lowers cellular 2-AG and AA that is accompanied by reductions in lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulated tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 secretion. Cell-based vaccination studies revealed that DC maturation ex\u00a0vivo and immunogenicity in\u00a0vivo was surprisingly unaffected by DAGL\u03b2 inactivation. Collectively, we identify DAGL\u03b2 pathways as a means for attenuating\u00a0DC inflammatory signaling while sparing critical\u00a0adaptive immune functions and further expand the\u00a0utility of targeting lipid pathways for immunomodulation.

        "Human nonvisual opsin 3 regulates pigmentation of epidermal melanocytes through functional interaction with melanocortin 1 receptor. Opsins form a family of light-activated, retinal-dependent, G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) that serve a multitude of visual and nonvisual functions. Opsin 3 (OPN3 or encephalopsin), initially identified in the brain, remains one of the few members of the mammalian opsin family with unknown function and ambiguous light absorption properties. We recently discovered that OPN3 is highly expressed in human epidermal melanocytes (HEMs)-the skin cells that produce melanin. The melanin pigment is a critical defense against ultraviolet radiation (UVR), and its production is mediated by the G\u03b1s-coupled melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R). The physiological function and light sensitivity of OPN3 in melanocytes are yet to be determined. Here, we show that in HEMs, OPN3 acts as a negative regulator of melanin production by modulating the signaling of MC1R. OPN3 negatively regulates the cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) response evoked by MC1R via activation of the G\u03b1i subunit of G proteins, thus decreasing cellular melanin levels. In addition to their functional relationship, OPN3 and MC1R colocalize at both the plasma membrane and in intracellular structures, and can form a physical complex. Remarkably, OPN3 can bind retinal, but does not mediate light-induced signaling in melanocytes. Our results identify a function for OPN3 in the regulation of the melanogenic pathway in epidermal melanocytes; we have revealed a light-independent function for the poorly characterized OPN3 and a pathway that greatly expands our understanding of melanocyte and skin physiology.

        "Length of Uninterrupted CAG, Independent of Polyglutamine Size, Results in Increased Somatic Instability, Hastening Onset of Huntington Disease. Huntington disease (HD) is caused by a CAG repeat expansion in the huntingtin (HTT) gene. Although the length of this repeat is inversely correlated with age of onset (AOO), it does not fully explain the variability in AOO. We assessed the sequence downstream of the CAG repeat in HTT [reference: (CAG)n-CAA-CAG], since variants within this region have been previously described, but no study of AOO has been performed. These analyses identified a variant that results in complete loss of interrupting (LOI) adenine nucleotides in this region [(CAG)n-CAG-CAG]. Analysis of multiple HD pedigrees showed that this LOI variant is associated with dramatically earlier AOO (average of 25 years) despite the same polyglutamine length as in individuals with the interrupting penultimate CAA codon. This LOI allele is particularly frequent in persons with reduced penetrance alleles who manifest with HD and increases the likelihood of presenting clinically with HD with a CAG of 36-39 repeats. Further, we show that the LOI variant is associated with increased somatic repeat instability, highlighting this as a significant driver of this effect. These findings indicate that the number of uninterrupted CAG repeats, which is lengthened by the LOI, is the most significant contributor to AOO of HD and is more significant than polyglutamine length, which is not altered in these individuals. In addition, we identified another variant in this region, where the CAA-CAG sequence is duplicated, which was associated with later AOO. Identification of these cis-acting modifiers have potentially important implications for genetic counselling in HD-affected families. ",
        "International Expert Consensus on a Cell Therapy Communication Tool: DOSES. BACKGROUND: The lack of a standardized system for describing cell therapies acts as a barrier to advancement in clinical and basic research and practice. The aim of this study was to establish an international expert consensus on strategies to improve standardization and transparency when describing cell therapies. The secondary aim was to develop a consensus among experts on the contents of a standardized tool for describing cell therapies. METHODS: The need for expert consensus on strategies to improve cell therapy communication was confirmed at the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons/National Institutes of Health Optimizing Clinical Use of Biologics Symposium in 2018. A working group of 6 experts convened an international consensus process involving clinicians and basic scientists using validated Delphi methodology. This iterative process was used to define statements on communication of cell therapies and develop a standardized tool for describing cell therapies. RESULTS: Thirty-four experts completed 3 rounds survey with use of the Delphi process. After 3 rounds, 27 statements relating to existing nomenclature, solutions to improve communication, ideal characteristics of a framework, mandatory elements of a new framework, and future work to facilitate application reached consensus with >80% agreement and <5% disagreement. Consensus was reached on the contents of a tool for improving standardization and transparency when describing cell therapies. This tool, dubbed \"DOSES,\" is based on the reporting of 5 core items: donor (i.e., autologous, allogeneic, xenogeneic), origin of tissue, separation from other cell types/preparation method, exhibited cell characteristics associated with behavior, and the site of delivery. CONCLUSIONS: This study has established expert consensus on the communication of cell therapies. The DOSES tool has been developed to improve standardization and transparency in describing cell therapies. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The DOSES tool for describing cell therapies can be utilized by researchers, clinicians, regulators, and industry professionals to improve standardization and transparency when describing cell therapies. The use of this tool may allow clinicians and patients to better understand the characteristics of current and future cell preparations. ",
        "Molecular structure of an N-terminal phosphorylated \u03b2-amyloid fibril. The structural polymorphism in \u03b2-amyloid (A\u03b2) plaques from Alzheimer disease (AD) has been recognized as an important pathological factor. Plaques from sporadic AD patients contain fibrillar deposits of various amyloid proteins/peptides, including posttranslational modified A\u03b2 (PTM-A\u03b2) subtypes. Although many PTM-A\u03b2s were shown to accelerate the fibrillation process, increase neuronal cytotoxicity of aggregates, or enhance the stability of fibrils, the contribution of PTM-A\u03b2s to structural polymorphisms and their pathological roles remains unclear. We report here the NMR-based structure for the Ser-8-phosphorylated 40-residue A\u03b2 (pS8-A\u03b240) fibrils, which shows significant difference to the wild-type fibrils, with higher cross-seeding efficiency and thermodynamic stability. Given these physicochemical properties, the structures originated from pS8-A\u03b240 fibrils may potentially dominate the polymorphisms in the mixture of wild-type and phosphorylated A\u03b2 deposits. Our results imply that A\u03b2 subtypes with \"seeding-prone\" properties may influence the polymorphisms of amyloid plaques through the cross-seeding process. ",
        "Integration of suboptimal health status evaluation as a criterion for prediction of preeclampsia is strongly recommended for healthcare management in pregnancy: a prospective cohort study in a Ghanaian population. Background: Normotensive pregnancy may develop into preeclampsia (PE) and other adverse pregnancy complications (APCs), for which the causes are still unknown. Suboptimal health status (SHS), a physical state between health and disease, might contribute to the development and progression of PE. By integration of a routine health measure in this Ghanaian Suboptimal Health Cohort Study, we explored the usefulness of a 25-question item SHS questionnaire (SHSQ-25) for early screening and prediction of normotensive pregnant women (NTN-PW) likely to develop PE. Methods: We assessed the overall health status among a cohort of 593 NTN-PW at baseline (10-20\u00a0weeks gestation) and followed them at 21-31\u00a0weeks until 32-42\u00a0weeks. After an average of 20\u00a0weeks follow-up, 498 participants returned and were included in the final analysis. Hematobiochemical, clinical and sociodemographic data were obtained. Results: Of the 498 participants, 49.8% (248/498) had 'high SHS' at baseline (61.7% (153/248) later developed PE) and 38.3% (95/248) were NTN-PW, whereas 50.2% (250/498) had 'optimal health' (17.6% (44/250) later developed PE) and 82.4% (206/250) were NTN-PW. At baseline, high SHS score yielded a significantly (p\u2009<\u20090.05) increased adjusted odds ratio, a wider area under the curve (AUC) and a higher sensitivity and specificity for the prediction of PE (3.67; 0.898; 91.9% and 87.8%), PE coexisting with intrauterine growth restriction (2.86, 0.838; 91.5% and 75.9%), stillbirth (2.52; 0.783; 96.6% and 60.0%), hemolysis elevated liver enzymes and low platelet count (HELLP) syndrome (2.08; 0.800; 97.2% and 63.8%), acute kidney injury (2.20; 0.825; 95.3% and 70.0%) and dyslipidaemia (2.80; 0.8205; 95.7% and 68.4%) at 32-42\u00a0weeks gestation. Conclusions: High SHS score is associated with increased incidence of PE; hence, SHSQ-25 can be used independently as a risk stratification tool for adverse pregnancy outcomes thereby creating an opportunity for predictive, preventive and personalized medicine.

        "Cooked starchy food in hearths ca. 120 kya and 65 kya (MIS 5e and MIS 4) from Klasies River Cave, South Africa. Plant carbohydrates currently constitute 55-80% of the modern human diet (FAO and WHO, 1997) and some of today's key global health issues are associated with excessive carbohydrate consumption. However, starch carbohydrate is still a poorly understood element of modern human diet and our past starch diet may provide insights for future research. Despite an archaeological narrative that links our early hominin ancestors to a diet that is rich in roots and tubers, there is little deep time archaeological evidence of human plant starch consumption. Geneticists hypothesise that the duplication of starch digestion genes in early Homo sapiens (\u223c300 kya), is an adaptive response to an increased starch diet. Here we offer the earliest evidence of identified fragments of charred starch plant tissue (parenchyma) from cave and rock shelter hearths dated to Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 5e and MIS 4, from the Middle Stone Age (MSA) site of Klasies River main site, South Africa (34.06\u00b0S, 24.24\u00b0E).

        "Somatic PDGFRB Activating Variants in Fusiform Cerebral Aneurysms. The role of somatic genetic variants in the pathogenesis of intracranial-aneurysm formation is unknown. We identified a 23-year-old man with progressive, right-sided intracranial aneurysms, ipsilateral to an impressive cutaneous phenotype. The index individual underwent\u00a0a series of genetic evaluations for known connective-tissue disorders, but the evaluations were unrevealing. Paired-sample exome sequencing between blood and fibroblasts derived from the diseased areas detected a single novel variant predicted to cause a p.Tyr562Cys (g.149505130T>C [GRCh37/hg19]; c.1685A>G) change within the platelet-derived growth factor receptor \u03b2 gene (PDGFRB), a juxtamembrane-coding region. Variant-allele fractions ranged from 18.75% to 53.33% within histologically abnormal tissue,\u00a0suggesting post-zygotic or somatic mosaicism. In an independent cohort of aneurysm specimens, we detected somatic-activating PDGFRB variants in the juxtamembrane domain or the kinase activation loop in 4/6 fusiform aneurysms (and 0/38 saccular aneurysms; Fisher's exact test, p < 0.001). PDGFRB-variant, but not wild-type, patient cells were found to have overactive auto-phosphorylation with\u00a0downstream activation of ERK, SRC, and AKT. The expression of discovered variants demonstrated non-ligand-dependent auto-phosphorylation,\u00a0responsive to the kinase inhibitor sunitinib. Somatic gain-of-function variants in PDGFRB are a novel mechanism in the pathophysiology of fusiform cerebral aneurysms and suggest a potential role for targeted therapy with kinase inhibitors. ",
        "Egg consumption, cholesterol intake, and risk of incident stroke in men: the Kuopio Ischaemic Heart Disease Risk Factor Study. BACKGROUND: Epidemiologic studies suggest inverse associations between consumption of egg, a major source of dietary cholesterol, and stroke. However, the evidence of the relation remains limited, especially among carriers of apolipoprotein E4 (apoE4), which influences cholesterol metabolism. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate associations of egg and cholesterol intakes with risk of stroke and with the major stroke risk factor, blood pressure, in middle-aged and older men from eastern Finland and whether apoE phenotype could modify these associations. METHODS: A total of 1950 men aged 42-60 y in 1984-1989 were included at the baseline examinations of the prospective population-based Kuopio Ischaemic Heart Disease Risk Factor Study. Data on apoE phenotype were available for 1015 men. Dietary intakes were assessed with 4-d food records at baseline and incident stroke events were assessed by record linkage to hospital discharge registries. Cox proportional hazards regression analyses were used to estimate associations with stroke risk. Associations with baseline blood pressure were evaluated with ANCOVA. RESULTS: During the mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SD follow-up of 21.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a07.2 y, there were 217 incidences of any stroke: 166 of ischemic stroke and 55 of hemorrhagic stroke. Comparing the highest egg intake quartile with the lowest, the multivariable-adjusted HRs were 0.81 for total stroke (95% CI: 0.54, 1.23; P-trend\u00a0=\u00a00.32), 0.84 for ischemic stroke (95% CI: 0.53, 1.34; P-trend\u00a0=\u00a00.44), and 0.75 for hemorrhagic stroke (95% CI: 0.32, 1.77; P-trend\u00a0=\u00a00.40). The respective HRs for the highest cholesterol intake quartile compared with the lowest were 0.86 (95% CI: 0.57, 1.32; P-trend\u00a0=\u00a00.42), 0.74 (95% CI: 0.46, 1.20; P-trend\u00a0=\u00a00.32), and 1.10 (95% CI: 0.45, 2.66; P-trend\u00a0=\u00a00.75). Diastolic blood pressure was 1.6 mm Hg (P-trend\u00a0=\u00a00.04) lower in the highest egg intake quartile compared with the lowest, but there were no associations with systolic blood pressure or with cholesterol intake. ApoE phenotype (32% had apoE4 phenotype) did not modify the associations. CONCLUSION: Neither egg nor cholesterol intakes were associated with stroke risk in this cohort, regardless of apoE phenotype.This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as NCT03221127. ",
        "Electric Field Based Dressing Disrupts Mixed-Species Bacterial Biofilm Infection and Restores Functional Wound Healing. OBJECTIVE: This study was designed to employ electroceutical principles, as an alternative to pharmacological intervention, to manage wound biofilm infection. Mechanism of action of a United States Food and Drug Administration-cleared wireless electroceutical dressing (WED) was tested in an established porcine chronic wound polymicrobial biofilm infection model involving inoculation with Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 and Acinetobacter baumannii 19606. BACKGROUND: Bacterial biofilms represent a major wound complication. Resistance of biofilm toward pharmacologic interventions calls for alternative therapeutic strategies. Weak electric field has anti-biofilm properties. We have previously reported the development of WED involving patterned deposition of Ag and Zn on fabric. When moistened, WED generates a weak electric field without any external power supply and can be used as any other disposable dressing. METHODS: WED dressing was applied within 2\u200ahours of wound infection to test its ability to prevent biofilm formation. Alternatively, WED was applied after 7 days of infection to study disruption of established biofilm. Wounds were treated with placebo dressing or WED twice a week for 56 days. RESULTS: Scanning electron microscopy demonstrated that WED prevented and disrupted wound biofilm aggregates. WED accelerated functional wound closure by restoring skin barrier function. WED blunted biofilm-induced expression of (1) P. aeruginosa quorum sensing mvfR (pqsR), rhlR and lasR genes, and (2) miR-9 and silencing of E-cadherin. E-cadherin is critically required for skin barrier function. Furthermore, WED rescued against biofilm-induced persistent inflammation by circumventing nuclear factor kappa B activation and its downstream cytokine responses. CONCLUSION: This is the first pre-clinical porcine mechanistic study to recognize the potential of electroceuticals as an effective platform technology to combat wound biofilm infection. ",
        "Mortality in adult-onset and elderly-onset IBD: a nationwide register-based cohort study 1964-2014. OBJECTIVES: To examine all-cause and cause-specific mortality in adult-onset and elderly-onset IBD and to describe time trends in mortality over the past 50 years. DESIGN: Swedish nationwide register-based cohort study 1964-2014, comparing mortality in 82\u2009718 incident IBD cases (inpatient and non-primary outpatient care) with 10 times as many matched general population reference individuals (n=801\u2009180) using multivariable Cox regression to estimate HRs. Among patients with IBD, the number of participants with elderly-onset (\u226560 years) IBD was 17\u2009873. RESULTS: During 984\u2009330 person-years of follow-up, 15 698/82 718 (19%) of all patients with IBD died (15.9/1000 person-years) compared with 121 095/801 180 (15.1%) of reference individuals, corresponding to an HR of 1.5 for IBD (95% CI=1.5\u2009to 1.5 (HR=1.5; 95% CI=1.5 to 1.5 in elderly-onset IBD)) or one extra death each year per 263 patients. Mortality was increased specifically for UC (HR=1.4; 95% CI=1.4 to 1.5), Crohn's disease (HR=1.6; 95% CI=1.6 to 1.7) and IBD-unclasssified (HR=1.6; 95% CI=1.5 to 1.8). IBD was linked to increased rates of multiple causes of death, including cardiovascular disease (HR=1.3; 1.3 to 1.3), malignancy (HR=1.4; 1.4 to 1.5) and digestive disease (HR=5.2; 95% CI=4.9 to 5.5). Relative mortality during the first 5 years of follow-up decreased significantly over time. Incident cases of 2002-2014 had 2.3 years shorter mean estimated life span than matched comparators. CONCLUSIONS: Adult-onset and elderly-onset patients with UC, Crohn's disease and IBD-unclassified were all at increased risk of death. The increased mortality remained also after the introduction of biological therapies but has decreased over time. ",
        "Prediabetes and Risk for Cardiac Death Among Patients With Coronary Artery Disease: The ARTEMIS Study. OBJECTIVE: To compare cardiac mortality in patients with CAD and prediabetes with that in CAD patients with normal glycemic status and type 2 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The Innovation to Reduce Cardiovascular Complications of Diabetes at the Intersection (ARTEMIS) study included patients with CAD after revascularization (79%), optimal medical therapy, or both. Patients had type 2 diabetes (n = 834), impaired glucose tolerance (IGT; n = 314), impaired fasting glucose (IFG; n = 103), or normal glycemic status (n = 697) as defined on the basis of the results of an oral glucose tolerance test. The primary end point was cardiac death. Major adverse cardiac event (MACE: cardiac death, heart failure, or acute coronary syndrome) and all-cause mortality were secondary end points. RESULTS: During a mean \u00b1 SD follow-up of 6.3 \u00b1 1.6 years, 101 cardiac deaths, 385 MACEs, and 208 deaths occurred. Patients with IGT tended to have 49% lower adjusted risk for cardiac death (P = 0.069), 32% lower adjusted risk for all-cause mortality (P = 0.076), and 36% lower adjusted risk for MACE (P = 0.011) than patients with type 2 diabetes. The patients with IFG had 82% lower adjusted risk for all-cause mortality (P = 0.015) than the patients with type 2 diabetes, whereas risks for cardiac death and MACE did not differ significantly between the two groups. The adjusted risks for cardiac death, MACE, and all-cause mortality among patients with IGT and IFG did not significantly differ from those risks among patients with normal glycemic status. CONCLUSIONS: Cardiac mortality or incidence of MACE in patients with CAD with prediabetes (i.e., IGT or IFG after revascularization, optimal medical therapy, or both) does not differ from those values in patients with normal glycemic status.

        "Early Neuromuscular Blockade in the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome. BACKGROUND: The benefits of early continuous neuromuscular blockade in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) who are receiving mechanical ventilation remain unclear. METHODS: We randomly assigned patients with moderate-to-severe ARDS (defined by a ratio of the partial pressure of arterial oxygen to the fraction of inspired oxygen of <150 mm Hg with a positive end-expiratory pressure [PEEP] of \u22658 cm of water) to a 48-hour continuous infusion of cisatracurium with concomitant deep sedation (intervention group) or to a usual-care approach without routine neuromuscular blockade and with lighter sedation targets (control group). The same mechanical-ventilation strategies were used in both groups, including a strategy involving a high PEEP. The primary end point was in-hospital death from any cause at 90 days. RESULTS: The trial was stopped at the second interim analysis for futility. We enrolled 1006 patients early after the onset of moderate-to-severe ARDS (median, 7.6 hours after onset). During the first 48 hours after randomization, 488 of the 501 patients (97.4%) in the intervention group started a continuous infusion of cisatracurium (median duration of infusion, 47.8 hours; median dose, 1807 mg), and 86 of the 505 patients (17.0%) in the control group received a neuromuscular blocking agent (median dose, 38 mg). At 90 days, 213 patients (42.5%) in the intervention group and 216 (42.8%) in the control group had died before hospital discharge (between-group difference, -0.3 percentage points; 95% confidence interval, -6.4 to 5.9; P\u2009=\u20090.93). While in the hospital, patients in the intervention group were less physically active and had more adverse cardiovascular events than patients in the control group. There were no consistent between-group differences in end points assessed at 3, 6, and 12 months. CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with moderate-to-severe ARDS who were treated with a strategy involving a high PEEP, there was no significant difference in mortality at 90 days between patients who received an early and continuous cisatracurium infusion and those who were treated with a usual-care approach with lighter sedation targets.

        "Associations of extracurricular physical activity patterns and body composition components in a multi-ethnic population of UK children (the Size and Lung Function in Children study): a multilevel modelling analysis. BACKGROUND: Body Mass Index (BMI) is a common outcome when assessing associations between childhood overweight and obesity and physical activity patterns. However, the fat and fat-free components of BMI, measured by the Fat Mass Index (FMI) and Fat-Free Mass Index (FFMI), may show contrasting associations with physical activity, while ethnic groups may vary in both physical activity patterns and body composition. Body composition must therefore be evaluated when assessing the associations between childhood overweight and obesity and physical activity in multi-ethnic populations. METHODS: This cross-sectional study investigated associations of BMI, FMI and FFMI z-scores with extracurricular physical activity for 2171 London primary schoolchildren (aged 5-11\u2009years) of black, South Asian and white/other ethnicity. Multilevel mixed-effects ordered logistic modelling was used, adjusting for age, sex and family and neighbourhood socioeconomic status as potential confounders. RESULTS: Controlling for ethnicity and individual, family and neighbourhood socioeconomic confounders, actively commuting children had significantly lower Odds Ratios for being in high\u00a0BMI (Odds Ratio\u00a0(OR)\u2009=\u20090.678; 95\u2009%\u2009Confidence Interval\u00a0(CI)\u2009=\u20090.531\u2009-\u20090.865; p\u2009-\u2009value\u2009=\u20090.002) and FMI z-score\u00a0groups (OR =\u20090.679; 95\u2009%\u2009CI\u2009=\u20090.499\u2009-\u20090.922; p\u2009=\u20090.013), but not FFMI z-score\u00a0groups, than passive commuters. Children doing sports less than once a week had lower\u00a0Odds Ratios for being in high BMI (OR =\u20090.435; 95\u2009%\u2009CI\u2009=\u20090.236\u2009-\u20090.802; p\u2009=\u20090.008) and FFMI (OR =\u20090.455; 95\u2009%\u2009CI\u2009=\u20090.214\u2009-\u20090.969; p\u2009=\u2009.041) z-score\u00a0categories compared to daily active children. Differences in FMI between groups did not reach the significance threshold. A trend towards statistical significance was obtained whereby children's complete inactivity was associated with higher odds for\u00a0being in\u00a0higher BMI (OR =\u20092.222\u2009:\u200995\u2009%\u2009CI\u2009=\u20090.977\u2009-\u20095.052; p\u2009=\u2009.057) and FMI z-score\u00a0groups (OR =\u20092.485\u2009:\u200995\u2009%\u2009CI\u2009=\u20090.961\u2009-\u20096.429; p\u2009=\u2009.060). FFMI z-scores did not show a similar trend with complete inactivity. CONCLUSIONS: Active commuting was objectively associated with lower adiposity, while more frequent extracurricular sports participation was correlated with greater fat-free mass accretion. These relationships were independent of ethnicity and individual, family or neighbourhood socioeconomic confounding factors. ",
        "Risks and clinical predictors of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma diagnoses in adults with diagnosed NAFLD: real-world study of 18 million patients in four European cohorts. BACKGROUND: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a common condition that progresses in some patients to steatohepatitis (NASH), cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Here we used healthcare records of 18 million adults to estimate risk of acquiring advanced liver disease diagnoses in patients with NAFLD or NASH compared to individually matched controls. METHODS: Data were extracted from four European primary care databases representing the UK, Netherlands, Italy and Spain. Patients with a recorded diagnosis of NAFLD or NASH (NAFLD/NASH) were followed up for incident cirrhosis and HCC diagnoses. Each coded NAFLD/NASH patient was matched to up to 100 \"non-NAFLD\" patients by practice site, gender, age\u2009\u00b1\u20095\u2009years and visit recorded within \u00b1\u20096\u2009months. Hazard ratios (HR) were estimated using Cox models adjusted for age and smoking status and pooled across databases by random effects meta-analyses. RESULTS: Out of 18,782,281 adults, we identified 136,703 patients with coded NAFLD/NASH. Coded NAFLD/NASH patients were more likely to have diabetes, hypertension and obesity than matched controls. HR for cirrhosis in patients compared to controls was 4.73 (95% CI 2.43-9.19) and for HCC, 3.51 (95% CI 1.72-7.16). HR for either outcome was higher in patients with NASH and those with high-risk Fib-4 scores. The strongest independent predictor of a diagnosis of HCC or cirrhosis was baseline diagnosis of diabetes. CONCLUSIONS: Real-world population data show that recorded diagnosis of NAFLD/NASH increases risk of life-threatening liver outcomes. Diabetes is an independent predictor of advanced liver disease diagnosis, emphasising the need to identify specific groups of patients at highest risk. ",
        "Derivation, Validation, and Potential Treatment Implications of Novel Clinical Phenotypes for Sepsis. Importance: Sepsis is a heterogeneous syndrome. Identification of distinct clinical phenotypes may allow more precise therapy and improve care. Objective: To derive sepsis phenotypes from clinical data, determine their reproducibility and correlation with host-response biomarkers and clinical outcomes, and assess the potential causal relationship with results from randomized clinical trials (RCTs). Design, Settings, and Participants: Retrospective analysis of data sets using statistical, machine learning, and simulation tools. Phenotypes were derived among 20\u202f189 total patients (16\u202f552 unique patients) who met Sepsis-3 criteria within 6 hours of hospital presentation at 12 Pennsylvania hospitals (2010-2012) using consensus k means clustering applied to 29 variables. Reproducibility and correlation with biological parameters and clinical outcomes were assessed in a second database (2013-2014; n\u2009=\u200943\u202f086 total patients and n\u2009=\u200931\u202f160 unique patients), in a prospective cohort study of sepsis due to pneumonia (n\u2009=\u2009583), and in 3 sepsis RCTs (n\u2009=\u20094737). Exposures: All clinical and laboratory variables in the electronic health record. Main Outcomes and Measures: Derived phenotype (\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3, and \u03b4) frequency, host-response biomarkers, 28-day and 365-day mortality, and RCT simulation outputs. Results: The derivation cohort included 20\u202f189 patients with sepsis (mean age, 64 [SD, 17] years; 10\u202f022 [50%] male; mean maximum 24-hour Sequential Organ Failure Assessment [SOFA] score, 3.9 [SD, 2.4]). The validation cohort included 43\u202f086 patients (mean age, 67 [SD, 17] years; 21\u202f993 [51%] male; mean maximum 24-hour SOFA score, 3.6 [SD, 2.0]). Of the 4 derived phenotypes, the \u03b1 phenotype was the most common (n\u2009=\u20096625; 33%) and included patients with the lowest administration of a vasopressor; in the \u03b2 phenotype (n\u2009=\u20095512; 27%), patients were older and had more chronic illness and renal dysfunction; in the \u03b3 phenotype (n\u2009=\u20095385; 27%), patients had more inflammation and pulmonary dysfunction; and in the \u03b4 phenotype (n\u2009=\u20092667; 13%), patients had more liver dysfunction and septic shock. Phenotype distributions were similar in the validation cohort. There were consistent differences in biomarker patterns by phenotype. In the derivation cohort, cumulative 28-day mortality was 287 deaths of 5691 unique patients (5%) for the \u03b1 phenotype; 561 of 4420 (13%) for the \u03b2 phenotype; 1031 of 4318 (24%) for the \u03b3 phenotype; and 897 of 2223 (40%) for the \u03b4 phenotype. Across all cohorts and trials, 28-day and 365-day mortality were highest among the \u03b4 phenotype vs the other 3 phenotypes (P\u2009<\u2009.001). In simulation models, the proportion of RCTs reporting benefit, harm, or no effect changed considerably (eg, varying the phenotype frequencies within an RCT of early goal-directed therapy changed the results from >33% chance of benefit to >60% chance of harm). Conclusions and Relevance: In this retrospective analysis of data sets from patients with sepsis, 4 clinical phenotypes were identified that correlated with host-response patterns and clinical outcomes, and simulations suggested these phenotypes may help in understanding heterogeneity of treatment effects. Further research is needed to determine the utility of these phenotypes in clinical care and for informing trial design and interpretation. ",
        "Systemic GDF11 stimulates the secretion of adiponectin and induces a calorie restriction-like phenotype in aged mice. Aging is a negative regulator of general homeostasis, tissue function, and regeneration. Changes in organismal energy levels and physiology, through systemic manipulations such as calorie restriction and young blood infusion, can regenerate tissue activity and increase lifespan in aged mice. However, whether these two systemic manipulations could be linked has never been investigated. Here, we report that systemic GDF11 triggers a calorie restriction-like phenotype without affecting appetite or GDF15 levels in the blood, restores the insulin/IGF-1 signaling pathway, and stimulates adiponectin secretion from white adipose tissue by direct action on adipocytes, while repairing neurogenesis in the aged brain. These findings suggest that GDF11 has a pleiotropic effect on an organismal level and that it could be a linking mechanism of rejuvenation between heterochronic parabiosis and calorie restriction. As such, GDF11 could be considered as an important therapeutic candidate for age-related neurodegenerative and metabolic disorders. ",
        "High-Sensitivity Troponin I and Incident Coronary Events, Stroke, Heart Failure Hospitalization, and Mortality in the ARIC Study. BACKGROUND: We assessed whether plasma troponin I measured by a high-sensitivity assay (hs-TnI) is associated with incident cardiovascular disease (CVD) and mortality in a community-based sample without prior CVD. METHODS: ARIC study (Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities) participants aged 54 to 74 years without baseline CVD were included in this study (n=8121). Cox proportional hazards models were constructed to determine associations between hs-TnI and incident coronary heart disease (CHD; myocardial infarction and fatal CHD), ischemic stroke, atherosclerotic CVD (CHD and stroke), heart failure hospitalization, global CVD (atherosclerotic CVD and heart failure), and all-cause mortality. The comparative association of hs-TnI and high-sensitivity troponin T with incident CVD events was also evaluated. Risk prediction models were constructed to assess prediction improvement when hs-TnI was added to traditional risk factors used in the Pooled Cohort Equation. RESULTS: The median follow-up period was \u224815 years. Detectable hs-TnI levels were observed in 85% of the study population. In adjusted models, in comparison to low hs-TnI (lowest quintile, hs-TnI \u22641.3 ng/L), elevated hs-TnI (highest quintile, hs-TnI \u22653.8 ng/L) was associated with greater incident CHD (hazard ratio [HR], 2.20; 95% CI, 1.64-2.95), ischemic stroke (HR, 2.99; 95% CI, 2.01-4.46), atherosclerotic CVD (HR, 2.36; 95% CI, 1.86-3.00), heart failure hospitalization (HR, 4.20; 95% CI, 3.28-5.37), global CVD (HR, 3.01; 95% CI, 2.50-3.63), and all-cause mortality (HR, 1.83; 95% CI, 1.56-2.14). hs-TnI was observed to have a stronger association with incident global CVD events in white than in black individuals and a stronger association with incident CHD in women than in men. hs-TnI and high-sensitivity troponin T were only modestly correlated ( r=0.47) and were complementary in prediction of incident CVD events, with elevation of both troponins conferring the highest risk in comparison with elevation in either one alone. The addition of hs-TnI to the Pooled Cohort Equation model improved risk prediction for atherosclerotic CVD, heart failure, and global CVD. CONCLUSIONS: Elevated hs-TnI is strongly associated with increased global CVD incidence in the general population independent of traditional risk factors. hs-TnI and high-sensitivity troponin T provide complementary rather than redundant information.

        "Extracellular vesicle microRNA quantification from plasma using an integrated microfluidic device. Extracellular vesicles (EV) containing microRNAs (miRNAs) have tremendous potential as biomarkers for the early detection of disease. Here, we present a simple and rapid PCR-free integrated microfluidics platform capable of absolute quantification (<10% uncertainty) of both free-floating miRNAs and EV-miRNAs in plasma\u00a0with 1\u2009pM detection sensitivity. The assay time is only 30 minutes as opposed to 13\u2009h and requires only ~20\u2009\u03bcL of sample\u00a0as oppose to 1\u2009mL for conventional RT-qPCR techniques. The platform integrates a surface acoustic wave (SAW) EV lysing microfluidic chip with a concentration and sensing microfluidic chip incorporating an electrokinetic membrane sensor that is based on non-equilibrium ionic currents. Unlike conventional RT-qPCR methods, this technology does not require EV extraction, RNA purification, reverse transcription, or amplification. This platform can be easily extended for other RNA and DNA targets of interest, thus providing a viable screening tool for early disease diagnosis, prognosis, and monitoring of therapeutic response.

        "Where are we now in relation to determining the prevalence of ageism in this era of escalating population ageing?. Population ageing is escalating rapidly now worldwide. This is an important time to determine if ageism or discrimination against older people is of concern, such as it being prevalent and/or increasing in prevalence. Over the years, many ageism measurement tools have been developed, with research findings from their use of prime consideration then for determining the prevalence of ageism and any prevalence trends. All print and open access English-language research articles published in 1953+ that used one or more ageism measurement tools in a study were sought using the Directory of Open Access Journals and EBSCO Discovery Service. A total of 25 ageism measurement tools were identified. However, only six had been used one or more times to measure the prevalence of ageism. The identified prevalence levels varied considerably, but most investigations using small convenience samples, with limited generalizability of findings. This paper highlights the need to continue developing ageism measurement tools to estimate ageism or use other measures, such as census and population-representative polling, to assess the extent and impact of ageism. This foundational measurement is needed, as ageism could be prevalent and growing in effect. ",
        "The coronavirus macrodomain is required to prevent PARP-mediated inhibition of virus replication and enhancement of IFN expression. ADP-ribosylation is a ubiquitous post-translational addition of either monomers or polymers of ADP-ribose to target proteins by ADP-ribosyltransferases, usually by interferon-inducible diphtheria toxin-like enzymes known as PARPs. While several PARPs have known antiviral activities, these activities are mostly independent of ADP-ribosylation. Consequently, less is known about the antiviral effects of ADP-ribosylation. Several viral families, including Coronaviridae, Togaviridae, and Hepeviridae, encode for macrodomain proteins that bind to and hydrolyze ADP-ribose from proteins and are critical for optimal replication and virulence. These results suggest that macrodomains counter cellular ADP-ribosylation, but whether PARPs or, alternatively, other ADP-ribosyltransferases cause this modification is not clear. Here we show that pan-PARP inhibition enhanced replication and inhibited interferon production in primary macrophages infected with macrodomain-mutant but not wild-type coronavirus. Specifically, knockdown of two abundantly expressed PARPs, PARP12 and PARP14, led to increased replication of mutant but did not significantly affect wild-type virus. PARP14 was also important for the induction of interferon in mouse and human cells, indicating a critical role for this PARP in the regulation of innate immunity. In summary, these data demonstrate that the macrodomain is required to prevent PARP-mediated inhibition of coronavirus replication and enhancement of interferon production. ",
        "BRD4 Regulates Metastatic Potential of Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer through AHNAK. The inevitable progression of advanced prostate cancer to castration resistance, and ultimately to lethal metastatic disease, depends on primary or acquired resistance to conventional androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) and accumulated resistance strategies to evade androgen receptor (AR) suppression. In prostate cancer cells, AR adaptations that arise in response to ADT are not singular, but diverse, and include gene amplification, mutation, and even complete loss of receptor expression. Collectively, each of these AR adaptations contributes to a complex, heterogeneous, ADT-resistant tumor. Here, we examined prostate cancer cell lines that model common castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) subtypes, each with different AR composition, and focused on novel regulators of tumor progression, the Bromodomain and Extraterminal (BET) family of proteins. We found that BRD4 regulates cell migration across all models of CRPC, regardless of aggressiveness and AR status, whereas BRD2 and BRD3 only regulate migration and invasion in less aggressive models that retain AR expression or signaling. BRD4, a coregulator of gene transcription, controls migration and invasion through transcription of AHNAK, a large scaffolding protein linked to promotion of metastasis in a diverse set of cancers. Furthermore, treatment of CRPC cell lines with low doses of MZ1, a small-molecule, BRD4-selective degrader, inhibits metastatic potential. Overall, these results reveal a novel BRD4-AHNAK pathway that may be targetable to treat metastatic CRPC (mCRPC). IMPLICATIONS: BRD4 functions as the dominant regulator of CRPC cell migration and invasion through direct transcriptional regulation of AHNAK, which together offer a novel targetable pathway to treat metastatic CRPC.Visual Overview: http://mcr.aacrjournals.org/content/molcanres/17/8/1627/F1.large.jpg.

        "Myo-inositol mediates the effects of traffic-related air pollution on generalized anxiety symptoms at age 12\u202fyears. BACKGROUND: Exposure to traffic-related air pollution (TRAP) has been linked to childhood anxiety symptoms. Neuroimaging in patients with anxiety disorders indicate altered neurochemistry. OBJECTIVES: Evaluate the impact of TRAP on brain metabolism and its relation to childhood anxiety symptoms in the Cincinnati Childhood Allergy and Air Pollution Study (CCAAPS). METHODS: Adolescents (n\u202f=\u202f145) underwent magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Brain metabolites, including myo-inositol, N-acetylaspartate, creatine, choline, glutamate, glutamate plus glutamine, and glutathione were measured in the anterior cingulate cortex. Anxiety symptoms were assessed using the Spence Children's Anxiety Scale. TRAP exposure in early-life, averaged over childhood, and during the 12 months prior to imaging was estimated using a validated land use regression model. Associations between TRAP exposure, brain metabolism, and anxiety symptoms were estimated using linear regression and a bootstrapping approach for testing mediation by brain metabolite levels. RESULTS: Recent exposure to high levels of TRAP was associated with significant increases in myo-inositol (\u03b2\u202f=\u202f0.26; 95%CI 0.01, 0.51) compared to low TRAP exposure. Recent elevated TRAP exposure (\u03b2\u202f=\u202f4.71; 95% CI 0.95, 8.45) and increased myo-inositol levels (\u03b2\u202f=\u202f2.98; 95% CI 0.43, 5.52) were also significantly associated with increased generalized anxiety symptoms with 12% of the total effect between TRAP and generalized anxiety symptoms being mediated by myo-inositol levels. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study of children to utilize neuroimaging to link TRAP exposure, metabolite dysregulation in the brain, and generalized anxiety symptoms among otherwise healthy children. TRAP may elicit atypical excitatory neurotransmission and glial inflammatory responses leading to increased metabolite levels and subsequent anxiety symptoms. ",
        "Autonomic responses induced by aerobic submaximal exercise in obese and overweight adolescents. BACKGROUND: Graded exercises tests are performed in adult populations; nonetheless, the use of this type of assessment is greatly understudied in overweight and obese adolescents. OBJECTIVE: To investigate heart rate autonomic responses to submaximal aerobic exercise in obese and overweight adolescents. METHODS: We recruited 40 adolescents divided into two groups: (1) overweight group comprising 10 boys and 10 girls between Z-score +1 and +2 and (2) obese group comprising 10 boys and 10 girls above Z-score &gt;+2. Heart rate variability was analysed before (T1) and after exercise (T2-T4) on treadmill at a slope of 0%, with 70% of the maximal estimated heart rate (220 - age) for 20 minutes. RESULTS: Heart rate in the overweight group was: 93.2\u00b110.52 bpm versus 120.8\u00b113.49 bpm versus 94.6\u00b111.65 bpm versus 93.0\u00b19.23 bpm, and in the obese group was: 92.0\u00b115.41 bpm versus 117.6\u00b116.31 bpm versus 92.1\u00b112.9 bpm versus 91.8\u00b114.33 bpm. High frequency in the overweight group was: 640\u00b1633.1 ms2 versus 84\u00b1174.66 ms2 versus 603.5\u00b1655.31 ms2 versus 762.6\u00b1807.21 ms2, and in the obese group was: 628.4\u00b1779.81 ms2 versus 65.4\u00b1119.34 ms2 versus 506.2\u00b1482.70 ms2 versus 677.9\u00b1939.05 ms2; and root mean square of successive differences in the overweight group was: 37.9\u00b118.81 ms versus 10.9\u00b18.41 ms versus 32.8\u00b124.07 ms versus 36.7\u00b121.86 ms, and in the obese group was: 38.7\u00b123.17 ms versus 11.5\u00b18.62 ms versus 32.3\u00b116.74 ms versus 37.3\u00b124.21 ms. These values significantly changed during exercise compared with resting values in overweight and obese groups. Moreover, we also reported no significant difference of resting parasympathetic control of heart rate between obese and overweight adolescents. CONCLUSION: There was no significant difference of autonomic responses elicited by submaximal aerobic exercise between overweight and obese adolescents. ",
        "Time-of-Day-Dependent Trafficking and Function of Leukocyte Subsets. The number of leukocytes circulating in blood in mammals is under circadian control (i.e., \u223c24h). We summarize here latest findings on the mechanisms governing leukocyte migration from the blood into various organs, focusing on the distinct leukocyte subtype- and tissue-specific molecules involved. We highlight the oscillatory expression patterns of adhesion molecules, chemokines, and their receptors that are expressed on endothelial cells and leukocytes, and which are crucial regulators of rhythmic leukocyte recruitment. We also discuss the relevance of clock genes for leukocyte function and migration. Finally, we compare immune cell rhythms under steady-state conditions as well as during inflammation and disease, and we postulate how these findings provide potential new avenues for therapeutic intervention.

        "Characterization of Glycolytic Enzymes and Pyruvate Kinase M2 in Type 1 and 2 Diabetic Nephropathy. OBJECTIVE: Elevated glycolytic enzymes in renal glomeruli correlated with preservation of renal function in the Medalist Study, individuals with \u226550 years of type 1 diabetes. Specifically, pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) activation protected insulin-deficient diabetic mice from hyperglycemia-induced glomerular pathology. This study aims to extend these findings in a separate cohort of individuals with type 1 and type 2 diabetes and discover new circulatory biomarkers for renal protection through proteomics and metabolomics of Medalists' plasma. We hypothesize that increased glycolytic flux and improved mitochondrial biogenesis will halt the progression of diabetic nephropathy. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Immunoblots analyzed selected glycolytic and mitochondrial enzymes in postmortem glomeruli of non-Medalists with type 1 diabetes (n = 15), type 2 diabetes (n = 19), and no diabetes (n = 5). Plasma proteomic (SOMAscan) (n = 180) and metabolomic screens (n = 214) of Medalists with and without stage 3b chronic kidney disease (CKD) were conducted and significant markers validated by ELISA. RESULTS: Glycolytic (PKM1, PKM2, and ENO1) and mitochondrial (MTCO2) enzymes were significantly elevated in glomeruli of CKD- versus CKD+ individuals with type 2 diabetes. Medalists' plasma PKM2 correlated with estimated glomerular filtration rate (r2 = 0.077; P = 0.0002). Several glucose and mitochondrial enzymes in circulation were upregulated with corresponding downregulation of toxic metabolites in CKD-protected Medalists. Amyloid precursor protein was also significantly upregulated, tumor necrosis factor receptors downregulated, and both confirmed by ELISA. CONCLUSIONS: Elevation of enzymes involved in the metabolism of intracellular free glucose and its metabolites in renal glomeruli is connected to preserving kidney function in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. The renal profile of elevated glycolytic enzymes and reduced toxic glucose metabolites is reflected in the circulation, supporting their use as biomarkers for endogenous renal protective factors in people with diabetes.

        "Direct visualization of avian influenza H5N1 hemagglutinin precursor and its conformational change by high-speed atomic force microscopy. BACKGROUND: Hemagglutinin (HA) of influenza A is one of the key virulence factors that mediates the release of viral components in host cells. HA is initially synthesized as a trimeric precursor (HA0) and then it is cleaved by proteases to become a functional HA. Low pH induces irreversible conformational changes in both HA0 and HA but only HA is fusion compatible. Here, we used high-speed atomic force microscopy (HS-AFM) to record conformational changes in HA0 trimers (H5N1) from neutral to acidic conditions at a millisecond scale. METHODS: Purified HA0 protein was diluted with either neutral Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) or acetic acid-titrated Tris-HCl (pH\u202f5.0) and then loaded onto bare mica. Neutral or acidic Tris-HCl was used as the scanning buffer. HS-AFM movies were recorded and processed using Image J software. RESULTS: The conformation of HA0neutral visualized using HS-AFM was comparable to the HA trimer structures depicted in the PDB data and the AFM simulator. HA0 underwent rapid conformational changes under low pH condition. The circularity and area of HA0acid were significantly higher than in HA0neutral. In contrast, the height of HA0acid was significantly lower than in HA0neutral. CONCLUSIONS: We have captured real-time images of the native HA0 trimer structure under physiological conditions using HS-AFM. By analyzing the images, we confirm that HA0 trimer is sensitive to acidic conditions. GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: The dynamic nature of the HA structure, particularly in the host endosome, is essential for H5N1 infectivity. Understanding this acidic behavior is imperative for designing therapeutic strategies against H5N1. This article reports a sophisticated new tool for studying the spatiotemporal dynamics of the HA precursor protein. ",
        "Prevalence of Survival Without Major Comorbidities Among Adults Born Prematurely. Importance: Preterm birth has been associated with cardiometabolic, respiratory, and neuropsychiatric disorders in adulthood. However, the prevalence of survival without any major comorbidities is unknown. Objective: To determine the prevalence of survival without major comorbidities in adulthood among persons born preterm vs full-term. Design, Setting, and Participants: National cohort study of all 2\u202f566\u202f699 persons born in Sweden from January 1, 1973, through December 31, 1997, who had gestational age data and who were followed up for survival and comorbidities through December 31, 2015 (ages 18-43 years). Exposures: Gestational age at birth. Main Outcomes and Measures: Survival without major comorbidities among persons born extremely preterm (22-27 weeks), very preterm (28-33 weeks), late preterm (34-36 weeks), or early term (37-38 weeks), compared with full-term (39-41 weeks). Comorbidities were defined using the Adolescent and Young Adult Health Outcomes and Patient Experience (AYA HOPE) Comorbidity Index, which includes conditions that commonly manifest in adolescence or young adulthood, including neuropsychiatric disorders; and the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), which includes major chronic disorders predictive of mortality in adulthood. Poisson regression was used to determine prevalence ratios and differences, adjusted for potential confounders. Results: In this study population, 48.6% were female, 5.8% were born preterm, and the median age at end of follow-up was 29.8 years (interquartile range, 12.6 years). Of all persons born preterm, 54.6% were alive with no AYA HOPE comorbidities at the end of follow-up. Further stratified, this prevalence was 22.3% for those born extremely preterm, 48.5% for very preterm, 58.0% for late preterm, 61.2% for early term, and 63.0% for full-term. These prevalences were significantly lower for earlier gestational ages vs full-term (eg, adjusted prevalence ratios: extremely preterm, 0.35 [95% CI, 0.33 to 0.36; P\u2009<\u2009.001]; all preterm, 0.86 [95% CI, 0.85 to 0.86; P\u2009<\u2009.001]; adjusted prevalence differences: extremely preterm, -0.41 [95% CI, -0.42 to -0.40; P\u2009<\u2009.001]; all preterm, -0.09 [95% CI, -0.09 to -0.09; P\u2009<\u2009.001]). Using the CCI, the corresponding prevalences were 73.1% (all preterm), 32.5% (extremely preterm), 66.4% (very preterm), 77.1% (late preterm), 80.4% (early term), and 81.8% (full-term) (adjusted prevalence ratios: extremely preterm, 0.39 [95% CI, 0.38 to 0.41; P\u2009<\u2009.001]; all preterm, 0.89 [95% CI, 0.89 to 0.89; P\u2009<\u2009.001]; adjusted prevalence differences: extremely preterm, -0.50 [95% CI, -0.51 to -0.49; P\u2009<\u2009.001]; all preterm, -0.09 [95% CI, -0.09 to -0.09; P\u2009<\u2009.001]). Conclusions and Relevance: Among persons born preterm in Sweden between 1973 and 1997, the majority survived to early to mid-adulthood without major comorbidities. However, outcomes were worse for those born extremely preterm. ",
        "Direct interaction of whole-inactivated influenza A and pneumococcal vaccines enhances influenza-specific immunity. The upper respiratory tract is continuously exposed to a vast array of potentially pathogenic viruses and bacteria. Influenza A virus (IAV) has particular synergism with the commensal bacterium Streptococcus pneumoniae in this niche, and co-infection exacerbates pathogenicity and causes significant mortality. However, it is not known whether this synergism is associated with a direct interaction between the two pathogens. We have previously reported that co-administration of a whole-inactivated IAV vaccine (\u03b3-Flu) with a whole-inactivated pneumococcal vaccine (\u03b3-PN) enhances pneumococcal-specific responses. In this study, we show that mucosal co-administration of \u03b3-Flu and \u03b3-PN similarly augments IAV-specific immunity, particularly tissue-resident memory cell responses in the lung. In addition, our in vitro analysis revealed that S. pneumoniae directly interacts with both \u03b3-Flu and with live IAV, facilitating increased uptake by macrophages as well as increased infection of epithelial cells by IAV. These observations provide an additional explanation for the synergistic pathogenicity of IAV and S. pneumoniae, as well as heralding the prospect of exploiting the phenomenon to develop better vaccine strategies for both pathogens.

        "Prevalence, intensity and risk factors of tungiasis in Kilifi County, Kenya II: Results from a school-based observational study. INTRODUCTION: Awareness of the public health importance of tungiasis has been growing in East Africa in recent years, but data on epidemiological characteristics necessary for the planning and implementation of control measures do not exist. The work presented here was part of a larger cross-sectional study on the epidemiology of tungiasis in coastal Kenya and aims at identifying risk factors of tungiasis and severe disease in school children. METHODS: A total of 1,829 students of all age groups from five schools and 56 classes were clinically examined for tungiasis on their feet based on standardized procedures and observations made about the school infrastructure. To investigate the impact of school holidays, observations were repeated after school holidays in a subset of children in one school. In an embedded case-control study, structured interviews were conducted with 707 students in the five schools to investigate associations between tungiasis and household infrastructure, behaviour and socio-economic status. RESULTS: The overall prevalence of tungiasis was 48%; children below the age of 15 years were the most affected, and boys were twice as likely as girls to be infected. The highest risk of disease was associated with the socio-economic circumstances of the individual student at home. The study indicated that mild to moderate tungiasis could be reduced by a third, and severe tungiasis by over half, if sleeping places of children had hardened floors, whilst approximately a seventh of the cases could be prevented by sealing classroom floors in schools, and another fifth by using soap for daily feet washing. CONCLUSION: There is a clear role for public health workers to expand the WASH policy to include washing of feet with soap in school-aged children to fight tungiasis and to raise awareness of the importance of sealed floors.

        "Traffic Crashes, Violations, and Suspensions Among Young Drivers With ADHD. OBJECTIVES: To compare monthly rates of specific types of crashes, violations, and license suspensions over the first years of licensure for drivers with and without attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). METHODS: We identified patients of New Jersey primary care locations of the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia who were born in 1987-1997, were New Jersey residents, had their last primary care visit at age \u226512 years, and acquired a driver's license (N = 14\u2009936). Electronic health records were linked to New Jersey's licensing, crash, and violation databases. ADHD diagnosis was based on International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification diagnostic codes. We calculated monthly per-driver rates of crashes (at fault, alcohol related, nighttime, and with peers), violations, and suspensions. Adjusted rate ratios were estimated by using repeated-measures Poisson regression. RESULTS: Crash rates were higher for drivers with ADHD regardless of licensing age and, in particular, during the first month of licensure (adjusted rate ratio: 1.62 [95% confidence interval: 1.18-2.23]). They also experienced higher rates of specific crash types: their 4-year rate of alcohol-related crashes was 2.1 times that of drivers without ADHD. Finally, drivers with ADHD had higher rates of moving violations (for speeding, seat belt nonuse, and electronic equipment use) and suspensions. In the first year of driving, the rate of alcohol and/or drug violations was 3.6 times higher for adolescents with ADHD. CONCLUSIONS: Adolescents with ADHD are at particularly high crash risk in their initial months of licensure, and engagement in preventable risky driving behaviors may contribute to this elevated risk. Comprehensive preventive approaches that extend beyond current recommendations are critically needed. ",
        "Ultra-Processed Diets Cause Excess Calorie Intake and Weight Gain: An Inpatient Randomized Controlled Trial of Ad Libitum Food Intake. We investigated whether ultra-processed foods affect energy intake in 20 weight-stable adults, aged (mean\u00a0\u00b1 SE) 31.2\u00a0\u00b1 1.6 years and BMI\u00a0= 27\u00a0\u00b1 1.5\u00a0kg/m2. Subjects were admitted to the NIH Clinical Center and randomized to receive either ultra-processed or unprocessed diets for 2\u00a0weeks immediately followed by the alternate diet for 2\u00a0weeks. Meals were designed to be matched for presented calories, energy density, macronutrients, sugar, sodium, and fiber. Subjects were instructed to consume as much or as little as desired. Energy intake was greater during the ultra-processed diet (508\u00a0\u00b1 106\u00a0kcal/day; p\u00a0= 0.0001), with increased consumption of carbohydrate (280\u00a0\u00b1 54\u00a0kcal/day; p\u00a0< 0.0001) and fat (230\u00a0\u00b1 53\u00a0kcal/day; p\u00a0= 0.0004), but not protein (-2\u00a0\u00b1 12\u00a0kcal/day; p\u00a0= 0.85). Weight changes were highly correlated with energy intake (r\u00a0= 0.8, p\u00a0< 0.0001), with participants gaining 0.9\u00a0\u00b1 0.3\u00a0kg (p\u00a0= 0.009) during the ultra-processed diet and losing 0.9\u00a0\u00b1 0.3\u00a0kg (p\u00a0= 0.007) during the unprocessed diet. Limiting consumption of ultra-processed foods may be an effective strategy for obesity prevention and treatment. ",
        "The optimization of methadone dosing whilst treating with rifampicin: A pharmacokinetic modeling study. BACKGROUND: The use of oral methadone in opioid substitution treatment (OST) for the management of opioid use disorder is established clinical practice. Confounding treatment is the increased risks of contracting Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the mainstay treatment of which incorporates the potent CYP 2B6 inducer rifampicin. METHODS: This study applied pharmacokinetic modelling using virtual clinical trials, to pharmacokinetically quantify the extent and impact of rifampicin-mediated drug-drug interactions (DDI) on methadone plasma concentrations. An R-methadone model was developed and validated against 11 retrospective clinical studies prior to use in all subsequent studies. The aims were to investigate: (i) the impact of the DDI on daily methadone doses of 60\u2009mg, 90\u2009mg and 120\u2009mg; (ii) dose escalation during rifampicin and (iii) dose reduction following rifampicin cessation. RESULTS: A dose increase to 160\u2009mg daily during rifampicin treatment phases was required to maintain peak methadone plasma concentrations within a derived therapeutic window of 80-700\u2009ng/mL. Dose escalation prior to rifampicin initiation was not required and resulted in an increase in subjects with supra-therapeutic concentrations. However, during rifampicin cessation, a dose reduction of 10\u2009mg every 2 days commencing prior to rifampicin cessation, ensured that most patients possessed a peak methadone plasma concentration within an optimal therapeutic window. IMPLICATIONS: Rifampicin significantly alters methadone plasma concentrations and necessitates dose adjustments. Daily doses of almost double those used perhaps more commonly in clinical practice are required for optimal plasma concentration and careful consideration of dose reduction strategies would be required during the deinduction phase.

        "EGFR is required for Wnt9a-Fzd9b signalling specificity in haematopoietic stem cells. Wnt signalling drives many processes in development, homeostasis and disease; however, the role and mechanism of individual ligand-receptor (Wnt-Frizzled (Fzd)) interactions in specific biological processes remain poorly understood. Wnt9a is specifically required for the amplification of blood progenitor cells during development. Using genetic studies in zebrafish and human embryonic stem cells, paired with in vitro cell biology and biochemistry, we determined that Wnt9a signals specifically through Fzd9b to elicit \u03b2-catenin-dependent Wnt signalling that regulates haematopoietic stem and progenitor cell emergence. We demonstrate that the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is required as a cofactor for Wnt9a-Fzd9b signalling. EGFR-mediated phosphorylation of one tyrosine residue on the Fzd9b intracellular tail in response to Wnt9a promotes internalization of the Wnt9a-Fzd9b-LRP signalosome and subsequent signal transduction. These findings provide mechanistic insights for specific Wnt-Fzd signals, which will be crucial for specific therapeutic targeting and regenerative medicine. ",
        "Can bacterial indicators of a grassy woodland restoration inform ecosystem assessment and microbiota-mediated human health?. Understanding how microbial communities change with environmental degradation and restoration may offer new insights into the understudied ecology that connects humans, microbiota, and the natural world. Immunomodulatory microbial diversity and 'Old Friends' are thought to be supplemented from biodiverse natural environments, yet deficient in anthropogenically disturbed or degraded environments. However, few studies have compared the microbiomes of natural vs. human-altered environments and there is little knowledge of which microbial taxa are representative of ecological restoration-i.e. the assisted recovery of degraded ecosystems typically towards a more natural, biodiverse state. Here we use novel bootstrap-style resampling of site-level soil bacterial 16S rRNA gene environmental DNA data to identify genus-level indicators of restoration from a 10-year grassy eucalypt woodland restoration chronosequence at Mt Bold, South Australia. We found two key indicator groups emerged: 'opportunistic taxa' that decreased in relative abundance with restoration and more stable and specialist, 'niche-adapted taxa' that increased. We validated these results, finding seven of the top ten opportunists and eight of the top ten niche-adapted taxa displayed consistent differential abundance patterns between human-altered vs. natural samples elsewhere across Australia. Extending this, we propose a two-dimensional mapping for ecosystem condition based on the proportions of these divergent indicator groups. We also show that restoring a more biodiverse ecosystem at Mt Bold has increased the potentially immune-boosting environmental microbial diversity. Furthermore, environmental opportunists including the pathogen-containing genera Bacillus, Clostridium, Enterobacter, Legionella and Pseudomonas associated with disturbed ecosystems. Our approach is generalizable with potential to inform DNA-based methods for ecosystem assessment and help target environmental interventions that may promote microbiota-mediated human health gains.

        "The impact of community- versus clinic-based adherence clubs on loss from care and viral suppression for antiretroviral therapy patients: Findings from a pragmatic randomized controlled trial in South Africa. BACKGROUND: Adherence clubs, where groups of 25-30 patients who are virally suppressed on antiretroviral therapy (ART) meet for counseling and medication pickup, represent an innovative model to retain patients in care and facilitate task-shifting. This intervention replaces traditional clinical care encounters with a 1-hour group session every 2-3 months, and can be organized at a clinic or a community venue. We performed a pragmatic randomized controlled trial to compare loss from club-based care between community- and clinic-based adherence clubs. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Patients on ART with undetectable viral load at Witkoppen Health and Welfare Centre in Johannesburg, South Africa, were randomized 1:1 to a clinic- or community-based adherence club. Clubs were held every other month. All participants received annual viral load monitoring and medical exam at the clinic. Participants were referred back to clinic-based standard care if they missed a club visit and did not pick up ART medications within 5 days, had 2 consecutive late ART medication pickups, developed a disqualifying (excluding) comorbidity, or had viral rebound. From February 12, 2014, to May 31, 2015, we randomized 775 eligible adults into 12 pairs of clubs-376 (49%) into clinic-based clubs and 399 (51%) into community-based clubs. Characteristics were similar by arm: 65% female, median age 38 years, and median CD4 count 506 cells/mm3. Overall, 47% (95% CI 44%-51%) experienced the primary outcome of loss from club-based care. Among community-based club participants, the cumulative proportion lost from club-based care was 52% (95% CI 47%-57%), compared to 43% (95% CI 38%-48%, p = 0.002) among clinic-based club participants. The risk of loss to club-based care was higher among participants assigned to community-based clubs than among those assigned to clinic-based clubs (adjusted hazard ratio 1.38, 95% CI 1.02-1.87, p = 0.032), after accounting for sex, age, nationality, time on ART, baseline CD4 count, and employment status. Among those who were lost from club-based care (n = 367), the most common reason was missing a club visit and the associated ART medication pickup entirely (54%, 95% CI 49%-59%), and was similar by arm (p = 0.086). Development of an excluding comorbidity occurred in 3% overall of those lost from club-based care, and was not different by arm (p = 0.816); no deaths occurred in either arm during club-based care. Viral rebound occurred in 13% of those lost from community club-based care and 21% of those lost from clinic-based care (p = 0.051). In post hoc secondary analysis, among those referred to standard care, 72% (95% CI 68%-77%) reengaged in clinic-based care within 90 days of their club-based care discontinuation date. The main limitations of the trial are the lack of a comparison group receiving routine clinic-based standard care and the potential limited generalizability due to the single-clinic setting. CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate that overall loss from an adherence club intervention was high in this setting and that, importantly, it was worse in community-based adherence clubs compared to those based at the clinic. We urge caution in assuming that the effectiveness of clinic-based interventions will carry over to community settings, without a better understanding of patient-level factors associated with successful retention in care.

        "Genetic inhibition of CRMP2 phosphorylation at serine 522 promotes axonal regeneration after optic nerve injury. Axonal degeneration occurs in various neurological diseases and traumatic nerve injury, and axonal regeneration is restricted by inhibitory factors in the central nervous system. Cyclin-dependent kinase 5 and glycogen synthase kinase 3\u03b2 (GSK3\u03b2) are activated by one of those inhibitors, and collapsin response mediator protein 2 (CRMP2) is phosphorylated by both kinases. We previously developed a CRMP2 knock-in (CRMP2 KI) mouse line, in which CRMP2 phosphorylation at Ser 522 is inhibited. Because CRMP2 KI mice showed promotion of axonal regeneration after spinal cord injury, we hypothesized that CRMP2 KI mice would show higher axonal regeneration after optic nerve injury. In this study, we first show that depolymerization of microtubules after optic nerve crush (ONC) injury was suppressed in CRMP2 KI mice. Loss of retinal ganglia cells was also reduced after ONC. We found that protein level of GAP43, a marker of regenerative axons, was higher in the optic nerve from CRMP2KI than that from wild type 4 weeks after of ONC. We further observed increased numbers of axons labeled by tracer in the optic nerve after ONC in CRMP2 KI mice. These results suggest that inhibition of phosphorylation of CRMP2 suppresses axonal degeneration and promotes axonal regeneration after optic nerve injury. ",
        "Metformin blunts muscle hypertrophy in response to progressive resistance exercise training in older adults: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial: The MASTERS trial. Progressive resistance exercise training (PRT) is the most effective known intervention for combating aging skeletal muscle atrophy. However, the hypertrophic response to PRT is variable, and this may be due to muscle inflammation susceptibility. Metformin reduces inflammation, so we hypothesized that metformin would augment the muscle response to PRT in healthy women and men aged 65 and older. In a randomized, double-blind trial, participants received 1,700\u00a0mg/day metformin (N\u00a0=\u00a046) or placebo (N\u00a0=\u00a048) throughout the study, and all subjects performed 14\u00a0weeks of supervised PRT. Although responses to PRT varied, placebo gained more lean body mass (p\u00a0=\u00a0.003) and thigh muscle mass (p\u00a0<\u00a0.001) than metformin. CT scan showed that increases in thigh muscle area (p\u00a0=\u00a0.005) and density (p\u00a0=\u00a0.020) were greater in placebo versus metformin. There was a trend for blunted strength gains in metformin that did not reach statistical significance. Analyses of vastus lateralis muscle biopsies showed that metformin did not affect fiber hypertrophy, or increases in satellite cell or macrophage abundance with PRT. However, placebo had decreased type I fiber percentage while metformin did not (p\u00a0=\u00a0.007). Metformin led to an increase in AMPK signaling, and a trend for blunted increases in mTORC1 signaling in response to PRT. These results underscore the benefits of PRT in older adults, but metformin negatively impacts the hypertrophic response to resistance training in healthy older individuals.

        "The Chimpanzee SIV Envelope Trimer: Structure and Deployment as an HIV Vaccine Template. Epitope-targeted HIV vaccine design seeks to focus antibody responses to broadly neutralizing antibody (bnAb) sites by sequential immunization. A chimpanzee simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) envelope (Env) shares a single bnAb site, the variable loop 2 (V2)-apex, with HIV, suggesting its possible utility in an HIV\u00a0immunization strategy. Here, we generate a chimpanzee SIV Env trimer, MT145K, which displays selective binding to HIV V2-apex bnAbs and precursor versions, but no binding to other HIV specificities. We determine the structure of the MT145K trimer by cryo-EM and show that its architecture is remarkably similar to HIV Env. Immunization of an HIV V2-apex bnAb precursor Ab-expressing knockin mouse with the chimpanzee MT145K trimer induces HIV V2-specific neutralizing responses. Subsequent boosting with an HIV trimer cocktail induces responses that exhibit some virus cross-neutralization. Overall, the chimpanzee MT145K trimer behaves as expected from design both in\u00a0vitro and in\u00a0vivo and is an attractive potential component of a sequential immunization regimen to induce V2-apex bnAbs.

        "Short-term 3D culture systems of various complexity for treatment optimization of colorectal carcinoma. Three-dimensional (3D) cultures have the potential to increase the predictive value of pre-clinical drug research and bridge the gap towards anticipating clinical outcome of proposed treatments. However, their implementation in more advanced drug-discovery programs is still in its infancy due to the lack of reproducibility and low time- and cost effectiveness. HCT116, SW620 and DLD1 cells, cell lines with distinct mutations, grade and origin, were co-cultured with fibroblasts and endothelial cells (EC) in 3D spheroids. Clinically relevant drugs, i.e. 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), regorafenib and erlotinib, were administered individually to in\u00a0CRC cell cultures. In this study, we established a robust, low-cost and reproducible short-term 3D culture system addressing the various complexities of the colorectal carcinoma (CRC) microenvironment. We observed a dose-dependent increase of erlotinib sensitivity in 3D (co-)cultures compared to 2D cultures. Furthermore, we compared the drug combination efficacy and drug-drug interactions administered in 2D, 3D and 3D co-cultures. We observed that synergistic/additive drug-drug interactions for drug combinations administered at low doses shifted towards additive and antagonistic when applied at higher doses in metastatic CRC cells. The addition of fibroblasts at various ratios and EC increased the resistance to some drug combinations in SW620 and DLD1 cells, but not in HCT116. Retreatment of SW620 3D co-cultures with a low-dose 3-drug combination was as active (88% inhibition, relative to control) as 5-FU treatment at high dose (100\u2009\u03bcM). Moreover, 3D and 3D co-cultures responded variably to the drug combination treatments, and also signalling pathways were differently regulated, probably due to the influence of fibroblasts and ECs on cancer cells. The short-term 3D co-culture system developed here is a powerful platform for screening (combination) therapies. Understanding of signalling in 3D co-cultures versus 3D cultures and the responses in the 3D models upon drug treatment might be beneficial for designing anti-cancer therapies. ",
        "Development of a Photoswitchable Lithium-Sensitive Probe to Analyze Nonselective Cation Channel Activity in Migrating Cancer Cells. This is the first work to use a newly designed Li+-selective photoswitchable probe Sabrina Heng Lithium (SHL) in living colon cancer cells to noninvasively monitor cation channel activity in real time by the appearance of lithium hot spots detected by confocal microscopy. Punctate Li+ hot spots are clustered in the lamellipodial leading edges of HT29 human colon cancer cells and are colocalized with aquaporin-1 (AQP1) channels. AQP1 is a dual water and cyclic-nucleotide-gated cation channel located in lamellipodia and is essential for rapid cell migration in a subset of aggressive cancers. Both the Li+ hot spots and cell migration are blocked in HT29 cells by the AQP1 ion channel antagonist AqB011. In contrast, Li+ hot spots are not evident in a poorly migrating colon cancer cell line, SW620, which lacks comparable membrane expression of AQP1. Knockdown of AQP1 by RNA interference in HT29 cells significantly impairs Li+ hot spot activity. The SHL probe loaded in living cells shows signature chemical properties of ionic selectivity and reversibility. Dynamic properties of the Li+ hot spots, turning on and off, are confirmed by time-lapse imaging. SHL is a powerful tool for evaluating cation channel function in living cells in real time, with particular promise for studies of motile cells or interlinked networks not easily analyzed by electrophysiological methods. The ability to reset SHL by photoswitching allows monitoring of dynamic signals over time. Future applications of the Li+ probe could include high-throughput optical screening for discovering new classes of channels, or finding new pharmacological modulators for nonselective cation channels.

        "Morphine immunomodulation prolongs inflammatory and postoperative pain while the novel analgesic ZH853 accelerates recovery and protects against latent sensitization. BACKGROUND: Numerous studies have identified the proinflammatory, pronociceptive effects of morphine which ultimately exacerbate pain. Our novel endomorphin analog ZH853 does not produce proinflammatory effects on its own and gives potent, long-lasting analgesia. This study investigates whether ZH853's lack of interaction with the neuroimmune system reduces the risk of prolonged pain. METHODS: Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to one of two treatment paradigms. Either (1) chronic pain followed by chronic treatment with morphine, ZH853 or vehicle, or (2) chronic drug administered prior to pain induction. Complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) was injected or paw incision surgery was performed on the left hind plantar foot pad. Drugs were administered through Alzet osmotic minipumps at a rate of 1\u00a0\u03bcl/h for 5\u00a0days at appropriate doses based on prior experiments. Animals were tested for mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia using von Frey filaments and the Hargreaves apparatus, respectively. Additionally, several gait parameters were measured using the CatWalk XT. When all animals had recovered from pain, 1\u00a0mg/kg of naltrexone was administered to test for development of latent sensitization (LS). A second set of animals was used to investigate dorsal horn inflammation following CFA and drug treatment. ANOVAs were used to assess differences between drug treatment groups. RESULTS: As expected, morphine increased and prolonged pain in all experiments compared to vehicle treatment. However, ZH853 treatment reduced the overall time spent in pain and the severity of pain scores compared to morphine. ZH853 not only reduced inflammation versus morphine treatment but also, in some instances, acted as an anti-inflammatory drug compared to vehicle treatment. Finally, ZH853 prevented the development of LS while vehicle- and morphine-treated animals showed robust relapse to pain. CONCLUSIONS: ZH853 has a favorable side effect profile versus morphine and provides superior analgesia in a number of pain states. We now know that chronic use of this compound reduces time spent in a chronic pain state, the opposite of common opioids like morphine, and reduces the risk of LS, making ZH853 an excellent candidate for clinical development in humans for inflammatory and postoperative pain.

        "Effect of Developmentally Adapted Cognitive Processing Therapy for Youth With Symptoms of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder After Childhood Sexual and Physical Abuse: A Randomized Clinical Trial. Importance: Despite the high prevalence, evidence-based treatments for abuse-related posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in adolescents have rarely been studied. Objective: To examine whether developmentally adapted cognitive processing therapy (D-CPT) is more effective than a wait-list condition with treatment advice (WL/TA) among adolescents with PTSD related to childhood abuse. Design, Setting, and Participants: This rater-blinded, multicenter, randomized clinical trial (stratified by center) enrolled treatment-seeking adolescents and young adults (aged 14-21 years) with childhood abuse-related PTSD at 3 university outpatient clinics in Germany from July 2013 to June 2015, with the last follow-up interview conducted by May 2016. Of 194 patients, 88 were eligible for randomization. Interventions: Participants received D-CPT or WL/TA. Cognitive processing therapy was enhanced by a motivational and alliance-building phase, by including emotion regulation and consideration of typical developmental tasks, and by higher session frequency in the trauma-focused core CPT phase. In WL/TA, participants received treatment advice with respective recommendations of clinicians and were offered D-CPT after 7 months. Main Outcomes and Measures: All outcomes were assessed before treatment (baseline), approximately 8 weeks after the start of treatment, after the end of treatment (posttreatment), and at the 3-month follow-up. The primary outcome, PTSD symptom severity, was assessed in clinical interview (Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for Children and Adolescents for DSM-IV [CAPS-CA]). Secondary outcomes were self-reported PTSD severity, depression, borderline symptoms, behavior problems, and dissociation. Results: The 88 participants (75 [85%] female) had a mean age of 18.1 years (95% CI, 17.6-18.6 years). In the intention-to-treat analysis, the 44 participants receiving D-CPT (39 [89%] female) demonstrated greater improvement than the 44 WL/TA participants (36 [82%] female) in terms of PTSD severity (mean CAPS-CA scores, 24.7 [95% CI, 16.6-32.7] vs 47.5 [95% CI, 37.9-57.1]; Hedges g\u2009=\u20090.90). This difference was maintained through the follow-up (mean CAPS-CA scores, 25.9 [95% CI, 16.2-35.6] vs 47.3 [95% CI, 37.8-56.8]; Hedges g\u2009=\u20090.80). Treatment success was greatest during the trauma-focused core phase. The D-CPT participants also showed greater and stable improvement in all secondary outcomes, with between-groups effect sizes ranging from 0.65 to 1.08 at the posttreatment assessment (eg, for borderline symptoms, 14.1 [95% CI, 8.0-20.2] vs 32.0 [95% CI, 23.8-40.2]; Hedges g = 0.91). Conclusions and Relevance: Adolescents and young adults with abuse-related PTSD benefited more from D-CPT than from WL/TA. Treatment success was stable at the follow-up and generalized to borderline symptoms and other comorbidities. Trial Registration: German Clinical Trials Register identifier: DRKS00004787. ",
        "Coordinated Conformational Processing of the Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 by the Hsp70 and Hsp90 Chaperone Machineries. p53, the guardian of the genome, requires chaperoning by Hsp70 and Hsp90. However, how the two chaperone machineries affect p53 conformation and regulate its function remains elusive. We found that Hsp70, together with Hsp40, unfolds p53 in an ATP-dependent reaction. This unfolded state of p53 is susceptible to aggregation after release induced by the nucleotide exchange factor Bag-1. However, when Hsp90 and the adaptor protein Hop are present, p53 is transferred from Hsp70 to Hsp90, allowing restoration of the native state upon ATP hydrolysis. Our results suggest that the p53 conformation is constantly remodeled by the two major chaperone machineries. This connects p53 activity to stress, and the levels of free molecular chaperones are important factors regulating p53 activity. Together, our findings reveal an intricate interplay and cooperation of Hsp70 and Hsp90 in regulating the conformation of a client. ",
        "Familial Hypercholesterolemia Among Young Adults With Myocardial Infarction. BACKGROUND: There are limited data on the prevalence and treatment of familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) among U.S. adults who experience a myocardial infarction (MI) at a young age. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to evaluate the prevalence of clinically defined FH and examine the rates of statin utilization and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) achieved 1-year post MI. METHODS: The YOUNG-MI registry is a retrospective cohort study that includes patients who experience an MI at or below age 50 years between 2000 and 2016 at 2 academic centers. Probable or definite FH was defined by the Dutch Lipid Clinic criteria. Outcomes included the proportion of patients classified as probable or definite FH, use of lipid-lowering therapy, and LDL-C achieved 1-year post MI. RESULTS: The cohort consisted of 1,996 adults with a median age of 45 years; 19% were women, and 54% had ST-segment elevation MI. Probable/definite FH was present in 180 (9%) of whom 42.8% were not on statins prior to their MI. Of the 1,966 patients surviving until hospital discharge, 89.4% of FH patients and 89.9% of non-FH patients were discharged on statin therapy (p\u00a0=\u00a00.82). Among FH patients, 63.3% were discharged on high-intensity statin compared with 48.4% for non-FH patients (p\u00a0< 0.001). At 1-year follow-up, the percent reduction in LDL-C among FH patients was\u00a0-44.4% compared with\u00a0-34.5% (p\u00a0=\u00a00.006) in non-FH patients. The proportion of patients with LDL-C\u00a0\u226570\u00a0mg/dl was higher among FH patients (82.2%) compared with non-FH patients (64.5%; p\u00a0< 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Clinically defined FH was present in nearly 1 of 10 patients with MI at a young age. Only two-thirds of FH patients were discharged on high-intensity statin therapy, and the vast majority had elevated LDL-C at 1 year. These findings reinforce the need for more aggressive lipid-lowering therapy in young FH and non-FH patients post-MI. ",
        "The Adult Adrenal Cortex Undergoes Rapid Tissue Renewal in a Sex-Specific Manner. Evolution has resulted in profound differences between males and females that extend to non-reproductive organs and are reflected in the susceptibility and progression of diseases. However, the cellular and molecular basis for these differences remains largely unknown. Here we report that adrenal gland tissue renewal is highly active and sexually dimorphic, with female mice showing a 3-fold higher turnover than males. Moreover, in males, homeostasis relies on proliferation of cells within the steroidogenic zone, but females employ an additional stem and/or progenitor compartment situated in the adrenal capsule. Using lineage tracing, sex reversal models, gonadectomy, and dihydrotestosterone treatments, we further show that sex-specific stem cell activity is driven by male hormones that repress recruitment of Gli1+ stem cells from the capsule and cell proliferation. Taken together, our findings provide a molecular and cellular basis for adrenal sex dimorphism that may contribute to the increased incidence of adrenal diseases in females. ",
        "Mechanism of Cross-talk between H2B Ubiquitination and H3 Methylation by Dot1L. Methylation of histone H3 K79 by Dot1L is a hallmark of actively transcribed genes that depends on monoubiquitination of H2B K120 (H2B-Ub) and is an example of histone modification cross-talk that is conserved from yeast to humans. We report here cryo-EM structures of Dot1L bound to ubiquitinated nucleosome that show how H2B-Ub stimulates Dot1L activity and reveal a role for the histone H4 tail in positioning Dot1L. We find that contacts mediated by Dot1L and the H4 tail induce a conformational change in the globular core of histone H3 that\u00a0reorients K79 from an inaccessible position, thus enabling this side chain to insert into the active site in a position primed for catalysis. Our\u00a0study provides a comprehensive mechanism of\u00a0cross-talk between histone ubiquitination and methylation and reveals structural plasticity in histones that makes it possible for histone-modifying enzymes to access residues within the nucleosome core.

        "The evolution and multi-molecular properties of NF1 cutaneous neurofibromas originating from C-fiber sensory endings and terminal Schwann cells at normal sites of sensory terminations in the skin. In addition to large plexiform neurofibromas (pNF), NF1 patients are frequently disfigured by cutaneous neurofibromas (cNF) and are often afflicted with chronic pain and itch even from seemingly normal skin areas. Both pNFs and cNF consist primarily of benign hyperproliferating nonmyelinating Schwann cells (nSC). While pNF clearly arise within deep nerves and plexuses, the role of cutaneous innervation in the origin of cNF and in chronic itch and pain is unknown. First, we conducted a comprehensive, multi-molecular, immunofluorescence (IF) analyses on 3mm punch biopsies from three separate locations in normal appearing, cNF-free skin in 19 NF1 patients and skin of 16 normal subjects. At least one biopsy in 17 NF1 patients had previously undescribed micro-lesions consisting of a small, dense cluster of nonpeptidergic C-fiber endings and the affiliated nSC consistently adjoining adnexal structures-dermal papillae, hair follicles, sweat glands, sweat ducts, and arterioles-where C-fiber endings normally terminate. Similar micro-lesions were detected in hind paw skin of mice with conditionally-induced SC Nf1-/- mutations. Hypothesizing that these microlesions were pre-cNF origins of cNF, we subsequently analyzed numerous overt, small cNF (s-cNF, 3-6 mm) and discovered that each had an adnexal structure at the epicenter of vastly increased nonpeptidergic C-fiber terminals, accompanied by excessive nSC. The IF and functional genomics assays indicated that neurturin (NTRN) and artemin (ARTN) signaling through cRET kinase and GFR\u03b12 and GFR\u03b13 co-receptors on the aberrant C-fiber endings and nSC may mutually promote the onset of pre-cNF and their evolution to s-cNF. Moreover, TrpA1 and TrpV1 receptors may, respectively, mediate symptoms of chronic itch and pain. These newly discovered molecular characteristics might be targeted to suppress the development of cNF and to treat chronic itch and pain symptoms in NF1 patients. ",

        "\u03b2 Cell Hypoxia-Inducible Factor-1\u03b1 Is Required for the Prevention of Type 1 Diabetes. The development of autoimmune disease type 1 diabetes (T1D) is determined by both genetic background and environmental factors. Environmental triggers include RNA viruses, particularly coxsackievirus (CV), but how they induce T1D is not understood. Here, we demonstrate that deletion of the transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor-1\u03b1 (HIF-1\u03b1) from \u03b2 cells increases the susceptibility of non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice to environmentally triggered T1D from coxsackieviruses and the \u03b2 cell toxin streptozotocin. Similarly, knockdown of HIF-1\u03b1 in human islets leads to a poorer response to coxsackievirus infection. Studies in coxsackievirus-infected islets demonstrate that lack of HIF-1\u03b1 leads to impaired viral clearance, increased viral load, inflammation, pancreatitis, and loss of \u03b2 cell mass. These findings show an important role for \u03b2 cells and, specifically, lack of \u03b2 cell HIF-1\u03b1 in the development of T1D. These data suggest new strategies for the prevention of T1D. ",
        "Diagnostic tests, drug prescriptions, and follow-up patterns after incident heart failure: A cohort study of 93,000 UK patients. BACKGROUND: Effective management of heart failure is complex, and ensuring evidence-based practice presents a major challenge to health services worldwide. Over the past decade, the United Kingdom introduced a series of national initiatives to improve evidence-based heart failure management, including a landmark pay-for-performance scheme in primary care and a national audit in secondary care started in 2004 and 2007, respectively. Quality improvement efforts have been evaluated within individual clinical settings, but patterns of care across its continuum, although a critical component of chronic disease management, have not been studied. We have designed this study to investigate patients' trajectories of care around the time of diagnosis and their variation over time by age, sex, and socioeconomic status. METHODS AND FINDINGS: For this retrospective population-based study, we used linked primary and secondary health records from a representative sample of the UK population provided by the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD). We identified 93,074 individuals newly diagnosed with heart failure between 2002 and 2014, with a mean age of 76.7 years and of which 49% were women. We examined five indicators of care: (i) diagnosis care setting (inpatient or outpatient), (ii) posthospitalisation follow-up in primary care, (iii) diagnostic investigations, (iv) prescription of essential drugs, and (v) drug treatment dose. We used Poisson and linear regression models to calculate category-specific risk ratios (RRs) or adjusted differences and 95% confidence intervals (CIs), adjusting for year of diagnosis, age, sex, region, and socioeconomic status. From 2002 to 2014, indicators of care presented diverging trends. Outpatient diagnoses and follow-up after hospital discharge in primary care declined substantially (ranging from 56% in 2002 to 36% in 2014, RR 0.64 [0.62, 0.67] and 20% to 14%, RR 0.73 [0.65, 0.82], respectively). Primary care referral for diagnostic investigations and appropriate initiation of beta blockers and angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors (ACE-Is) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) both increased significantly (37% versus 82%, RR 2.24 [2.15, 2.34] and 18% versus 63%, RR 3.48 [2.72, 4.43], respectively). Yet, the average daily dose prescribed remained below guideline recommendations (42% for ACE-Is or ARBs, 29% for beta blockers in 2014) and was largely unchanged beyond the first 30 days after diagnosis. Despite increasing rates of treatment initiation, the overall dose prescribed to patients in the 12 months following diagnosis improved little over the period of study (adjusted difference for the combined dose of beta blocker and ACE-I or ARB: +6% [+2%, +10%]). Women and patients aged over 75 years presented significant gaps across all five indicators of care. Our study was limited by the available clinical information, which did not include exact left ventricular ejection fraction values, investigations performed during hospital admissions, or information about follow-up in community heart failure clinics. CONCLUSIONS: Management of heart failure patients in the UK presents important shortcomings that affect screening, continuity of care, and medication titration and disproportionally impact women and older people. National reporting and incentive schemes confined to individual clinical settings have been insufficient to identify these gaps and address patients' long-term care needs. ",
        "ACC Theta Improves Hippocampal Contextual Processing during Remote Recall. Consolidation studies show that, over time, memory recall becomes independent of the medial temporal lobes. Multiple lines of research show that the medial frontal cortex, including the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), is involved with contextual information processing and remote recall. We hypothesize that interactions between the ACC and hippocampal area CA1 will change as memories became more remote. Animals are re-exposed to multiple environments at different retention intervals. During remote recall, ACC-CA1 theta coherence increases, with the ACC leading area CA1. ACC theta regulates unit spike timing, gamma oscillations, and ensemble and single-neuron information coding in CA1. Over the course of consolidation, the strength and prevalence of ACC theta modulation grow, leading to richer environmental context representations in CA1. These data are consistent with the transference of contextual memory dependence to the ACC and indicate that remote memories are retrieved via ACC-driven oscillatory coupling with CA1. ",
        "Bioactive site-specifically modified proteins for 4D patterning of gel biomaterials. Protein-modified biomaterials can be used to modulate cellular function in three dimensions. However, as the dynamic heterogeneous control over complex cell physiology continues to be sought, strategies that permit a reversible and user-defined tethering of fragile proteins to materials remain in great need. Here we introduce a modular and robust semisynthetic approach to reversibly pattern cell-laden hydrogels with site-specifically modified proteins. Exploiting a versatile sortase-mediated transpeptidation, we generate a diverse library of homogeneous, singly functionalized proteins with bioorthogonal reactive handles for biomaterial modification. We demonstrate the photoreversible immobilization of fluorescent proteins, enzymes and growth factors to gels with excellent spatiotemporal resolution while retaining native protein bioactivity. Localized epidermal growth factor presentation enables dynamic regulation over proliferation, intracellular mitogen-activated protein kinase signalling and subcellularly resolved receptor endocytosis. Our method broadly permits the modification and patterning of a wide range of proteins, which provides newfound avenues to probe and direct advanced cellular fates in four dimensions. ",
        "Association of Mental Health Conditions With Participation in Cardiac Rehabilitation. Background Mental health conditions are associated with adverse cardiovascular outcomes in patients with ischemic heart disease, and much of this risk can be attributed to poor health behaviors. Although all patients with ischemic heart disease should be referred for cardiac rehabilitation (CR), whether patients with mental health conditions are willing to participate in CR programs is unknown. We sought to compare CR participation rates among patients with ischemic heart disease with versus without comorbid depression and/or posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Methods and Results We used national electronic health records to identify all patients hospitalized for acute myocardial infarction or coronary revascularization at Veterans Health Administration hospitals between 2010 and 2014. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to determine whether comorbid depression/PTSD was associated with CR participation during the 12\u00a0months after hospital discharge. Of the 86\u00a0537 patients hospitalized for ischemic heart disease between 2010 and 2014, 24% experienced PTSD and/or depression. Patients with PTSD and/or depression had higher CR participation rates than those without PTSD or depression (11% versus 8%; P<0.001). In comparison to patients without PTSD or depression, the odds of participation was 24% greater in patients with depression alone (odds ratio, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.15-1.34), 38% greater in patients with PTSD alone (odds ratio, 1.38; 95% CI, 1.24-1.54), and 57% greater in patients with both PTSD and depression (odds ratio, 1.57; 95% CI, 1.43-1.74). Conclusions Among patients with ischemic heart disease, the presence of comorbid depression and/or PTSD is associated with greater participation in CR, providing an important opportunity to promote healthy lifestyle behaviors and reduce adverse cardiovascular outcomes among these patients.

        "Identifying Familial Hypercholesterolemia Using a Blood Donor Screening Program With More Than 1 Million Volunteer Donors. Importance: Familial hypercholesterolemia is an autosomal-dominant disorder that often causes premature coronary artery disease. Unfortunately, familial hypercholesterolemia remains largely undiagnosed. Objective: To estimate the prevalence of familial hypercholesterolemia in a population of blood donors. Design: This analysis of deidentified data from blood donors 16 years and older who donated to Carter BloodCare, one of the largest independent blood programs in the United States, between January 2002 and December 2016. Carter BloodCare, which serves a population of about 8 million in Texas, routinely measures total nonfasting serum cholesterol levels as part of a donor health screening program. Data analysis occurred from October 2017 to March 2019. Exposure: Blood donation. Main Outcomes and Measures: Familial hypercholesterolemia was defined using the Make Early Diagnosis to Prevent Early Death general population criteria, with total nonfasting serum cholesterol thresholds of 270, 290, 340, and 360 mg/dL for donors younger than 20 years, 20 to 29 years, 30 to 39 years, and 40 years or older, respectively (to convert cholesterol values to mmol/L, multiply by 0.0259). For repeated donors, the maximum observed total cholesterol level was used for analyses. Results: The study included 1\u202f178\u202f102 individual donors with a total of 3\u202f038\u202f420 blood donations. Of all individual donors (median total cholesterol level, 183 [interquartile range (IQR), 157-212] mg/dL; median age, 32 [IQR, 19-47] years; 619\u202f583 [52.6%] women), a total of 3473 individuals (or 1 in every 339) met criteria for familial hypercholesterolemia. This group had a median (IQR) total cholesterol of 332 (297-377) mg/dL. Estimated prevalence was higher at younger ages (<30 years: 1:257) compared with older ages (\u226530 years: 1:469; P\u2009<\u2009.001) and in men (1:327) compared with women (1:351; P\u2009=\u2009.03). Among 2219 repeated donors who met familial hypercholesterolemia criteria at least once, 3116 of 10\u202f833 total donations (28.8%) met FH criteria. Conclusions and Relevance: The prevalence of familial hypercholesterolemia using the Make Early Diagnosis to Prevent Early Death criteria in a large cohort of blood donors was similar to the estimated prevalence of this disorder in the general population. The blood donor screening program could be a novel strategy to detect and notify individuals with potential familial hypercholesterolemia, particularly younger individuals in whom early detection and treatment is especially helpful, as well as guide cascade screening.

        "Adherence to metformin is reduced during school holidays and weekends in children with type 1 diabetes participating in a randomised controlled trial. BACKGROUND: Non-adherence to treatment in childhood chronic illness has serious consequences for health and healthcare costs. Accurate detailed objective data on adherence are minimal in this age group. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate medication adherence using electronic monitoring systems in children with type 1 diabetes (T1D). DESIGN: A cohort study of 90 T1D children (aged 13.6\u00b12.5 years, 41 males) from two paediatric diabetes clinics, participated in a 12-month double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial (1:1 allocation). This cohort provided 28\u2009336 days of study observations; 7138 school holiday and 8875 weekend/public holiday days. METHOD: Adherence to intervention (metformin (n=45) or placebo (n=45)) was measured objectively by Medication Event Monitoring Systems (MEMS) including proportion of medication doses taken and daily adherence patterns and by tablet count at 3, 6 and 12 months. The trial was completed in June 2015. RESULTS: There was an average (SD) of 363.3 (42) days of MEMS observations available for each study participant (94.1 (12.6) school holiday days and 117.1 (13.4) weekend/public holiday days). Adherence reduced during school holidays (adjusted OR (aOR) 0.81; 95%\u2009CI 0.72 to 0.91; p<0.001) and during weekends/public holidays (aOR 0.74; 95%\u2009CI 0.69 to 0.80; p<0.001). Adverse effects to the intervention did not affect overall adherence (aOR 0.77; 95%\u2009CI 0.3 to 2.01; p=0.6). Age, gender, body mass index, diabetes duration, insulin dose, HbA1c (Haemoglobin A1c) or socioeconomic status did not predict adherence. CONCLUSION: Medication adherence was reduced during school holidays and on weekends in children with T1D. Clinical characteristics including socioeconomic status and the presence of adverse effects did not predict adherence. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: ACTRN12611000148976. ",
        "Primary cilia defects causing mitral valve prolapse. Mitral valve prolapse (MVP) affects 1 in 40 people and is the most common indication for mitral valve surgery. MVP can cause arrhythmias, heart failure, and sudden cardiac death, and to date, the causes of this disease are poorly understood. We now demonstrate that defects in primary cilia genes and their regulated pathways can cause MVP in familial and sporadic nonsyndromic MVP cases. Our expression studies and genetic ablation experiments confirmed a role for primary cilia in regulating ECM deposition during cardiac development. Loss of primary cilia during development resulted in progressive myxomatous degeneration and profound mitral valve pathology in the adult setting. Analysis of a large family with inherited, autosomal dominant nonsyndromic MVP identified a deleterious missense mutation in a cilia gene, DZIP1 A mouse model harboring this variant confirmed the pathogenicity of this mutation and revealed impaired ciliogenesis during development, which progressed to adult myxomatous valve disease and functional MVP. Relevance of primary cilia in common forms of MVP was tested using pathway enrichment in a large population of patients with MVP and controls from previously generated genome-wide association studies (GWAS), which confirmed the involvement of primary cilia genes in MVP. Together, our studies establish a developmental basis for MVP through altered cilia-dependent regulation of ECM and suggest that defects in primary cilia genes can be causative to disease phenotype in some patients with MVP.

        "Racial and Ethnic Differences in the Prevalence and Time to Onset of Manifestations of Systemic Lupus Erythematosus: The California Lupus Surveillance Project. OBJECTIVE: The California Lupus Surveillance Project (CLSP) is a population-based registry of individuals with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) residing in San Francisco County, California from 2007 to 2009, with a special focus on Asian/Pacific Islander and Hispanic patients. We used retrospective CLSP data to analyze racial and ethnic differences in lupus manifestations and in the timing and risk of developing severe manifestations. METHODS: A total of 724 patients with SLE were retrospectively identified. Prevalence ratios (PRs) of SLE manifestations were calculated using Poisson regression models stratified by race/ethnicity and adjusted for sex, age at SLE diagnosis, and disease duration. We studied onset of severe SLE manifestations after SLE diagnosis using Kaplan-Meier methods to examine time-to-event and Cox proportional hazards regression models to estimate hazard ratios (HRs). White patients were the referent group in all analyses. RESULTS: African Americans, Asian/Pacific Islanders, and Hispanic patients had increased prevalence of renal manifestations (PR 1.74 [95% confidence interval (95% CI) 1.40-2.16], PR 1.68 [95% CI 1.38-2.05], and PR 1.35 [95% CI 1.05-1.74], respectively). Furthermore, African Americans had increased prevalence of neurologic manifestations (PR 1.49 [95% CI 1.12-1.98]), and both African Americans (PR 1.09 [95% CI 1.04-1.15]) and Asian/Pacific Islanders (PR 1.07 [95% CI 1.01-1.13]) had increased prevalence of hematologic manifestations. African Americans, Asian/Pacific Islanders, and Hispanic patients, respectively, had higher risk of developing lupus nephritis (HR 2.4 [95% CI 1.6-3.8], HR 4.3 [95% CI 2.9-6.4], and HR 2.3 [95% CI 1.4-3.8]) and thrombocytopenia (HR 2.3 [95% CI 1.1-4.4], HR 2.3 [95% CI 1.3-4.2], and HR 2.2 [95% CI 1.1-4.7]). Asian/Pacific Islander and Hispanic patients had higher risk of developing antiphospholipid syndrome (HR 2.5 [95% CI 1.4-4.4] and HR 2.6 [95% CI 1.3-5.1], respectively). CONCLUSION: This is the first epidemiologic study comparing lupus manifestations among 4 major racial and ethnic groups. We found substantial differences in the prevalence of several clinical SLE manifestations among racial/ethnic groups and discovered that African Americans, Asian/Pacific Islanders, and Hispanic patients are at increased risk of developing several severe manifestations following a diagnosis of SLE.

        "Age of patients undergoing surgery. BACKGROUND: Advancing age is independently associated with poor postoperative outcomes. The ageing of the general population is a major concern for healthcare providers. Trends in age were studied among patients undergoing surgery in the National Health Service in England. METHODS: Time trend ecological analysis was undertaken of Hospital Episode Statistics and Office for National Statistics data for England from 1999 to 2015. The proportion of patients undergoing surgery in different age groupings, their pooled mean age, and change in age profile over time were calculated. Growth in the surgical population was estimated, with associated costs, to the year 2030 by use of linear regression modelling. RESULTS: Some 68\u2009205\u2009695 surgical patient episodes (31\u2009220\u2009341 men, 45\u00b78 per cent) were identified. The mean duration of hospital stay was 5\u00b73\u2009days. The surgical population was older than the general population of England; this gap increased over time (1999: 47\u00b75 versus 38\u00b73\u2009years; 2015: 54\u00b72 versus 39\u00b77\u2009years). The number of people aged 75\u2009years or more undergoing surgery increased from 544\u2009998 (14\u00b79 per cent of that age group) in 1999 to 1\u2009012\u2009517 (22\u00b79 per cent) in 2015. By 2030, it is estimated that one-fifth of the 75\u2009years and older age category will undergo surgery each year (1\u00b749 (95 per cent c.i. 1\u00b743 to 1\u00b755) million people), at a cost of \u20ac3\u00b72 (3\u00b71 to 3\u00b75) billion. CONCLUSION: The population having surgery in England is ageing at a faster rate than the general population. Healthcare policies must adapt to ensure that provision of surgical treatments remains safe and sustainable. ",
        "Circulating Tumor Cells Exhibit Metastatic Tropism and Reveal Brain Metastasis Drivers. Hematogenous metastasis is initiated by a subset of circulating tumor cells (CTC) shed from primary or metastatic tumors into the blood circulation. Thus, CTCs provide a unique patient biopsy resource to decipher the cellular subpopulations that initiate metastasis and their molecular properties. However, one crucial question is whether CTCs derived and expanded ex vivo from patients recapitulate human metastatic disease in an animal model. Here, we show that CTC lines established from patients with breast cancer are capable of generating metastases in mice with a pattern recapitulating most major organs from corresponding patients. Genome-wide sequencing analyses of metastatic variants identified semaphorin 4D as a regulator of tumor cell transmigration through the blood-brain barrier and MYC as a crucial regulator for the adaptation of disseminated tumor cells to the activated brain microenvironment. These data provide the direct experimental evidence of the promising role of CTCs as a prognostic factor for site-specific metastasis. SIGNIFICANCE: Interests abound in gaining new knowledge of the physiopathology of brain metastasis. In a direct metastatic tropism analysis, we demonstrated that ex vivo-cultured CTCs from 4 patients with breast cancer showed organotropism, revealing molecular features that allow a subset of CTCs to enter and grow in the brain.This article is highlighted in the In This Issue feature, p. 1.

        "Bipolar disorder and risk of Parkinson disease: A nationwide longitudinal study. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the risk of Parkinson disease (PD) among patients with bipolar disorder (BD). METHODS: Using the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database, we examined 56,340 patients with BD and 225,360 age- and sex-matched controls between 2001 and 2009 and followed them to the end of 2011. Individuals who developed PD during the follow-up period were identified. RESULTS: Patients with BD had a higher incidence of PD (0.7% vs 0.1%, p < 0.001) during the follow-up period than the controls. A Cox regression analysis with adjustments for demographic data and medical comorbid conditions revealed that patients with BD were more likely to develop PD (hazard ratio [HR] 6.78, 95% confidence interval [CI] 5.74-8.02) than the control group. Sensitivity analyses after exclusion of the first year (HR 5.82, 95% CI 4.89-6.93) or first 3 years (HR 4.42; 95% CI 3.63-5.37) of observation showed consistent findings. Moreover, a high frequency of psychiatric admission for manic/mixed and depressive episodes was associated with an increased risk of developing PD. CONCLUSION: Patients with BD had a higher incidence of PD during the follow-up period than the control group. Manic/mixed and depressive episodes were associated with an elevated likelihood of developing PD. Further studies are necessary to investigate the underlying pathophysiology between BD and PD. ",
        "Potent and selective in vitro and in vivo antiproliferative effects of metal-organic trefoil knots. A set of metal-organic trefoil knots (M-TKs) generated by metal-templated self-assembly of a simple pair of chelating ligands were well tolerated in vitro by non-cancer cells but were significantly more potent than cisplatin in both human cancer cells--including those resistant to cisplatin--and in zebrafish embryos. In cultured cells, M-TKs generated reactive oxygen species that triggered apoptosis via the mitochondrial pathway without directly disrupting the cell-membrane or damaging nuclear DNA. The cytotoxicity and wide scope for structural variation of M-TKs indicate the potential of synthetic metal-organic knots as a new field of chemical space for pharmaceutical design and development.

        "A universal transcriptomic signature of age reveals the temporal scaling of Caenorhabditis elegans aging trajectories. We collected 60 age-dependent transcriptomes for C. elegans strains including four exceptionally long-lived mutants (mean adult lifespan extended 2.2- to 9.4-fold) and three examples of lifespan-increasing RNAi treatments. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) reveals aging as a transcriptomic drift along a single direction, consistent across the vastly diverse biological conditions and coinciding with the first principal component, a hallmark of the criticality of the underlying gene regulatory network. We therefore expected that the organism's aging state could be characterized by a single number closely related to vitality deficit or biological age. The \"aging trajectory\", i.e. the dependence of the biological age on chronological age, is then a universal stochastic function modulated by the network stiffness; a macroscopic parameter reflecting the network topology and associated with the rate of aging. To corroborate this view, we used publicly available datasets to define a transcriptomic biomarker of age and observed that the rescaling of age by lifespan simultaneously brings together aging trajectories of transcription and survival curves. In accordance with the theoretical prediction, the limiting mortality value at the plateau agrees closely with the mortality rate doubling exponent estimated at the cross-over age near the average lifespan. Finally, we used the transcriptomic signature of age to identify possible life-extending drug compounds and successfully tested a handful of the top-ranking molecules in C. elegans survival assays and achieved up to a +30% extension of mean lifespan.

        "Leukotriene B4-type I interferon axis regulates macrophage-mediated disease tolerance to influenza infection. Host defence against influenza A virus (IAV) infection depends not only on host resistance to eliminate the virus, but also disease tolerance to limit lung tissue damage and maintain pulmonary function. Fatal IAV infections are frequently the result of a maladaptive immune response that compromises disease tolerance rather than host resistance to infection. Here, we show that the leukotriene B4 (LTB4)-type I interferon (IFN) axis promotes a distinct mechanism of disease tolerance to pulmonary IAV infection. We demonstrate that mice genetically deficient in LTB4 signalling (Blt1R-/-) are more susceptible to IAV infection compared to control mice, despite similar pulmonary viral loads. The increased susceptibility of Blt1R-/- mice is associated with an accumulation of inflammatory monocyte-derived macrophages (IMMs) causing increased lung immunopathology. We mechanistically define that LTB4 signalling via the BLT1 receptor enhances the activation of the type I IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 receptor (IFNAR)/ and signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1), which leads to IFN-\u03b1 production by interstitial macrophages to suppresse in situ IMM proliferation. Importantly, the delivery of a single dose of LTB4 at the peak viral load reduces IMM proliferation, controls tissue damage and increases survival without affecting host resistance to IAV. These results reveal an unexpected anti-inflammatory role of LTB4 in disease tolerance to IAV infection. ",
        "Smad7:\u03b2-catenin complex regulates myogenic gene transcription. Recent reports indicate that Smad7 promotes skeletal muscle differentiation and growth. We previously documented a non-canonical role of nuclear Smad7 during myogenesis, independent of its role in TGF-\u03b2 signaling. Here further characterization of the myogenic function of Smad7 revealed \u03b2-catenin as a Smad7 interacting protein. Biochemical analysis identified a Smad7 interaction domain (SID) between aa575 and aa683 of \u03b2-catenin. Reporter gene analysis and chromatin immunoprecipitation demonstrated that Smad7 and \u03b2-catenin are cooperatively recruited to the extensively characterized ckm promoter proximal region to facilitate its muscle restricted transcriptional activation in myogenic cells. Depletion of endogenous Smad7 and \u03b2-catenin in muscle cells reduced ckm promoter activity indicating their role during myogenesis. Deletion of the \u03b2-catenin SID substantially reduced the effect of Smad7 on the ckm promoter and exogenous expression of SID abolished \u03b2-catenin function, indicating that SID functions as a trans dominant-negative regulator of \u03b2-catenin activity. \u03b2-catenin interaction with the Mediator kinase complex through its Med12 subunit led us to identify MED13 as an additional Smad7-binding partner. Collectively, these studies document a novel function of a Smad7-MED12/13-\u03b2-catenin complex at the ckm locus, indicating a key role of this complex in the program of myogenic gene expression underlying skeletal muscle development and regeneration.

        "Efficacy of Epicutaneous Immunotherapy in Children With Milk-Induced Eosinophilic Esophagitis. BACKGROUND & AIMS: Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is caused by an immune response to specific food allergens. There are no approved therapies beyond avoidance of the allergen(s) or treatment of inflammation. Epicutaneous immunotherapy (EPIT) reduces features of eosinophilic gastrointestinal disease in mice and pigs. We performed randomized, placebo-controlled study to determine the safety and efficacy of EPIT with Viaskin milk in children with milk-induced EoE. METHODS: In a double-blind study, 20 children (4-17 years old) with milk-induced EoE were randomly assigned to groups given EPIT with Viaskin milk (n = 15) or placebo (n = 5) for 9 months during a milk-free period, followed by milk-containing diet for 2 months with EPIT. Then, subjects underwent upper endoscopy analysis, biopsies were collected, and maximum esophageal eosinophil counts were determined and was the primary endpoint. After upper endoscopy, patients were given open-label EPIT for 11 months (open-label phase). The subjects were allowed to consume milk if they had maximum values of fewer than 10 eosinophils/high-power field (eos/hpf); otherwise, they remained on a milk-free diet until the last 2 months of the open-label phase. RESULTS: In the intent to treat population, there was no significant difference between the Viaskin milk group in mean eos/hpf (50.1 \u00b1 43.97 eos/hpf) vs the placebo group (48.20 \u00b1 56.98 eos/hpf). However, in the per-protocol population (7 patients given Viaskin milk and 2 patients given placebo), patients given Viaskin milk patients had a significantly lower mean eos/hpf count (25.57 \u00b1 31.19) than patients given placebo (95.00 \u00b1 63.64) (p = .038). At the end of the open-label phase, 9 of 19 evaluable subjects had mean values of fewer than 15 eos/hpf (47% response). The number of adverse events did not differ significantly between the Viaskin milk and placebo groups; there was 1 serious adverse event in the placebo group. CONCLUSIONS: In a pilot study of pediatric patients with EoE given EPIT with Viaskin milk or placebo for 11 months, we found no significant difference between groups for the maximum eosinophil count at the end of the study. However, findings from a per-protocol analysis indicate that Viaskin milk can reduce eos/hpf. At study completion, 47% of patients who continued open-label Viaskin milk for an additional 11 months had mean values of fewer than 15 eos/hpf. ClinicalTrials.gov no: NCT02579876. ",
        "Genome-lamina interactions are established de novo in the early mouse embryo. In mammals, the emergence of totipotency after fertilization involves extensive rearrangements of the spatial positioning of the genome1,2. However, the contribution of spatial genome organization to the regulation of developmental programs is unclear3. Here we generate high-resolution maps of genomic interactions with the nuclear lamina (a filamentous meshwork that lines the inner nuclear membrane) in mouse pre-implantation embryos. We reveal that nuclear organization is not inherited from the maternal germline but is instead established de novo shortly after fertilization. The two parental genomes establish lamina-associated domains (LADs)4 with different features that converge after the 8-cell stage. We find that the mechanism of LAD establishment is unrelated to DNA replication. Instead, we show that paternal LAD formation in zygotes is prevented by ectopic expression of Kdm5b, which\u00a0suggests that LAD establishment may be dependent on remodelling of H3K4 methylation. Our data suggest a step-wise assembly model whereby early LAD formation precedes consolidation of topologically associating domains. ",
        "Dog bite injuries to the face: Is there risk with breed ownership? A systematic review with meta-analysis. INTRODUCTION: Dog bite injuries to the face are a serious, yet modifiable public health concern. This study explores the relationship between dog breed and the risk of biting and injury. The objective of this study is to determine the relative risk and severity of dog bite injuries to the face by breed. METHODS: Retrospective chart review of facial dog bite injuries presenting to the University of Virginia Health System and Nationwide Children's Hospital. Additionally, descriptive data was collected from 240 patients over the last 15 years. Bite risk by breed was assessed by a literature search from 1970 to current. A composite measure was used to determine the severity of injury, and characterize each patient into an ordinal scale of bite severity. An average of each breed bite rate within each study was calculated and combined to create an empiric bite risk by breed. Dog breeds were also further characterized morphologically. RESULTS: Bite risk by breed from the literature review and bite severity by breed from our case series were combined to create a total bite risk plot. Injuries from Pitbull's and mixed breed dogs were both more frequent and more severe. This data is well-suited for a bubble plot showing bite risk on the x-axis, bite severity on the y-axis, and size of the bubble by number of cases. This creates a \"risk to own\" graphic for potential dog owners. CONCLUSIONS: Breeds vary in both rates of biting and severity. The highest risk breeds had both a high rate of biting and caused significant tissue injury. Physical characteristics can also help determine risk for unknown or mixed dog breeds. Potential dog owners can utilize this data when assessing which breed to own. ",
        "Blood pressure after a heightened pesticide spray period among children living in agricultural communities in Ecuador. INTRODUCTION: Agricultural pesticide spray periods increase the pesticide exposure potential of children living nearby and growing evidence indicates that they may affect children's health. We examined the association of time following a heightened agricultural production period, the Mother's Day flower harvest (May), with children's blood pressure (BP). METHODS: We included cross-sectional information of 313 children ages 4-9 years in Ecuadorian agricultural communities (the ESPINA study). Examinations occurred during a period of low flower production, but within 63-100 days (mean\u202f=\u202f81.5, SD\u202f=\u202f10.9) following the Mother's Day harvest. BP was measured twice using a pediatric sphygmomanometer and BP percentiles appropriate for age, gender and height were calculated. RESULTS: Participants were 51% male, 1.6% hypertensive and 7.7% had elevated BP. The mean (SD) BP percentiles were: systolic: 51.7 (23.9); diastolic: 33.3 (20.3). There was an inverse relationship between of time after the spray season with percentiles of systolic (difference [\u03b2] per 10.9 days after the harvest: -4.3 [95%CI: -6.9, -1.7]) and diastolic BP (\u03b2: -7.5 [-9.6, -5.4]) after adjusting for race, heart rate and BMI-for-age z-score. A curvilinear association with diastolic BP was observed. For every 10.9 days that a child was examined sooner after the harvest, the OR of elevated BP/hypertension doubled (OR: 2.0, 95% CI: 1.3, 3.1). Time after the harvest was positively associated with acetylcholinesterase. CONCLUSIONS: Children examined sooner after a heightened pesticide spray period had higher blood pressure and pesticide exposure markers than children examined later. Further studies with multiple exposure-outcome measures across pesticide spray periods are needed. ",
        "Combating Vaccine Hesitancy with Vaccine-Preventable Disease Familiarization: An Interview and Curriculum Intervention for College Students. In 2019, the World Health Organization (WHO) listed vaccine hesitancy in its top ten threats to global health. Vaccine hesitancy is a \"delay in acceptance or refusal to vaccinate despite availability of vaccination services\". Urban areas with large amounts of vaccine hesitancy are at risk for the resurgence of vaccine-preventable diseases (VPDs). Many vaccine-hesitant (VH) parents may be unfamiliar with the consequences of VPDs, and thus might be swayed when confronted with the symptoms and dangers of VPDs. As such, we sought to educate college students (future parents) in an urban vaccine-hesitant hotspot by assigning them to interview family or community members who had experienced a VPD. Student vaccine attitudes were assessed by surveys before and after the interviews. Vaccine-hesitant students who conducted a VPD interview but received no additional vaccine educational materials were significantly more likely (interaction term p < 0.001) to become pro-vaccine (PV) (68%) than students who conducted an autoimmune interview and received no additional educational materials. Additionally, students whose interviewees experienced intense physical suffering or physical limitations or students who were enrolled in a course with intensive VPD and vaccine curriculum had significantly increased vaccine attitudes. This suggests that introducing students to VPDs can decrease vaccine hesitancy. ",
        "Gender differences in grant and personnel award funding rates at the Canadian Institutes of Health Research based on research content area: A retrospective analysis. BACKGROUND: Although women at all career stages are more likely to leave academia than men, early-career women are a particularly high-risk group. Research supports that women are less likely than men to receive research funding; however, whether funding success rates vary based on research content is unknown. We addressed gender differences in funding success rates for applications directed to one or more of 13 institutes, representing research communities, over a 15-year period. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We retrospectively reviewed 55,700 grant and 4,087 personnel award applications submitted to the Canadian Institutes of Health Research. We analyzed application success rates according to gender and the primary institute selected by applicants, pooled gender differences in success rates using random effects models, and fitted Poisson regression models to assess the effects of gender, time, and institute. We noted variable success rates among grant applications directed to selected institutes and declining success rates over time. Women submitted 31.1% and 44.7% of grant and personnel award applications, respectively. In the pooled estimate, women had significantly lower grant success (risk ratio [RR] 0.89, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.84-0.94; p < 0.001; absolute difference 3.2%) compared with men, with substantial heterogeneity (I2 = 58%). Compared with men, women who directed grants to the Institutes of Cancer Research (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.78-0.96), Circulatory and Respiratory Health (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.66-0.84), Health Services and Policy Research (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.68-0.90), and Musculoskeletal Health and Arthritis (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.69-0.93) were significantly less likely to be funded, and those who directed grants to the Institute of Aboriginal People's Health (RR 1.67, 95% CI 1.0-2.7) were more likely to be funded. Overall, women also had significantly lower personnel award success (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.65-0.86; p < 0.001; absolute difference 6.6%). Regression modelling identified that the effect of gender on grant success rates differed by institute and not time. Study limitations include use of institutes as a surrogate identifier, variability in designation of primary institute, and lack of access to metrics reflecting applicants, coapplicants, peer reviewers, and the peer-review process. CONCLUSIONS: Gender disparity existed overall in grant and personnel award success rates, especially for grants directed to selected research communities. Funding agencies should monitor for gender differences in grant success rates overall and by research content. ",
        "Battle for the thermostat: Gender and the effect of temperature on cognitive performance. This paper studies differences in the effect of temperature on cognitive performance by gender in a large controlled lab experiment (N = 543). We study performance in math, verbal and cognitive reflection tasks and find that the effects of temperature vary significantly across men and women. At higher temperatures, women perform better on a math and verbal task while the reverse effect is observed for men. The increase in female performance in response to higher temperature is significantly larger and more precisely estimated than the corresponding decrease in male performance. In contrast to math and verbal tasks, temperature has no impact on a measure of cognitive reflection for either gender. Our findings suggest that gender mixed workplaces may be able to increase productivity by setting the thermostat higher than current standards. ",
        "Sex Differences in Presentation and Outcome After an Acute Transient or Minor Neurologic Event. Importance: Sex differences have been described in the presentation, care, and outcomes among people with acute ischemic strokes, but these differences are less understood for minor ischemic cerebrovascular events. The present study hypothesized that, compared with men, women are more likely to report nonfocal symptoms and to receive a stroke mimic diagnosis. Objective: To evaluate sex differences in the symptoms, diagnoses, and outcomes of patients with acute transient or minor neurologic events. Design, Setting, and Participants: This prospective cohort study of patients with minor ischemic cerebrovascular events or stroke mimics enrolled at multicenter academic emergency departments in Canada between December 2013 and March 2017 and followed up for 90 days is a substudy of SpecTRA (Spectrometry for Transient Ischemic Attack Rapid Assessment). In total, 1729 consecutive consenting patients with acute transient or minor neurologic symptoms were referred for neurologic evaluation; 66 patients were excluded for protocol violation (n\u2009=\u200946) or diagnosis of transient global amnesia (n\u2009=\u200920). Exposures: The main exposure was female or male sex. Main Outcomes and Measures: The main outcome was the clinical diagnosis (cerebral ischemia vs stroke mimic). Secondary outcomes were 90-day stroke recurrence and 90-day composite outcome of stroke, myocardial infarction, or death. The association between presenting symptoms (focal vs nonfocal) and clinical diagnosis was also assessed. Research hypotheses were formulated after data collection. Results: Of 1648 patients included, 770 (46.7%) were women, the median (interquartile range) age was 70 (59-80) years, 1509 patients (91.6%) underwent brain magnetic resonance imaging, and 1582 patients (96.0%) completed the 90-day follow-up. Women (522 of 770 [67.8%]) were less likely than men (674 of 878 [76.8%]) to receive a diagnosis of cerebral ischemia (adjusted risk ratio [aRR], 0.88; 95% CI, 0.82-0.95), but the 90-day stroke recurrence outcome (aRR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.48-1.66) and 90-day composite outcome (aRR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.54-1.32) were similar for men and women. No significant sex differences were found for presenting symptoms. Compared with patients with no focal neurologic symptoms, those with focal and nonfocal symptoms were more likely to receive a diagnosis of cerebral ischemia (aRR, 1.28; 95% CI, 1.15-1.39), but the risk was highest among patients with focal symptoms only (aRR, 1.45; 95% CI, 1.34-1.53). Sex did not modify these associations. Conclusions and Relevance: The results of the present study suggest that, despite similar presenting symptoms among men and women, women may be more likely to receive a diagnosis of stroke mimic, but they may not have a lower risk than men of subsequent vascular events, indicating potentially missed opportunities for prevention of vascular events among women.

        "Limitation of TCA Cycle Intermediates Represents an Oxygen-Independent Nutritional Antibacterial Effector Mechanism of Macrophages. In hypoxic and inflamed tissues, oxygen (O2)-dependent antimicrobial defenses are impaired due to a shortage of O2. To gain insight into the mechanisms that control bacterial infection under hypoxic conditions, we infected macrophages with the obligate intracellular pathogen Coxiella burnetii, the causative agent of Q fever. Our experiments revealed that hypoxia impeded C.\u00a0burnetii replication in a hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) 1\u03b1-dependent manner. Mechanistically, under hypoxia, HIF1\u03b1 impaired the activity of STAT3, which in turn reduced the intracellular level of TCA cycle intermediates, including citrate, and impeded C.\u00a0burnetii replication in macrophages. However, bacterial viability was maintained, allowing the persistence of C.\u00a0burnetii, which is a prerequisite for the development of chronic Q fever. This knowledge will open future research avenues on the pathogenesis of chronic Q fever. In addition, the regulation of TCA cycle metabolites by HIF1\u03b1 represents a previously unappreciated mechanism of host defense against intracellular pathogens. ",
        "Single crossover-mediated targeted nucleotide substitution and knock-in strategies with CRISPR/Cas9 system in the rice blast fungus. Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9)-mediated genome editing has become a promising approach for efficient and versatile genetic engineering in various organisms; however, simple and precise nucleotide modification methods in filamentous fungi have been restricted to double crossover type homologous recombination (HR). In this study, we developed a novel genome editing strategy via single crossover-mediated HR in the model filamentous fungus Pyricularia (Magnaporthe) oryzae. This method includes the CRISPR/Cas9 system and a donor vector harboring a single homology arm with point mutations at the CRISPR/Cas9 cleavage site. Using this strategy, we demonstrated highly efficient and freely programmable base substitutions within the desired genomic locus, and target gene disrupted mutants were also obtained via a shortened (100-1000\u2009bp) single homology arm. We further demonstrated that this method allowed a one-step GFP gene knock-in at the C-terminus of the targeted gene. Since the genomic recombination does not require an intact protospacer-adjacent motif within the donor construct and any additional modifications of host components, this method can be used in various filamentous fungi for CRISPR/Cas9-based basic and applied biological analyses.

        "OLIG2 Drives Abnormal Neurodevelopmental Phenotypes in Human iPSC-Based Organoid and Chimeric Mouse Models of Down Syndrome. Down syndrome (DS) is a common neurodevelopmental disorder, and cognitive defects in DS patients may arise from imbalances in excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission. Understanding the mechanisms underlying such imbalances may provide opportunities for therapeutic intervention. Here, we show that human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) derived from DS patients overproduce OLIG2+ ventral forebrain neural progenitors. As a result, DS hiPSC-derived cerebral organoids excessively produce specific subclasses of GABAergic interneurons and cause impaired recognition memory in neuronal chimeric mice. Increased OLIG2 expression in DS cells directly upregulates interneuron lineage-determining transcription factors. shRNA-mediated knockdown of OLIG2 largely reverses abnormal gene expression in early-stage DS neural progenitors, reduces interneuron production in DS organoids and chimeric mouse brains, and improves behavioral deficits in DS chimeric mice. Thus, altered OLIG2 expression may underlie neurodevelopmental abnormalities and cognitive defects in DS patients. ",
        "Semen quality of young men in Switzerland: a nationwide cross-sectional population-based study. BACKGROUND: Sperm counts have been steadily decreasing over the past five decades with regional differences in the Western world. The reasons behind these trends are complex, but numerous insights indicate that environmental and lifestyle factors are important players. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate semen quality and male reproductive health in Switzerland. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A nationwide cross-sectional study was conducted on 2523 young men coming from all regions of Switzerland, recruited during military conscription. Semen volume, sperm concentration, motility, and morphology were analyzed. Anatomy of the genital area and testicular volume was recorded. Testicular cancer incidence rates in the general population were retrieved from Swiss regional registries. RESULTS: Median sperm concentration adjusted for period of sexual abstinence was 48\u00a0million/mL. Comparing with the 5th percentile of the WHO reference values for fertile men, 17% of men had sperm concentration below 15\u00a0million/mL, 25% had less than 40% motile spermatozoa, and 43% had less than 4% normal forms. Disparities in semen quality among geographic regions, urbanization rates, and linguistic areas were limited. A larger proportion of men with poor semen quality had been exposed in utero to maternal smoking. Furthermore, testicular cancer incidence rates in the Swiss general population increased significantly between 1980 and 2014. DISCUSSION: For the first time, a systematic sampling among young men has confirmed that semen quality is affected on a national level. The median sperm concentration measured is among the lowest observed in Europe. No specific geographical differences could be identified. Further studies are needed to determine to what extent the fertility of Swiss men is compromised and to evaluate the impact of environmental and lifestyle factors. CONCLUSION: A significant proportion of Swiss young men display suboptimal semen quality with only 38% having sperm concentration, motility, and morphology values that met WHO semen reference criteria.

        "Mortality Among Professional American-Style Football Players and Professional American Baseball Players. Importance: Studies of American-style football players have suggested lower overall mortality rates compared with general populations, but with possibly increased neurodegenerative mortality. However, comparisons with general populations can introduce bias. This study compared mortality between US National Football League (NFL) and US Major League Baseball (MLB) players, a more appropriate comparison group of professional athletes. Objective: To compare all-cause and cause-specific mortality between NFL and MLB players. Design, Setting, and Participants: In this retrospective cohort study, the setting was US mortality from January 1, 1979, through December 31, 2013. The dates of analysis were January 2016 to April 2019. Participants were 3419 NFL and 2708 MLB players with at least 5 playing seasons. Exposures: Participation in the NFL compared with the MLB. Main Outcomes and Measures: Vital status and causes of death from the National Death Index from 1979 through 2013 were obtained. Cox proportional hazards regression models using age as the timescale were used to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs to examine all-cause and cause-specific mortality among NFL players compared with MLB players, adjusted for race and decade of birth. Results: By the end of follow-up, there were 517 deaths (mean [SD] age, 59.6 [13.2] years) in the NFL cohort and 431 deaths (mean [SD] age, 66.7 [12.3] years) in the MLB cohort. Cardiovascular and neurodegenerative conditions, respectively, were noted as underlying or contributing causes in 498 and 39 deaths in the NFL and 225 and 16 deaths in the MLB. Compared with MLB players, NFL players had significantly elevated rates of all-cause (HR, 1.26; 95% CI, 1.10-1.44), cardiovascular disease (HR, 2.40; 95% CI, 2.03-2.84), and neurodegenerative disease (HR, 2.99; 95% CI, 1.64-5.45) mortality. Comparing hypothetical populations of 1000 NFL and 1000 MLB players followed up to age 75 years, there would be an excess 21 all-cause deaths among NFL players, as well as 77 and 11 more deaths with underlying or contributing causes that included cardiovascular and neurodegenerative conditions, respectively. Conclusions and Relevance: This study found that NFL players had elevated all-cause, cardiovascular, and neurodegenerative mortality rates compared with MLB players, although the absolute number of excess neurodegenerative deaths was still small. Factors that vary across these sports (eg, body habitus and head trauma) as opposed to those common across sports (eg, physical activity) could underlie the differences. ",
        "Propagation and Selectivity of Axonal Loss in Leber Hereditary Optic Neuropathy. Leber hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON) is a syndrome of subacute loss of central vision associated with mutations in mitochondrial DNA coding for components of complex I. LHON preferentially involves small axons in the temporal optic nerve, but the reason is unclear. We performed a Monte Carlo simulation of the spread of injury in LHON axons to better understand the predilection for small axons. Optic nerve slices were modeled as grids containing axons with sizes from reported regional distributions. The propagation of injury from a localized concentration of superoxide was simulated as the spread via passive diffusion from one axon to adjacent axons, with basal production and scavenging rate proportional to axonal area and volume, respectively. Axonal degeneration occurred when intra-axonal concentrations reached a toxic threshold. Simulations demonstrated that almost all small and medium axons degenerated by the time steady-state was reached, but about 50% of large axons were preserved. The location of initial injury affected time to steady state, with nasal injuries reaching steady state faster than temporal injuries. The pattern of axonal degeneration in the simulations mirrored both visual fields and optic nerve histology from patients with LHON. These results provide insight into the nature of axonal loss in LHON. ",
        "Oral Bacterial Signatures in Cerebral Thrombi of Patients With Acute Ischemic Stroke Treated With Thrombectomy. Background Chronic infections have been reported to be risk factors for both coronary heart disease and ischemic stroke. DNA of oral bacteria, mainly from the viridans streptococci group, has been detected in coronary thrombus aspirates of myocardial infarction and cerebral aneurysms. Viridans streptococci are known to cause infective endocarditis and possess thrombogenic properties. We studied the presence of oral bacterial DNA in thrombus aspirates of patients with acute ischemic stroke treated with mechanical thrombectomy. Methods and Results Thrombus aspirates and arterial blood were taken from 75 patients (69% men; mean age, 67\u00a0years) with acute ischemic stroke. The presence of Streptococcus species, mainly the Streptococcus mitis group, belonging to viridans streptococci as well as Porphyromonas gingivalis and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans in samples were determined using a quantitative polymerase chain reaction with specific primers and probes. The relative amount of bacterial DNA in a sample was determined with the comparative threshold cycle method. Bacterial DNA was detected in 84% (n=63) of aspired thrombi, and 16% (n=12) of samples were considered bacterial DNA negative. DNA of Streptococcus species, mainly the S mitis group, was found in 79% (n=59) of samples. The median relative amount of Streptococcus species DNA was 5.10-fold higher compared with the control blood samples from the same patients. All thrombi were negative for both P gingivalis and A actinomycetemcomitans. Conclusions This is the first study showing the common presence of bacterial DNA from viridans streptococci in aspired thrombi of patients with acute ischemic stroke. Streptococcal bacteria, mostly of oral origin, may contribute to the progression and thrombotic events of cerebrovascular diseases. ",
        "A Multiplexed Serologic Test for Diagnosis of Lyme Disease for Point-of-Care Use. Single multiplexed assays could replace the standard 2-tiered (STT) algorithm recommended for the laboratory diagnosis of Lyme disease if they perform with a specificity and a sensitivity superior or equal to those of the STT algorithm. We used human serum rigorously characterized to be sera from patients with acute- and convalescent-phase early Lyme disease, Lyme arthritis, and posttreatment Lyme disease syndrome, as well as the necessary controls (n\u2009=\u2009241 samples), to select the best of 12 Borrelia burgdorferi proteins to improve our microfluidic assay (mChip-Ld). We then evaluated its serodiagnostic performance in comparison to that of a first-tier enzyme immunoassay and the STT algorithm. We observed that more antigens became positive as Lyme disease progressed from early to late stages. We selected three antigens (3Ag) to include in the mChip-Ld: VlsE and a proprietary synthetic 33-mer peptide (PepVF) to capture sensitivity in all disease stages and OspC for early Lyme disease. With the specificity set at 95%, the sensitivity of the mChip-Ld with 3Ag ranged from 80% (95% confidence interval [CI], 56% to 94%) and 85% (95% CI, 74% to 96%) for two panels of serum from patients with early Lyme disease and was 100% (95% CI, 83% to 100%) for serum from patients with Lyme arthritis; the STT algorithm detected early Lyme disease in the same two panels of serum from patients with early Lyme disease with a sensitivity of 48.5% and 75% and Lyme arthritis in serum from patients with Lyme arthritis with a sensitivity of 100%, and the specificity was 97.5% to 100%. The mChip-Ld platform outperformed the STT algorithm according to sensitivity. These results open the door for the development of a single, rapid, multiplexed diagnostic test for point-of-care use that can be designed to identify the Lyme disease stage. ",
        "An evolutionary recent IFN/IL-6/CEBP axis is linked to monocyte expansion and tuberculosis severity in humans. Monocyte counts are increased during human tuberculosis (TB) but it has not been determined whether Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) directly regulates myeloid commitment. We demonstrated that exposure to Mtb directs primary human CD34+ cells to differentiate into monocytes/macrophages. In vitro myeloid conversion did not require type I or type II IFN signaling. In contrast, Mtb enhanced IL-6 responses by CD34+ cell cultures and IL-6R neutralization inhibited myeloid differentiation and decreased mycobacterial growth in vitro. Integrated systems biology analysis of transcriptomic, proteomic and genomic data of large data sets of healthy controls and TB patients established the existence of a myeloid IL-6/IL6R/CEBP gene module associated with disease severity. Furthermore, genetic and functional analysis revealed the IL6/IL6R/CEBP gene module has undergone recent evolutionary selection, including Neanderthal introgression and human pathogen adaptation, connected to systemic monocyte counts. These results suggest Mtb co-opts an evolutionary recent IFN-IL6-CEBP feed-forward loop, increasing myeloid differentiation linked to severe TB in humans. ",
        "Artificially Enhancing and Suppressing Hippocampus-Mediated Memories. Emerging evidence indicates that distinct hippocampal domains differentially drive cognition and emotion [1, 2]; dorsal regions encode spatial, temporal, and contextual information [3-5], whereas ventral regions regulate stress responses [6], anxiety-related behaviors [7, 8], and emotional states [8-10]. Although previous studies demonstrate that optically manipulating cells in the dorsal hippocampus can drive the behavioral expression of positive and negative memories, it is unknown whether changes in cellular activity in the ventral hippocampus can drive such behaviors [11-14]. Investigating the extent to which distinct hippocampal memories across the longitudinal axis modulate behavior could aid in the understanding of stress-related psychiatric disorders known to affect emotion, memory, and cognition [15]. Here, we asked whether tagging and stimulating cells along the dorsoventral axis of the hippocampus could acutely, chronically, and differentially promote context-specific behaviors. Acute reactivation of both dorsal and ventral hippocampus cells that were previously active during memory formation drove freezing behavior, place avoidance, and place preference. Moreover, chronic stimulation of dorsal or ventral hippocampal fear memories produced a context-specific reduction or enhancement of fear responses, respectively, thus demonstrating bi-directional and context-specific modulation of memories along the longitudinal axis of the hippocampus. Fear memory suppression was associated with a reduction in hippocampal cells active during retrieval, while fear memory enhancement was associated with an increase in basolateral amygdala activity. Together, our data demonstrate that discrete sets of cells throughout the hippocampus provide key nodes sufficient to bi-directionally reprogram both the neural and behavioral expression of memory.

        "Kidney regeneration with biomimetic vascular scaffolds based on vascular corrosion casts. We have developed a biomimetic renal vascular scaffold based on a vascular corrosion casting technique. This study evaluated the feasibility of using this novel biomimetic scaffold for kidney regeneration in a rat kidney cortical defect model. Vascular corrosion casts were prepared from normal rat kidneys by perfusion with 10% polycaprolactone (PCL) solution, followed by tissue digestion. The corrosion PCL cast was coated with collagen, and PCL was removed from within the collagen coating, leaving only a hollow collagen-based biomimetic vascular scaffold. The fabricated scaffolds were pre-vascularized with MS1 endothelial cell coating, incorporated into 3D renal constructs, and subsequently implanted either with or without human renal cells in the renal cortex of nude rats. The implanted collagen-based vascular scaffold was easily identified and integrated into native kidney tissue. The biomimetic vascular scaffold coated with endothelial cells (MS1) showed significantly enhanced vascularization, as compared to the uncoated scaffold and hydrogel only groups (P\u202f<\u202f0.001). Along with the improved vascularization effects, the MS1-coated scaffolds showed a significant renal cell infiltration from the neighboring host tissue, as compared to the other groups (P\u202f<\u202f0.05). Moreover, addition of human renal cells to the MS1-coated scaffold resulted in further enhancement of vascularization and tubular structure regeneration within the implanted constructs. The biomimetic collagen vascular scaffolds coated with endothelial cells are able to enhance vascularization and facilitate the formation of renal tubules after 14\u202fdays when combined with human renal cells. This study shows the feasibility of bioengineering vascularized functional renal tissues for kidney regeneration. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Vascularization is one of the major hurdles affecting the survival and integration of implanted three-dimensional tissue constructs in vivo. A novel, biomimetic, collagen-based vascular scaffold that is structurally identical to native kidney tissue was developed and tested. This biomimetic vascularized scaffold system facilitates the development of new vessels and renal cell viability in vivo when implanted in a partial renal defect. The use of this scaffold system could address the challenges associated with vascularization, and may be an ideal treatment strategy for partial augmentation of renal function in patients with chronic kidney disease.

        "Multiplane Calcium Imaging Reveals Disrupted Development of Network Topology in Zebrafish pcdh19 Mutants. Functional brain networks self-assemble during development, although the molecular basis of network assembly is poorly understood. Protocadherin-19 (pcdh19) is a homophilic cell adhesion molecule that is linked to neurodevelopmental disorders, and influences multiple cellular and developmental events in zebrafish. Although loss of PCDH19 in humans and model organisms leads to functional deficits, the underlying network defects remain unknown. Here, we employ multiplane, resonant-scanning in vivo two-photon calcium imaging of developing zebrafish, and use graph theory to characterize the development of resting state functional networks in both wild-type and pcdh19 mutant larvae. We find that the brain networks of pcdh19 mutants display enhanced clustering and an altered developmental trajectory of network assembly. Our results show that functional imaging and network analysis in zebrafish larvae is an effective approach for characterizing the developmental impact of lesions in genes of clinical interest. ",
        "Stem cell-associated heterogeneity in Glioblastoma results from intrinsic tumor plasticity shaped by the microenvironment. The identity and unique capacity of cancer stem cells (CSC) to drive tumor growth and resistance have been challenged in brain tumors. Here we report that cells expressing CSC-associated cell membrane markers in Glioblastoma (GBM) do not represent a clonal entity defined by distinct functional properties and transcriptomic profiles, but rather a plastic state that most cancer cells can adopt. We show that phenotypic heterogeneity arises from non-hierarchical, reversible state transitions, instructed by the microenvironment and is\u00a0predictable by mathematical modeling. Although functional stem cell properties were similar in vitro, accelerated reconstitution of heterogeneity provides a growth advantage in vivo, suggesting that tumorigenic potential is linked to intrinsic plasticity rather than CSC multipotency. The capacity of any given cancer cell to reconstitute tumor heterogeneity cautions against therapies targeting CSC-associated membrane epitopes. Instead inherent cancer cell plasticity emerges as a novel relevant target for treatment. ",
        "Compartmentalized gut lymph node drainage dictates adaptive immune responses. The intestinal immune system has the challenging task of tolerating foreign nutrients and the commensal microbiome, while excluding or eliminating ingested pathogens. Failure of this balance leads to conditions such as inflammatory bowel diseases, food allergies and invasive gastrointestinal infections1. Multiple immune mechanisms are therefore in place to maintain tissue integrity, including balanced generation of effector T (TH) cells and FOXP3+ regulatory T (pTreg) cells, which mediate resistance to pathogens and regulate excessive immune activation, respectively1-4. The gut-draining lymph nodes (gLNs) are key sites for orchestrating adaptive immunity to luminal perturbations5-7. However, it is unclear how they simultaneously support tolerogenic and inflammatory reactions. Here we show that gLNs are immunologically specific to the functional gut segment that they drain. Stromal and dendritic cell gene signatures and polarization of T cells against the same luminal antigen differ between gLNs, with the proximal small intestine-draining gLNs preferentially giving rise to tolerogenic responses and the distal gLNs to pro-inflammatory T cell responses. This segregation permitted\u00a0the targeting of distal gLNs for vaccination and the maintenance of duodenal pTreg cell induction during colonic infection. Conversely, the compartmentalized dichotomy was perturbed by surgical removal of select distal gLNs and duodenal infection, with effects on both lymphoid organ and tissue immune responses. Our findings reveal that the conflict between tolerogenic and inflammatory intestinal responses is in part resolved by discrete gLN drainage, and encourage antigen targeting to specific gut segments for therapeutic immune modulation.

        "Failure to attune to language predicts autism in high risk infants. Young humans are typically sensitive to evolutionarily important aspects of information in the surrounding environment in a way that makes us thrive. Seeking to probe the putative disruptions of this process in infancy, I examined the statistical character of head movements in 52 9-10 mo-old infants, half at high familial risk (HR) for Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD), who underwent an fMRI scan while listening to words spoken with alternating stress patterns on syllables. Relative to low risk (LR) infants, HR infants, in particular those showing the least rapid receptive language progress, had significantly lower noise-to-signal levels and increased symmetry. A comparison of patterns during a native language and a sleep scan revealed the most atypical ordering of signatures on the 3 tasks in a subset of HR infants, suggesting that the biological mechanism of language development is least acquisitive in those HR infants who go on to develop ASD in toddlerhood.

        "Mesoscopic Neural Representations in Spatial Navigation. Recent evidence suggests that mesoscopic neural oscillations measured via intracranial electroencephalography exhibit spatial representations, which were previously only observed at the micro- and macroscopic level of brain organization. Specifically, theta (and gamma) oscillations correlate with movement, speed, distance, specific locations, and goal proximity to boundaries. In entorhinal cortex (EC), they exhibit hexadirectional modulation, which is putatively linked to grid cell activity. Understanding this mesoscopic neural code is crucial because information represented by oscillatory power and phase may complement the information content at other levels of brain organization. Mesoscopic neural oscillations help bridge the gap between single-neuron and macroscopic brain signals of spatial navigation and may provide a mechanistic basis for novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets to treat diseases causing spatial disorientation.

        "Human Hippocampal Neurogenesis Persists in Aged Adults and Alzheimer's Disease Patients. Whether hippocampal neurogenesis persists throughout life in the human brain is not fully resolved. Here, we demonstrate that hippocampal neurogenesis is persistent through the tenth decade of life and is detectable in patients with mild cognitive impairments and Alzheimer's disease. In a cohort of 18 participants with a mean age of 90.6 years, Nestin+Sox2+ neural progenitor cells (NPCs) and DCX+ neuroblasts and immature neurons were detected, but their numbers greatly varied between participants. Nestin+ cells localize in the anterior hippocampus, and NPCs, neuroblasts, and immature neurons are evenly distributed along the anterior to posterior axis. The number of DCX+PCNA+ cells is reduced in mild cognitive impairments, and higher numbers of neuroblasts are associated with better cognitive status. The number of DCX+PCNA+ cells correlates with functional interactions between presynaptic SNARE proteins. Our results suggest that hippocampal neurogenesis persists in the aged and diseased human brain and that it is possibly associated with cognition. ",
        "An AAV-SGCG Dose-Response Study in a \u03b3-Sarcoglycanopathy Mouse Model in the Context of Mechanical Stress. Sarcoglycanopathies are rare autosomic limb girdle muscular dystrophies caused by mutations in one of the genes coding for sarcoglycans. Sarcoglycans form a complex, which is an important part of the dystrophin-associated glycoprotein complex and which protects the sarcolemma against muscle contraction-induced damage. Absence of one of the sarcoglycans on the plasma membrane reduces the stability of the whole complex and perturbs muscle fiber membrane integrity. There is currently no curative treatment for any of the sarcoglycanopathies. A first clinical trial to evaluate the safety of a recombinant AAV2/1 vector expressing \u03b3-sarcoglycan using an intramuscular route of administration showed limited expression of\u00a0the transgene and good tolerance of the approach. In this\u00a0report, we undertook a dose-effect study in mice to evaluate\u00a0the efficiency of an AAV2/8-expressing \u03b3-sarcoglycan controlled by a muscle-specific promoter with a systemic mode of administration. We observed a dose-related efficiency with a nearly complete restoration of gamma sarcoglycan (SGCG) expression, histological appearance, biomarker level, and whole-body strength at the highest dose tested. In addition, our data suggest that a high expression threshold level must be\u00a0achieved for effective protection of the transduced muscle,\u00a0while a suboptimal transgene expression level might be less protective in the context of mechanical stress.

        "Managing small, highly prolific invasive aquatic species: Exploring an ecosystem approach for the eastern mosquitofish (Gambusia holbrooki). Invasive exotic species threaten native biodiversity worldwide and their management is on the agenda of an increasing number of countries. We explored the potential of an ecosystem approach for the natural control of Gambusia holbrooki, which is among the most pernicious and widely distributed fish invaders. Individual-based linear mixed models were used to identify the ecosystem factors (conspecific density, environment and piscivorous birds) that most influenced life-history variation in male and female G. holbrooki (N\u202f=\u202f654). All traits (body condition, growth, length, gonad weight, offspring size and number, real and potential fertility) were associated with at least one ecosystem factor from the 18 water bodies surveyed in north-eastern Spain. Models for female reproductive traits had the highest fit (R2\u202f=\u202f0.89) and those for body condition in both sexes the lowest (0.12). The life history of G. holbrooki was mostly affected by its density; increasing offspring number at the expense of offspring size at the sites with the highest fish density. Weaker effects on G. holbrooki life history were observed for the abundance of piscivorous birds and water-quality conditions, including turbidity and nutrient concentrations. Although effects were not consistent between traits, outputs supported that G. holbrooki has a wide tolerance to changes in water quality. Therefore, actions based solely on environmental changes within the range tested probably will fail in reducing the proliferation of G. holbrooki, especially if its body condition improved at the most naturalised sites. Overall, this study suggests that the management of G. holbrooki using ecologically sound treatments is likely to be very difficult in stagnant waters. Preventing new introductions and direct removal once established are the most appropriate actions for the management of this small, highly prolific fish invader. ",
        "Hedgehog signaling promotes tumor-associated macrophage polarization to suppress intratumoral CD8+ T cell recruitment. Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) usually display an antiinflammatory M2-like phenotype to facilitate tumor growth. However, what drives M2 polarization of TAMs and how TAMs suppress antitumor immunity within the tumor microenvironment (TME) remain largely undefined. Using several murine tumor models, we showed that hedgehog (Hh) signaling in myeloid cells is critical for TAM M2 polarization and tumor growth. We also found that tumor cells secrete sonic hedgehog (SHH), an Hh ligand, and that tumor-derived SHH drives TAM M2 polarization. Furthermore, Hh-induced functional polarization in TAMs suppresses CD8+ T cell recruitment to the TME through the inhibition of CXCL9 and CXCL10 production by TAMs. Last, we demonstrated that Kr\u00fcppel-like factor 4 (Klf4) mediates Hh-dependent TAM M2 polarization and the immunosuppressive function. Collectively, these findings highlight a critical role for tumor-derived SHH in promoting TAM M2 polarization, a mechanism for TAM-mediated immunosuppression, and may provide insights into the design of new cancer immunotherapeutic strategies.

        "Comparison of Opioid Prescribing by Dentists in the United States and England. Importance: The United States consumes most of the opioids worldwide despite representing a small portion of the world's population. Dentists are one of the most frequent US prescribers of opioids despite data suggesting that nonopioid analgesics are similarly effective for oral pain. While oral health and dentist use are generally similar between the United States and England, it is unclear how opioid prescribing by dentists varies between the 2 countries. Objective: To compare opioid prescribing by dentists in the United States and England. Design, Setting, and Participants: Cross-sectional study of prescriptions for opioids dispensed from outpatient pharmacies and health care settings between January 1 and December 31, 2016, by dentists in the United States and England. Data were analyzed from October 2018 to January 2019. Exposures: Opioids prescribed by dentists. Main Outcomes and Measures: Proportion and prescribing rates of opioid prescriptions. Results: In 2016, the proportion of prescriptions written by US dentists that were for opioids was 37 times greater than the proportion written by English dentists. In all, 22.3% of US dental prescriptions were opioids (11.4 million prescriptions) compared with 0.6% of English dental prescriptions (28\u202f082 prescriptions) (difference, 21.7%; 95% CI, 13.8%-32.1%; P\u2009<\u2009.001). Dentists in the United States also had a higher number of opioid prescriptions per 1000 population (35.4 per 1000 US population [95% CI, 25.2-48.7 per 1000 population] vs 0.5 per 1000 England population [95% CI, 0.03-3.7 per 1000 population]) and number of opioid prescriptions per dentist (58.2 prescriptions per dentist [95% CI, 44.9-75.0 prescriptions per dentist] vs 1.2 prescriptions per dentist [95% CI, 0.2-5.6 prescriptions per dentist]). While the codeine derivative dihydrocodeine was the sole opioid prescribed by English dentists, US dentists prescribed a range of opioids containing hydrocodone (62.3%), codeine (23.2%), oxycodone (9.1%), and tramadol (4.8%). Dentists in the United States also prescribed long-acting opioids (0.06% of opioids prescribed by US dentists [6425 prescriptions]). Long-acting opioids were not prescribed by English dentists. Conclusions and Relevance: This study found that in 2016, dentists in the United States prescribed opioids with significantly greater frequency than their English counterparts. Opioids with a high potential for abuse, such as oxycodone, were frequently prescribed by US dentists but not prescribed in England. These results illustrate how 1 source of opioids differs substantially in the United States vs England. To reduce dental opioid prescribing in the United States, dentists could adopt measures similar to those used in England, including national guidelines for treating dental pain that emphasize prescribing opioids conservatively.

        "An Age-Based Framework for Evaluating Genome-Scale Sequencing Results in Newborn Screening. OBJECTIVE: To assess the performance of a standardized, age-based metric for scoring clinical actionability to evaluate conditions for inclusion in newborn screening and compare it with the results from other contemporary methods. STUDY DESIGN: The North Carolina Newborn Exome Sequencing for Universal Screening study developed an age-based, semiquantitative metric to assess the clinical actionability of gene-disease pairs and classify them with respect to age of onset or timing of interventions. This categorization was compared with the gold standard Recommended Uniform Screening Panel and other methods to evaluate gene-disease pairs for newborn genomic sequencing. RESULTS: We assessed 822 gene-disease pairs, enriched for pediatric onset of disease and suspected actionability. Of these, 466 were classified as having childhood onset and high actionability, analogous to conditions selected for the Recommended Uniform Screening Panel core panel. Another 245 were classified as having childhood onset and low to no actionability, 25 were classified as having adult onset and high actionability, 19 were classified as having adult onset and low to no actionability, and 67 were excluded due to controversial evidence and/or prenatal onset. CONCLUSIONS: This study describes a novel method to facilitate decisions about the potential use of genomic sequencing for newborn screening. These categories may assist parents and physicians in making informed decisions about the disclosure of results from voluntary genomic sequencing in children. ",
        "The viral protein corona directs viral pathogenesis and amyloid aggregation. Artificial nanoparticles accumulate a protein corona layer in biological fluids, which significantly influences their bioactivity. As nanosized obligate intracellular parasites, viruses share many biophysical properties with artificial nanoparticles in extracellular environments and here we show that respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and herpes simplex virus\u00a0type 1 (HSV-1) accumulate a rich and distinctive protein corona in different biological fluids. Moreover, we show that corona pre-coating differentially affects viral infectivity and immune cell activation. In addition, we demonstrate that viruses bind amyloidogenic peptides in their corona and catalyze amyloid formation via surface-assisted heterogeneous nucleation. Importantly, we show that HSV-1 catalyzes the aggregation of the amyloid \u03b2-peptide (A\u03b242), a major constituent of amyloid plaques in Alzheimer's disease, in\u00a0vitro and in animal models. Our results highlight the viral protein corona as an acquired structural layer that is critical for viral-host interactions and illustrate a mechanistic convergence between viral and amyloid pathologies.

        "Increasing species sampling in chelicerate genomic-scale datasets provides support for monophyly of Acari and Arachnida. Chelicerates are a diverse group of arthropods, represented by such forms as predatory spiders and scorpions, parasitic ticks, humic detritivores, and marine sea spiders (pycnogonids) and horseshoe crabs. Conflicting phylogenetic relationships have been proposed for chelicerates based on both morphological and molecular data, the latter usually not recovering arachnids as a clade and instead finding horseshoe crabs nested inside terrestrial Arachnida. Here, using genomic-scale datasets and analyses optimised for countering systematic error, we find strong support for monophyletic Acari (ticks and mites), which when considered as a single group represent the most biodiverse chelicerate lineage. In addition, our analysis recovers marine forms (sea spiders and horseshoe crabs) as the successive sister groups of a monophyletic lineage of terrestrial arachnids, suggesting a single colonisation of land within Chelicerata and the absence of wholly secondarily marine arachnid orders.

        "Whole-genome deep-learning analysis identifies contribution of noncoding mutations to autism risk. We address the challenge of detecting the contribution of noncoding mutations to disease with a deep-learning-based framework that predicts the specific regulatory effects and the deleterious impact of genetic variants. Applying this framework to 1,790 autism spectrum disorder (ASD) simplex families reveals a role in disease for noncoding mutations-ASD probands harbor both transcriptional- and post-transcriptional-regulation-disrupting de novo mutations of significantly higher functional impact than those in unaffected siblings. Further analysis suggests involvement of noncoding mutations in synaptic transmission and neuronal development and, taken together with previous studies, reveals a convergent genetic landscape of coding and noncoding mutations in ASD. We demonstrate that sequences carrying prioritized mutations identified in probands possess allele-specific regulatory activity, and we highlight a link between noncoding mutations and heterogeneity in the IQ of ASD probands. Our predictive genomics framework illuminates the role of noncoding mutations in ASD and prioritizes mutations with high impact for further study, and is broadly applicable to complex human diseases.

        "Atlas of group A streptococcal vaccine candidates compiled using large-scale comparative genomics. Group A Streptococcus (GAS; Streptococcus pyogenes) is a bacterial pathogen for which a commercial vaccine for humans is not available. Employing the advantages of high-throughput DNA sequencing technology to vaccine design, we have analyzed 2,083 globally sampled GAS genomes. The global GAS population structure reveals extensive genomic heterogeneity driven by homologous recombination and overlaid with high levels of accessory gene plasticity. We identified the existence of more than 290 clinically associated genomic phylogroups across 22 countries, highlighting challenges in designing vaccines of global utility. To determine vaccine candidate coverage, we investigated all of the previously described GAS candidate antigens for gene carriage and gene sequence heterogeneity. Only 15 of 28 vaccine antigen candidates were found to have both low naturally occurring sequence variation and high (>99%) coverage across this diverse GAS population. This technological platform for vaccine coverage determination is equally applicable to prospective GAS vaccine antigens identified in future studies. ",
        "Atypical Dorsolateral Prefrontal Activity in Female Adolescents With Conduct Disorder During Effortful Emotion Regulation. BACKGROUND: Conduct disorder (CD), which is characterized by severe aggressive and antisocial behavior, is linked to emotion processing and regulation deficits. However, the neural correlates of emotion regulation are yet to be investigated in adolescents with CD. Furthermore, it remains unclear whether CD is associated with deficits in emotional reactivity, emotion regulation, or both. METHODS: We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to study effortful emotion regulation by cognitive reappraisal in 59 female adolescents 15 to 18 years of age (30 with a CD diagnosis and 29 typically developing (TD) control adolescents). RESULTS: Behaviorally, in-scanner self-report ratings confirmed successful emotion regulation within each group individually but significant group differences in emotional reactivity and reappraisal success when comparing the groups (CD < TD). Functional magnetic resonance imaging results revealed significantly lower activation in left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and angular gyrus in CD compared with TD adolescents during emotion regulation, but no group differences for emotional reactivity. Furthermore, connectivity between left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and the bilateral putamen, right prefrontal cortex, and amygdala was reduced in CD compared with TD adolescents during reappraisal. Callous-unemotional traits were unrelated to neural activation, but these traits correlated negatively with behavioral reports of emotional reactivity. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate reduced prefrontal brain activity and functional connectivity during effortful emotion regulation in female adolescents with CD. This sheds light on the neural basis of the behavioral deficits that have been reported previously. Future studies should investigate whether cognitive interventions are effective in enhancing emotion-regulation abilities and/or normalizing prefrontal and temporoparietal activity in female adolescents with CD.

        "Modeling Cardiovascular Risks of E-Cigarettes With Human-Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell-Derived Endothelial Cells. BACKGROUND: Electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) have experienced a tremendous increase in use. Unlike cigarette smoking, the effects of e-cigarettes and their constituents on mediating vascular health remain understudied. However, given their increasing popularity, it is imperative to evaluate the health risks of e-cigarettes, including the effects of their ingredients, especially nicotine and flavorings. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of flavored e-cigarette liquids (e-liquids) and serum isolated from e-cigarette users on endothelial health and endothelial cell-dependent macrophage activation. METHODS: Human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived endothelial cells (iPSC-ECs) and a high-throughput screening approach were used to assess endothelial integrity following exposure to 6 different e-liquids with varying nicotine concentrations and to serum from e-cigarette users. RESULTS: The cytotoxicity of the e-liquids varied considerably, with the cinnamon-flavored product being most potent and leading to significantly decreased cell viability, increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, caspase 3/7 activity, and low-density lipoprotein uptake, activation of oxidative stress-related pathway, and impaired tube formation and migration, confirming endothelial dysfunction. Upon exposure of ECs to e-liquid, conditioned media induced macrophage polarization into a pro-inflammatory state, eliciting the production of interleukin-1\u03b2 and -6, leading to increased ROS. After exposure of human iPSC-ECs to serum of e-cigarette users, increased ROS linked to endothelial dysfunction was observed, as indicated by impaired pro-angiogenic properties. There was also an observed increase in inflammatory cytokine expression in the serum of e-cigarette users. CONCLUSIONS: Acute exposure to flavored e-liquids or e-cigarette use exacerbates endothelial dysfunction, which\u00a0often precedes cardiovascular diseases. ",
        "Association between fat mass through adolescence and arterial stiffness: a population-based study from The Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children. BACKGROUND: The link between adiposity, metabolic abnormalities, and arterial disease progression in children and adolescents remains poorly defined. We aimed to assess whether persistent high adiposity levels are associated with increased arterial stiffness in adolescence and any mediation effects by common metabolic risk factors. METHODS: We included participants from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) who had detailed adiposity measurements between the ages 9-17 years and arterial stiffness (carotid to femoral pulse wave velocity [PWV]) measured at age 17 years. Body-mass index (BMI) and waist-to-height ratio were calculated from weight, height, and waist circumference measurements whereas fat mass was assessed using repeated dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scans. We used total and trunk fat mass indices (FMIs) to classify participants as normal (<75th percentile) or high (>75th percentile) FMI. We classified participants as being metabolically unhealthy if they had three or more of the following risk factors: high levels of systolic blood pressure, triglycerides, or glucose (all >75th percentile) or low levels of high-density lipoprotein (<25th percentile). We used multivariable linear regression analysis to assess the relationship between PWV and exposure to adiposity, and tested for linear trend of PVW levels across ordinal groups. We used latent class growth mixture modelling analysis to assess the effect of longitudinal changes in adiposity indices through adolescence on arterial stiffness. FINDINGS: We studied 3423 participants (1866 [54\u00b75%] female and 1557 [45\u00b75%] male). Total fat mass was positively associated with PWV at age 17 years (0\u00b7004 m/s per kg, 95% CI 0\u00b7001-0\u00b7006; p=0\u00b70081). Persistently high total FMI and trunk FMI between ages 9 and 17 years were related to greater PWV (0\u00b715 m/s per kg/m2, 0\u00b705-0\u00b724; p=0\u00b70044 and 0\u00b715 m/s per kg/m2, 0\u00b706-0\u00b725; p=0\u00b70021) compared with lower FMI. Metabolic abnormalities amplified the adverse effect of high total FMI on arterial stiffness (PWV 6\u00b70 m/s [95% CI 5\u00b79-6\u00b70] for metabolically healthy participants and 6\u00b72 m/s [5\u00b79-6\u00b74] for metabolically unhealthy participants). Participants who restored normal total FMI in adolescence (PWV 5\u00b78 m/s [5\u00b77-5\u00b79] for metabolically healthy and 5\u00b79 m/s [5\u00b76-6\u00b71] for metabolically unhealthy) had comparable PWV to those who had normal FMI throughout (5\u00b77 m/s [5\u00b77-5\u00b78] for metabolically healthy and 5\u00b79 m/s [5\u00b78-5\u00b79] for metabolically unhealthy). INTERPRETATION: Persistently high fat mass during adolescence was associated with greater arterial stiffness and was further aggravated by an unfavourable metabolic profile. Reverting to normal FMI in adolescence was associated with normal PWV, suggesting adolescence as an important period for interventions to tackle obesity in the young to maximise long-term vascular health.

        "MTHFD1 interaction with BRD4 links folate metabolism to transcriptional regulation. The histone acetyl reader bromodomain-containing protein 4 (BRD4) is an important regulator of chromatin structure and transcription, yet factors modulating its activity have remained elusive. Here we describe two complementary screens for genetic and physical interactors of BRD4, which converge on the folate pathway enzyme MTHFD1 (methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase, cyclohydrolase and formyltetrahydrofolate synthetase 1). We show that a fraction of MTHFD1 resides in the nucleus, where it is recruited to distinct genomic loci by direct interaction with BRD4. Inhibition of either BRD4 or MTHFD1 results in similar changes in nuclear metabolite composition and gene expression; pharmacological inhibitors of the two pathways synergize to impair cancer cell viability in vitro and in vivo. Our finding that MTHFD1 and other metabolic enzymes are chromatin associated suggests a direct role for nuclear metabolism in the control of gene expression. ",
        "Tumor Necrosis Factor-\u03b1-Mediated Metaplastic Inhibition of LTP Is Constitutively Engaged in an Alzheimer's Disease Model. LTP, a fundamental mechanism of learning and memory, is a highly regulated process. One form of regulation is metaplasticity (i.e., the activity-dependent and long-lasting changes in neuronal state that orchestrate the direction, magnitude, and persistence of future synaptic plasticity). We have previously described a heterodendritic metaplasticity effect, whereby strong high-frequency priming stimulation in stratum oriens inhibits subsequent LTP in the stratum radiatum of hippocampal area CA1, potentially by engagement of the enmeshed astrocytic network. This effect may occur due to neuron-glia interactions in response to priming stimulation that leads to the release of gliotransmitters. Here we found in male rats that TNF\u03b1 and associated signal transduction enzymes, but not interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2), were responsible for mediating the metaplasticity effect. Replacing priming stimulation with TNF\u03b1 incubation reproduced these effects. As TNF\u03b1 levels are elevated in Alzheimer's disease, we examined whether heterodendritic metaplasticity is dysregulated in a transgenic mouse model of the disease, either before or after amyloid plaque formation. We showed that TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 levels were significantly increased in aged but not young transgenic mice. Although control LTP was impaired in the young transgenic mice, it was not TNF\u03b1-dependent. In the older transgenic mice, however, LTP was impaired in a way that occluded further reduction by heterosynaptic metaplasticity, whereas LTP was entirely rescued by incubation with a TNF\u03b1 antibody, but not an IL-1\u03b2 antibody. Thus, TNF\u03b1 mediates a heterodendritic metaplasticity in healthy rodents that becomes constitutively and selectively engaged in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT The proinflammatory cytokine TNF\u03b1 is known to be capable of inhibiting LTP and is upregulated several-fold in brain tissue, serum, and CSF of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. However, the mechanistic roles played by TNF\u03b1 in plasticity and AD remain poorly understood. Here we show that TNF\u03b1 and its downstream signaling molecules p38 MAPK, ERK, and JNK contribute fundamentally to a long-range metaplastic inhibition of LTP in rats. Moreover, the impaired LTP in aged APP/PS1 mice is rescued by incubation with a TNF\u03b1 antibody. Thus, there is an endogenous engagement of the metaplasticity mechanism in this mouse model of AD, supporting the idea that blocking TNF\u03b1 might be of therapeutic benefit in the disease. ",
        "Adverse organogenesis and predisposed long-term metabolic syndrome from prenatal exposure to fine particulate matter. Exposure to fine particulate matter (PM) during pregnancy is associated with high risks of birth defects/fatality and adverse long-term postnatal health. However, limited mechanistic data are available to assess the detailed impacts of prenatal PM exposure. Here we evaluate fine PM exposure during pregnancy on prenatal/postnatal organogenesis in offspring and in predisposing metabolic syndrome for adult life. Between days 0 and 18 of gestation, two groups of adult female rats (n = 10 for each) were placed in a dual-exposure chamber device, one with clean ambient air (\u223c3 \u00b5g\u00b7m-3) and the other with ambient air in the presence of 100 to 200 \u00b5g\u00b7m-3 of ultrafine aerosols of ammonium sulfate. At birth (postnatal day 0, PND0), four males and four females were selected randomly from each litter to be nursed by dams, whereas tissues were collected from the remaining pups. At PND21, tissues were collected from two males and two females, whereas the remaining pups were fed either a high- or low-fat diet until PND105, when tissues were obtained for biochemical and physiological analyses. Maternal exposure to fine PM increased stillbirths; reduced gestation length and birth weight; increased concentrations of glucose and free fatty acids in plasma; enhanced lipid accumulation in the liver; and decreased endothelium-dependent relaxation of aorta. This lead to altered organogenesis and predisposed progeny to long-term metabolic defects in an age-, organ-, and sex-specific manner. Our results highlight the necessity to develop therapeutic strategies to remedy adverse health effects of maternal PM exposure on conceptus/postnatal growth and development. ",

        "Cardiomyopathy in Children: Classification and Diagnosis: A Scientific Statement From the American Heart Association. In this scientific statement from the American Heart Association, experts in the field of cardiomyopathy (heart muscle disease) in children address 2 issues: the most current understanding of the causes of cardiomyopathy in children and the optimal approaches to diagnosis cardiomyopathy in children. Cardiomyopathies result in some of the worst pediatric cardiology outcomes; nearly 40% of children who present with symptomatic cardiomyopathy undergo a heart transplantation or die within the first 2 years after diagnosis. The percentage of children with cardiomyopathy who underwent a heart transplantation has not declined over the past 10 years, and cardiomyopathy remains the leading cause of transplantation for children >1 year of age. Studies from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute-funded Pediatric Cardiomyopathy Registry have shown that causes are established in very few children with cardiomyopathy, yet genetic causes are likely to be present in most. The incidence of pediatric cardiomyopathy is \u22481 per 100\u2009000 children. This is comparable to the incidence of such childhood cancers as lymphoma, Wilms tumor, and neuroblastoma. However, the published research and scientific conferences focused on pediatric cardiomyopathy are sparcer than for those cancers. The aim of the statement is to focus on the diagnosis and classification of cardiomyopathy. We anticipate that this report will help shape the future research priorities in this set of diseases to achieve earlier diagnosis, improved clinical outcomes, and better quality of life for these children and their families.

        "FANCM limits ALT activity by restricting telomeric replication stress induced by deregulated BLM and R-loops. Telomerase negative immortal cancer cells elongate telomeres through the Alternative Lengthening of Telomeres (ALT) pathway. While sustained telomeric replicative stress is required to maintain ALT, it might also lead to cell death when excessive. Here, we show that the ATPase/translocase activity of FANCM keeps telomeric replicative stress in check specifically in ALT cells. When FANCM is depleted in ALT cells, telomeres become dysfunctional, and cells stop proliferating and die. FANCM depletion also increases ALT-associated marks and de novo synthesis of telomeric DNA. Depletion of the BLM helicase reduces the telomeric replication stress and cell proliferation defects induced by FANCM inactivation. Finally, FANCM unwinds telomeric R-loops in vitro and suppresses their accumulation in cells. Overexpression of RNaseH1 completely abolishes the replication stress remaining in cells codepleted for FANCM and BLM. Thus, FANCM allows controlled ALT activity and ALT cell proliferation by limiting the toxicity of uncontrolled BLM and telomeric R-loops. ",
        "Revisiting the taxonomy and evolution of pathogenicity of the genus Leptospira through the prism of genomics. The causative agents of leptospirosis are responsible for an emerging zoonotic disease worldwide. One of the major routes of transmission for leptospirosis is the natural environment contaminated with the urine of a wide range of reservoir animals. Soils and surface waters also host a high diversity of non-pathogenic Leptospira and species for which the virulence status is not clearly established. The genus Leptospira is currently divided into 35 species classified into three phylogenetic clusters, which supposedly correlate with the virulence of the bacteria. In this study, a total of 90 Leptospira strains isolated from different environments worldwide including Japan, Malaysia, New Caledonia, Algeria, mainland France, and the island of Mayotte in the Indian Ocean were sequenced. A comparison of average nucleotide identity (ANI) values of genomes of the 90 isolates and representative genomes of known species revealed 30 new Leptospira species. These data also supported the existence of two clades and 4 subclades. To avoid classification that strongly implies assumption on the virulence status of the lineages, we called them P1, P2, S1, S2. One of these subclades has not yet been described and is composed of Leptospira idonii and 4 novel species that are phylogenetically related to the saprophytes. We then investigated genome diversity and evolutionary relationships among members of the genus Leptospira by studying the pangenome and core gene sets. Our data enable the identification of genome features, genes and domains that are important for each subclade, thereby laying the foundation for refining the classification of this complex bacterial genus. We also shed light on atypical genomic features of a group of species that includes the species often associated with human infection, suggesting a specific and ongoing evolution of this group of species that will require more attention. In conclusion, we have uncovered a massive species diversity and revealed a novel subclade in environmental samples collected worldwide and we have redefined the classification of species in the genus. The implication of several new potentially infectious Leptospira species for human and animal health remains to be determined but our data also provide new insights into the emergence of virulence in the pathogenic species.

        "Targeted homology-directed repair in blood stem and progenitor cells with CRISPR nanoformulations. Ex vivo CRISPR gene editing in haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells has opened potential treatment modalities for numerous diseases. The current process uses electroporation, sometimes followed by virus transduction. While this complex manipulation has resulted in high levels of gene editing at some genetic loci, cellular toxicity was observed. We have developed a CRISPR nanoformulation based on colloidal gold nanoparticles with a unique loading design capable of cellular entry without the need for electroporation or viruses. This highly monodispersed nanoformulation avoids lysosomal entrapment and localizes to the nucleus in primary human blood progenitors without toxicity. Nanoformulation-mediated gene editing is efficient and sustained with different CRISPR nucleases at multiple loci of therapeutic interest. The engraftment kinetics of nanoformulation-treated primary cells in humanized mice are better relative to those of non-treated cells, with no differences in differentiation. Here we demonstrate non-toxic delivery of the entire CRISPR payload into primary human blood progenitors. ",

        "Inability to act was associated with an extended delay prior to care-seeking, in patients with an acute myocardial infarction. BACKGROUND: The out-of-hospital mortality in patients with acute myocardial infarction remains unchanged in contrast to a decrease in inhospital mortality. Interventions aiming to shorten patient delay have been largely unsuccessful. A deeper understanding is apparently needed on patients' appraisal prior to care-seeking. AIM: To investigate whether appraisal processes influence patient delay, and if the questionnaire 'Patients' appraisal, emotions and action tendencies preceding care seeking in acute myocardial infarction' (PA-AMI) could discriminate between patients with prolonged care-seeking and those with a short delay. METHODS: A cross-sectional study including 326 acute myocardial infarction patients filling out the validated questionnaire PA-AMI. The impact of subscales on delay was analysed by projection to latent structures regression. Discrimination opportunities between patients with short and long delays were analysed by projection to latent structures discriminant analysis. RESULTS: The subscales 'perceived inability to act' and 'symptom appraisal' had a major impact on patient delay (P<0.0001). 'Perceived inability to act' had its main influence in patients with a delay exceeding 12 hours, and 'symptom appraisal' had its main influence in patients with a delay shorter than one hour. CONCLUSION: Appraisal processes influence patient delay. Acute myocardial infarction patients with a prolonged delay were, besides a low perceived symptom severity and urgency to seek medical care, characterised by a perceived loss of control and ability to act. Therefore, future interventions aimed at decreasing delay should pay attention to appraisal processes, and perceived inability to act may be a sign of a health threat and therefore a signal to seek medical care.

        "SORLA regulates endosomal trafficking and oncogenic fitness of HER2. The human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) is an oncogene targeted by several kinase inhibitors and therapeutic antibodies. While the endosomal trafficking of many other receptor tyrosine kinases is known to regulate their oncogenic signalling, the prevailing view on HER2 is that this receptor is predominantly retained on the cell surface. Here, we find that sortilin-related receptor 1 (SORLA; SORL1) co-precipitates with HER2 in cancer cells and regulates HER2 subcellular distribution by promoting recycling of the endosomal receptor back to the plasma membrane. SORLA protein levels in cancer cell lines and bladder cancers correlates with HER2 levels. Depletion of SORLA triggers HER2 targeting to late endosomal/lysosomal compartments and impairs HER2-driven signalling and in vivo tumour growth. SORLA silencing also disrupts normal lysosome function and sensitizes anti-HER2 therapy sensitive and resistant cancer cells to lysosome-targeting cationic amphiphilic drugs. These findings reveal potentially important SORLA-dependent endosomal trafficking-linked vulnerabilities in HER2-driven cancers. ",
        "Metabolites of lactic acid bacteria present in fermented foods are highly potent agonists of human hydroxycarboxylic acid receptor 3. The interplay of microbiota and the human host is physiologically crucial in health and diseases. The beneficial effects of lactic acid bacteria (LAB), permanently colonizing the human intestine or transiently obtained from food, have been extensively reported. However, the molecular understanding of how LAB modulate human physiology is still limited. G protein-coupled receptors for hydroxycarboxylic acids (HCAR) are regulators of immune functions and energy homeostasis under changing metabolic and dietary conditions. Most mammals have two HCAR (HCA1, HCA2) but humans and other hominids contain a third member (HCA3) in their genomes. A plausible hypothesis why HCA3 function was advantageous in hominid evolution was lacking. Here, we used a combination of evolutionary, analytical and functional methods to unravel the role of HCA3 in vitro and in vivo. The functional studies included different pharmacological assays, analyses of human monocytes and pharmacokinetic measurements in human. We report the discovery of the interaction of D-phenyllactic acid (D-PLA) and the human host through highly potent activation of HCA3. D-PLA is an anti-bacterial metabolite found in high concentrations in LAB-fermented food such as Sauerkraut. We demonstrate that D-PLA from such alimentary sources is well absorbed from the human gut leading to high plasma and urine levels and triggers pertussis toxin-sensitive migration of primary human monocytes in an HCA3-dependent manner. We provide evolutionary, analytical and functional evidence supporting the hypothesis that HCA3 was consolidated in hominids as a new signaling system for LAB-derived metabolites. ",
        "PTPN2 regulates the generation of exhausted CD8+ T cell subpopulations and restrains tumor immunity. CD8+ T cell exhaustion is a state of dysfunction acquired in chronic viral infection and cancer, characterized by the formation of Slamf6+ progenitor exhausted and Tim-3+ terminally exhausted subpopulations through unknown mechanisms. Here we establish the phosphatase PTPN2 as a new regulator of the differentiation of the terminally exhausted subpopulation that functions by attenuating type 1 interferon signaling. Deletion of Ptpn2 in CD8+ T cells increased the generation, proliferative capacity and cytotoxicity of Tim-3+ cells without altering Slamf6+ numbers during lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus clone 13 infection. Likewise, Ptpn2 deletion in CD8+ T cells enhanced Tim-3+ anti-tumor responses and improved tumor control. Deletion of Ptpn2 throughout the immune system resulted in MC38 tumor clearance and improved programmed cell death-1 checkpoint blockade responses to B16 tumors. Our results indicate that increasing the number of cytotoxic Tim-3+CD8+ T cells can promote effective anti-tumor immunity and implicate PTPN2 in immune cells as an attractive cancer immunotherapy target.

        "Synthetic, non-intoxicating 8,9-dihydrocannabidiol for the mitigation of seizures. There can be a fine line between therapeutic intervention and substance abuse, and this point is clearly exemplified in herbal cannabis and its products. Therapies involving cannabis have been the treatment of last resort for some cases of refractory epilepsy, and this has been among the strongest medical justifications for legalization of marijuana. In order to circumvent the narcotic effects of \u03949-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), many studies have concentrated on its less intoxicating isomer cannabidiol (CBD). However, CBD, like all natural cannabinoids, is a controlled substance in most countries, and its conversion into THC can be easily performed using common chemicals. We describe here the anticonvulsant properties of 8,9-dihydrocannibidiol (H2CBD), a fully synthetic analogue of CBD that is prepared from inexpensive, non-cannabis derived precursors. H2CBD was found to have effectiveness comparable to CBD both for decreasing the number and reducing the severity of pentylenetetrazole-induced seizures in rats. Finally, H2CBD cannot be converted by any reasonable synthetic route into THC, and thus has the potential to act as a safe, noncontroversial drug for seizure mitigation. ",
        "Usefulness of Predischarge Cardiac Testing in Low Risk Women and Men for Safe, Rapid Discharge from a Chest Pain Unit. Predischarge cardiac testing (PDT) in low-risk patients evaluated for acute coronary syndrome in a chest pain unit (CPU) remains a challenge. It is unclear whether PDT varies by gender. We analyzed consecutive low-risk women and men evaluated in our CPU over a 2-year period and compared the utilization of PDT (exercise treadmill test, myocardial stress perfusion scintigraphy, exercise stress echocardiography, invasive coronary angiography, or no test), and incidence of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) at 30 days and 6 months. The study group comprised 619 patients (54% women). A large proportion of both genders did not undergo PDT, although this finding was more frequent in women (50% women vs 40% men, p\u202f=\u202f0.01). At 30 days, there were no MACE in either gender. After 6 months of follow-up, MACE remained very low in both women and men (2 [1%] vs 2 [1%]), and in patients who did and did not receive PDT (2 [1%] vs 2 [1%]). Mean length of stay in the CPU was 5.4 hours in patients without PDT and 9.8 hours in those with PDT (p <0.0001) without altering postdischarge MACE. When referred for PDT, women more often underwent myocardial stress perfusion scintigraphy than men (22% vs 14%, p\u202f=\u202f0.005) and less often received exercise treadmill test (20% vs 39%, p <0.0001). Yield of abnormal PDT was low in both women and men although it was lower in women (1% vs 5%, p\u202f=\u202f0.02). In conclusion, many low-risk women and men evaluated in a CPU for acute coronary syndrome can be safely and rapidly discharged without PDT and with low risk for MACE at 30 days and at 6 months. Exclusion of PDT was associated with significantly reduced length of stay while maintaining safety in terms of postdischarge MACE. ",
        "Adverse organogenesis and predisposed long-term metabolic syndrome from prenatal exposure to fine particulate matter. Exposure to fine particulate matter (PM) during pregnancy is associated with high risks of birth defects/fatality and adverse long-term postnatal health. However, limited mechanistic data are available to assess the detailed impacts of prenatal PM exposure. Here we evaluate fine PM exposure during pregnancy on prenatal/postnatal organogenesis in offspring and in predisposing metabolic syndrome for adult life. Between days 0 and 18 of gestation, two groups of adult female rats (n = 10 for each) were placed in a dual-exposure chamber device, one with clean ambient air (\u223c3 \u00b5g\u00b7m-3) and the other with ambient air in the presence of 100 to 200 \u00b5g\u00b7m-3 of ultrafine aerosols of ammonium sulfate. At birth (postnatal day 0, PND0), four males and four females were selected randomly from each litter to be nursed by dams, whereas tissues were collected from the remaining pups. At PND21, tissues were collected from two males and two females, whereas the remaining pups were fed either a high- or low-fat diet until PND105, when tissues were obtained for biochemical and physiological analyses. Maternal exposure to fine PM increased stillbirths; reduced gestation length and birth weight; increased concentrations of glucose and free fatty acids in plasma; enhanced lipid accumulation in the liver; and decreased endothelium-dependent relaxation of aorta. This lead to altered organogenesis and predisposed progeny to long-term metabolic defects in an age-, organ-, and sex-specific manner. Our results highlight the necessity to develop therapeutic strategies to remedy adverse health effects of maternal PM exposure on conceptus/postnatal growth and development. ",
        "Prosit: proteome-wide prediction of peptide tandem mass spectra by deep learning. In mass-spectrometry-based proteomics, the identification and quantification of peptides and proteins heavily rely on sequence database searching or spectral library matching. The lack of accurate predictive models for fragment ion intensities impairs the realization of the full potential of these approaches. Here, we extended the ProteomeTools synthetic peptide library to 550,000 tryptic peptides and 21\u2009million high-quality tandem mass spectra. We trained a deep neural network, termed Prosit, resulting in chromatographic retention time and fragment ion intensity predictions that exceed the quality of the experimental data. Integrating Prosit into database search pipelines led to more identifications at >10\u00d7 lower false discovery rates. We show the general applicability of Prosit by predicting spectra for proteases other than trypsin, generating spectral libraries for data-independent acquisition and improving the analysis of metaproteomes. Prosit is integrated into ProteomicsDB, allowing search result re-scoring and custom spectral library generation for any organism on the basis of peptide sequence alone. ",
        "Diagnosing growth in low-grade gliomas with and without longitudinal volume measurements: A retrospective observational study. BACKGROUND: Low-grade gliomas cause significant neurological morbidity by brain invasion. There is no universally accepted objective technique available for detection of enlargement of low-grade gliomas in the clinical setting; subjective evaluation by clinicians using visual comparison of longitudinal radiological studies is the gold standard. The aim of this study is to determine whether a computer-assisted diagnosis (CAD) method helps physicians detect earlier growth of low-grade gliomas. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We reviewed 165 patients diagnosed with grade 2 gliomas, seen at the University of Alabama at Birmingham clinics from 1 July 2017 to 14 May 2018. MRI scans were collected during the spring and summer of 2018. Fifty-six gliomas met the inclusion criteria, including 19 oligodendrogliomas, 26 astrocytomas, and 11 mixed gliomas in 30 males and 26 females with a mean age of 48 years and a range of follow-up of 150.2 months (difference between highest and lowest values). None received radiation therapy. We also studied 7 patients with an imaging abnormality without pathological diagnosis, who were clinically stable at the time of retrospective review (14 May 2018). This study compared growth detection by 7 physicians aided by the CAD method with retrospective clinical reports. The tumors of 63 patients (56 + 7) in 627 MRI scans were digitized, including 34 grade 2 gliomas with radiological progression and 22 radiologically stable grade 2 gliomas. The CAD method consisted of tumor segmentation, computing volumes, and pointing to growth by the online abrupt change-of-point method, which considers only past measurements. Independent scientists have evaluated the segmentation method. In 29 of the 34 patients with progression, the median time to growth detection was only 14 months for CAD compared to 44 months for current standard of care radiological evaluation (p < 0.001). Using CAD, accurate detection of tumor enlargement was possible with a median of only 57% change in the tumor volume as compared to a median of 174% change of volume necessary to diagnose tumor growth using standard of care clinical methods (p < 0.001). In the radiologically stable group, CAD facilitated growth detection in 13 out of 22 patients. CAD did not detect growth in the imaging abnormality group. The main limitation of this study was its retrospective design; nevertheless, the results depict the current state of a gold standard in clinical practice that allowed a significant increase in tumor volumes from baseline before detection. Such large increases in tumor volume would not be permitted in a prospective design. The number of glioma patients (n = 56) is a limitation; however, it is equivalent to the number of patients in phase II clinical trials. CONCLUSIONS: The current practice of visual comparison of longitudinal MRI scans is associated with significant delays in detecting growth of low-grade gliomas. Our findings support the idea that physicians aided by CAD detect growth at significantly smaller volumes than physicians using visual comparison alone. This study does not answer the questions whether to treat or not and which treatment modality is optimal. Nonetheless, early growth detection sets the stage for future clinical studies that address these questions and whether early therapeutic interventions prolong survival and improve quality of life.

        "Remdesivir (GS-5734) protects African green monkeys from Nipah virus challenge. Nipah virus is an emerging pathogen in the Paramyxoviridae family. Upon transmission of Nipah virus from its natural reservoir, Pteropus spp. fruit bats, to humans, it causes respiratory and neurological disease with a case-fatality rate about 70%. Human-to-human transmission has been observed during Nipah virus outbreaks in Bangladesh and India. A therapeutic treatment for Nipah virus disease is urgently needed. Here, we tested the efficacy of remdesivir (GS-5734), a broad-acting antiviral nucleotide prodrug, against Nipah virus Bangladesh genotype in African green monkeys. Animals were inoculated with a lethal dose of Nipah virus, and a once-daily intravenous remdesivir treatment was initiated 24 hours later and continued for 12 days. Mild respiratory signs were observed in two of four treated animals, whereas all control animals developed severe respiratory disease signs. In contrast to control animals, which all succumbed to the infection, all remsdesivir-treated animals survived the lethal challenge, indicating that remdesivir represents a promising antiviral treatment for Nipah virus infection.

        "Relationship between vitamin D status and the vaginal microbiome during pregnancy. OBJECTIVE: Evidence supports an inverse association between vitamin D and bacterial vaginosis (BV) during pregnancy. Furthermore, both the vaginal microbiome and vitamin D status correlate with pregnancy outcome. Women of African ancestry are more likely to experience BV, to be vitamin D deficient, and to have certain pregnancy complications. We investigated the association between vitamin D status and the vaginal microbiome. STUDY DESIGN: Subjects were assigned to a treatment (4400\u2009IU) or a control group (400\u2009IU vitamin D daily), sampled three times during pregnancy, and vaginal 16S rRNA gene taxonomic\u00a0profiles and plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] concentrations were examined. RESULT: Gestational age and ethnicity were significantly associated with the microbiome. Megasphaera correlated negatively (p\u2009=\u20090.0187) with 25(OH)D among women of African ancestry. Among controls, women of European ancestry exhibited a positive correlation between plasma 25(OH)D and L. crispatus abundance. CONCLUSION: Certain vaginal bacteria are associated with plasma 25(OH)D concentration. ",
        "A microfluidic assay for the quantification of the metastatic propensity of breast cancer specimens. The challenge of predicting which patients with breast cancer will develop metastases leads to the overtreatment of patients with benign disease and to the inadequate treatment of aggressive cancers. Here, we report the development and testing of a microfluidic assay that quantifies the abundance and proliferative index of migratory cells in breast cancer specimens, for the assessment of their metastatic propensity and for the rapid screening of potential antimetastatic therapeutics. On the basis of the key roles of cell motility and proliferation in cancer metastasis, the device accurately predicts the metastatic potential of breast cancer cell lines and of patient-derived xenografts. Compared with unsorted cancer cells, highly motile cells isolated by the device exhibited similar tumourigenic potential but markedly increased metastatic propensity in vivo. RNA sequencing of the highly motile cells revealed an enrichment of motility-related and survival-related genes. The approach might be developed into a companion assay for the prediction of metastasis in patients and for the selection of effective therapeutic regimens. ",
        "Development of human cGAS-specific small-molecule inhibitors for repression of dsDNA-triggered interferon expression. Cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) is the primary sensor for aberrant intracellular dsDNA producing the cyclic dinucleotide cGAMP, a second messenger initiating cytokine production in subsets of myeloid lineage cell types. Therefore, inhibition of the enzyme cGAS may act anti-inflammatory. Here we report the discovery of human-cGAS-specific small-molecule inhibitors by high-throughput screening and the targeted medicinal chemistry optimization for two molecular scaffolds. Lead compounds from one scaffold co-crystallize with human cGAS and occupy the ATP- and GTP-binding active site. The specificity and potency of these drug candidates is further documented in human myeloid cells including primary macrophages. These novel cGAS inhibitors with cell-based activity will serve as probes into cGAS-dependent innate immune pathways and warrant future pharmacological studies for treatment of cGAS-dependent inflammatory diseases.

        "Pharmacodynamic study of radium-223 in men with bone metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer. BACKGROUND: Radium-223 is a targeted alpha-particle therapy that improves survival in men with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), particularly in men with elevated serum levels of bone alkaline phosphatase (B-ALP). We hypothesized that osteomimicry, a form of epithelial plasticity leading to an osteoblastic phenotype, may contribute to intralesional deposition of radium-223 and subsequent irradiation of the tumor microenvironment. METHODS: We conducted a pharmacodynamic study (NCT02204943) of radium-223 in men with bone mCRPC. Prior to and three and six months after radium-223 treatment initiation, we collected CTCs and metastatic biopsies for phenotypic characterization and CTC genomic analysis. The primary objective was to describe the impact of radium-223 on the prevalence of CTC B-ALP over time. We measured radium-223 decay products in tumor and surrounding normal bone during treatment. We validated genomic findings in a separate independent study of men with bone metastatic mCRPC (n = 45) and publicly accessible data of metastatic CRPC tissues. RESULTS: We enrolled 20 men with symptomatic bone predominant mCRPC and treated with radium-223. We observed greater radium-223 radioactivity levels in metastatic bone tumor containing biopsies compared with adjacent normal bone. We found evidence of persistent Cellsearch CTCs and B-ALP (+) CTCs in the majority of men over time during radium-223 therapy despite serum B-ALP normalization. We identified genomic gains in osteoblast mimicry genes including gains of ALPL, osteopontin, SPARC, OB-cadherin and loss of RUNX2, and validated genomic alterations or increased expression at the DNA and RNA level in an independent cohort of 45 men with bone-metastatic CRPC and in 150 metastatic biopsies from men with mCRPC. CONCLUSIONS: Osteomimicry may contribute in part to the uptake of radium-223 within bone metastases and may thereby enhance the therapeutic benefit of this bone targeting radiotherapy. ",
        "Electrical Stimulation of the Greater Auricular Nerve to Reduce Postoperative Atrial Fibrillation. BACKGROUND: Postoperative atrial fibrillation (POAF) occurs in up to 40% of patients undergoing cardiac surgery. Invasive stimulation of the vagal nerve previously demonstrated a reduced risk of POAF. Therefore, we examined the antiarrhythmic and anti-inflammatory effects of noninvasive low-level transcutaneous electrical stimulation (LLTS) of the greater auricular nerve in a pilot trial including patients undergoing cardiac surgery. METHODS: Patients were randomized into a sham (n=20) or a treatment group (n=20) for LLTS. After cardiac surgery, electrodes were applied in the triangular fossa of the ear. Stimulation (amplitude 1 mA, frequency 1 Hz for 40 minutes, followed by a 20 minutes break) was performed for up to 2 weeks after cardiac surgery. Heart rhythm was recorded continuously using an ECG during the observation period. CRP (C-reactive protein) and IL (interleukin)-6 plasma concentrations were measured immediately after surgery as well as on day 2 and 7 postsurgery. RESULTS: Patients receiving LLTS had a significantly reduced occurrence of POAF (4 of 20) when compared with controls (11 of 20, P=0.022) during a similar mean Holter recording period. The median duration of POAF was comparable between the treatment and the control group (878 [249; 1660] minutes versus 489 [148; 1775] minutes; P=0.661). No effect of LLTS on CRP or IL-6 levels was detectable. CONCLUSIONS: LLTS of the greater auricular nerve may be a potential therapy for POAF. We demonstrated the feasibility to conduct a randomized trial of neurostimulation as an outlay for a multisite clinical trial. ",
        "Standardisation of flow cytometry for whole blood immunophenotyping of islet transplant and transplant clinical trial recipients. Understanding the immunological phenotype of transplant recipients is important to improve outcomes and develop new therapies. Immunophenotyping of whole peripheral blood (WPB) by flow cytometry is a rapid method to obtain large amounts of data relating to the outcomes of different transplant treatments with limited patient impact. Healthy individuals and patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D) enrolled in islet transplantation were recruited and WPB was collected. 46 fluorochrome-conjugated mouse-anti-human antibodies were used (43 of 46 antibodies were titrated). BD cytometer setup and tracking beads were used to characterize and adjust for cytometer performance. Antibody cocktails were pre-mixed <60 minutes before staining. Multicolour panels were designed based on fluorochrome brightness, antigen density, co-expression, and fluorochrome spillover into non-primary detectors in each panel on a 5 laser flow cytometer. WPB sample staining used 50-300 \u03bcl WPB for each panel and was performed within 2 hours of blood sample collection. Samples were acquired on a BD-LSRFortessa. The operating procedures, including specimen collection, antibody cocktails, staining protocol, flow-cytometer setup and data analysis, were standardized. The staining index of 43 antibodies and the spillover spreading matrix for each panel was calculated. The final concentrations for the 46 antibodies used was determined for staining of WPB samples. Absolute cell-count and 7 leukocyte profiling panels consisting of subsets and/or status of granulocytes, monocytes, dendritic, B, NK, and T cells including regulatory T cells (Tregs) and NKT were designed and established on a 5 laser BD-LSR Fortessa. 13 T1D patients, including 4 islet transplant recipients and 8 healthy controls, were evaluated. The ability to reproducibly measure immune subsets and immune-profiles of islet transplant patients up to 18 months post transplantation has been established as a tool to measure immune cell reconstitution after transplantation.

        "Decomposing Cell Identity for Transfer Learning across Cellular Measurements, Platforms, Tissues, and Species. Analysis of gene expression in single cells allows for decomposition of cellular states as low-dimensional latent spaces. However, the interpretation and validation of these spaces remains a challenge. Here, we present scCoGAPS, which defines latent spaces from a source single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) dataset, and projectR, which evaluates these latent spaces in independent target datasets via transfer learning. Application of developing mouse retina to scRNA-Seq reveals intrinsic relationships across biological contexts and assays while avoiding batch effects and other technical features. We compare the dimensions learned in this source dataset to adult mouse retina, a time-course of human retinal development, select scRNA-seq datasets from developing brain, chromatin accessibility data, and a murine-cell type atlas to identify shared biological features. These tools lay the groundwork for exploratory analysis of scRNA-seq data via latent space representations, enabling a shift in how we compare and identify cells beyond reliance on marker genes or ensemble molecular identity.

        "Identification and characterization of a novel anti-inflammatory lipid isolated from Mycobacterium vaccae, a soil-derived bacterium with immunoregulatory and stress resilience properties. RATIONALE: Mycobacterium vaccae (NCTC 11659) is an environmental saprophytic bacterium with anti-inflammatory, immunoregulatory, and stress resilience properties. Previous studies have shown that whole, heat-killed preparations of M. vaccae prevent allergic airway inflammation in a murine model of allergic asthma. Recent studies also demonstrate that immunization with M. vaccae prevents stress-induced exaggeration of proinflammatory cytokine secretion from mesenteric lymph node cells stimulated ex vivo, prevents stress-induced exaggeration of chemically induced colitis in a model of inflammatory bowel disease, and prevents stress-induced anxiety-like defensive behavioral responses. Furthermore, immunization with M. vaccae induces anti-inflammatory responses in the brain and prevents stress-induced exaggeration of microglial priming. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying anti-inflammatory effects of M. vaccae are not known. OBJECTIVES: Our objective was to identify and characterize novel anti-inflammatory molecules from M. vaccae NCTC 11659. METHODS: We have purified and identified a unique anti-inflammatory triglyceride, 1,2,3-tri [Z-10-hexadecenoyl] glycerol, from M. vaccae and evaluated its effects in freshly isolated murine peritoneal macrophages. RESULTS: The free fatty acid form of 1,2,3-tri [Z-10-hexadecenoyl] glycerol, 10(Z)-hexadecenoic acid, decreased lipopolysaccharide-stimulated secretion of the proinflammatory cytokine IL-6 ex vivo. Meanwhile, next-generation RNA sequencing revealed that pretreatment with 10(Z)-hexadecenoic acid upregulated genes associated with peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPAR\u03b1) signaling in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated macrophages, in association with a broad transcriptional repression of inflammatory markers. We confirmed using luciferase-based transfection assays that 10(Z)-hexadecenoic acid activated PPAR\u03b1 signaling, but not PPAR\u03b3, PPAR\u03b4, or retinoic acid receptor (RAR) \u03b1 signaling. The effects of 10(Z)-hexadecenoic acid on lipopolysaccharide-stimulated secretion of IL-6 were prevented by PPAR\u03b1 antagonists and absent in PPAR\u03b1-deficient mice. CONCLUSION: Future studies should evaluate the effects of 10(Z)-hexadecenoic acid on stress-induced exaggeration of peripheral inflammatory signaling, central neuroinflammatory signaling, and anxiety- and fear-related defensive behavioral responses.

        "Association of Early-Onset Alzheimer Disease With Elevated Low-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol Levels and Rare Genetic Coding Variants of APOB. Importance: Early-onset Alzheimer disease (EOAD) is a rare form of Alzheimer disease (AD) with a large genetic basis that is only partially understood. In late-onset AD, elevated circulating cholesterol levels increase AD risk even after adjusting for the apolipoprotein E \u03b54 (APOE E4) allele, a major genetic factor for AD and elevated cholesterol levels; however, the role of circulating cholesterol levels in EOAD is unclear. Objectives: To investigate the association between circulating cholesterol levels and EOAD and to identify genetic variants underlying this possible association. Design, Setting, and Participants: In this case series, plasma cholesterol levels were directly measured in 267 samples from the AD research centers (ADRCs) of Emory University and University of California, San Francisco, collected from January 21, 2009, through August 21, 2014. The association between cholesterol and EOAD was examined using multiple linear regression. To determine the underlying genetic variants, APOB, APP, PSEN1, and PSEN2 were sequenced in samples from 2125 EOAD cases and controls recruited from 29 ADRCs from January 1, 1984, through December 31, 2015. Data were analyzed from November 23, 2016, through April 10, 2018. Exposures: Clinical diagnosis, age at clinical diagnosis, plasma cholesterol measures (total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol [LDL-C], high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, and apolipoprotein B), and genetic variants in APOE, APP, PSEN1, PSEN2, and APOB. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was the association between EOAD and plasma cholesterol measures. The secondary outcome was the association between EOAD and the burden of genetic variants in APOB. Results: Of the 2125 samples that underwent genetic sequencing, 1276 were from women (60.0%) and 654 (30.8%) were from patients with EOAD (mean [SD] ages, 55.6 [4.3] years for cases and 72.0 [9.6] years for controls). APOE E4 explained 10.1% of the variance of EOAD. After controlling for APOE E4, EOAD cases had higher levels of total cholesterol (mean difference [SE], 21.9 [5.2] mg/dL; P\u2009=\u20092.9\u2009\u00d7\u200910-5), LDL-C (mean difference [SE], 22.0 [4.5] mg/dL; P\u2009=\u20091.8\u2009\u00d7\u200910-6), and ApoB (mean difference [SE], 12.0 [2.4] mg/dL; P\u2009=\u20092.0\u2009\u00d7\u200910-6) than controls in 267 frozen samples. Approximately 3% of EOAD cases carried known AD-causing mutations. Gene-based rare variant burden testing in 2066 samples showed that rare APOB coding variants were significantly more abundant in EOAD cases after adjusting for sex, APOE E4, genetic principal components, ADRC center, and batch (effect size, 0.20; P\u2009=\u20094.20\u2009\u00d7\u200910-4). Conclusions and Relevance: Elevated LDL-C levels were associated with higher probability of having EOAD, and EOAD cases were enriched for rare coding variants in APOB, which codes for the major protein of LDL-C. Collectively, these novel findings highlight the important role of LDL-C in EOAD pathogenesis and suggest a direct link of APOB variants to AD risk. ",
        "Growth dynamics in naturally progressing chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. How the genomic features of a patient's cancer relate to individual disease kinetics remains poorly understood. Here we used the indolent growth dynamics of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) to analyse the growth rates and corresponding\u00a0genomic patterns of leukaemia cells from 107 patients with CLL, spanning decades-long disease courses. We found that CLL commonly demonstrates not only exponential expansion but also logistic growth, which is sigmoidal and reaches a certain steady-state level. Each growth pattern was associated with marked differences in genetic composition, the pace of disease progression and the extent of clonal evolution. In a subset of patients, whose serial samples underwent next-generation sequencing, we found that dynamic changes in the disease course of CLL were shaped by the genetic events that were already present in the early slow-growing stages. Finally, by analysing the growth rates of subclones compared with their parental clones, we quantified the growth advantage conferred by putative CLL drivers in vivo. ",
        "Ectonucleotidase tri(di)phosphohydrolase-1 (ENTPD-1) disrupts inflammasome/interleukin 1\u03b2-driven venous thrombosis. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT), caused by alterations in venous homeostasis is the third most common cause of cardiovascular mortality; however, key molecular determinants in venous thrombosis have not been fully elucidated. Several lines of evidence indicate that DVT occurs at the intersection of dysregulated inflammation and coagulation. The enzyme ectonucleoside tri(di)phosphohydrolase (ENTPD1, also known as CD39) is a vascular ecto-apyrase on the surface of leukocytes and the endothelium that inhibits intravascular inflammation and thrombosis by hydrolysis of phosphodiester bonds from nucleotides released by activated cells. Here, we evaluated the contribution of CD39 to venous thrombosis in a restricted-flow model of murine inferior vena cava stenosis. CD39-deficiency conferred a >2-fold increase in venous thrombogenesis, characterized by increased leukocyte engagement, neutrophil extracellular trap formation, fibrin, and local activation of tissue factor in the thrombotic milieu. This was orchestrated by increased phosphorylation of the p65 subunit of NF\u03baB, activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, and interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2) release in CD39-deficient mice. Substantiating these findings, an IL-1\u03b2-neutralizing antibody attenuated the thrombosis risk in CD39-deficient mice. These data demonstrate that IL-1\u03b2 is a key accelerant of venous thrombo-inflammation, which can be suppressed by CD39. CD39 inhibits in vivo crosstalk between inflammation and coagulation pathways, and is a critical vascular checkpoint in venous thrombosis. ",
        "Taxes and front-of-package labels improve the healthiness of beverage and snack purchases: a randomized experimental marketplace. BACKGROUND: Sugar taxes and front-of-package (FOP) nutrition labelling systems are strategies to address diet-related non-communicable diseases. However, there is relatively little experimental data on how these strategies influence consumer behavior and how they may interact. This study examined the relative impact of different sugar taxes and FOP labelling systems on beverage and snack food purchases. METHODS: A total of 3584 Canadians 13\u2009years and older participated in an experimental marketplace study using a 5 (FOP label condition)\u2009\u00d7\u20098 (tax condition) between-within group experiment. Participants received $5 and were presented with images of 20 beverages and 20 snack foods available for purchase. Participants were randomized to one of five FOP label conditions (no label; 'high in' warning; multiple traffic light; health star rating; nutrition grade) and completed eight within-subject purchasing tasks with different taxation conditions (beverages: no tax, 20% tax on sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs), 20% tax on sugary drinks, tiered tax on SSBs, tiered tax on sugary drinks; snack foods: no tax, 20% tax on high-sugar foods, tiered tax on high-sugar foods). Upon conclusion, one of eight selections was randomly chosen for purchase, and participants received the product and any change. RESULTS: Compared to those who saw no FOP label, participants who viewed the 'high in' symbol purchased less sugar (-\u20092.5\u2009g), saturated fat (-\u20090.09\u2009g), and calories (-\u200912.6\u2009kcal) in the beverage purchasing tasks, and less sodium (-\u200913.5\u2009mg) and calories (-\u20098.9\u2009kcal) in the food tasks. All taxes resulted in substantial reductions in mean sugars (-\u20091.4 to -\u20094.7\u2009g) and calories (-\u20095.3 to -\u200919.8\u2009kcal) purchased, and in some cases, reductions in sodium (-\u20092.5 to -\u20096.6\u2009mg) and saturated fat (-\u20090.03 to -\u20090.08\u2009g). Taxes that included 100% fruit juice ('sugary drink' taxes) produced greater reductions in sugars and calories than those that did not. CONCLUSIONS: This study expands the evidence indicating the effectiveness of sugar taxation and FOP labelling strategies in promoting healthy food and beverage choices. The results emphasize the importance of applying taxes to 100% fruit juice to maximize policy impact, and suggest that nutrient-specific FOP 'high in' labels may be more effective than other common labelling systems at reducing consumption of targeted nutrients.

        "An order-to-disorder structural switch activates the FoxM1 transcription factor. Intrinsically disordered transcription factor transactivation domains (TADs) function through structural plasticity, adopting ordered conformations when bound to transcriptional co-regulators. Many transcription factors contain a negative regulatory domain (NRD) that suppresses recruitment of transcriptional machinery through autoregulation of the TAD. We report the solution structure of an autoinhibited NRD-TAD complex within FoxM1, a critical activator of mitotic gene expression. We observe that while both the FoxM1 NRD and TAD are primarily intrinsically disordered domains, they associate and adopt a structured conformation. We identify how Plk1 and Cdk kinases cooperate to phosphorylate FoxM1, which releases the TAD into a disordered conformation that then associates with the TAZ2 or KIX domains of the transcriptional co-activator CBP. Our results support a mechanism of FoxM1 regulation in which the TAD undergoes switching between disordered and different ordered structures. ",
        "c-MYC regulates mRNA translation efficiency and start-site selection in lymphoma. The oncogenic c-MYC (MYC) transcription factor has broad effects on gene expression and cell behavior. We show that MYC alters the efficiency and quality of mRNA translation into functional proteins. Specifically, MYC drives the translation of most protein components of the electron transport chain in lymphoma cells, and many of these effects are independent from proliferation. Specific interactions of MYC-sensitive RNA-binding proteins (e.g., SRSF1/RBM42) with 5'UTR sequence motifs mediate many of these changes. Moreover, we observe a striking shift in translation initiation site usage. For example, in low-MYC conditions, lymphoma cells initiate translation of the CD19 mRNA from a site in exon 5. This results in the truncation of all extracellular CD19 domains and facilitates escape from CD19-directed CAR-T cell therapy. Together, our findings reveal MYC effects on the translation of key metabolic enzymes and immune receptors in lymphoma cells. ",
        "Low-Field Magnetic Stimulation Restores Cognitive and Motor Functions in the Mouse Model of Repeated Traumatic Brain Injury: Role of Cellular Prion Protein. Traumatic brain injury (TBI)/concussion is a growing epidemic throughout the world. Memory and neurobehavioral dysfunctions are among the sequelae of TBI. Dislodgement of cellular prion protein (PrPc) and disruption of circadian rhythm have been linked to TBI. Low-field magnetic stimulation (LFMS) is a new noninvasive repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) technique that generates diffused and low-intensity magnetic stimulation to deep cortical and subcortical areas. The role of LFMS on PrPc, proteins related to the circadian rhythm, and behavior alterations in a repeated TBI mouse model were studied in the present study. TBI was induced to the mice (right hemisphere) using weight-drop method, once daily for 3 days. LFMS treatment was given for 20\u2009min once daily for 4 days (immediately after each TBI induction). The results showed that LFMS-treated TBI mice significantly improved cognitive and motor function as evidenced by open field exploration, rotarod, and novel location recognition tasks. In addition, a significant increase in PrPc and decreased glial fibrillary acidic protein levels were observed in cortical and hippocampal regions of LFMS-treated TBI mice brain compared with sham-treated TBI mice, while neuronal nuclei level was significantly increased in cortical region. In LFMS-treated mice, a decrease in proteins related to circadian rhythm were observed, compared with sham-treated TBI mice. The results obtained from the study demonstrated the neuroprotective effect of LFMS, which may be through regulating PrPc and/or proteins related to circadian rhythm. Thus, the present study suggests that LFMS may improve the subject's neurological condition following TBI. ",
        "Dietary salt promotes cognitive impairment through tau phosphorylation. Dietary habits and vascular risk factors promote both Alzheimer's disease and cognitive impairment caused by vascular factors1-3. Furthermore, accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau, a microtubule-associated protein and a hallmark of Alzheimer's pathology4, is also linked to vascular cognitive impairment5,6. In mice, a salt-rich diet leads to cognitive dysfunction associated with a nitric oxide deficit in cerebral endothelial cells and cerebral hypoperfusion7. Here we report that dietary salt induces hyperphosphorylation of tau followed by cognitive dysfunction in mice, and that these effects are prevented by restoring endothelial nitric oxide production. The nitric oxide deficiency reduces neuronal calpain nitrosylation and results in enzyme activation, which, in turn, leads to tau phosphorylation by activating cyclin-dependent kinase\u00a05. Salt-induced cognitive impairment is not observed in tau-null mice or in mice treated with anti-tau antibodies, despite persistent cerebral hypoperfusion and neurovascular dysfunction. These findings identify a causal link between dietary salt, endothelial dysfunction and tau pathology, independent of haemodynamic insufficiency. Avoidance of excessive salt intake and maintenance of vascular health may help to stave off the vascular and neurodegenerative pathologies that underlie dementia in the elderly. ",
        "Long-term exposure to atmospheric metals assessed by mosses and mortality in France. BACKGROUND: Long-term exposure to air pollution affects health, but little is known about exposure to atmospheric metals. Estimating exposure to atmospheric metals across large spatial areas remains challenging. Metal concentrations in mosses could constitute a useful proxy. Here, we linked moss biomonitoring and epidemiological data to investigate the associations between long-term exposure to metals and mortality. METHODS: We modelled and mapped 13 atmospheric metals from a 20-year national moss biomonitoring program to derive exposure estimates across France. In the population-based Gazel cohort, we included 11,382 participants from low to intermediate population density areas and assigned modelled metals to their residential addresses. We distinguished between airborne metals that are primarily of natural origin and those primarily of anthropogenic origin. Associations were estimated between exposure to metals and mortality (natural-cause, cardiovascular and respiratory), using Cox models, with confounder adjustment at individual level. FINDINGS: Between 1996 and 2017, there were 1313 deaths in the cohort (including 181 cardiovascular and 33 respiratory). Exposure to the anthropogenic metals was associated with an increased risk of natural-cause mortality (hazard ratio of 1.16 [1.08-1.24] per interquartile range of exposure), while metals from natural sources were not. INTERPRETATION: Some atmospheric anthropogenic metals may be associated with excess mortality - even in areas with relatively low levels of exposure to air pollution. Consistent with the previous literature, our findings support the use of moss biomonitoring as a tool to assess health effects of air pollution exposure at individual level. ",
        "Primed PMNs in healthy mouse and human circulation are first responders during acute inflammation. Polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) are the most abundant circulating leukocytes, and the first cells recruited to sites of tissue inflammation. Using a fixation method to preserve native CD marker expression prior to immunophenotyping, we identified a distinct population of \"primed for recruitment\" PMNs in healthy mouse and human blood that has high expression of adhesion and activation markers compared with the bulk resting-state PMNs. In response to acute tissue inflammation, primed PMNs (pPMNs) were rapidly depleted from the circulation and recruited to the tissue. One hour after acute peritoneal insult, pPMNs became the dominant PMN population in bone marrow (BM) and blood, returning to baseline levels with resolution of inflammation. PMN priming was induced by the granulopoietic factors granulocyte-macrophage-colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF). High levels of pPMNs were observed in neutropenic mice and in pediatric neutropenic patients who were resistant to infection, highlighting an important role of this population in innate immune function.

        "7-Hydroxymitragynine Is an Active Metabolite of Mitragynine and a Key Mediator of Its Analgesic Effects. Mitragyna speciosa, more commonly known as kratom, is a plant native to Southeast Asia, the leaves of which have been used traditionally as a stimulant, analgesic, and treatment for opioid addiction. Recently, growing use of the plant in the United States and concerns that kratom represents an uncontrolled drug with potential abuse liability, have highlighted the need for more careful study of its pharmacological activity. The major active alkaloid found in kratom, mitragynine, has been reported to have opioid agonist and analgesic activity in vitro and in animal models, consistent with the purported effects of kratom leaf in humans. However, preliminary research has provided some evidence that mitragynine and related compounds may act as atypical opioid agonists, inducing therapeutic effects such as analgesia, while limiting the negative side effects typical of classical opioids. Here we report evidence that an active metabolite plays an important role in mediating the analgesic effects of mitragynine. We find that mitragynine is converted in vitro in both mouse and human liver preparations to the much more potent mu-opioid receptor agonist 7-hydroxymitragynine and that this conversion is mediated by cytochrome P450 3A isoforms. Further, we show that 7-hydroxymitragynine is formed from mitragynine in mice and that brain concentrations of this metabolite are sufficient to explain most or all of the opioid-receptor-mediated analgesic activity of mitragynine. At the same time, mitragynine is found in the brains of mice at very high concentrations relative to its opioid receptor binding affinity, suggesting that it does not directly activate opioid receptors. The results presented here provide a metabolism-dependent mechanism for the analgesic effects of mitragynine and clarify the importance of route of administration for determining the activity of this compound. Further, they raise important questions about the interpretation of existing data on mitragynine and highlight critical areas for further research in animals and humans. ",
        "Accurate needle-free assessment of myocardial oxygenation for ischemic heart disease in canines using magnetic resonance imaging. Myocardial oxygenation-the ability of blood vessels to supply the heart muscle (myocardium) with oxygen-is a critical determinant of cardiac function. Impairment of myocardial oxygenation is a defining feature of ischemic heart disease (IHD), which is caused by pathological conditions that affect the blood vessels supplying oxygen to the heart muscle. Detecting altered myocardial oxygenation can help guide interventions and prevent acute life-threatening events such as heart attacks (myocardial infarction); however, current diagnosis of IHD relies on surrogate metrics and exogenous contrast agents for which many patients are contraindicated. An oxygenation-sensitive cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) approach used previously to demonstrate that CMR signals can be sensitized to changes in myocardial oxygenation showed limited ability to detect small changes in signals in the heart because of physiologic and imaging noise during data acquisition. Here, we demonstrate a CMR-based approach termed cfMRI [cardiac functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)] that detects myocardial oxygenation. cfMRI uses carbon dioxide for repeat interrogation of the functional capacity of the heart's blood vessels via a fast MRI approach suitable for clinical adoption without limitations of key confounders (cardiac/respiratory motion and heart rate changes). This method integrates multiple whole-heart images within a computational framework to reduce noise, producing confidence maps of alterations in myocardial oxygenation. cfMRI permits noninvasive monitoring of myocardial oxygenation without requiring ionizing radiation, contrast agents, or needles. This has the potential to broaden our ability to noninvasively identify IHD and a diverse spectrum of heart diseases related to myocardial ischemia. ",
        "The metabolites NADP+ and NADPH are the targets of the circadian protein Nocturnin (Curled). Nocturnin (NOCT) is a rhythmically expressed protein that regulates metabolism under the control of circadian clock. It has been proposed that NOCT deadenylates and regulates metabolic enzyme mRNAs. However, in contrast to other deadenylases, purified NOCT lacks the deadenylase activity. To identify the substrate of NOCT, we conducted a mass spectrometry screen and report that NOCT specifically and directly converts the dinucleotide NADP+ into NAD+ and NADPH into NADH. Further, we demonstrate that the Drosophila NOCT ortholog, Curled, has the same enzymatic activity. We obtained the 2.7\u2009\u00c5 crystal structure of the human NOCT\u2022NADPH complex, which revealed that NOCT recognizes the chemically unique ribose-phosphate backbone of the metabolite, placing the 2'-terminal phosphate productively for removal. We provide evidence for NOCT targeting to mitochondria and propose that NADP(H) regulation, which takes place at least in part in mitochondria, establishes the molecular link between circadian clock and metabolism.

        "Systems change to improve tobacco use identification and referral in the chiropractic setting: a pilot study. Background: Tobacco use remains a leading cause of death and disability in the United States. Health professionals need to address the use of tobacco products by their patients, but chiropractic clinical systems often remain unsupported and underappreciated in their role to facilitate tobacco use cessation. Methods: This pilot study tested an intervention to assist a chiropractic community to implement sustainable health systems changes for tobacco use based on U.S. Public Health Service guidelines. Chiropractors were educated on the Ask, Advise, Refer (AAR) approach, provided with ongoing guidance, and followed for six months to assess systems change. The study was conducted from March 2016 to July 2017. Results: Evidence of a systematic process in place to conduct AAR was present in all clinics by the end of the fourth month of the intervention period. Although no clinic had sustained health system change for full AAR, all six of the clinics made progress in the individual AAR components. Furthermore, five clinics achieved sustained system change for the Ask component, as after systems change was achieved, the rate of tobacco user identifications did not drop below 50%. For the Advise component, five clinics succeeded in having individual months of \u226550% of tobacco users being advised, and three clinics achieved the formal definition of systems change. For the Refer component, no clinic achieved system change, although four had individual months of \u226550% of tobacco users being referred. The patient quit rate was 13.3% (n\u2009=\u200915) for the 30-day follow-up and 16.7% (n\u2009=\u20096) for the three-month follow-up. Conclusions: This study demonstrates the feasibility of implementing a health systems change in the chiropractic setting to identify tobacco users, to advise them to quit, and to refer users for cessation services.

        "Pharmacodynamics of Tebipenem: New Options for Oral Treatment of Multidrug-Resistant Gram-Negative Infections. Tebipenem pivoxil HBr (TBPM-PI-HBr) is a novel orally bioavailable carbapenem. The active moiety is tebipenem. Tebipenem pivoxil is licensed for use in Japan in children with ear, nose, and throat infections and respiratory infections. The HBr salt was designed to improve drug substance and drug product properties, including stability. TBPM-PI-HBr is now being developed as an agent for the treatment of complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI) in adults. The pharmacokinetics-pharmacodynamics of tebipenem were studied in a well-characterized neutropenic murine thigh infection model. Plasma drug concentrations were measured using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Dose fractionation experiments were performed after establishing dose-response relationships. The magnitude of drug exposure required for stasis was established using 11 strains of Enterobacteriaceae (Escherichia coli, n\u2009=\u20096; Klebsiella pneumoniae, n\u2009=\u20095) with a variety of resistance mechanisms. The relationship between drug exposure and the emergence of resistance was established in a hollow-fiber infection model (HFIM). Tebipenem exhibited time-dependent pharmacodynamics that were best described by the free drug area under the concentration-time curve (fAUC0-24)/MIC corrected for the length of the dosing interval (fAUC0-24/MIC\u2009\u00b7\u20091/tau). The pharmacodynamics of tebipenem versus E. coli and K. pneumoniae were comparable, as was the response of strains possessing extended-spectrum \u03b2-lactamases versus the wild type. The median fAUC0-24/MIC\u2009\u00b7\u20091/tau value for the achievement of stasis in the 11 strains was 23. Progressively more fractionated regimens in the HFIM resulted in the suppression of resistance. An fAUC0-24/MIC\u2009\u00b7\u20091/tau value of 34.58 to 51.87 resulted in logarithmic killing and the suppression of resistance. These data and analyses will be used to define the regimen for a phase III study of adult patients with cUTI. ",
        "Single-cell trajectories reconstruction, exploration and mapping of omics data with STREAM. Single-cell transcriptomic assays have enabled the de novo reconstruction of lineage differentiation trajectories, along with the characterization of cellular heterogeneity and state transitions. Several methods have been developed for reconstructing developmental trajectories from single-cell transcriptomic data, but efforts on analyzing single-cell epigenomic data and on trajectory visualization remain limited. Here we present STREAM, an interactive pipeline capable of disentangling and visualizing complex branching trajectories from both single-cell transcriptomic and epigenomic data. We have tested STREAM on several synthetic and real datasets generated with different single-cell technologies. We further demonstrate its utility for understanding myoblast differentiation and disentangling known heterogeneity in hematopoiesis for different organisms. STREAM is an open-source software package. ",
        "Metabolic control of BRISC-SHMT2 assembly regulates immune signalling. Serine hydroxymethyltransferase\u00a02 (SHMT2) regulates one-carbon transfer reactions that are essential for amino acid and nucleotide metabolism, and uses pyridoxal-5'-phosphate (PLP) as a cofactor. Apo SHMT2 exists as a dimer with unknown functions, whereas PLP binding stabilizes the active tetrameric state. SHMT2 also promotes inflammatory cytokine signalling by interacting with the deubiquitylating BRCC36 isopeptidase complex (BRISC), although it is unclear whether this function relates to metabolism. Here we present the cryo-electron microscopy structure of the human BRISC-SHMT2 complex at a resolution of 3.8\u00a0\u00c5. BRISC is a U-shaped dimer of four subunits, and SHMT2 sterically blocks the BRCC36 active site and inhibits deubiquitylase activity. Only the inactive SHMT2 dimer-and not the active PLP-bound tetramer-binds and inhibits BRISC. Mutations in BRISC that disrupt SHMT2 binding impair type I interferon signalling in response to inflammatory stimuli. Intracellular levels of PLP regulate the interaction between BRISC and SHMT2, as well as inflammatory cytokine responses. These data reveal a mechanism in which metabolites regulate deubiquitylase activity and inflammatory signalling. ",
        "Distinct fibroblast subsets drive inflammation and damage in arthritis. The identification of lymphocyte subsets with non-overlapping effector functions has been pivotal to the development of targeted therapies in immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (IMIDs)1,2. However, it remains unclear whether fibroblast subclasses with non-overlapping functions also exist and are responsible for the wide variety of tissue-driven processes observed in IMIDs, such as inflammation and damage3-5. Here we identify and describe the biology of distinct subsets of fibroblasts responsible for mediating either inflammation or tissue damage in arthritis. We show that deletion of fibroblast activation protein-\u03b1 (FAP\u03b1)+ fibroblasts suppressed both inflammation and bone erosions in mouse models of resolving and persistent arthritis. Single-cell transcriptional analysis identified two distinct fibroblast subsets within the FAP\u03b1+ population: FAP\u03b1+THY1+ immune effector fibroblasts located in the synovial sub-lining, and FAP\u03b1+THY1- destructive fibroblasts restricted to the synovial lining layer. When adoptively transferred into the joint, FAP\u03b1+THY1- fibroblasts selectively mediate bone and cartilage damage with little effect on inflammation, whereas transfer of FAP\u03b1+ THY1+ fibroblasts resulted in a more severe and persistent inflammatory arthritis, with minimal effect on bone and cartilage. Our findings describing anatomically discrete, functionally distinct fibroblast subsets with non-overlapping functions have important implications for cell-based therapies aimed at modulating inflammation and tissue damage.

        "Evolutionary pathways to antibiotic resistance are dependent upon environmental structure and bacterial lifestyle. Bacterial populations vary in their stress tolerance and population structure depending upon whether growth occurs in well-mixed or structured environments. We hypothesized that evolution in biofilms would generate greater genetic diversity than well-mixed environments and lead to different pathways of antibiotic resistance. We used experimental evolution and whole genome sequencing to test how the biofilm lifestyle influenced the rate, genetic mechanisms, and pleiotropic effects of resistance to ciprofloxacin in Acinetobacter baumannii populations. Both evolutionary dynamics and the identities of mutations differed between lifestyle. Planktonic populations experienced selective sweeps of mutations including the primary topoisomerase drug targets, whereas biofilm-adapted populations acquired mutations in regulators of efflux pumps. An overall trade-off between fitness and resistance level emerged, wherein biofilm-adapted clones were less resistant than planktonic but more fit in the absence of drug. However, biofilm populations developed collateral sensitivity to cephalosporins, demonstrating the clinical relevance of lifestyle on the evolution of resistance. ",
        "Sociodemographic factors and social determinants associated with toxicology confirmed polysubstance opioid-related deaths. BACKGROUND AND AIMS: While prescribed and illicit opioid use are primary drivers of the national surges in overdose deaths, opioid overdose deaths in which stimulants are also present are increasing in the U.S. We determined the social determinants and sociodemographic factors associated with opioid-only versus polysubstance opioid overdose deaths in Massachusetts. Particular attention was focused on the role of stimulants in opioid overdose deaths. METHODS: We analyzed all opioid-related overdose deaths from 2014 to 2015 in an individually-linked population database in Massachusetts. We used linked postmortem toxicology data to identify drugs present at the time of death. We constructed a multinomial logistic regression model to identify factors associated with three mutually exclusive overdose death groups based on toxicological results: opioid-related deaths with (1) opioids only present, (2) opioids and other substances not including stimulants, and (3) opioids and stimulants with or without other substances. RESULTS: Between 2014 and 2015, there were 2,244 opioid-related overdose deaths in Massachusetts that had accompanying toxicology results. Toxicology reports indicated that 17% had opioids only, 36% had opioids plus stimulants, and 46% had opioids plus another non-stimulant substance. Persons older than 24 years, non-rural residents, those with comorbid mental illness, non-Hispanic black residents, and persons with recent homelessness were more likely than their counterparts to die with opioids and stimulants than opioids alone. CONCLUSIONS: Polysubstance opioid overdose is increasingly common in the US. Addressing modifiable social determinants of health, including barriers to mental health services and homelessness, is important to reduce polysubstance use and overdose deaths. ",
        "Long-Term Exposure to Ambient Ozone and Progression of Subclinical Arterial Disease: The Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis and Air Pollution. BACKGROUND: Long-term ozone ([Formula: see text]) exposure is associated with cardiovascular mortality, but little is known about the associations between [Formula: see text] and subclinical arterial disease. OBJECTIVES: We studied the longitudinal association of exposure to [Formula: see text] and progression of key subclinical arterial markers in adults: intima-media thickness of common carotid artery ([Formula: see text]), carotid plaque (CP) burden, and coronary artery calcification (CAC). METHODS: CAC was measured one to four times at baseline and at follow-up exams (1999\u20132012) by computed tomography (CT) in 6,619 healthy adults, recruited at age 45-84 y without cardiovascular disease (CVD), over a mean of 6.5 y (standard deviation: 3.5 y). [Formula: see text] and CP burden were quantified in 3,392 participants using carotid artery ultrasound imaging acquired over a mean of 9 y (1.7 y). Over 91% and 89% participants had at least one follow-up [Formula: see text] and CAC measurement, respectively. Residence-specific [Formula: see text] concentrations were estimated by a validated spatiotemporal model spanning from 1999 to 2012. This model relied on comprehensive monitoring data and geographical variables to predict individualized long-term average concentrations since baseline. Linear mixed models and logistic regression model were used to evaluate relationships of long-term average exposure to [Formula: see text] with longitudinal change in [Formula: see text], CAC, and CP formation, respectively. RESULTS: Mean progression rates of [Formula: see text] and CAC were [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text]. CP formation was identified in 55% of the subjects. A [Formula: see text] increase in long-term average [Formula: see text] exposure was associated with a [Formula: see text] [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.4, 9.7] greater increase in [Formula: see text] over 10 y. A [Formula: see text] increase in [Formula: see text] was also associated with new CP formation [odds ratio (OR): 1.2 (95% CI: 1.1, 1.4)] but not CAC progression [[Formula: see text] (95% CI: [Formula: see text], 2)]. Associations were robust in the analysis with extended covariate adjustment, including copollutants, i.e., nitrogen oxides ([Formula: see text]) and particulate matter with diameter [Formula: see text] ([Formula: see text]). CONCLUSION: Over almost a decade of follow-up, outdoor [Formula: see text] concentrations were associated with increased rate of carotid wall thickness progression and risk of new plaque formation, suggesting arterial injury in this cohort. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP3325.

        "Metabolomics Profiling before, during, and after the Beijing Olympics: A Panel Study of Within-Individual Differences during Periods of High and Low Air Pollution. BACKGROUND: The metabolome is a collection of exogenous chemicals and metabolites from cellular processes that may reflect the body's response to environmental exposures. Studies of air pollution and metabolomics are limited. OBJECTIVES: To explore changes in the human metabolome before, during, and after the 2008 Beijing Olympics Games, when air pollution was high, low, and high, respectively. METHODS: Serum samples were collected before, during, and after the Olympics from 26 participants in an existing panel study. Gas and ultra-high performance liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry were used in metabolomics analysis. Repeated measures ANOVA, network analysis, and enrichment analysis methods were employed to identify metabolites and classes associated with air pollution changes. RESULTS: A total of 886 molecules were measured in our metabolomics analysis. Network partitioning identified four modules with 65 known metabolites that significantly changed across the three time points. All known molecules in the first module ([Formula: see text]) were lipids (e.g., eicosapentaenoic acid, stearic acid). The second module consisted primarily of dipeptides ([Formula: see text], e.g., isoleucylglycine) plus 8 metabolites from four other classes (e.g., hypoxanthine, 12-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid). Most of the metabolites in Modules 3 (19 of 23) and 4 (5 of 5) were unknown. Enrichment analysis of module-identified metabolites indicted significantly overrepresented pathways, including long- and medium-chain fatty acids, polyunsaturated fatty acids (n3 and n6), eicosanoids, lysolipid, dipeptides, fatty acid metabolism, and purine metabolism [(hypo) xanthine/inosine-containing pathways]. CONCLUSIONS: We identified two major metabolic signatures: one consisting of lipids, and a second that included dipeptides, polyunsaturated fatty acids, taurine, and xanthine. Metabolites in both groups decreased during the 2008 Beijing Olympics, when air pollution was low, and increased after the Olympics, when air pollution returned to normal (high) levels. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP3705.

        "Toward an Understanding of Patients' and Their Partners' Experiences of Bladder Cancer. BACKGROUND: Bladder cancer is characterized by recurrence and progression, ongoing surveillance and treatment, adverse effects, and complications and is associated with chronic ill health that may compromise relationships, social activities, and employment. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to gain an understanding of quality of life disruptions among both those diagnosed with bladder cancer and their supportive partners (spouses or other family members). INTERVENTIONS/METHODS: Couples were recruited from a tertiary care public hospital database. Nine heterosexual couples (married/de facto) and another comprising a clinical participant and her daughter-in-law were interviewed for approximately 60 minutes. Interviews were audio recorded and transcribed, with qualitative description used to gain an in-depth understanding of participants' experiences without previous agenda or knowledge, allowing their viewpoints to be summarized in everyday terms. RESULTS: Thematic analysis highlighted 4 themes: psychical responses, cognitive and emotional reactions, survival techniques and the importance of partner support and its assistance for clinical participants acceptance of, and adaptation to their bladder cancer, surveillance, and treatment protocols. CONCLUSION: A key finding was the value of a supportive partner in dealing with the effects of bladder cancer daily. From a health service perspective, the need for clear information provision and counseling/support to assist patient management was also evident. IMPLICATIONS FOR FUTURE PRACTICE: Health professionals need to appreciate the quality of life implications for patients and partners, thus understanding the needs of couples. Greater collaboration with and by health professionals who assist in care may allow couples to move more confidently toward adaptation to bladder cancer. ",
        "Cold parenting is associated with cellular aging in offspring: A retrospective study. BACKGROUND: Early life stress is a known risk factor for diseases and premature death. We tested whether parenting style impacts telomere length (TL), a cellular aging biomarker. METHODS: Information on parents' style of parenting was obtained from 199 participants in the Adventist Health Study-1 (AHS-1) who 27+ years later also enrolled in the AHS-2 where blood was collected for relative TL (rTL) assessment. RESULTS: Subjects describing their mothers' parenting style as cold had on average 25% smaller rTL compared to subjects not reporting a cold mother (1.89 vs 2.53). This association was greatest among those with less education, and those who stayed overweight/obese or put on weight during follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: These results support previous findings that early life stress may have health implications by promoting cellular aging, and expands these stressors to include cold parenting during an individuals' formative years. Higher education and normal weight seem to provide some resilience. ",

Longitudinal analyses of 16S ribosomal RNA, metagenomic, metatranscriptomic and cytokine profiles from 45 preterm and 90 term birth controls identified harbingers of preterm birth in this cohort of women predominantly of African ancestry. Women who delivered preterm exhibited significantly lower vaginal levels of Lactobacillus crispatus and higher levels of BVAB1, Sneathia amnii, TM7-H1, a group of Prevotella species and nine additional taxa. The first representative genomes of BVAB1 and TM7-H1 are described. Preterm-birth-associated taxa were correlated with proinflammatory cytokines in vaginal fluid. These findings highlight new opportunities for assessment of the risk of preterm birth. ",
        "BK Polyomavirus Activates the DNA Damage Response To Prolong S Phase. BK polyomavirus (PyV) is a major source of kidney failure in transplant recipients. The standard treatment for patients with lytic BKPyV infection is to reduce immunosuppressive therapy, which increases the risk of graft rejection. PyVs are DNA viruses that rely upon host replication proteins for viral genome replication. A hallmark of PyV infection is activation of the DNA damage response (DDR) to prevent severe host and viral DNA damage that impairs viral production by an unknown mechanism. Therefore, we sought to better understand why BKPyV activates the DDR through the ATR and ATM pathways and how this prevents DNA damage and leads to increased viral production. When ATR was inhibited in BKPyV-infected primary kidney cells, severe DNA damage occurred due to premature Cdk1 activation, which resulted in mitosis of cells that were actively replicating host DNA in S phase. Conversely, ATM was required for efficient entry into S phase and to prevent normal mitotic entry after G2 phase. The synergistic activation of these DDR kinases promoted and maintained BKPyV-mediated S phase to enhance viral production. In contrast to BKPyV infection, DDR inhibition did not disrupt cell cycle control in uninfected cells. This suggests that DDR inhibitors may be used to specifically target BKPyV-infected cells.IMPORTANCE BK polyomavirus (BKPyV) is an emerging pathogen that reactivates in immunosuppressed organ transplant patients. We wanted to understand why BKPyV-induced activation of the DNA damage response (DDR) enhances viral titers and prevents host DNA damage. Here, we show that the virus activates the DNA damage response in order to keep the infected cells in S phase to replicate the viral DNA. The source of DNA damage was due to actively replicating cells with uncondensed chromosomes entering directly into mitosis when the DDR was inhibited in BKPyV-infected cells. This study clarifies the previously enigmatic role of the DDR during BKPyV infection by demonstrating that the virus activates the DDR to maintain the cells in S phase in order to promote viral replication and that disruption of this cell cycle arrest can lead to catastrophic DNA damage for the host.

        "Weight-based teasing is associated with gain in BMI and fat mass among children and adolescents at-risk for obesity: A longitudinal study. BACKGROUND: Youths with overweight and obesity report frequent instances of weight-based teasing. However, little is known about the prospective associations between weight-based teasing and changes in body composition among youth. OBJECTIVE: To assess associations between weight-based teasing and changes in body mass index (BMI) and fat mass in a longitudinal study of youths with, or at-risk for, overweight and obesity. METHODS: One hundred ten youths with, or at-risk for, overweight participated in a longitudinal observational study. The Perception of Teasing Scale was administered at baseline. Height, weight, and body composition were obtained at baseline and at follow-ups (range: 1-15\u00a0years). RESULTS: Mean age at baseline was 11.8\u00a0years; 53% had overweight/obesity; 36% were non-Hispanic Black; 55% were female; mean follow-up from baseline: 8.5\u00a0years. Adjusting for covariates and repeated measures of BMI or fat mass, linear mixed models revealed that weight-based teasing was associated with greater gain of BMI and fat mass across the follow-up period (ps\u00a0\u2264\u00a0.007). Adjusting for covariates, youths reporting high weight-based teasing (two standard deviations above the mean) experienced a 33% greater gain in BMI (an additional 0.20\u00a0kg/m2 ) and a 91% greater gain in fat mass (an additional 0.65\u00a0kg) per year compared with peers who reported no weight-based teasing. CONCLUSIONS: Among youths with, and at-risk for, overweight and obesity, weight-based teasing was associated with greater weight and fat gain. ",
        "Forensic medical results and law enforcement actions following sexual assault: A comparison of child, adolescent and adult cases. BACKGROUND: In sexual assault cases, little research has examined differences in forensic medical findings and law enforcement response by victim age across the entire age range. OBJECTIVE: This study addressed this gap by comparing four victim age groups: adults, adolescents over the age of consent, adolescents under the age of consent, and children under 12. PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: Cases were randomly sampled from a statewide database of medical reports on sexual assault examinations conducted in hospital emergency departments, including only cases reported to law enforcement (N\u2009=\u2009563). METHODS: Data were combined from a medical report database, from coding of medical documentation and crime laboratory reports, and from case data provided by law enforcement. RESULTS: Rates for both younger and older adolescent victims and adult victims were comparable, with no statistically significant differences on most variables: penetration, perpetrator use of force, non-genital and genital injuries, presence of biological evidence, generating assailant DNA profiles, DNA match to suspect, hits in the FBI's DNA database, and law enforcement unfounding (i.e., determining allegations to be false or baseless). Child victims were significantly less likely to have a non-genital injury, and their cases were significantly more likely to be founded by law enforcement. Arrests were significantly more likely when victims were under the age of consent. CONCLUSIONS: Despite significant differences by victim age, similarity between adolescent and adult cases was substantial. Both younger and older adolescents may be at higher risk of physical violence during sexual assault than previously recognized, and need greater attention in response systems. ",
        "Rapid molecular evolution of pain insensitivity in multiple African rodents. Noxious substances, called algogens, cause pain and are used as defensive weapons by plants and stinging insects. We identified four previously unknown instances of algogen-insensitivity by screening eight African rodent species related to the naked mole-rat with the painful substances capsaicin, acid (hydrogen chloride, pH 3.5), and allyl isothiocyanate (AITC). Using RNA sequencing, we traced the emergence of sequence variants in transduction channels, like transient receptor potential channel TRPA1 and voltage-gated sodium channel Nav1.7, that accompany algogen insensitivity. In addition, the AITC-insensitive highveld mole-rat exhibited overexpression of the leak channel NALCN (sodium leak channel, nonselective), ablating AITC detection by nociceptors. These molecular changes likely rendered highveld mole-rats immune to the stings of the Natal droptail ant. Our study reveals how evolution can be used as a discovery tool to find molecular mechanisms that shut down pain. ",
        "The microbiota regulate neuronal function and fear extinction learning. Multicellular organisms have co-evolved with complex consortia of viruses, bacteria, fungi and parasites, collectively referred to as the microbiota1. In mammals, changes in the composition of the microbiota can influence many physiologic processes (including development, metabolism and immune cell function) and are associated with susceptibility to multiple diseases2. Alterations in the microbiota can also modulate host behaviours-such as social activity, stress, and anxiety-related responses-that are linked to diverse neuropsychiatric disorders3. However, the mechanisms by which the microbiota influence neuronal activity and host behaviour remain poorly defined. Here we show that manipulation of the microbiota in antibiotic-treated or germ-free adult mice results in significant deficits in fear extinction learning. Single-nucleus RNA\u00a0sequencing of the medial prefrontal cortex of the brain revealed significant alterations in gene expression in excitatory neurons, glia and other cell types. Transcranial two-photon imaging showed that deficits in extinction learning after manipulation of the microbiota in adult mice were associated with defective learning-related remodelling of postsynaptic dendritic spines and reduced activity in cue-encoding neurons in the medial prefrontal cortex. In addition, selective re-establishment of the microbiota revealed a limited neonatal developmental window in which microbiota-derived signals can restore normal extinction learning in adulthood. Finally, unbiased metabolomic analysis identified four metabolites that were significantly downregulated in germ-free mice and have been reported to be related to neuropsychiatric disorders in humans and mouse models, suggesting that microbiota-derived compounds may directly affect brain function and behaviour. Together, these data indicate that fear extinction learning requires microbiota-derived signals both during early postnatal neurodevelopment and in adult mice, with implications for our understanding of how diet, infection, and lifestyle influence brain health and subsequent susceptibility to neuropsychiatric disorders.

        "Long-term ex vivo haematopoietic-stem-cell expansion allows nonconditioned transplantation. Multipotent self-renewing haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) regenerate the adult blood system after transplantation1, which is a curative therapy for numerous diseases including immunodeficiencies and leukaemias2. Although substantial effort has been applied to identifying HSC maintenance factors through the characterization of the in vivo bone-marrow HSC microenvironment or niche3-5, stable ex vivo HSC expansion has previously been unattainable6,7. Here we describe the development of a defined, albumin-free culture system that supports the long-term ex vivo expansion of functional mouse HSCs. We used a systematic optimization approach, and found that high levels of thrombopoietin synergize with low levels of stem-cell factor and fibronectin to sustain HSC self-renewal. Serum albumin has long been recognized as a major source of biological contaminants in HSC cultures8; we identify polyvinyl alcohol as a functionally superior replacement for serum albumin that is compatible with good manufacturing practice. These conditions afford between 236- and 899-fold expansions of functional HSCs over 1\u00a0month, although analysis of clonally derived cultures suggests that there is considerable heterogeneity in the self-renewal capacity of HSCs ex vivo. Using this system, HSC cultures that are derived from only 50\u00a0cells robustly engraft in recipient mice without the normal requirement for toxic pre-conditioning (for example, radiation), which may be relevant for HSC transplantation in humans. These findings therefore have important implications for both basic HSC research and clinical haematology. ",
        "Burden of Environmental Adversity Associated With Psychopathology, Maturation, and Brain Behavior Parameters in Youths. Importance: Low socioeconomic status (L-SES) and the experience of traumatic stressful events (TSEs) are environmental factors implicated in behavioral deficits, abnormalities in brain development, and accelerated maturation. However, the relative contribution of these environmental factors is understudied. Objective: To compare the association of L-SES and TSEs with psychopathology, puberty, neurocognition, and multimodal neuroimaging parameters in brain maturation. Design, Setting, and Participants: The Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort is a community-based study examining psychopathology, neurocognition, and neuroimaging among participants recruited through the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia pediatric network. Participants are youths aged 8 to 21 years at enrollment with stable health and fluency in English. The sample of 9498 participants was racially (5298 European ancestry [55.8%], 3124 African ancestry [32.9%], and 1076 other [11.4%]) and economically diverse. A randomly selected subsample (n\u2009=\u20091601) underwent multimodal neuroimaging. Data were collected from November 5, 2009, through December 30, 2011, and analyzed from February 1 through November 7, 2018. Main Outcomes and Measures: The following domains were examined: (1) clinical, including psychopathology, assessed with a structured interview based on the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-Age Children, and puberty, assessed with the Tanner scale; (2) neurocognition, assessed by the Penn Computerized Neurocognitive Battery; and (3) multimodal magnetic resonance imaging parameters of brain structure and function. Results: A total of 9498 participants were included in the analysis (4906 [51.7%] female; mean [SD] age, 14.2 [3.7] years). Clinically, L-SES and TSEs were associated with greater severity of psychiatric symptoms across the psychopathology domains of anxiety/depression, fear, externalizing behavior, and the psychosis spectrum. Low SES showed small effect sizes (highest for externalizing behavior, 0.306 SD; 95% CI, 0.269 to 0.342), whereas TSEs had large effect sizes, with the highest in females for anxiety/depression (1.228 SD; 95% CI, 1.156 to 1.300) and in males for the psychosis spectrum (1.099 SD; 95% CI, 1.032 to 1.166). Both were associated with early puberty. Cognitively, L-SES had moderate effect sizes on poorer performance, the greatest being on complex cognition (-0.500 SD 95% CI, -0.536 to -0.464), whereas TSEs were associated with slightly better memory (0.129 SD; 95% CI, 0.084 to 0.174) and poorer complex reasoning (-0.109 SD; 95% CI, -0.154 to -0.064). Environmental factors had common and distinct associations with brain structure and function. Structurally, both were associated with lower volume, but L-SES had correspondingly lower gray matter density, whereas TSEs were associated with higher gray matter density. Functionally, both were associated with lower regional cerebral blood flow and coherence and with accelerated brain maturation. Conclusions and Relevance: Low SES and TSEs are associated with common and unique differences in symptoms, neurocognition, and structural and functional brain parameters. Both environmental factors are associated with earlier completion of puberty by physical features and brain parameters. These findings appear to underscore the need for identifying and preventing adverse environmental conditions associated with neurodevelopment. ",
        "Tracing Oncogene Rearrangements in the Mutational History of Lung Adenocarcinoma. Mutational processes giving rise to lung adenocarcinomas (LADCs) in non-smokers remain elusive. We analyzed 138 LADC whole genomes, including 83 cases with minimal contribution of smoking-associated mutational signature. Genomic rearrangements were not correlated with smoking-associated mutations and frequently served as driver events of smoking-signature-low LADCs. Complex genomic rearrangements, including chromothripsis and chromoplexy, generated 74% of known fusion oncogenes, including EML4-ALK, CD74-ROS1, and KIF5B-RET. Unlike other collateral rearrangements, these fusion-oncogene-associated rearrangements were frequently copy-number-balanced, representing a genomic signature of early oncogenesis. Analysis of mutation timing revealed that fusions and point mutations of canonical oncogenes were often acquired in the early decades of life. During a long latency, cancer-related genes were disrupted or amplified by complex rearrangements. The genomic landscape was different between subgroups-EGFR-mutant LADCs had frequent whole-genome duplications with p53 mutations, whereas fusion-oncogene-driven LADCs had frequent SETD2 mutations. Our study highlights LADC oncogenesis driven by endogenous mutational processes. ",
        "Parvifoline AA Promotes Susceptibility of Hepatocarcinoma to Natural Killer Cell-Mediated Cytolysis by Targeting Peroxiredoxin. Natural killer (NK) cells play a crucial role in the surveillance of malignant cells. The engagement of NK group 2 member D (NKG2D) receptor with its ligands on target cells represents a promising therapeutic strategy against cancers. Here, we report that parvifoline\u00a0AA (PAA), a natural ent-kaurane diterpenoid, markedly stimulates the expression of NKG2D ligands on hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells, considerably enhancing their recognition and lysis by NK cells. We determined that PAA covalently binds to the conserved cysteine site of peroxiredoxins I/II (Prxs-I/II) and inhibits their catalytic activity, subsequently activating the ROS/ERK axis and the immunogenicity of HCC toward NK cells. Robust tumor growth inhibition by PAA dependent on NK cell activation was detected in\u00a0vivo. Our data suggest Prxs-I/II as a promising cancer immune therapeutic target and provide a compelling rationale for further development of the inhibitor PAA as a sensitizer agent for NK cell-mediated HCC immunotherapy.

        "Close proximity interactions support transmission of ESBL-K. pneumoniae but not ESBL-E. coli in healthcare settings. Antibiotic-resistance of hospital-acquired infections is a major public health issue. The worldwide emergence and diffusion of extended-spectrum \u03b2-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae, including Escherichia coli (ESBL-EC) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (ESBL-KP), is of particular concern. Preventing their nosocomial spread requires understanding their transmission. Using Close Proximity Interactions (CPIs), measured by wearable sensors, and weekly ESBL-EC-and ESBL-KP-carriage data, we traced their possible transmission paths among 329 patients in a 200-bed long-term care facility over 4 months. Based on phenotypically defined resistance profiles to 12 antibiotics only, new bacterial acquisitions were tracked. Extending a previously proposed statistical method, the CPI network's ability to support observed incident-colonization episodes of ESBL-EC and ESBL-KP was tested. Finally, mathematical modeling based on our findings assessed the effect of several infection-control measures. A potential infector was identified in the CPI network for 80% (16/20) of ESBL-KP acquisition episodes. The lengths of CPI paths between ESBL-KP incident cases and their potential infectors were shorter than predicted by chance (P = 0.02), indicating that CPI-network relationships were consistent with dissemination. Potential ESBL-EC infectors were identified for 54% (19/35) of the acquisitions, with longer-than-expected lengths of CPI paths. These contrasting results yielded differing impacts of infection control scenarios, with contact reduction interventions proving less effective for ESBL-EC than for ESBL-KP. These results highlight the widely variable transmission patterns among ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae species. CPI networks supported ESBL-KP, but not ESBL-EC spread. These outcomes could help design more specific surveillance and control strategies to prevent in-hospital Enterobacteriaceae dissemination. ",
        "PET imaging of freely moving interacting rats. Awake rat brain positron emission tomography (PET) has previously been developed to avoid the influence of anesthesia on the rat brain response. In the present work, we further the awake rat brain scanning methodology to establish simultaneous scanning of two interacting rats in a high resolution, large field of view PET scanner. Awake rat imaging methodology based on point source tracking was adapted to be used in a dedicated human brain scanner, the ECAT high resolution research tomograph (HRRT). Rats could freely run on a horizontal platform of 19.4 \u00d7 23\u202fcm placed inside the HRRT. The developed methodology was validated using a motion resolution phantom experiment, 3 awake single rat [18F]FDG scans as well as an [18F]FDG scan of 2 interacting rats. The precision of the point source based motion tracking was 0.359\u202fmm (standard deviation). Minor loss of spatial resolution was observed in the motion corrected reconstructions (MC) of the resolution phantom compared to the motion-free reconstructions (MF). The full-width-at-half-maximum of the phantom rods were increased by on average 0.37\u202fmm in the MC compared to the MF. During the awake scans, extensive motion was observed with rats moving throughout the platform area. The average rat head motion speed was 1.69\u202fcm/s. Brain regions such as hippocampus, cortex and cerebellum could be recovered in the motion corrected reconstructions. Relative regional brain uptake of MC and MF was strongly correlated (Pearson's r ranging from 0.82 to 0.95, p\u202f<\u202f0.0001). Awake rat brain PET imaging of interacting rats was successfully implemented on the HRRT scanner. The present method allows a large range of motion throughout a large field of view as well as to image two rats simultaneously opening the way to novel rat brain PET study designs. ",
        "Field pathogenomics of Fusarium head blight reveals pathogen transcriptome differences due to host resistance. Fusarium head blight (FHB), caused by Fusarium graminearum and other Fusarium species, is a detrimental disease that affects small grains such as wheat around the world. Management of FHB is difficult, and surveillance as well as a better understanding of pathogen aggressiveness is needed for improved control. F. graminearum disease severity varies depending on the resistance of the host genotype. In this study, we used the field pathogenomics method to investigate gene expression and population structure of isolates collected from wheat lines of varying resistance levels (susceptible, intermediate, and resistant) as well as an axenic control. Differential gene expression was found among isolates collected from different host genotypes. Candidate gene sets were identified for both F. graminearum infection of specific host genotypes and general infection to wheat. Population structure of isolates from different resistance level sources was the same, with all isolates belonging to the NA1 population. ",
        "Lactate Is a Natural Suppressor of RLR Signaling by Targeting MAVS. RLR-mediated type I IFN production plays a pivotal role in elevating host immunity for viral clearance and cancer immune surveillance. Here, we report that glycolysis, which is inactivated during RLR activation, serves as a barrier to impede type I IFN production upon RLR activation. RLR-triggered MAVS-RIG-I recognition hijacks hexokinase binding to MAVS, leading to the impairment of hexokinase mitochondria localization and activation. Lactate serves as a key metabolite responsible for glycolysis-mediated RLR signaling inhibition by directly binding to MAVS transmembrane (TM) domain and\u00a0preventing MAVS aggregation. Notably, lactate restoration reverses increased IFN production caused by lactate deficiency. Using pharmacological and genetic approaches, we show that lactate reduction by lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA) inactivation heightens type I IFN production to protect mice from viral infection. Our study establishes a critical role of glycolysis-derived lactate in limiting RLR signaling and identifies MAVS as a direct sensor of lactate, which functions to connect energy metabolism and innate immunity.

        "Ammonia generation by tryptophan synthase drives a key genetic difference between genital and ocular Chlamydia trachomatis isolates. A striking difference between genital and ocular clinical isolates of Chlamydia trachomatis is that only the former express a functional tryptophan synthase and therefore can synthesize tryptophan by indole salvage. Ocular isolates uniformly cannot use indole due to inactivating mutations within tryptophan synthase, indicating a selection against maintaining this enzyme in the ocular environment. Here, we demonstrate that this selection occurs in two steps. First, specific indole derivatives, produced by the human gut microbiome and present in serum, rapidly induce expression of C. trachomatis tryptophan synthase, even under conditions of tryptophan sufficiency. We demonstrate that these indole derivatives function by acting as de-repressors of C. trachomatis TrpR. Second, trp operon de-repression is profoundly deleterious when infected cells are in an indole-deficient environment, because in the absence of indole, tryptophan synthase deaminates serine to pyruvate and ammonia. We have used biochemical and genetic approaches to demonstrate that expression of wild-type tryptophan synthase is required for the bactericidal production of ammonia. Pertinently, although these indole derivatives de-repress the trpRBA operon of C. trachomatis strains with trpA or trpB mutations, no ammonia is produced, and no deleterious effects are observed. Our studies demonstrate that tryptophan synthase can catalyze the ammonia-generating \u03b2-elimination reaction within any live bacterium. Our results also likely explain previous observations demonstrating that the same indole derivatives inhibit the growth of other pathogenic bacterial species, and why high serum levels of these indole derivatives are favorable for the prognosis of diseased conditions associated with bacterial dysbiosis.

        "DNA damage detection in nucleosomes involves DNA register shifting. Access to DNA packaged in nucleosomes is critical for gene regulation, DNA replication and DNA repair. In humans, the UV-damaged DNA-binding protein (UV-DDB) complex detects UV-light-induced pyrimidine dimers throughout the genome; however, it remains unknown how these lesions are recognized in chromatin, in which nucleosomes restrict access to DNA. Here we report cryo-electron microscopy structures of UV-DDB bound to nucleosomes bearing a 6-4 pyrimidine-pyrimidone dimer or a DNA-damage mimic in various positions. We find that UV-DDB binds UV-damaged nucleosomes at lesions located in the solvent-facing minor groove without affecting the overall nucleosome architecture. In the case of buried lesions that face the histone core, UV-DDB changes the predominant translational register of the nucleosome and selectively binds the lesion in an accessible, exposed position. Our findings explain how UV-DDB detects occluded lesions in strongly positioned nucleosomes, and identify slide-assisted site\u00a0exposure as a mechanism by which high-affinity DNA-binding proteins can access otherwise occluded sites in nucleosomal DNA.

        "Mung Bean Protein Supplement Improves Muscular Strength in Healthy, Underactive Vegetarian Adults. Although vegetarian diets are considered generally protective against chronic disease, nutrient deficiencies, including protein, are possible due to low bioavailability from plant-based sources. The consequences of inadequate dietary protein include reduced lean body mass (LBM) and muscle weakness. This study examined relationships between protein intake, strength, and LBM in 37 underactive vegetarians and recorded the impact of protein supplementation (18 g/day mung bean protein) on these indices utilizing an eight-week, randomized, controlled, feeding trial. Both handgrip and knee flexor and extensor strength were measured at baseline and week eight. At baseline, LBM was significantly related to grams of protein consumed daily. LBM was also correlated to grip strength (r = 0.569, p < 0.001) and lower body strength (r = 0.763 to 0.784; p < 0.001). Twenty-five vegetarians completed the feeding trial, including 11 in the protein supplementation group (PRO) and 14 in the control group (CON). At the end of the trial, LBM and strength did not differ significantly between groups. However, the average percent change for grip, flexor, and extensor strength did differ between PRO and CON participants (+2.9 \u00b1 7.2% and -2.6 \u00b1 7.3% respectively, p = 0.05). Thus, there were strong associations between dietary protein, LBM, and strength in vegetarians and an indication that supplementary vegetarian protein increased strength in the absence of exercise and independent of LBM.

        "SREBP1 drives Keratin-80-dependent cytoskeletal changes and invasive behavior in endocrine-resistant ER\u03b1 breast cancer. Approximately 30% of ER\u03b1 breast cancer patients relapse with metastatic disease following adjuvant endocrine therapies. The connection between acquisition of drug resistance and invasive potential is poorly understood. In this study, we demonstrate that the type II keratin topological associating domain undergoes epigenetic reprogramming in aromatase inhibitors (AI)-resistant cells, leading to Keratin-80 (KRT80) upregulation. KRT80 expression is driven by de novo enhancer activation by sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1). KRT80 upregulation directly promotes cytoskeletal rearrangements at the leading edge, increased focal adhesion and cellular stiffening, collectively promoting cancer cell invasion. Shearwave elasticity imaging performed on prospectively recruited patients confirms KRT80 levels correlate with stiffer tumors. Immunohistochemistry showed increased KRT80-positive cells at relapse and, using several clinical endpoints, KRT80 expression associates with poor survival. Collectively, our data uncover an unpredicted and potentially targetable direct link between epigenetic and cytoskeletal reprogramming promoting cell invasion in response to chronic AI treatment. ",
        "Metabolic control of BRISC-SHMT2 assembly regulates immune signalling. Serine hydroxymethyltransferase\u00a02 (SHMT2) regulates one-carbon transfer reactions that are essential for amino acid and nucleotide metabolism, and uses pyridoxal-5'-phosphate (PLP) as a cofactor. Apo SHMT2 exists as a dimer with unknown functions, whereas PLP binding stabilizes the active tetrameric state. SHMT2 also promotes inflammatory cytokine signalling by interacting with the deubiquitylating BRCC36 isopeptidase complex (BRISC), although it is unclear whether this function relates to metabolism. Here we present the cryo-electron microscopy structure of the human BRISC-SHMT2 complex at a resolution of 3.8\u00a0\u00c5. BRISC is a U-shaped dimer of four subunits, and SHMT2 sterically blocks the BRCC36 active site and inhibits deubiquitylase activity. Only the inactive SHMT2 dimer-and not the active PLP-bound tetramer-binds and inhibits BRISC. Mutations in BRISC that disrupt SHMT2 binding impair type I interferon signalling in response to inflammatory stimuli. Intracellular levels of PLP regulate the interaction between BRISC and SHMT2, as well as inflammatory cytokine responses. These data reveal a mechanism in which metabolites regulate deubiquitylase activity and inflammatory signalling. ",
        "Assessment of the Appropriateness of Antibiotic Prescriptions for Infection Prophylaxis Before Dental Procedures, 2011 to 2015. Importance: Antibiotics are recommended before certain dental procedures in patients with select comorbidities to prevent serious distant site infections. Objective: To assess the appropriateness of antibiotic prophylaxis before dental procedures using Truven, a national integrated health claims database. Design, Setting, and Participants: Retrospective cohort study. Dental visits from 2011 to 2015 were linked to medical and prescription claims from 2009 to 2015. The dates of analysis were August 2018 to January 2019. Participants were US patients with commercial dental insurance without a hospitalization or extraoral infection 14 days before antibiotic prophylaxis (defined as a prescription with \u22642 days' supply dispensed within 7 days before a dental visit). Exposures: Presence or absence of cardiac diagnoses and dental procedures that manipulated the gingiva or tooth periapex. Main Outcomes and Measures: Appropriate antibiotic prophylaxis was defined as a prescription dispensed before a dental visit with a procedure that manipulated the gingiva or tooth periapex in patients with an appropriate cardiac diagnosis. To assess associations between patient or dental visit characteristics and appropriate antibiotic prophylaxis, multivariable logistic regression was used. A priori hypothesis tests were performed with an \u03b1 level of .05. Results: From 2011 to 2015, antibiotic prophylaxis was prescribed for 168\u202f420 dental visits for 91\u202f438 patients (median age, 63 years; interquartile range, 55-72 years; 57.2% female). Overall, these 168\u202f420 dental visits were associated with 287\u202f029 dental procedure codes (range, 1-14 per visit). Most dental visits were classified as diagnostic (70.2%) and/or preventive (58.8%). In 90.7% of dental visits, a procedure was performed that would necessitate antibiotic prophylaxis in high-risk cardiac patients. Prevalent comorbidities include prosthetic joint devices (42.5%) and cardiac conditions at the highest risk of adverse outcome from infective endocarditis (20.9%). Per guidelines, 80.9% of antibiotic prophylaxis prescriptions before dental visits were unnecessary. Clindamycin was more likely to be unnecessary relative to amoxicillin (odds ratio [OR], 1.10; 95% CI, 1.05-1.15). Prosthetic joint devices (OR, 2.31; 95% CI, 2.22-2.41), tooth implant procedures (OR, 1.66; 95% CI, 1.45-1.89), female sex (OR, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.17-1.25), and visits occurring in the western United States (OR, 1.15; 95% CI, 1.06-1.25) were associated with unnecessary antibiotic prophylaxis. Conclusion and Relevance: More than 80% of antibiotics prescribed for infection prophylaxis before dental visits were unnecessary. Implementation of antimicrobial stewardship in dental practices is an opportunity to improve antibiotic prescribing for infection prophylaxis. ",
        "Gastrointestinal dysfunction in patients and mice expressing the autism-associated R451C mutation in neuroligin-3. Gastrointestinal (GI) problems constitute an important comorbidity in many patients with autism. Multiple mutations in the neuroligin family of synaptic adhesion molecules are implicated in autism, however whether they are expressed and impact GI function via changes in the enteric nervous system is unknown. We report the GI symptoms of two brothers with autism and an R451C mutation in Nlgn3 encoding the synaptic adhesion protein, neuroligin-3. We confirm the presence of an array of synaptic genes in the murine GI tract and investigate the impact of impaired synaptic protein expression in mice carrying the human neuroligin-3 R451C missense mutation (NL3R451C ). Assessing in vivo gut dysfunction, we report faster small intestinal transit in NL3R451C compared to wild-type mice. Using an ex vivo colonic motility assay, we show increased sensitivity to GABAA receptor modulation in NL3R451C mice, a well-established Central Nervous System (CNS) feature associated with this mutation. We further show increased numbers of small intestine myenteric neurons in NL3R451C mice. Although we observed altered sensitivity to GABAA receptor modulators in the colon, there was no change in colonic neuronal numbers including the number of GABA-immunoreactive myenteric neurons. We further identified altered fecal microbial communities in NL3R451C mice. These results suggest that the R451C mutation affects small intestinal and colonic function and alter neuronal numbers in the small intestine as well as impact fecal microbes. Our findings identify a novel GI phenotype associated with the R451C mutation and highlight NL3R451C mice as a useful preclinical model of GI dysfunction in autism. Autism Res 2019, 12: 1043-1056. \u00a9 2019 International Society for Autism Research, Wiley Periodicals, Inc. LAY SUMMARY: People with autism commonly experience gastrointestinal problems, however the cause is unknown. We report gut symptoms in patients with the autism-associated R451C mutation encoding the neuroligin-3 protein. We show that many of the genes implicated in autism are expressed in mouse gut. The neuroligin-3 R451C mutation alters the enteric nervous system, causes gastrointestinal dysfunction, and disrupts gut microbe populations in mice. Gut dysfunction in autism could be due to mutations that affect neuronal communication. ",
        "Alanine Tails Signal Proteolysis in Bacterial Ribosome-Associated Quality Control. In ribosome-associated quality control (RQC), Rqc2/NEMF closely supports the E3 ligase Ltn1/listerin in promoting ubiquitylation and degradation of aberrant nascent-chains obstructing large (60S) ribosomal subunits-products of ribosome stalling during translation. However, while Ltn1 is eukaryote-specific, Rqc2 homologs are also found in bacteria and archaea; whether prokaryotic Rqc2 has an RQC-related function has remained unknown. Here, we show that, as in eukaryotes, a bacterial Rqc2 homolog (RqcH) recognizes obstructed 50S subunits and promotes nascent-chain proteolysis. Unexpectedly, RqcH marks nascent-chains for degradation in a direct manner, by appending C-terminal poly-alanine tails that act as degrons recognized by the ClpXP protease. Furthermore, RqcH acts redundantly with tmRNA/ssrA and protects cells against translational and environmental stresses. Our results uncover a\u00a0proteolytic-tagging mechanism with implications toward the function of related modifications in eukaryotes and suggest that RQC was already active in the last universal common ancestor (LUCA) to help cope with incomplete translation.

        "Therapeutic benefit of combining calorie-restricted ketogenic diet and glutamine targeting in late-stage experimental glioblastoma. Glioblastoma (GBM) is an aggressive primary human brain tumour that has resisted effective therapy for decades. Although glucose and glutamine are the major fuels that drive GBM growth and invasion, few studies have targeted these fuels for therapeutic management. The glutamine antagonist, 6-diazo-5-oxo-L-norleucine (DON), was administered together with a calorically restricted ketogenic diet (KD-R) to treat late-stage orthotopic growth in two syngeneic GBM mouse models: VM-M3 and CT-2A. DON targets glutaminolysis, while the KD-R reduces glucose and, simultaneously, elevates neuroprotective and non-fermentable ketone bodies. The diet/drug therapeutic strategy killed tumour cells while reversing disease symptoms, and improving overall mouse survival. The therapeutic strategy also reduces edema, hemorrhage, and inflammation. Moreover, the KD-R diet facilitated DON delivery to the brain and allowed a lower dosage to achieve therapeutic effect. The findings support the importance of glucose and glutamine in driving GBM growth and provide a therapeutic strategy for non-toxic metabolic management. ",
        "Neuron-Astrocyte Metabolic Coupling Protects against Activity-Induced Fatty Acid Toxicity. Metabolic coordination between neurons and astrocytes is critical for the health of the brain. However, neuron-astrocyte coupling of lipid metabolism, particularly in response to neural activity, remains largely uncharacterized. Here, we demonstrate that toxic fatty acids (FAs) produced in hyperactive neurons are transferred to astrocytic lipid droplets by ApoE-positive lipid particles. Astrocytes consume the FAs stored in lipid droplets via mitochondrial \u03b2-oxidation in response to neuronal activity and turn on a detoxification gene expression program. Our findings reveal that FA metabolism is coupled in neurons and astrocytes to protect neurons from FA toxicity during periods of enhanced activity. This coordinated mechanism for metabolizing FAs could underlie both homeostasis and a variety of disease states of the brain. ",
        "Porphyromonas gingivalis in Alzheimer's disease brains: Evidence for disease causation and treatment with small-molecule inhibitors. Porphyromonas gingivalis, the keystone pathogen in chronic periodontitis, was identified in the brain of Alzheimer's disease patients. Toxic proteases from the bacterium called gingipains were also identified in the brain of Alzheimer's patients, and levels correlated with tau and ubiquitin pathology. Oral P. gingivalis infection in mice resulted in brain colonization and increased production of A\u03b21-42, a component of amyloid plaques. Further, gingipains were neurotoxic in vivo and in vitro, exerting detrimental effects on tau, a protein needed for normal neuronal function. To block this neurotoxicity, we designed and synthesized small-molecule inhibitors targeting gingipains. Gingipain inhibition reduced the bacterial load of an established P. gingivalis brain infection, blocked A\u03b21-42 production, reduced neuroinflammation, and rescued neurons in the hippocampus. These data suggest that gingipain inhibitors could be valuable for treating P. gingivalis brain colonization and neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease. ",
        "Apalutamide for Metastatic, Castration-Sensitive Prostate Cancer. BACKGROUND: Apalutamide is an inhibitor of the ligand-binding domain of the androgen receptor. Whether the addition of apalutamide to androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) would prolong radiographic progression-free survival and overall survival as compared with placebo plus ADT among patients with metastatic, castration-sensitive prostate cancer has not been determined. METHODS: In this double-blind, phase 3 trial, we randomly assigned patients with metastatic, castration-sensitive prostate cancer to receive apalutamide (240 mg per day) or placebo, added to ADT. Previous treatment for localized disease and previous docetaxel therapy were allowed. The primary end points were radiographic progression-free survival and overall survival. RESULTS: A total of 525 patients were assigned to receive apalutamide plus ADT and 527 to receive placebo plus ADT. The median age was 68 years. A total of 16.4% of the patients had undergone prostatectomy or received radiotherapy for localized disease, and 10.7% had received previous docetaxel therapy; 62.7% had high-volume disease, and 37.3% had low-volume disease. At the first interim analysis, with a median of 22.7 months of follow-up, the percentage of patients with radiographic progression-free survival at 24 months was 68.2% in the apalutamide group and 47.5% in the placebo group (hazard ratio for radiographic progression or death, 0.48; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.39 to 0.60; P<0.001). Overall survival at 24 months was also greater with apalutamide than with placebo (82.4% in the apalutamide group vs. 73.5% in the placebo group; hazard ratio for death, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.51 to 0.89; P\u2009=\u20090.005). The frequency of grade 3 or 4 adverse events was 42.2% in the apalutamide group and 40.8% in the placebo group; rash was more common in the apalutamide group. CONCLUSIONS: In this trial involving patients with metastatic, castration-sensitive prostate cancer, overall survival and radiographic progression-free survival were significantly longer with the addition of apalutamide to ADT than with placebo plus ADT, and the side-effect profile did not differ substantially between the two groups.

        "Lithium chloride corrects weakness and myopathology in a preclinical model of LGMD1D. Objective: To understand DNAJB6's function in skeletal muscle and identify therapeutic targets for limb-girdle muscular dystrophy 1D (LGMD1D). Methods: DNAJB6 knockout (KO) myoblasts were generated with Crispr/cas9 technology, and differentially accumulated proteins were identified using stable isotope labeling, followed by quantitative mass spectrometry. Cultured KO myotubes and mouse muscle from DNAJB6b-WT or DNAJB6b-F93L mice were analyzed using histochemistry, immunohistochemistry, and immunoblot. Mouse functional strength measures included forelimb grip strength and inverted wire hang. Results: DNAJB6 inactivation leads to the accumulation of sarcomeric proteins and hypertrophic myotubes with an enhanced fusion index. The increased fusion in DNAJB6 KO myotubes correlates with diminished glycogen synthase kinase-\u03b2 (GSK3\u03b2) activity. In contrast, LGMD1D mutations in DNAJB6 enhance GSK3\u03b2 activation and suppress \u03b2-catenin and NFAT3c signaling. GSK3\u03b2 inhibition with lithium chloride improves muscle size and strength in an LGMD1D preclinical mouse model. Conclusions: Our results suggest that DNAJB6 facilitates protein quality control and negatively regulates myogenic signaling. In addition, LGMD1D-associated DNAJB6 mutations inhibit myogenic signaling through augmented GSK3\u03b2 activity. GSK3\u03b2 inhibition with lithium chloride may be a therapeutic option in LGMD1D. ",
        "Inhibition of microglial activation in rats attenuates paraventricular nucleus inflammation in G\u03b1i2 protein-dependent, salt-sensitive hypertension. NEW FINDINGS: \u2022 What is the central question of this study? We hypothesized that central inflammatory processes that involve activation of microglia and astrocytes contribute to the development of G\u03b1i2 protein-dependent, salt-sensitive hypertension. \u2022 What is the main finding and its importance? The main finding is that PVN-specific inflammatory processes, driven by microglial activation, appear to be linked to the development of G\u03b1i2 protein-dependent, salt-sensitive hypertension in Sprague-Dawley rats. This finding might reveal new mechanistic targets in the treatment of hypertension. ABSTRACT: The\u00a0central mechanisms underlying salt-sensitive hypertension, a significant public health issue, remain to be established. Researchers in our laboratory have reported that hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN) G\u03b1i2 proteins mediate the sympathoinhibitory and normotensive responses to high sodium intake in salt-resistant rats. Given the recent evidence of central inflammation in animal models of hypertension, we hypothesized that PVN inflammation contributes to G\u03b1i2 protein-dependent, salt-sensitive hypertension. Male Sprague-Dawley rats received chronic\u00a0intracerebroventricular infusions of a targeted G\u03b1i2 or control scrambled oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN) and were maintained for 7\u00a0days on a normal-salt (NS; 0.6% NaCl) or high-salt (HS; 4% NaCl) diet; in subgroups on HS, intracerebroventricular minocycline (microglial inhibitor) was co-infused with ODNs. Radiotelemetry was used in subgroups of rats to measure mean arterial pressure (MAP) chronically. In a separate group of rats, plasma noradrenaline, plasma renin activity, urinary angiotensinogen and mRNA levels of the PVN pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6 and the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 were assessed. In additional groups, immunohistochemistry was performed for markers of PVN and subfornical organ microglial activation and cytokine levels and PVN astrocyte activation. High salt intake evoked salt-sensitive hypertension, increased plasma noradrenaline, PVN pro-inflammatory cytokine mRNA upregulation, anti-inflammatory cytokine mRNA downregulation and PVN-specific microglial activation in rats receiving a targeted G\u03b1i2 but not scrambled ODN. Minocycline co-infusion significantly attenuated the increase in MAP and abolished the increase in plasma noradrenaline and inflammation in G\u03b1i2 ODN-infused animals on HS. Our data suggest that central G\u03b1i2 protein prevents microglial-mediated PVN inflammation and the development of salt-sensitive hypertension. ",
        "The Mediterranean Diet and 2-Year Change in Cognitive Function by Status of Type 2 Diabetes and Glycemic Control. OBJECTIVE: To determine associations of a Mediterranean diet score (MeDS) with 2-year change in cognitive function by type 2 diabetes and glycemic control status and contrast it against other diet quality scores. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We used data from the longitudinal Boston Puerto Rican Health Study (n = 913; 42.6% with type 2 diabetes at 2 years). Glycemic control at baseline was categorized as uncontrolled (hemoglobin A1c \u22657% [53 mmol/mol]) versus controlled. Two-year change in glycemic control was defined as stable/improved versus poor/declined. We defined MeDS, Healthy Eating Index, Alternate Healthy Eating Index, and Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension scores. Adjusted mixed linear models assessed 2-year change in global cognitive function z score, executive and memory function, and nine individual cognitive tests. RESULTS: Higher MeDS, but no other diet quality score, was associated with higher 2-year change in global cognitive function in adults with type 2 diabetes (\u03b2 \u00b1 SE = 0.027 \u00b1 0.011; P = 0.016) but not in those without (P = 0.80). Similar results were noted for Mini-Mental State Examination, word recognition, digit span, and clock drawing tests. Results remained consistent for individuals under glycemic control at baseline (0.062 \u00b1 0.020; P = 0.004) and stable/improved over 2 years (0.053 \u00b1 0.019; P = 0.007), but not for individuals with uncontrolled or poor/declined glycemic control. All diet quality scores were associated with higher 2-year memory function in adults without type 2 diabetes. CONCLUSIONS: Both adhering to a Mediterranean diet and effectively managing type 2 diabetes may support optimal cognitive function. Healthy diets, in general, can help improve memory function among adults without type 2 diabetes. ",
        "The Occupational Burden of Nonmalignant Respiratory Diseases. An Official American Thoracic Society and European Respiratory Society Statement. Rationale: Workplace inhalational hazards remain common worldwide, even though they are ameliorable. Previous American Thoracic Society documents have assessed the contribution of workplace exposures to asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease on a population level, but not to other chronic respiratory diseases. The goal of this document is to report an in-depth literature review and data synthesis of the occupational contribution to the burden of the major nonmalignant respiratory diseases, including airway diseases; interstitial fibrosis; hypersensitivity pneumonitis; other noninfectious granulomatous lung diseases, including sarcoidosis; and selected respiratory infections. Methods: Relevant literature was identified for each respiratory condition. The occupational population attributable fraction (PAF) was estimated for those conditions for which there were sufficient population-based studies to allow pooled estimates. For the other conditions, the occupational burden of disease was estimated on the basis of attribution in case series, incidence rate ratios, or attributable fraction within an exposed group. Results: Workplace exposures contribute substantially to the burden of multiple chronic respiratory diseases, including asthma (PAF, 16%); chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (PAF, 14%); chronic bronchitis (PAF, 13%); idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (PAF, 26%); hypersensitivity pneumonitis (occupational burden, 19%); other granulomatous diseases, including sarcoidosis (occupational burden, 30%); pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (occupational burden, 29%); tuberculosis (occupational burden, 2.3% in silica-exposed workers and 1% in healthcare workers); and community-acquired pneumonia in working-age adults (PAF, 10%). Conclusions: Workplace exposures contribute to the burden of disease across a range of nonmalignant lung conditions in adults (in addition to the 100% burden for the classic occupational pneumoconioses). This burden has important clinical, research, and policy implications. There is a pressing need to improve clinical recognition and public health awareness of the contribution of occupational factors across a range of nonmalignant respiratory diseases. ",
        "Characteristics, Prevention, and Management of Cardiovascular Disease in People Living With HIV: A Scientific Statement From the American Heart Association. As early and effective antiretroviral therapy has become more widespread, HIV has transitioned from a progressive, fatal disease to a chronic, manageable disease marked by elevated risk of chronic comorbid diseases, including cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). Rates of myocardial infarction, heart failure, stroke, and other CVD manifestations, including pulmonary hypertension and sudden cardiac death, are significantly higher for people living with HIV than for uninfected control subjects, even in the setting of HIV viral suppression with effective antiretroviral therapy. These elevated risks generally persist after demographic and clinical risk factors are accounted for and may be partly attributed to chronic inflammation and immune dysregulation. Data on long-term CVD outcomes in HIV are limited by the relatively recent epidemiological transition of HIV to a chronic disease. Therefore, our understanding of CVD pathogenesis, prevention, and treatment in HIV relies on large observational studies, randomized controlled trials of HIV therapies that are underpowered to detect CVD end points, and small interventional studies examining surrogate CVD end points. The purpose of this document is to provide a thorough review of the existing evidence on HIV-associated CVD, in particular atherosclerotic CVD (including myocardial infarction and stroke) and heart failure, as well as pragmatic recommendations on how to approach CVD prevention and treatment in HIV in the absence of large-scale randomized controlled trial data. This statement is intended for clinicians caring for people with HIV, individuals living with HIV, and clinical and translational researchers interested in HIV-associated CVD. ",
        "High-Resolution Protein 3D Structure Determination in Living Eukaryotic Cells. Proteins in living cells interact specifically or nonspecifically with an enormous number of biomolecules. To understand the behavior of proteins under intracellular crowding conditions, it is indispensable to observe their three-dimensional (3D) structures at the atomic level in a physiologically natural environment. We demonstrate the first de\u2005novo protein structure determinations in eukaryotes with the sf9 cell/baculovirus system using NMR data from living cells exclusively. The method was applied to five proteins, rat calmodulin, human HRas, human ubiquitin, T. thermophilus HB8 TTHA1718, and Streptococcus protein G B1 domain. In all cases, we could obtain structural information from well-resolved in-cell 3D nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy (NOESY) data, suggesting that our method can be a standard tool for protein structure determinations in living eukaryotic cells. For three proteins, we achieved well-converged 3D structures. Among these, the in-cell structure of protein G B1 domain was most accurately determined, demonstrating that a helix-loop region is tilted away from a \u03b2-sheet compared to the conformation in diluted solution.

        "Injuries and concussions among young children, ages 5-11, playing sports in recreational leagues in Florida. BACKGROUND: The specific research aims of this study included: 1) Conduct an epidemiologic analysis of recreational sports injuries among 1500 children, ages 5-11 in Florida: and 2) Utilize the computerized pediatric concussion tool from ImPACT Applications, Inc. for baseline and follow-up testing to better understand these injuries. This research followed a prospective surveillance design utilizing a large cohort of children, ages, 5-11, who play recreational football, soccer, and baseball/softball in Florida. The study venue was a large athletic facility in Hillsborough County, Florida. The sports observed were soccer (girls' and boys'), baseball, softball, and football. Internal and external advisory boards were consulted throughout the study. METHODS: Certified Athletic Trainers (ATCs) were hired to use High School Reporting Information Online (RIO) for injuries and the Ipad-administered pediatric concussion tool developed by ImPACT Applications, Inc for baseline/follow-up concussion data. RESULTS: Over the course of the project, 26 RIO-reported injuries were reported. Football and soccer produced the greatest rate of injuries. There were 12 concussions which comprised nearly half of all the RIO injuries (46%). We conducted 882 baseline concussion tests and 13 follow-up tests over the 2 years. CONCLUSIONS: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time data have been collected and reported on sports injuries in the study population. Future studies built on these findings will allow for the development of targeted guidelines and interventions for coaches, players, and parents so sports injury-related morbidity and mortality decrease in our youngest athletes.

        "Immune myopathy with large histiocyte-related myofiber necrosis. OBJECTIVE: To describe the features of a new, pathologically distinctive, acquired myopathy with an unusual pattern of scattered necrotic muscle fibers that are neighbored, surrounded, or invaded, by large, often multinucleated, histiocytic cells. METHODS: Retrospective review of records and muscle pathology of 4 patients. RESULTS: Clinical features common to our patients included muscle pain and proximal, symmetric, moderate to severe, weakness in the arms and legs progressing over 1-4 weeks. Patients had other associated systemic disorders, including anemia in all, and hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, hepatic disease, Raynaud phenomenon, metastatic cancer, and cardiomyopathy, in 1 patient each. Serum creatine kinase (CK) levels at presentation were very high, ranging from 10,000 to 102,000 U/L. Three patients improved within 3 months after treatment. Muscle pathology included scattered necrotic muscle fibers with cytoplasm that stained for C5b-9 complement, especially around fiber peripheries, pale on nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide and often dark on hematoxylin & eosin. Large, often multinucleated, cells with features of histiocytes, including anatomical features on electron microscopy and immunostaining for major histocompatibility complex Class I and histiocyte markers (HAM56, CD68, CD163, and S100), were usually closely apposed to the surface of, or invaded, necrotic myofibers. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with large-histiocyte-associated myopathy (LHIM) had a subacute onset of proximal predominant weakness, associated systemic disorders, very high serum CK, and a pathologically distinctive pattern of large histiocyte-associated muscle fiber necrosis. LHIM may be caused by an autoimmune, histiocyte-mediated attack directed against muscle fibers. ",
        "Bromodomain and extraterminal proteins foster the core transcriptional regulatory programs and confer vulnerability in liposarcoma. Liposarcomas (LPSs) are a group of malignant mesenchymal tumors showing adipocytic differentiation. Here, to gain insight into the enhancer dysregulation and transcriptional addiction in this disease, we chart super-enhancer structures in both LPS tissues and cell lines. We identify a bromodomain and extraterminal (BET) protein-cooperated FUS-DDIT3 function in myxoid LPS and a BET protein-dependent core transcriptional regulatory circuitry consisting of FOSL2, MYC, and RUNX1 in de-differentiated LPS. Additionally, SNAI2 is identified as a crucial downstream target that enforces both proliferative and metastatic potentials to de-differentiated LPS cells. Genetic depletion of BET genes, core transcriptional factors, or SNAI2 mitigates consistently LPS malignancy. We also reveal a compelling susceptibility of LPS cells to BET protein degrader ARV-825. BET protein depletion confers additional advantages to circumvent acquired resistance to Trabectedin, a chemotherapy drug for LPS. Moreover, this study provides a framework for discovering and targeting of core oncogenic transcriptional programs in human cancers. ",
        "How do breast cancer surgery scars impact survivorship? Findings from a nationwide survey in the United States. BACKGROUND: The surgical treatment of breast cancer has been associated with negative consequences for patients' body image, sexual functioning, mental health, and social adjustment. Recent advances in the surgical approach to breast cancer allow the oncologic surgeon to safely optimize cosmetic outcomes. Little is known about the possible relevance of surgical scars. The aim of this research was to gather the perspective of breast cancer survivors themselves on the issue of surgical scars and their negative impact on survivorship. METHODS: An internet survey was conducted nationwide in the United States among women who reported being surgically treated by lumpectomy, mastectomy, or both procedures for breast cancer. To improve generalizability, census-based enrollment quotas were applied for geographic region, health insurance, and income. RESULTS: The five hundred respondents reported lumpectomy only (n\u2009=\u2009215), mastectomy only (n\u2009=\u2009140), or both surgeries (n\u2009=\u2009132). In response to the statement, \"I do not like the location of my surgical scar\", 64% of lumpectomy-only respondents and 67% of mastectomy-only respondents agreed somewhat or strongly. Only 26% of lumpectomy respondents and 14% of mastectomy respondents reported minimal or no negative impact as a consequence of the surgical scars. CONCLUSION: Consistent with previous literature, this nationwide US survey shows that the majority of women feel negatively affected by their breast cancer surgery scars. Surgeons should consider this outcome when planning surgery, which may improve patients' survivorship journey. ",
        "Associations of Dietary Cholesterol or Egg Consumption With Incident Cardiovascular Disease and Mortality. Importance: Cholesterol is a common nutrient in the human diet and eggs are a major source of dietary cholesterol. Whether dietary cholesterol or egg consumption is associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD) and mortality remains controversial. Objective: To determine the associations of dietary cholesterol or egg consumption with incident CVD and all-cause mortality. Design, Setting, and Participants: Individual participant data were pooled from 6 prospective US cohorts using data collected between March 25, 1985, and August 31, 2016. Self-reported diet data were harmonized using a standardized protocol. Exposures: Dietary cholesterol (mg/day) or egg consumption (number/day). Main Outcomes and Measures: Hazard ratio (HR) and absolute risk difference (ARD) over the entire follow-up for incident CVD (composite of fatal and nonfatal coronary heart disease, stroke, heart failure, and other CVD deaths) and all-cause mortality, adjusting for demographic, socioeconomic, and behavioral factors. Results: This analysis included 29\u202f615 participants (mean [SD] age, 51.6 [13.5] years at baseline) of whom 13\u202f299 (44.9%) were men and 9204 (31.1%) were black. During a median follow-up of 17.5 years (interquartile range, 13.0-21.7; maximum, 31.3), there were 5400 incident CVD events and 6132 all-cause deaths. The associations of dietary cholesterol or egg consumption with incident CVD and all-cause mortality were monotonic (all P values for nonlinear terms, .19-.83). Each additional 300 mg of dietary cholesterol consumed per day was significantly associated with higher risk of incident CVD (adjusted HR, 1.17 [95% CI, 1.09-1.26]; adjusted ARD, 3.24% [95% CI, 1.39%-5.08%]) and all-cause mortality (adjusted HR, 1.18 [95% CI, 1.10-1.26]; adjusted ARD, 4.43% [95% CI, 2.51%-6.36%]). Each additional half an egg consumed per day was significantly associated with higher risk of incident CVD (adjusted HR, 1.06 [95% CI, 1.03-1.10]; adjusted ARD, 1.11% [95% CI, 0.32%-1.89%]) and all-cause mortality (adjusted HR, 1.08 [95% CI, 1.04-1.11]; adjusted ARD, 1.93% [95% CI, 1.10%-2.76%]). The associations between egg consumption and incident CVD (adjusted HR, 0.99 [95% CI, 0.93-1.05]; adjusted ARD, -0.47% [95% CI, -1.83% to 0.88%]) and all-cause mortality (adjusted HR, 1.03 [95% CI, 0.97-1.09]; adjusted ARD, 0.71% [95% CI, -0.85% to 2.28%]) were no longer significant after adjusting for dietary cholesterol consumption. Conclusions and Relevance: Among US adults, higher consumption of dietary cholesterol or eggs was significantly associated with higher risk of incident CVD and all-cause mortality in a dose-response manner. These results should be considered in the development of dietary guidelines and updates. ",
        "Metformin Promotes Anxiolytic and Antidepressant-Like Responses in Insulin-Resistant Mice by Decreasing Circulating Branched-Chain Amino Acids. Epidemiological studies indicate that insulin resistance (IR), a hallmark of type 2 diabetes, is associated with an increased risk of major depression. Here, we demonstrated that male mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD) exhibited peripheral metabolic impairments reminiscent of IR accompanied by elevated circulating levels of branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs), whereas both parameters were normalized by chronic treatment with metformin (Met). Given the role of BCAAs in the regulation of tryptophan influx into the brain, we then explored the activity of the serotonin (5-HT) system. Our results indicated that HFD-fed mice displayed impairment in the electrical activity of dorsal raphe 5-HT neurons, attenuated hippocampal extracellular 5-HT concentrations and anxiety, one of the most visible and early symptoms of depression. On the contrary, Met stimulated 5-HT neurons excitability and 5-HT neurotransmission while hindering HFD-induced anxiety. Met also promoted antidepressant-like activities as observed with fluoxetine. In light of these data, we designed a modified HFD in which BCAA dietary supply was reduced by half. Deficiency in BCAAs failed to reverse HFD-induced metabolic impairments while producing antidepressant-like activity and enhancing the behavioral response to fluoxetine. Our results suggest that Met may act by decreasing circulating BCAAs levels to favor serotonergic neurotransmission in the hippocampus and promote antidepressant-like effects in mice fed an HFD. These findings also lead us to envision that a diet poor in BCAAs, provided either alone or as add-on therapy to conventional antidepressant drugs, could help to relieve depressive symptoms in patients with metabolic comorbidities.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Insulin resistance in humans is associated with increased risk of anxiodepressive disorders. Such a relationship has been also found in rodents fed a high-fat diet (HFD). To determine whether insulin-sensitizing strategies induce anxiolytic- and/or antidepressant-like activities and to investigate the underlying mechanisms, we tested the effects of metformin, an oral antidiabetic drug, in mice fed an HFD. Metformin reduced levels of circulating branched-chain amino acids, which regulate tryptophan uptake within the brain. Moreover, metformin increased hippocampal serotonergic neurotransmission while promoting anxiolytic- and antidepressant-like effects. Moreover, a diet poor in these amino acids produced similar beneficial behavioral property. Collectively, these results suggest that metformin could be used as add-on therapy to a conventional antidepressant for the comorbidity between metabolic and mental disorders. ",
        "TFPa/HADHA is required for fatty acid beta-oxidation and cardiolipin re-modeling in human cardiomyocytes. Mitochondrial trifunctional protein deficiency, due to mutations in hydratase subunit A (HADHA), results in sudden infant death syndrome with no cure.\u00a0To reveal the disease etiology, we generated stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes from HADHA-deficient hiPSCs and accelerated their maturation via an engineered microRNA maturation cocktail that upregulated the epigenetic regulator, HOPX.\u00a0 Here we report, matured HADHA mutant cardiomyocytes treated with an endogenous mixture of fatty acids manifest the disease phenotype: defective calcium dynamics and repolarization kinetics which results in a pro-arrhythmic state. Single cell RNA-seq reveals a cardiomyocyte developmental intermediate, based on metabolic gene expression. This intermediate gives rise to mature-like cardiomyocytes in control cells but, mutant cells transition to a pathological state with reduced fatty acid beta-oxidation, reduced mitochondrial proton gradient, disrupted cristae structure and defective cardiolipin remodeling. This study reveals that HADHA (tri-functional protein alpha), a monolysocardiolipin acyltransferase-like enzyme, is required for fatty acid beta-oxidation and cardiolipin remodeling, essential for functional mitochondria in human cardiomyocytes.

        "From Wood to Tetrahydro-2-benzazepines in Three Waste-Free Steps: Modular Synthesis of Biologically Active Lignin-Derived Scaffolds. Inherently complex, lignin-derived aromatic monomers comprising valuable structural moieties present in many pharmaceuticals would serve as ideal substrates for the construction of biologically active molecules. Here, we describe a strategy that incorporates all intrinsic functional groups present in platform chemicals obtained by lignin depolymerization into value-added amines, using sustainable catalytic methods and benign solvents. Our strikingly efficient protocol provides access to libraries of aminoalkyl-phenol derivatives and seven-membered N-heterocycles directly from wood in two, respectively three, waste-free steps. Several molecules in these libraries have shown promising antibacterial or anticancer activities, emphasizing the advantage of this modular synthetic strategy and the potential for drug discovery. The sustainable catalytic pathways presented here can lead to significant benefits for the pharmaceutical industry where reduction of hazardous waste is a prime concern, and the described strategies that lead to high-value products from non-edible biomass waste streams also markedly increase the economic feasibility of lignocellulosic biorefineries.

        "Genetic diversity of CHC22 clathrin impacts its function in glucose metabolism. CHC22 clathrin plays a key role in intracellular membrane traffic of the insulin-responsive glucose transporter GLUT4 in humans. We performed population genetic and phylogenetic analyses of the CHC22-encoding CLTCL1 gene, revealing independent gene loss in at least two vertebrate lineages, after arising from gene duplication. All vertebrates retained the paralogous CLTC gene encoding CHC17 clathrin, which mediates endocytosis. For vertebrates retaining CLTCL1, strong evidence for purifying selection supports CHC22 functionality. All human populations maintained two high frequency CLTCL1 allelic variants, encoding either methionine or valine at position 1316. Functional studies indicated that CHC22-V1316, which is more frequent in farming populations than in hunter-gatherers, has different cellular dynamics than M1316-CHC22 and is less effective at controlling GLUT4 membrane traffic, altering its insulin-regulated response. These analyses suggest that ancestral human dietary change influenced selection of allotypes that affect CHC22's role in metabolism and have potential to differentially influence the human insulin response.

        "Effect of a Home-Based Exercise Program on Subsequent Falls Among Community-Dwelling High-Risk Older Adults After a Fall: A Randomized Clinical Trial. Importance: Whether exercise reduces subsequent falls in high-risk older adults who have already experienced a fall is unknown. Objective: To assess the effect of a home-based exercise program as a fall prevention strategy in older adults who were referred to a fall prevention clinic after an index fall. Design, Setting, and Participants: A 12-month, single-blind, randomized clinical trial conducted from April 22, 2009, to June 5, 2018, among adults aged at least 70 years who had a fall within the past 12 months and were recruited from a fall prevention clinic. Interventions: Participants were randomized to receive usual care plus a home-based strength and balance retraining exercise program delivered by a physical therapist (intervention group; n\u2009=\u2009173) or usual care, consisting of fall prevention care provided by a geriatrician (usual care group; n\u2009=\u2009172). Both were provided for 12 months. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was self-reported number of falls over 12 months. Adverse event data were collected in the exercise group only and consisted of falls, injuries, or muscle soreness related to the exercise intervention. Results: Among 345 randomized patients (mean age, 81.6 [SD, 6.1] years; 67% women), 296 (86%) completed the trial. During a mean follow-up of 338 (SD, 81) days, a total of 236 falls occurred among 172 participants in the exercise group vs 366 falls among 172 participants in the usual care group. Estimated incidence rates of falls per person-year were 1.4 (95% CI, 0.1-2.0) vs 2.1 (95% CI, 0.1-3.2), respectively. The absolute difference in fall incidence was 0.74 (95% CI, 0.04-1.78; P\u2009=\u2009.006) falls per person-year and the incident rate ratio was 0.64 (95% CI, 0.46-0.90; P\u2009=\u2009.009). No adverse events related to the intervention were reported. Conclusions and Relevance: Among older adults receiving care at a fall prevention clinic after a fall, a home-based strength and balance retraining exercise program significantly reduced the rate of subsequent falls compared with usual care provided by a geriatrician. These findings support the use of this home-based exercise program for secondary fall prevention but require replication in other clinical settings.

        "Use of PROMIS-29\u00ae in US Veterans: Diagnostic Concordance and Domain Comparisons with the General Population. BACKGROUND: PROMIS\u00ae items have not been widely or systematically used within the Veterans Health Administration (VA). OBJECTIVE: To examine the concordance of PROMIS-29\u00ae scores and medical record diagnosis in US Veterans and to compare Veteran scores relative to US population norms. DESIGN/PARTICIPANTS: Cross-sectional multi-site survey of Veterans (n\u2009=\u20093221) provided sociodemographic and PROMIS-29\u00ae domain data. Electronic medical records provided health condition (depression, anxiety, sleep disorders, pain disorders) diagnosis data. MAIN MEASURES: For each domain, we calculated PROMIS\u00ae standardized T scores and used t tests to compare PROMIS\u00ae scores for Veterans diagnosed with each targeted health condition vs. those without that documented clinical diagnosis and compare mean Veterans' PROMIS-29\u00ae with US adult population norms. KEY RESULTS: Veterans with (vs. without) a depression diagnosis reported significantly higher PROMIS\u00ae depression scores (60.3 vs. 49.6, p\u2009<\u2009.0001); those with an anxiety diagnosis (vs. without) reported higher average PROMIS\u00ae anxiety scores (62.7 vs. 50.9, p\u2009<\u2009.0001). Veterans with (vs. without) a pain disorder reported higher pain interference (65.3 vs. 57.7, p\u2009<\u2009.0001) and pain intensity (6.4 vs. 4.4, p\u2009<\u2009.0001). Veterans with (vs. without) a sleep disorder reported higher sleep disturbance (55.8 vs. 51.2, p\u2009<\u2009.0001) and fatigue (57.5 vs. 51.8, p\u2009<\u2009.0001) PROMIS\u00ae scores. Compared with the general population norms, Veterans scored worse across all PROMIS-29\u00ae domains. CONCLUSIONS: We found that PROMIS-29\u00ae domains are selectively sensitive to expected differences between clinically-defined groups, suggesting their appropriateness as indicators of condition symptomology among Veterans. Notably, Veterans scored worse across all PROMIS-29(R) domains compared with population norms. Taken collectively, our findings suggest that PROMIS-29\u00ae may be a useful tool for VA providers to assess patient's physical and mental health, and because PROMIS\u00ae items are normed to the general population, this offers a way to compare the health of Veterans with the adult population at large and identify disparate areas for intervention.

        "Interethnic differences in pancreatic cancer incidence and risk factors: The Multiethnic Cohort. While disparity in pancreatic cancer incidence between blacks and whites has been observed, few studies have examined disparity in other ethnic minorities. We evaluated variations in pancreatic cancer incidence and assessed the extent to which known risk factors account for differences in pancreatic cancer risk among African Americans, Native Hawaiians, Japanese Americans, Latino Americans, and European Americans in the Multiethnic Cohort Study. Risk factor data were obtained from the baseline questionnaire. Cox regression was used to estimate the relative risks (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for pancreatic cancer associated with risk factors and ethnicity. During an average 16.9-year follow-up, 1,532 incident pancreatic cancer cases were identified among 184,559 at-risk participants. Family history of pancreatic cancer (RR 1.97, 95% CI 1.50-2.58), diabetes (RR 1.32, 95% CI 1.14-1.54), body mass index \u226530\u00a0kg/m2 (RR 1.25, 95% CI 1.08-1.46), current smoking (<20 pack-years RR 1.43, 95% CI 1.19-1.73; \u226520 pack-years RR 1.76, 95% CI 1.46-2.12), and red meat intake (RR 1.17, 95% CI 1.00-1.36) were associated with pancreatic cancer. After adjustment for these risk factors, Native Hawaiians (RR 1.60, 95% CI 1.30-1.98), Japanese Americans (RR 1.33, 95% CI 1.15-1.54), and African Americans (RR 1.20, 95% CI 1.01-1.42), but not Latino Americans (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.76-1.07), had a higher risk of pancreatic cancer compared to European Americans. Interethnic differences in pancreatic cancer risk are not fully explained by differences in the distribution of known risk factors. The greater risks in Native Hawaiians and Japanese Americans are new findings and elucidating the causes of these high rates may improve our understanding and prevention of pancreatic cancer. ",
        "Employee Experiences with a Newly Adopted Paid Parental Leave Policy: Equity Considerations for Policy Implementation. Purpose: Paid parental leave (PPL) policies offer immense opportunity to enhance health equity by providing financial stability to workers and promoting the health of families in the United States. Working in partnership with a local county government, which recently adopted a paid leave policy, we engaged in a qualitative substudy to enhance our understanding of how workers perceived and experienced the policy across levels of the socioecological framework. Methods: Working in partnership with Multnomah County, a large public-sector employer in Portland, OR that recently adopted a PPL policy, we collected qualitative data through focus groups with employees. Data were transcribed, coded, and analyzed thematically. Results: We conducted seven focus groups with county employees (N=35) in the fall of 2017. Three major themes emerged from the focus group data: intersectional inequities, disparities by department, and uneven benefits. Conclusions: Our findings highlight the inequities of experience with the PPL policy across employees at individual, organization, and environmental levels. These findings offer insight and guidance for entities considering the adoption and implementation of such policies to consider concrete steps to enhance equity of access and experience. ",
        "Single-cell transcriptomics unveils gene regulatory network plasticity. BACKGROUND: Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) plays a pivotal role in our understanding of cellular heterogeneity. Current analytical workflows are driven by categorizing principles that consider cells as individual entities and classify them into complex taxonomies. RESULTS: We devise a conceptually different computational framework based on a holistic view, where single-cell datasets are used to infer global, large-scale regulatory networks. We develop correlation metrics that are specifically tailored to single-cell data, and then generate, validate, and interpret single-cell-derived regulatory networks from organs and perturbed systems, such as diabetes and Alzheimer's disease. Using tools from graph theory, we compute an unbiased quantification of a gene's biological relevance and accurately pinpoint key players in organ function and drivers of diseases. CONCLUSIONS: Our approach detects multiple latent regulatory changes that are invisible to single-cell workflows based on clustering or differential expression analysis, significantly broadening the biological insights that can be obtained with this leading technology.

        "Associations Between Objective Sleep and Ambulatory Blood Pressure in a Community Sample. OBJECTIVE: Epidemiologic data increasingly support sleep as a determinant of cardiovascular disease risk. Fewer studies have investigated the mechanisms underlying this relationship using objective sleep assessment approaches. Therefore, the aim of this study was to examine associations between daily blood pressure (BP) and both objectively assessed sleep duration and efficiency. METHODS: A diverse community sample of 300 men and women aged 21 to 70 years, enrolled in the North Texas Heart Study, participated in the study. Actigraphy-assessed sleep was monitored for two consecutive nights with ambulatory BP sampled randomly within 45-minute blocks on the first and second day as well as the second night. RESULTS: Overall, sleep duration results paralleled those of sleep efficiency. Individuals with lower sleep efficiency had higher daytime systolic (B = -0.35, SE = 0.11, p = .0018, R = 0.26) but not diastolic BP (B = -0.043, SE = 0.068, p = .52, R = 0.17) and higher nighttime BP (systolic: B = -0.37, SE = 0.10, p < .001, R = .15; diastolic: B = -0.20, SE = 0.059, p < .001, R = .14). Moreover, lower sleep efficiency on one night was associated with higher systolic (B = -0.51, SE = 0.11, p < .001, R = 0.23) and diastolic BP (B = -0.17, SE = 0.065, p = .012, R = .16) the following day. When 'asleep' BP was taken into account instead of nighttime BP, the associations between sleep and BP disappeared. When both sleep duration and efficiency were assessed together, sleep efficiency was associated with daytime systolic BP, whereas sleep duration was associated with nighttime BP. CONCLUSIONS: Lower sleep duration and efficiency are associated with higher daytime systolic BP and higher nighttime BP when assessed separately. When assessed together, sleep duration and efficiency diverge in their associations with BP at different times of day. These results warrant further investigation of these possible pathways to disease. ",
        "PD-L1 detection using 89Zr-atezolizumab immuno-PET in renal cell carcinoma tumorgrafts from a patient with favorable nivolumab response. BACKGROUND: Programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression in metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC) correlates with a worse prognosis, but whether it also predicts responsiveness to anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy remains unclear. Most studies of PD-L1 are limited by evaluation in primary rather than metastatic sites, and in biopsy samples, which may not be representative. These limitations may be overcome with immuno-positron emission tomography (iPET), an emerging tool allowing the detection of cell surface proteins with radiolabeled antibodies. Here, we report iPET studies of PD-L1 in a preclinical tumorgraft model of clear cell RCC (ccRCC) from a patient who had a favorable response to anti-PD-1 therapy. CASE PRESENTATION: A 49-year-old man underwent a cytoreductive nephrectomy in 2017 of a right kidney tumor invading into the adrenal gland that was metastatic to the lungs and a rib. Histological analyses revealed a ccRCC of ISUP grade 4 with extensive sarcomatoid features. IMDC risk group was poor. Within two hours of surgery, a tumor sample was implanted orthotopically into NOD/SCID mice. Consistent with an aggressive tumor, a renal mass was detected 18\u2009days post-implantation. Histologically, the tumorgraft showed sarcomatoid differentiation and high levels of PD-L1, similar to the patient's tumor. PD-L1 was evaluated in subsequently transplanted mice using iPET and the results were compared to control mice implanted with a PD-L1-negative tumor. We labeled atezolizumab, an anti-PD-L1 antibody with a mutant Fc, with zirconium-89. iPET revealed significantly higher 89Zr-atezolizumab uptake in index than control tumorgrafts. The patient was treated with high-dose IL2 initially, and subsequently with pazopanib, with rapidly progressive disease, but had a durable response with nivolumab. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first report of non-invasive detection of PD-L1 in renal cancer using molecular imaging. This study supports clinical evaluation of iPET to identify RCC patients with tumors deploying the PD-L1 checkpoint pathway who may be most likely to benefit from PD-1/PD-L1 disrupting drugs. ",
        "Distinct Surface Expression of Activating Receptor Ly49H Drives Differential Expansion of NK Cell Clones upon Murine Cytomegalovirus Infection. Natural killer (NK) cells show some features of adaptive immunity but have not been studied at the clonal level. Here, we used retrogenic color-barcoding and single-cell adoptive transfers to track clonal immune responses to murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) infection, derived from individual NK cells expressing activating receptor Ly49H. Clonal expansion of single NK cells varied substantially, and this variation could not be attributed to the additional presence or absence of inhibitory Ly49 receptors. Instead, single-cell-derived variability correlated with distinct surface expression levels of Ly49H itself. Ly49Hhi NK cell clones maintained higher Ly49H expression and expanded more than their Ly49Hlo counterparts in response to MCMV. Thus, akin to adaptive processes shaping an antigen-specific T\u00a0cell receptor (TCR) repertoire, the Ly49H+ NK cell population adapts to MCMV infection. This process relies on the clonal maintenance of distinct Ly49H expression levels, generating a repertoire of individual NK cells outfitted with distinct reactivity to MCMV. ",
        "Synthetic Lugdunin Analogues Reveal Essential Structural Motifs for Antimicrobial Action and Proton Translocation Capability. Lugdunin, a novel thiazolidine cyclopeptide, exhibits micromolar activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). For structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies, synthetic analogues obtained from alanine and stereo scanning as well as peptides with modified thiazolidine rings were tested for antimicrobial activity. The thiazolidine ring and the alternating d- and l-amino acid backbone are essential. Notably, the non-natural enantiomer displays equal activity, thus indicating the absence of a chiral target. The antibacterial activity strongly correlates with dissipation of the membrane potential in S.\u2005aureus. Lugdunin equalizes pH gradients in artificial membrane vesicles, thereby maintaining membrane integrity, which demonstrates that proton translocation is the mode of action (MoA). The incorporation of extra tryptophan or propargyl moieties further expands the diversity of this class of thiazolidine cyclopeptides. ",

During heart regeneration in the zebrafish, fibrotic tissue is replaced by newly formed cardiomyocytes derived from preexisting ones. It is unclear whether the heart is composed of several cardiomyocyte populations bearing different capacity to replace lost myocardium. Here, using sox10 genetic fate mapping, we identify a subset of preexistent cardiomyocytes in the adult zebrafish heart with a distinct gene expression profile that expanded after cryoinjury. Genetic ablation of sox10+ cardiomyocytes impairs cardiac regeneration, revealing that these cells play a role in heart regeneration. ",
        "Chemical disarming of isoniazid resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) killed more people in 2017 than any other single infectious agent. This dangerous pathogen is able to withstand stresses imposed by the immune system and tolerate exposure to antibiotics, resulting in persistent infection. The global tuberculosis (TB) epidemic has been exacerbated by the emergence of mutant strains of Mtb that are resistant to frontline antibiotics. Thus, both phenotypic drug tolerance and genetic drug resistance are major obstacles to successful TB therapy. Using a chemical approach to identify compounds that block stress and drug tolerance, as opposed to traditional screens for compounds that kill Mtb, we identified a small molecule, C10, that blocks tolerance to oxidative stress, acid stress, and the frontline antibiotic isoniazid (INH). In addition, we found that C10 prevents the selection for INH-resistant mutants and restores INH sensitivity in otherwise INH-resistant Mtb strains harboring mutations in the katG gene, which encodes the enzyme that converts the prodrug INH to its active form. Through mechanistic studies, we discovered that C10 inhibits Mtb respiration, revealing a link between respiration homeostasis and INH sensitivity. Therefore, by using C10 to dissect Mtb persistence, we discovered that INH resistance is not absolute and can be reversed. ",
        "Immediate improvement of speech-in-noise perception through multisensory stimulation via an auditory to tactile sensory substitution. BACKGROUND: Hearing loss is becoming a real social and health problem. Its prevalence in the elderly is an epidemic. The risk of developing hearing loss is also growing among younger people. If left untreated, hearing loss can perpetuate development of neurodegenerative diseases, including dementia. Despite recent advancements in hearing aid (HA) and cochlear implant (CI) technologies, hearing impaired users still encounter significant practical and social challenges, with or without aids. In particular, they all struggle with understanding speech in challenging acoustic environments, especially in presence of a competing speaker. OBJECTIVES: In the current proof-of-concept study we tested whether multisensory stimulation, pairing audition and a minimal-size touch device would improve intelligibility of speech in noise. METHODS: To this aim we developed an audio-to-tactile sensory substitution device (SSD) transforming low-frequency speech signals into tactile vibrations delivered on two finger tips. Based on the inverse effectiveness law, i.e., multisensory enhancement is strongest when signal-to-noise ratio is lowest between senses, we embedded non-native language stimuli in speech-like noise and paired it with a low-frequency input conveyed through touch. RESULTS: We found immediate and robust improvement in speech recognition (i.e. in the Signal-To-Noise-ratio) in the multisensory condition without any training, at a group level as well as in every participant. The reported improvement at the group-level of 6\u200adB was indeed major considering that an increase of 10\u200adB represents a doubling of the perceived loudness. CONCLUSIONS: These results are especially relevant when compared to previous SSD studies showing effects in behavior only after a demanding cognitive training. We discuss the implications of our results for development of SSDs and of specific rehabilitation programs for the hearing impaired either using or not using HAs or CIs. We also discuss the potential application of such a set-up for sense augmentation, such as when learning a new language. ",
        "The Fertilized Anterior Cruciate Ligament: An All-Inside Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction Augmented With Amnion, Bone Marrow Concentrate, and a Suture Tape. There is increasing research and interest surrounding biologics and sports medicine. Amnion has the potential to decrease adhesions and possibly protect anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) grafts along with increasing vascularization by acting as a scaffold. Bone marrow concentrate containing mesenchymal stem cells combined with Allosync Pure (Arthrex, Naples, FL) injected into ACL tunnels has the potential to increase the speed and quality of graft bone incorporation, especially when used in the setting of a soft-tissue allograft. Using suture tape augmentation (InternalBrace; Arthrex) with the reconstruction has been thought to increase the early strength of the reconstruction. In this article, we combine all 3 techniques into an all-inside ACL reconstruction that has great potential for an earlier return to play and advanced rehabilitation. ",
        "Analysis of the utility of early MRI/MRA in 400 patients with spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage. OBJECTIVEMRI and MRA studies are routinely obtained to identify the etiology of intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). The diagnostic yield of MRI/MRA in the setting of an acute ICH, however, remains unclear. The authors' goal was to determine the utility of early MRI/MRA in detecting underlying structural lesions in ICH and to identify patients in whom additional imaging during hospitalization could safely be foregone.METHODSThe authors reviewed data obtained in 400 patients with spontaneous ICH diagnosed on noncontrast head CT scans who underwent MRI/MRA between 2015 and 2017 at their institution. MRI/MRA studies were reviewed to identify underlying lesions, such as arteriovenous malformations, aneurysms, cavernous malformations, arteriovenous fistulas, tumors, sinus thrombosis, moyamoya disease, and abscesses.RESULTSThe median patient age was 65 \u00b1 15.8 years. Hypertension was the most common (72%) comorbidity. Structural abnormalities were detected on MRI/MRA in 12.5% of patients. Structural lesions were seen in 5.7% of patients with basal ganglia/thalamic ICH, 14.1% of those with lobar ICH, 20.4% of those with cerebellar ICH, and 27.8% of those with brainstem ICH. Notably, the diagnostic yield of MRI/MRA was 0% in patients > 65 years with a basal ganglia/thalamic hemorrhage and 0% in those > 85 years with any ICH location, whereas it was 37% in patients < 50 years and 23% in those < 65 years. Multivariate analysis showed that decreasing age, absence of hypertension, and non-basal ganglia/thalamic location were predictors of finding an underlying lesion.CONCLUSIONSThe yield of MRI/MRA in ICH is highly variable, depending on patient age and hemorrhage location. The findings of this study do not support obtaining early MRI/MRA studies in patients \u2265 65 years with basal ganglia/thalamic ICH or in any ICH patients \u2265 85 years. In all other situations, early MRI/MRA remains valuable in ruling out underlying lesions. ",
        "Novel correlates of protection against pandemic H1N1 influenza A virus infection. Influenza viruses remain a severe threat to human health, causing up to 650,000 deaths annually1,2. Seasonal influenza virus vaccines can prevent infection, but are rendered ineffective by antigenic drift. To provide improved protection from infection, novel influenza virus vaccines that target the conserved epitopes of influenza viruses, specifically those in the hemagglutinin stalk and neuraminidase, are currently being developed3. Antibodies against the hemagglutinin stalk confer protection in animal studies4-6. However, no data exist on natural infections in humans, and these antibodies do not show activity in the hemagglutination inhibition assay, the hemagglutination inhibition titer being the current correlate of protection against influenza virus infection7-9. While previous studies have investigated the protective effect of cellular immune responses and neuraminidase-inhibiting antibodies, additional serological correlates of protection from infection could aid the development of broadly protective or universal influenza virus vaccines10-13. To address this gap, we performed a household transmission study to identify alternative correlates of protection from infection and disease in naturally exposed individuals. Using this study, we determined 50% protective titers and levels for hemagglutination inhibition, full-length hemagglutinin, neuraminidase and hemagglutinin stalk-specific antibodies. Further, we found that hemagglutinin stalk antibodies independently correlated with protection from influenza virus infection. ",
        "Fate plasticity and reprogramming in genetically distinct populations of Danio leucophores. Understanding genetic and cellular bases of adult form remains a fundamental goal at the intersection of developmental and evolutionary biology. The skin pigment cells of vertebrates, derived from embryonic neural crest, are a useful system for elucidating mechanisms of fate specification, pattern formation, and how particular phenotypes impact organismal behavior and ecology. In a survey of Danio fishes, including the zebrafish Danio rerio, we identified two populations of white pigment cells-leucophores-one of which arises by transdifferentiation of adult melanophores and another of which develops from a yellow-orange xanthophore or xanthophore-like progenitor. Single-cell transcriptomic, mutational, chemical, and ultrastructural analyses of zebrafish leucophores revealed cell-type-specific chemical compositions, organelle configurations, and genetic requirements. At the organismal level, we identified distinct physiological responses of leucophores during environmental background matching, and we showed that leucophore complement influences behavior. Together, our studies reveal independently arisen pigment cell types and mechanisms of fate acquisition in zebrafish and illustrate how concerted analyses across hierarchical levels can provide insights into phenotypes and their evolution.

        "Genetic and genomic alterations differentially dictate low-grade glioma growth through cancer stem cell-specific chemokine recruitment of T cells and microglia. BACKGROUND: One of the clinical hallmarks of low-grade gliomas (LGGs) arising in children with the neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) cancer predisposition syndrome is significant clinical variability with respect to tumor growth, associated neurologic deficits, and response to therapy. Numerous factors could contribute to this clinical heterogeneity, including the tumor cell of origin, the specific germline NF1 gene mutation, and the coexistence of additional genomic alterations. Since human specimens are rarely acquired, and have proven difficult to maintain in vitro or as xenografts in vivo, we have developed a series of Nf1 mutant optic glioma mouse strains representing each of these contributing factors. METHODS: Optic glioma stem cells (o-GSCs) were generated from this collection of Nf1 genetically engineered mice, and analyzed for their intrinsic growth properties, as well as the production of chemokines that could differentially attract T cells and microglia. RESULTS: The observed differences in Nf1 optic glioma growth are not the result of cell autonomous growth properties of o-GSCs, but rather the unique patterns of o-GSC chemokine expression, which differentially attract T cells and microglia. This immune profile collectively dictates the levels of chemokine C-C ligand 5 (Ccl5) expression, the key stromal factor that drives murine Nf1 optic glioma growth. CONCLUSIONS: These findings reveal that genetic and genomic alterations create murine LGG biological heterogeneity through the differential recruitment of T cells and microglia by o-GSC-produced chemokines, which ultimately determine the expression of stromal factors that drive tumor growth.

        "Double-Blind Placebo-Controlled Trial of Galantamine for Methadone-Maintained Individuals With Cocaine Use Disorder: Secondary Analysis of Effects on Illicit Opioid Use. BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Concurrent use of cocaine and opioids is a persistent and challenging problem, particularly within methadone maintenance settings, and there are no approved pharmacotherapies for this population. Galantamine, a cholinesterase inhibitor, was found in a randomized clinical trial to reduce cocaine use among methadone-maintained individuals who were also cocaine dependent. Because of the potential of galantamine to reduce multiple drugs of abuse, it may also reduce opioid use. METHODS: We conducted a secondary analysis of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 120 methadone-maintained individuals with concurrent cocaine dependence. Participants were randomized to galantamine or placebo in a 12-week trial with a 6-month follow-up (97% of intention to treat sample reached for final follow-up). RESULTS: There was a significant main effect for galantamine over placebo on percent of urine specimens that were negative for opioids, both within treatment (77% for galantamine vs 62% for placebo, F\u2009=\u20095.0, P\u2009=\u20090.027) and through a 6-month follow-up (81% vs 59%, respectively, F\u2009=\u200910.8, P\u2009=\u20090.001). This effect was seen regardless of whether participants used nonprescribed opioids during the baseline period. Galantamine effects were seen early in treatment, with participants in placebo submitting the first opioid-positive urine specimen significantly sooner than participants in galantamine (median day 15 vs 53, Wilcoxon\u2009=\u20095.7, P\u2009=\u20090.02). CONCLUSIONS AND SCIENTIFIC SIGNIFICANCE: If these results are supported in future trials, galantamine may hold promise across multiple drugs of abuse, including opioids.

        "Taking Stock of Dietary Supplements' Harmful Effects on Children, Adolescents, and Young Adults. PURPOSE: The aim of the study was to evaluate the relationship between supplement categories and adverse events in children, adolescents, and young adults. METHODS: This is a retrospective observational study using adverse event reports between January 2004 and April 2015 in the U.S. Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System on food and dietary supplements database. We quantified the relative risks for severe medical events of dietary supplements sold for various functions relative to vitamins among individuals aged between 0 and 25\u00a0years. Severe medical events include death, disability, life-threatening events, hospitalization, emergency room visit, and/or required intervention to prevent permanent disability. RESULTS: There were 977 single-supplement-related adverse event reports affecting individuals aged between 0 and 25\u00a0years over 11\u00a0years (50.6% female; age: mean\u00a0= 16.5\u00a0years, standard deviation\u00a0= 7.5\u00a0years). Supplements sold for muscle building (risk ratio [RR]\u00a0= 2.7; 95% confidence interval [CI]\u00a0= 1.9-4.0), energy (RR\u00a0= 2.6; 95% CI\u00a0= 1.9-3.6), and weight loss (RR\u00a0= 2.6; 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a01.9-3.4) were associated with almost three times the risk for severe medical events compared with vitamins. CONCLUSIONS: Consumption of dietary supplements sold for weight loss, muscle building, and energy involved increased risks for severe medical events compared with vitamins.

This study aimed at evaluating hybrid multispectral optoacoustic tomography/ultrasound for imaging of thyroid disorders, including Graves' disease and thyroid nodules. Methods: The functional biomarkers and tissue parameters deoxygenated hemoglobin, oxygenated hemoglobin, total hemoglobin, saturation of hemoglobin, fat content, and water content were analyzed in thyroid lobes affected by Graves' disease (n = 6), thyroid lobes with healthy tissue (n = 8), benign thyroid nodules (n = 13), and malignant thyroid nodules (n = 3). Results: In Graves' disease, significantly higher deoxygenated hemoglobin (3.18 \u00b1 0.52 vs. 2.13 \u00b1 0.62; P = 0.0055) and total hemoglobin (8.34 \u00b1 0.88 vs. 6.59 \u00b1 1.16; P = 0.0084) and significantly lower fat content (0.64 \u00b1 0.37 vs. 1.69 \u00b1 1.25; P = 0.0293) were found than in healthy controls. Malignant thyroid nodules showed significantly lower saturation of hemoglobin (55.4% \u00b1 2.6% vs. 60.8% \u00b1 7.2%; P = 0.0393) and lower fat content (0.62 \u00b1 0.19 vs. 1.46 \u00b1 0.87; P = 0.1295) than benign nodules. Conclusion: This pilot study showed the applicability and the potential of hybrid multispectral optoacoustic tomography/ultrasound to semiquantitatively provide tissue characterization and functional parameters in thyroid disorders for improved noninvasive diagnostics of thyroid diseases.

        "Modulation of Antimicrobial Peptide Potency in Stressed Lipid Bilayers. It is shown that the tendency of an archetypal antimicrobial peptide to insert into and perforate a simple lipid bilayer is strongly modulated by tensile stress in the membrane. The results, obtained through molecular dynamics simulations, have been demonstrated with several lipid compositions and appear to be general, although quantitative details differ. The findings imply that the potency of antimicrobial peptides may not be a purely intrinsic chemical property and, instead, depends on the mechanical state of the target membrane. ",
        "Estradiol levels are elevated in older men with diffuse cutaneous SSc and are associated with decreased survival. BACKGROUND: Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is a female-predominant disease, characterized by excessive extracellular matrix deposition (ECM) with dermal and internal organ fibrosis. Considering the sex-based disparity in disease incidence, estradiol (E2), an estrogen form with pro-fibrotic effects, may play a role in SSc. We reported that post-menopausal women with diffuse cutaneous (dc)SSc have higher serum E2 levels compared to similar aged, healthy controls. Since males with SSc tend to have more severe disease, we examined serum E2 in dcSSc males in relation to disease characteristics and survival. METHODS: We measured serum E2 in 83 dcSSc men >\u200950\u2009years old from the University of Pittsburgh Scleroderma Center and similar aged healthy controls. Using statistical modeling, we examined the associations between serum E2, internal organ involvement, autoantibody profiles, and survival. RESULTS: Male dcSSc patients had significantly higher serum E2 levels compared to healthy males and similar aged dcSSc post-menopausal women. Male dcSSc patients with high serum E2 had significantly more heart involvement, a trend for higher skin thickness progression rate, and worse survival. Using Cox regression modeling, increased serum E2 levels in anti-Scl-70 antibody-positive dcSSc males were associated with an increased risk of death. CONCLUSIONS: dcSSc males >\u200950\u2009years old have higher levels of serum E2 compared to healthy controls and dcSSc post-menopausal women. Elevated serum E2 levels in dcSSc males are associated with heart involvement, trend to progression of dermal fibrosis, and, if anti-Scl-70 antibody positive, worse survival. Our study expands on previous work implicating E2 in dermal fibrosis in SSc and associates E2 levels with internal organ involvement and survival. These data suggest a role for estrogen imbalance in dcSSc. ",
        "High Salt Inhibits Tumor Growth by Enhancing Anti-tumor Immunity. Excess salt intake could affect the immune system by shifting the immune cell balance toward a pro-inflammatory state. Since this shift of the immune balance is thought to be beneficial in anti-cancer immunity, we tested the impact of high salt diets on tumor growth in mice. Here we show that high salt significantly inhibited tumor growth in two independent murine tumor transplantation models. Although high salt fed tumor-bearing mice showed alterations in T cell populations, the effect seemed to be largely independent of adaptive immune cells. In contrast, depletion of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) significantly reverted the inhibitory effect on tumor growth. In line with this, high salt conditions almost completely blocked murine MDSC function in vitro. Importantly, similar effects were observed in human MDSCs isolated from cancer patients. Thus, high salt conditions seem to inhibit tumor growth by enabling more pronounced anti-tumor immunity through the functional modulation of MDSCs. Our findings might have critical relevance for cancer immunotherapy. ",
        "Cross-sectional and Prospective Associations of Actigraphy-Assessed Sleep Regularity With Metabolic Abnormalities: The Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis. OBJECTIVE: To cross-sectionally and prospectively investigate the association between irregular sleep patterns, a potential marker for circadian disruption, and metabolic abnormalities. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis, participants completed 7-day actigraphy at exam 5 (2010-2013) and were prospectively followed throughout exam 6 (2016 to 2017). Sleep regularity was quantified by the 7-day SD of actigraphy-assessed sleep duration and sleep onset timing. Metabolic abnormalities were defined by 1) the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III criteria and 2) a data-driven clustering of metabolic factors. RESULTS: In the exam 5 cross-sectional analysis adjusted for sociodemographic and lifestyle factors (n = 2,003), every 1-h increase in the sleep duration SD was associated with 27% (95% CI 1.10, 1.47) higher odds of metabolic syndrome, and every 1-h increase in the sleep timing SD was associated with 23% (95% CI 1.06, 1.42) higher odds. The associations remained significant with additional adjustment for sleep-related factors including sleep duration. In the prospective analysis (n = 970), the corresponding fully adjusted odds ratio (OR) was 1.27 (95% CI 0.97, 1.65) for sleep duration and 1.36 (1.03, 1.80) for sleep timing. Compared with the cluster of few metabolic changes, every 1-h increase in sleep variability was associated with almost doubled odds for the cluster characterized by incidence of multiple metabolic abnormalities (OR 1.97 [95% CI 1.18, 3.30] for sleep duration and OR 2.10 [95% CI 1.25, 3.53] for sleep timing). CONCLUSIONS: Increased variability in sleep duration and timing was associated with higher prevalence and incidence of metabolic abnormalities even after consideration of sleep duration and other lifestyle factors.

        "Stem Cell-Derived Exosomes as Nanotherapeutics for Autoimmune and Neurodegenerative Disorders. To dissect therapeutic mechanisms of transplanted stem cells and develop exosome-based nanotherapeutics in treating autoimmune and neurodegenerative diseases, we assessed the effect of exosomes secreted from human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in treating multiple sclerosis using an experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) mouse model. We found that intravenous administration of exosomes produced by MSCs stimulated by IFN\u03b3 (IFN\u03b3-Exo) (i) reduced the mean clinical score of EAE mice compared to PBS control, (ii) reduced demyelination, (iii) decreased neuroinflammation, and (iv) upregulated the number of CD4+CD25+FOXP3+ regulatory T cells (Tregs) within the spinal cords of EAE mice. Co-culture of IFN\u03b3-Exo with activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) cells in vitro reduced PBMC proliferation and levels of pro-inflammatory Th1 and Th17 cytokines including IL-6, IL-12p70, IL-17AF, and IL-22 yet increased levels of immunosuppressive cytokine indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase. IFN\u03b3-Exo could also induce Tregs in vitro in a murine splenocyte culture, likely mediated by a third-party accessory cell type. Further, IFN\u03b3-Exo characterization by deep RNA sequencing suggested that IFN\u03b3-Exo contains anti-inflammatory RNAs, where their inactivation partially hindered the exosomes potential to induce Tregs. Furthermore, we found that IFN\u03b3-Exo harbors multiple anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective proteins. These results not only shed light on stem cell therapeutic mechanisms but also provide evidence that MSC-derived exosomes can potentially serve as cell-free therapies in creating a tolerogenic immune response to treat autoimmune and central nervous system disorders.

        "Nonmedical use of alprazolam in the UK: Results from a nationally representative survey. There is concern in the UK about nonmedical use (NMU) of alprazolam (Xanax). We investigated the epidemiology of alprazolam NMU compared with diazepam using data from the Survey of Non-Medical Use of Prescription Drugs (NMURx) programme (collected 28 September-1 December 2017). The survey included 10\u00a0019 respondents and was weighted by age, sex and region to represent 52\u00a0927\u00a0659 UK adults. The estimated national prevalence of lifetime NMU of alprazolam was 0.32% (95% confidence interval: 0.19-0.46), and 1.30% (1.06-1.54) for diazepam. The prevalence of NMU in the last 90\u00a0days was significantly different when split by age category for alprazolam (P\u00a0<\u00a0.001), but not for diazepam (P\u00a0=\u00a0.262) with alprazolam NMU being more common among younger adults (age 16-24\u00a0years: 0.37%; age 25-34\u00a0years: 0.14%; 35\u00a0years or older: 0.01%). Further research is needed to fully understand the motivations of alprazolam NMU and to monitor whether the popularity of alprazolam will rise. ",
        "Plan U: Universal access to scientific and medical research via funder preprint mandates. Preprint servers such as arXiv and bioRxiv represent a highly successful and relatively low cost mechanism for providing free access to research findings. By decoupling the dissemination of manuscripts from the much slower process of evaluation and certification by journals, preprints also significantly accelerate the pace of research itself by allowing other researchers to begin building on new results immediately. If all funding agencies were to mandate posting of preprints by grantees-an approach we term Plan U (for \"universal\")-free access to the world's scientific output for everyone would be achieved with minimal effort. Moreover, the existence of all articles as preprints would create a fertile environment for experimentation with new peer review and research evaluation initiatives, which would benefit from a reduced barrier to entry because hosting and archiving costs were already covered.

        "Smoking does not accelerate leucocyte telomere attrition: a meta-analysis of 18 longitudinal cohorts. Smoking is associated with shorter leucocyte telomere length (LTL), a biomarker of increased morbidity and reduced longevity. This association is widely interpreted as evidence that smoking causes accelerated LTL attrition in adulthood, but the evidence for this is inconsistent. We analysed the association between smoking and LTL dynamics in 18 longitudinal cohorts. The dataset included data from 12 579 adults (4678 current smokers and 7901 non-smokers) over a mean follow-up interval of 8.6 years. Meta-analysis confirmed a cross-sectional difference in LTL between smokers and non-smokers, with mean LTL 84.61 bp shorter in smokers (95% CI: 22.62 to 146.61). However, LTL attrition was only 0.51 bp yr-1 faster in smokers than in non-smokers (95% CI: -2.09 to 1.08), a difference that equates to only 1.32% of the estimated age-related loss of 38.33 bp yr-1. Assuming a linear effect of smoking, 167 years of smoking would be required to generate the observed cross-sectional difference in LTL. Therefore, the difference in LTL between smokers and non-smokers is extremely unlikely to be explained by a linear, causal effect of smoking. Selective adoption, whereby individuals with short telomeres are more likely to start smoking, needs to be considered as a more plausible explanation for the observed pattern of telomere dynamics. ",
        "Contributors to Postinjury Mental Health in Urban Black Men With Serious Injuries. Importance: Physical injury is associated with postinjury mental health problems, which typically increase disability, cost, recidivism, and self-medication for symptoms. Objective: To determine risk and protective factors across the life span that contribute to depression and posttraumatic stress symptom severity at 3 months after hospital discharge. Design, Setting, and Participants: This prospective cohort study used a 3-month postdischarge follow-up of patients who had been treated at an urban, level 1 trauma center in the Northeastern United States. Men with injuries who were hospitalized, self-identified as black, were 18 years or older, and resided in the Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, region were eligible and consecutively enrolled. Those who were experiencing a cognitive dysfunction or psychotic disorder, hospitalized because of attempted suicide, or receiving current treatment for depression or posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) were excluded. Data were collected from January 2013 to October 2017. Data analysis took place from January 2018 to August 2018. Exposures: A serious injury requiring hospitalization; adverse childhood experiences, childhood neighborhood disadvantage, and preinjury physical and mental health; and emotional resources, injury intent, and acute stress responses. Main Outcomes and Measures: Depression and PTSD symptom severity were assessed with the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptoms-Self-report and the PTSD Check List-5. The a priori hypothesis was that risk and protective factors are associated with depression and PTSD symptom severity. The analytic approach was structural equation modeling. Results: A total of 623 black men were enrolled. Of these, 502 participants (80.6%) were retained at 3-month follow-up. Their mean (SD) age was 35.6 (14.9) years; 346 (55.5%) had experienced intentional injuries, and the median (range) Injury Severity Score was 9 (1-45). Of the 500 participants with complete primary outcome data, 225 (45.0%) met the cut point criteria for mental health diagnoses at 3 months. For both mental health outcomes, the models fit the data well (depression: root mean square error of approximation [RMSEA], 0.044; comparative fit index [CFI], 0.93; PTSD: RMSEA\u2009=\u20090.045; CFI\u2009=\u20090.93), and all hypothesized paths were significant and in the hypothesized direction. Outcomes were associated with poor preinjury health (standardized weights: depression, 0.28; P\u2009<\u2009.001; PTSD, 0.17; P\u2009=\u2009.02), acute psychological reactions (depression, 0.34; PTSD, 0.38; both P\u2009<\u2009.001), and intentional injury (depression, 0.16; PTSD, 0.24; both P\u2009<\u2009.001). Acute psychological reactions were associated with childhood adversity (depression, 0.33; PTSD, 0.36; both P\u2009<\u2009.001). A history of prior mental health challenges (depression, 0.70; PTSD, 0.70; both P\u2009<\u2009.001) and psychological or emotional health resources (depression, -0.22; PTSD, -0.23; both P\u2009=\u2009.003) affected poor preinjury health, which was in turn associated with acute psychological reaction (depression, 0.44; PTSD, 0.42; both P\u2009<\u2009.001). Conclusions and Relevance: The intersection of prior trauma and adversity, prior exposure to neighborhood disadvantage, and poorer preinjury health and functioning are important, even in the midst of acute medical care for traumatic injury. These results support the importance of trauma-informed health care and focused assessment to identified patients with injuries who are at highest risk for poor postinjury mental health outcomes. ",
        "Cancer therapy and risk of congenital malformations in children fathered by men treated for testicular germ-cell cancer: A nationwide register study. BACKGROUND: Because of the potential mutagenic effects of chemo- and radiotherapy, there is concern regarding increased risk of congenital malformations (CMs) among children of fathers with cancer. Previous register studies indicate increased CM risk among children conceived after paternal cancer but lack data on oncological treatment. Increased CM risk was recently reported in children born before paternal cancer. This study aims to investigate whether anti-neoplastic treatment for testicular germ-cell cancer (TGCC) implies additional CM risk. METHODS AND FINDINGS: In this nationwide register study, all singletons born in Sweden 1994-2014 (n = 2,027,997) were included. Paternal TGCC diagnoses (n = 2,380), anti-neoplastic treatment, and offspring CMs were gathered from the Swedish Norwegian Testicular Cancer Group (SWENOTECA) and the Swedish Medical Birth Register. Children were grouped based on +/- paternal TGCC; treatment regimen: surveillance (n = 1,340), chemotherapy (n = 2,533), or radiotherapy (n = 360); and according to time of conception: pre- (n = 2,770) or post-treatment (n = 1,437). Odds ratios (ORs) for CMs were calculated using logistic regression with adjustment for parental ages, maternal body mass index (BMI), and maternal smoking. Children conceived before a specific treatment acted as reference for children conceived after the same treatment. Among children fathered by men with TGCC (n = 4,207), 184 had a CM. The risk of malformations was higher among children of fathers with TGCC compared with children fathered by men without TGCC (OR 1.28, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.19-1.38, p = 0.001, 4.4% versus 3.5%). However, no additional risk increase was associated with oncological treatment when comparing post-treatment-to pretreatment-conceived children (chemotherapy, OR = 0.82, 95% CI 0.54-1.25, p = 0.37, 4.1% versus 4.6%; radiotherapy, OR = 1.01, 95% CI 0.25-4.12, p = 0.98, 3.2% versus 3.0%). Study limitations include lack of data on use of cryopreserved or donor sperm and on seminoma patients for the period 1995-2000-both tending to decrease the difference between the groups with TGCC and without TGCC. Furthermore, the power of analyses on chemotherapy intensity and radiotherapy was limited. CONCLUSIONS: No additional increased risk of CMs was observed in children of men with TGCC treated with radio- or chemotherapy. However, paternal TGCC per se was associated with modestly increased risk for offspring malformations. Clinically, this information can reassure concerned patients. ",
        "Vastly extended drug release from poly(pro-17\u03b2-estradiol) materials facilitates in vitro neurotrophism and neuroprotection. Central nervous system (CNS) injuries persist for years, and currently there are no therapeutics that can address the complex injury cascade that develops over this time-scale. 17\u03b2-estradiol (E2) has broad tropism within the CNS, targeting and inducing beneficial phenotypic changes in myriad cells following injury. To address the unmet need for vastly prolonged E2 release, we report first-generation poly(pro-E2) biomaterial scaffolds that release E2 at nanomolar concentrations over the course of 1-10 years via slow hydrolysis in vitro. As a result of their finely tuned properties, these scaffolds demonstrate the ability to promote and guide neurite extension ex vivo and protect neurons from oxidative stress in vitro. The design and testing of these materials reported herein demonstrate the first step towards next-generation implantable biomaterials with prolonged release and excellent regenerative potential. ",
        "Unsalted tomato juice intake improves blood pressure and serum low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level in local Japanese residents at risk of cardiovascular disease. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of unsalted tomato juice intake on cardiovascular risk markers in local Japanese residents. Four hundred and eighty-one local residents in Kuriyama, Japan, were enrolled in this study. Throughout the year of the study, they were provided with as much unsalted tomato juice as they wanted. Participants were screened for cardiovascular risk markers, such as blood pressure (BP), serum lipid profile, and glucose tolerance, before and after the study period. Of the study participants, 260 participated in a detailed study of their lifestyle factors. The average ages of the 184 male and 297 female participants were 56.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a013.3 (mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SD) and 58.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a011.7\u00a0years, respectively. BP in 94 participants with untreated prehypertension or hypertension was significantly lowered (systolic BP, 141.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a012.1-137.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a016.3\u00a0mmHg, p\u00a0=\u00a00.003; diastolic BP, 83.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a010.1-80.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a011.1\u00a0mmHg, p\u00a0=\u00a00.012, paired t test). Further, the serum low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) level in 125 participants with untreated dyslipidemia significantly decreased (155.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a023.2-149.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a025.0\u00a0mg/dl, p\u00a0=\u00a00.005, paired t test). These beneficial effects were not different between sexes and among the different age groups. No significant difference in lifestyle was found before and after the study.

        "How do economic downturns affect the mental health of children? Evidence from the National Health Interview Survey. Research linking economic conditions and health often does not consider children's mental health problems, which are the most common and consequential health issues for children and adolescents. We examine the effects of unemployment rates and housing prices on well-validated child and adolescent mental health outcomes and use of special education services for emotional problems in the 2001-2013 National Health Interview Survey. We find that the effects of economic conditions on children's mental health are clinically and economically meaningful; children's mental health outcomes worsen as the economy weakens. The effects of economic conditions on child and adolescent mental health are pervasive, found in almost every subgroup that we examine. The use of special education services for emotional problems also rises when economic conditions worsen. Our analyses of possible mechanisms that link economic conditions to child mental health suggest that parental unemployment cannot fully explain the relationship between economic conditions and child mental health.

        "Magnitude and modifiers of the weekend effect in hospital admissions: a systematic review and meta-analysis. OBJECTIVE: To examine the magnitude of the weekend effect, defined as differences in patient outcomes between weekend and weekday hospital admissions, and factors influencing it. DESIGN: A systematic review incorporating Bayesian meta-analyses and meta-regression. DATA SOURCES: We searched seven databases including MEDLINE and EMBASE from January 2000 to April 2015, and updated the MEDLINE search up to November 2017. Eligibility criteria: primary research studies published in peer-reviewed journals of unselected admissions (not focusing on specific conditions) investigating the weekend effect on mortality, adverse events, length of hospital stay (LoS) or patient satisfaction. RESULTS: For the systematic review, we included 68 studies (70 articles) covering over 640\u2009million admissions. Of these, two-thirds were conducted in the UK (n=24) or USA (n=22). The pooled odds ratio (OR) for weekend mortality effect across admission types was 1.16 (95% credible interval 1.10 to 1.23). The weekend effect appeared greater for elective (1.70, 1.08 to 2.52) than emergency (1.11, 1.06 to 1.16) or maternity (1.06, 0.89 to 1.29) admissions. Further examination of the literature shows that these estimates are influenced by methodological, clinical and service factors: at weekends, fewer patients are admitted to hospital, those who are admitted are more severely ill and there are differences in care pathways before and after admission. Evidence regarding the weekend effect on adverse events and LoS is weak and inconsistent, and that on patient satisfaction is sparse. The overall quality of evidence for inferring weekend/weekday difference in hospital care quality from the observed weekend effect was rated as 'very low' based on the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations framework. CONCLUSIONS: The weekend effect is unlikely to have a single cause, or to be a reliable indicator of care quality at weekends. Further work should focus on underlying mechanisms and examine care processes in both hospital and community. PROSPERO REGISTRATION NUMBER: CRD42016036487. ",
        "Dynamic Modulation of the Gut Microbiota and Metabolome by Bacteriophages in a Mouse Model. The human gut microbiome is comprised of densely colonizing microorganisms including bacteriophages, which are in dynamic interaction with each other and the mammalian host. To address how bacteriophages impact bacterial communities in the gut, we investigated the dynamic effects of phages on a model microbiome. Gnotobiotic mice were colonized with defined human gut commensal bacteria and subjected to predation by cognate lytic phages. We found that phage predation not only directly impacts susceptible bacteria but also leads to cascading effects on other bacterial species via interbacterial interactions. Metabolomic profiling revealed that shifts in the microbiome caused by phage predation have a direct consequence on the gut metabolome. Our work provides insight into the ecological importance of phages as modulators of bacterial colonization, and it additionally suggests the potential impact of gut phages on the mammalian host with implications for their therapeutic use to precisely modulate the microbiome.

        "Tau binding protein CAPON induces tau aggregation and neurodegeneration. To understand the molecular processes that link A\u03b2 amyloidosis, tauopathy and neurodegeneration, we screened for tau-interacting proteins by immunoprecipitation/LC-MS. We identified the carboxy-terminal PDZ ligand of nNOS (CAPON) as a novel tau-binding protein. CAPON is an adaptor protein of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS), and activated by the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor. We observed accumulation of CAPON in the hippocampal pyramidal cell layer in the AppNL-G-F -knock-in (KI) brain. To investigate the effect of CAPON accumulation on Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis, CAPON was overexpressed in the brain of AppNL-G-F mice crossbred with MAPT (human tau)-KI mice. This produced significant hippocampal atrophy and caspase3-dependent neuronal cell death in the CAPON-expressing hippocampus, suggesting that CAPON accumulation increases neurodegeneration. CAPON expression also induced significantly higher levels of phosphorylated, oligomerized and insoluble tau. In contrast, CAPON deficiency ameliorated the AD-related pathological phenotypes in tauopathy model. These findings suggest that CAPON could be a druggable AD target. ",
        "Piwi/PRG-1 Argonaute and TGF-\u03b2 Mediate Transgenerational Learned Pathogenic Avoidance. The ability to inherit learned information from parents could be evolutionarily beneficial, enabling progeny to better survive dangerous conditions. We discovered that, after C.\u00a0elegans have learned to avoid the pathogenic bacteria Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA14), they pass this learned behavior on to their progeny, through either the male or female germline, persisting through the fourth generation. Expression of the TGF-\u03b2 ligand DAF-7 in the ASI sensory neurons correlates with and is required for this transgenerational avoidance behavior. Additionally, the Piwi Argonaute homolog PRG-1 and its downstream molecular components are required for transgenerational inheritance of both avoidance behavior and ASI daf-7 expression. Animals whose parents have learned to avoid PA14 display a PA14 avoidance-based survival advantage that is also prg-1 dependent, suggesting an adaptive response. Transgenerational epigenetic inheritance of pathogenic learning may optimize progeny decisions to increase survival in fluctuating environmental conditions. ",
        "Longevity-related molecular pathways are subject to midlife \"switch\" in humans. Emerging evidence indicates that molecular aging may follow nonlinear or discontinuous trajectories. Whether this occurs in human neuromuscular tissue, particularly for the noncoding transcriptome, and independent of metabolic and aerobic capacities, is unknown. Applying our novel RNA method to quantify tissue coding and long noncoding RNA (lncRNA), we identified ~800 transcripts tracking with age up to ~60\u00a0years in human muscle and brain. In silico analysis demonstrated that this temporary linear \"signature\" was regulated by drugs, which reduce mortality or extend life span in model organisms, including 24 inhibitors of the IGF-1/PI3K/mTOR pathway that mimicked, and 5 activators that opposed, the signature. We profiled Rapamycin in nondividing primary human myotubes (n\u00a0=\u00a032 HTA 2.0 arrays) and determined the transcript signature for reactive oxygen species in neurons, confirming that our age signature was largely regulated in the \"pro-longevity\" direction. Quantitative network modeling demonstrated that age-regulated ncRNA equaled the contribution of protein-coding RNA within structures, but tended to have a lower heritability, implying lncRNA may better reflect environmental influences. Genes ECSIT, UNC13, and SKAP2 contributed to a network that did not respond to Rapamycin, and was associated with \"neuron apoptotic processes\" in protein-protein interaction analysis (FDR\u00a0=\u00a02.4%). ECSIT links inflammation with the continued age-related downwards trajectory of mitochondrial complex I gene expression (FDR\u00a0<\u00a00.01%), implying that sustained inhibition of ECSIT may be maladaptive. The present observations link, for the first time, model organism longevity programs with the endogenous but temporary genome-wide responses to aging in humans, revealing a pattern that may ultimately underpin personalized rates of health span.

        "On the occurrence of cytochrome P450 in viruses. Genes encoding cytochrome P450 (CYP; P450) enzymes occur widely in the Archaea, Bacteria, and Eukarya, where they play important roles in metabolism of endogenous regulatory molecules and exogenous chemicals. We now report that genes for multiple and unique P450s occur commonly in giant viruses in the Mimiviridae, Pandoraviridae, and other families in the proposed order Megavirales. P450 genes were also identified in a herpesvirus (Ranid herpesvirus 3) and a phage (Mycobacterium phage Adler). The Adler phage P450 was classified as CYP102L1, and the crystal structure of the open form was solved at 2.5 \u00c5. Genes encoding known redox partners for P450s (cytochrome P450 reductase, ferredoxin and ferredoxin reductase, and flavodoxin and flavodoxin reductase) were not found in any viral genome so far described, implying that host redox partners may drive viral P450 activities. Giant virus P450 proteins share no more than 25% identity with the P450 gene products we identified in Acanthamoeba castellanii, an amoeba host for many giant viruses. Thus, the origin of the unique P450 genes in giant viruses remains unknown. If giant virus P450 genes were acquired from a host, we suggest it could have been from an as yet unknown and possibly ancient host. These studies expand the horizon in the evolution and diversity of the enormously important P450 superfamily. Determining the origin and function of P450s in giant viruses may help to discern the origin of the giant viruses themselves. ",
        "Exome sequencing in multiple sclerosis families identifies 12 candidate genes and nominates biological pathways for the genesis of disease. Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory disease of the central nervous system characterized by myelin loss and neuronal dysfunction. Although the majority of patients do not present familial aggregation, Mendelian forms have been described. We performed whole-exome sequencing analysis in 132 patients from 34 multi-incident families, which nominated likely pathogenic variants for MS in 12 genes of the innate immune system that regulate the transcription and activation of inflammatory mediators. Rare missense or nonsense variants were identified in genes of the fibrinolysis and complement pathways (PLAU, MASP1, C2), inflammasome assembly (NLRP12), Wnt signaling (UBR2, CTNNA3, NFATC2, RNF213), nuclear receptor complexes (NCOA3), and cation channels and exchangers (KCNG4, SLC24A6, SLC8B1). These genes suggest a disruption of interconnected immunological and pro-inflammatory pathways as the initial event in the pathophysiology of familial MS, and provide the molecular and biological rationale for the chronic inflammation, demyelination and neurodegeneration observed in MS patients.

        "A conjugative plasmid that augments virulence in Klebsiella pneumoniae. A virulence-encoding plasmid, p15WZ-82_Vir, which formed as a result of the integration of a 100-kb fragment of the hypervirulence plasmid pLVPK into a conjugative IncFIB plasmid, was recovered from a clinical Klebsiella variicola strain. Such a plasmid could be conjugated to carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella strains, enabling them to simultaneously express the carbapenem resistance- and hypervirulence-associated phenotypes. Unlike the non-conjugative pLVPK plasmid, emergence of p15WZ-82_Vir may promote rapid dissemination of virulence-encoding elements among Gram-negative bacterial pathogens. ",
        "Synthesis of polypeptides via bioinspired polymerization of in situ purified N-carboxyanhydrides. Ribozymes synthesize proteins in a highly regulated local environment to minimize side reactions caused by various competing species. In contrast, it is challenging to prepare synthetic polypeptides from the polymerization of N-carboxyanhydrides (NCAs) in the presence of water and impurities, which induce monomer degradations and chain terminations, respectively. Inspired by natural protein synthesis, we herein report the preparation of well-defined polypeptides in the presence of competing species, by using a water/dichloromethane biphasic system with macroinitiators anchored at the interface. The impurities are extracted into the aqueous phase in situ, and the localized macroinitiators allow for NCA polymerization at a rate which outpaces water-induced side reactions. Our polymerization strategy streamlines the process from amino acids toward high molecular weight polypeptides with low dispersity by circumventing the tedious NCA purification and the demands for air-free conditions, enabling low-cost, large-scale production of polypeptides that has potential to change the paradigm of polypeptide-based biomaterials.

        "Interaction Between Cortical Auditory Processing and Vagal Regulation of Heart Rate in Language Tasks: A Randomized, Prospective, Observational, Analytical and Cross-Sectional Study. Cortical auditory evoked potentials (CAEP) throughout a language task is beneficial during psychophysiological evaluation to advance identification of language disorders. So as to better comprehend human communication and to provide additional elements for neuropsychological examinations we aimed to (1) examine the influence of language tasks on cortical auditory processing and vagal control of heart rate and (2) to verify a possible association between the parasympathetic cardiac regulation and cortical auditory processing in language tasks. This study was completed with 49 women. The subjects were separated into two groups: (1) phonological language tasks (N\u2009=\u200921) and (2) semantic (N\u2009=\u200921) language tasks. Heart rate variability (HRV) and CAEP were evaluated before and after the tests. HRV reduced (small effect size) and P3 wave latency increased after the phonological task. Identical variables were significantly correlated after the phonological task and linear regression indicated significant interaction between pNN50 (percentage of adjacent RR intervals with a difference of duration greater than 50 milliseconds) and P3 latency (16.9%). In conclusion, phonological language tasks slightly reduced parasympathetic control of HR and increased cognitive effort. The association between HRV and CAEP are anticipated to be involved in this mechanism. ",
        "STRIPAK Members Orchestrate Hippo and Insulin Receptor Signaling to Promote Neural Stem Cell Reactivation. Adult stem cells reactivate from quiescence to maintain tissue homeostasis and in response to injury. How the underlying regulatory signals are integrated is largely unknown. Drosophila neural stem cells (NSCs) also leave quiescence to generate adult neurons and glia, a process that is dependent on Hippo signaling inhibition and activation of the insulin-like receptor (InR)/PI3K/Akt cascade. We performed a transcriptome analysis of individual quiescent and reactivating NSCs harvested directly from Drosophila brains and identified the conserved STRIPAK complex members mob4, cka, and PP2A (microtubule star, mts). We show that PP2A/Mts phosphatase, with its regulatory subunit Widerborst, maintains NSC quiescence, preventing premature activation of InR/PI3K/Akt signaling. Conversely, an increase in Mob4 and Cka levels promotes NSC reactivation. Mob4 and Cka are essential to recruit PP2A/Mts into a complex with Hippo kinase, resulting in Hippo pathway inhibition. We propose that Mob4/Cka/Mts functions as an intrinsic molecular switch coordinating Hippo and InR/PI3K/Akt pathways and enabling NSC reactivation. ",
        "Elevation in plasma tRNA fragments precede seizures in human epilepsy. Transfer RNAs (tRNAs) are a major class of noncoding RNA. Stress-induced cleavage of tRNA is highly conserved and results in tRNA fragments. Here we find specific tRNA fragments in plasma are associated with epilepsy. Small RNA sequencing of plasma samples collected during video-EEG monitoring of focal epilepsy patients identified significant differences in three tRNA fragments (5', 5'AlaTGC, and 5'GluCTC) from controls. Levels of these tRNA fragments were higher in pre-seizure than post-seizure samples, suggesting they may serve as biomarkers of seizure risk in epilepsy patients. In vitro studies confirmed that production and extracellular release of tRNA fragments was lower after epileptiform-like activity in hippocampal neurons. We designed PCR-based assays to quantify tRNA fragments in a cohort of pre- and post-seizure plasma samples from focal epilepsy patients and healthy controls (n = 32/group). Receiver operating characteristic analysis indicated that tRNA fragments potently distinguished pre- from post-seizure patients (area under the curve of 0.8-0.95). Elevated tRNA fragments levels were not detected in patients with psychogenic non-epileptic seizures, and did not result from medication tapering. This study identifies a novel class of epilepsy biomarker and reveals the potential existence of prodromal molecular patterns in blood that could be used to predict seizure risk. ",
        "An Anti-CD3 Antibody, Teplizumab, in Relatives at Risk for Type 1 Diabetes. BACKGROUND: Type 1 diabetes is a chronic autoimmune disease that leads to destruction of insulin-producing beta cells and dependence on exogenous insulin for survival. Some interventions have delayed the loss of insulin production in patients with type 1 diabetes, but interventions that might affect clinical progression before diagnosis are needed. METHODS: We conducted a phase 2, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial of teplizumab (an Fc receptor-nonbinding anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody) involving relatives of patients with type 1 diabetes who did not have diabetes but were at high risk for development of clinical disease. Patients were randomly assigned to a single 14-day course of teplizumab or placebo, and follow-up for progression to clinical type 1 diabetes was performed with the use of oral glucose-tolerance tests at 6-month intervals. RESULTS: A total of 76 participants (55 [72%] of whom were \u226418 years of age) underwent randomization - 44 to the teplizumab group and 32 to the placebo group. The median time to the diagnosis of type 1 diabetes was 48.4 months in the teplizumab group and 24.4 months in the placebo group; the disease was diagnosed in 19 (43%) of the participants who received teplizumab and in 23 (72%) of those who received placebo. The hazard ratio for the diagnosis of type 1 diabetes (teplizumab vs. placebo) was 0.41 (95% confidence interval, 0.22 to 0.78; P\u2009=\u20090.006 by adjusted Cox proportional-hazards model). The annualized rates of diagnosis of diabetes were 14.9% per year in the teplizumab group and 35.9% per year in the placebo group. There were expected adverse events of rash and transient lymphopenia. KLRG1+TIGIT+CD8+ T cells were more common in the teplizumab group than in the placebo group. Among the participants who were HLA-DR3-negative, HLA-DR4-positive, or anti-zinc transporter 8 antibody-negative, fewer participants in the teplizumab group than in the placebo group had diabetes diagnosed. CONCLUSIONS: Teplizumab delayed progression to clinical type 1 diabetes in high-risk participants. (Funded by the National Institutes of Health and others; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01030861.).

        "68Ga-FAPI PET/CT: Tracer Uptake in 28 Different Kinds of Cancer. The recent development of quinoline-based PET tracers that act as fibroblast-activation-protein inhibitors (FAPIs) demonstrated promising preclinical and clinical results. FAP is overexpressed by cancer-associated fibroblasts of several tumor entities. Here, we quantify the tumor uptake on 68Ga-FAPI PET/CT of various primary and metastatic tumors to identify the most promising indications for future application. Methods:68Ga-FAPI PET/CT scans were requested by various referring physicians according to individual clinical indications that were considered insufficiently covered by 18F-FDG PET/CT or other imaging modalities. All PET/CT was performed 1 h after injection of 122-312 MBq of 68Ga-FAPI-04. We retrospectively identified 80 patients with histopathologically proven primary tumors or metastases or radiologically unequivocal metastatic lesions of histologically proven primary tumors. Tumor uptake was quantified by SUVmax and SUVmean (60% isocontour). Results: Eighty patients with 28 different tumor entities (54 primary tumors and 229 metastases) were evaluated. The highest average SUVmax (>12) was found in sarcoma, esophageal, breast, cholangiocarcinoma, and lung cancer. The lowest 68Ga-FAPI uptake (average SUVmax < 6) was observed in pheochromocytoma, renal cell, differentiated thyroid, adenoid cystic, and gastric cancer. The average SUVmax of hepatocellular, colorectal, head-neck, ovarian, pancreatic, and prostate cancer was intermediate (SUV 6-12). SUV varied across and within all tumor entities. Because of low background in muscle and blood pool (SUVmax < 2), the tumor-to-background contrast ratios were more than 3-fold in the intermediate and more than 6-fold in the high-intensity uptake group. Conclusion: Several highly prevalent cancers presented with remarkably high uptake and image contrast on 68Ga-FAPI PET/CT. The high and rather selective tumor uptake may open up new applications for noninvasive tumor characterization, staging examinations, or radioligand therapy. ",
        "Covalent Plasmodium falciparum-selective proteasome inhibitors exhibit a low propensity for generating resistance in vitro and synergize with multiple antimalarial agents. Therapeutics with novel modes of action and a low risk of generating resistance are urgently needed to combat drug-resistant Plasmodium falciparum malaria. Here, we report that the peptide vinyl sulfones WLL-vs (WLL) and WLW-vs (WLW), highly selective covalent inhibitors of the P. falciparum proteasome, potently eliminate genetically diverse parasites, including K13-mutant, artemisinin-resistant lines, and are particularly active against ring-stage parasites. Selection studies reveal that parasites do not readily acquire resistance to WLL or WLW and that mutations in the \u03b22, \u03b25 or \u03b26 subunits of the 20S proteasome core particle or in components of the 19S proteasome regulatory particle yield only <five-fold decreases in parasite susceptibility. This result compares favorably against previously published non-covalent inhibitors of the Plasmodium proteasome that can select for resistant parasites with >hundred-fold decreases in susceptibility. We observed no cross-resistance between WLL and WLW. Moreover, most mutations that conferred a modest loss of parasite susceptibility to one inhibitor significantly increased sensitivity to the other. These inhibitors potently synergized multiple chemically diverse classes of antimalarial agents, implicating a shared disruption of proteostasis in their modes of action. These results underscore the potential of targeting the Plasmodium proteasome with covalent small molecule inhibitors as a means of combating multidrug-resistant malaria. ",
        "Increased growth ability and pathogenicity of American- and Pacific-subtype Zika virus (ZIKV) strains compared with a Southeast Asian-subtype ZIKV strain. We investigated the growth properties and virulence in mice of three Zika virus (ZIKV) strains of Asian/American lineage, PRVABC59, ZIKV/Hu/Chiba/S36/2016 (ChibaS36), and ZIKV/Hu/NIID123/2016 (NIID123), belonging to the three distinct subtypes of this lineage. The American-subtype strain, PRVABC59, showed the highest growth potential in vitro, whereas the Southeast Asian-subtype strain, NIID123, showed the lowest proliferative capacity. Moreover, PRVABC59- and NIID123-infected mice showed the highest and lowest viremia levels and infectious virus levels in the testis, respectively, and the rate of damaged testis in PRVABC59-infected mice was higher than in mice infected with the other two strains. Lastly, ZIKV NS1 antigen was detected in the damaged testes of mice infected with PRVABC59 and the Pacific-subtype strain, ChibaS36, at 2 weeks post-inoculation and in the epididymides of PRVABC59-infected mice at 6 weeks post-inoculation. Our results indicate that PRVABC59 and ChibaS36 exhibit increased abilities to grow in vitro and in vivo and to induce testis damage in mice. ",
        "Fatty acid transport protein\u00a02 reprograms neutrophils in cancer. Polymorphonuclear myeloid-derived suppressor cells (PMN-MDSCs) are pathologically activated neutrophils that are crucial for the regulation of immune responses in cancer. These cells contribute to the failure of cancer therapies and are associated with poor clinical outcomes. Despite recent advances in the understanding of PMN-MDSC biology, the mechanisms responsible for the pathological activation of neutrophils are not well defined, and this limits the selective targeting of these cells. Here we report that mouse and human PMN-MDSCs exclusively upregulate fatty acid transport protein 2 (FATP2). Overexpression of FATP2 in PMN-MDSCs was controlled by granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, through the activation of the STAT5 transcription factor. Deletion of FATP2 abrogated the suppressive activity of PMN-MDSCs. The main mechanism of FATP2-mediated suppressive activity involved the uptake of arachidonic acid and the synthesis of prostaglandin E2. The selective pharmacological inhibition of FATP2 abrogated the activity of PMN-MDSCs and substantially delayed tumour progression. In combination with checkpoint inhibitors, FATP2 inhibition blocked tumour progression in mice. Thus, FATP2 mediates the acquisition of immunosuppressive activity by PMN-MDSCs and represents a target to inhibit the functions of PMN-MDSCs selectively and to improve the efficiency of cancer therapy.

        "Transmissible cancer and the evolution of sex. The origin and subsequent maintenance of sex and recombination are among the most elusive and controversial problems in evolutionary biology. Here, we propose a novel hypothesis, suggesting that sexual reproduction not only evolved to reduce the negative effects of the accumulation of deleterious mutations and processes associated with pathogen and/or parasite resistance but also to prevent invasion by transmissible selfish neoplastic cheater cells, henceforth referred to as transmissible cancer cells. Sexual reproduction permits systematic change of the multicellular organism's genotype and hence an enhanced detection of transmissible cancer cells by immune system. Given the omnipresence of oncogenic processes in multicellular organisms, together with the fact that transmissible cancer cells can have dramatic effects on their host fitness, our scenario suggests that the benefits of sex and concomitant recombination will be large and permanent, explaining why sexual reproduction is, despite its costs, the dominant mode of reproduction among eukaryotes.

        "Identification of a Synergistic Multi-Drug Combination Active in Cancer Cells via the Prevention of Spindle Pole Clustering. A major limitation of clinically used cancer drugs is the lack of specificity resulting in toxicity. To address this, we performed a phenotypically-driven screen to identify optimal multidrug combinations acting with high efficacy and selectivity in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). The search was performed using the Therapeutically Guided Multidrug Optimization (TGMO) method in ccRCC cells (786-O) and nonmalignant renal cells and identified a synergistic low-dose four-drug combination (C2) with high efficacy and negligible toxicity. We discovered that C2 inhibits multipolar spindle pole clustering, a survival mechanism employed by cancer cells with spindle abnormalities. This phenotype was also observed in 786-O cells resistant to sunitinib, the first line ccRCC treatment, as well as in melanoma cells with distinct percentages of supernumerary centrosomes. We conclude that C2-treatment shows a high efficacy in cells prone to form multipolar spindles. Our data suggest a highly effective and selective C2 treatment strategy for malignant and drug-resistant cancers. ",
        "Mitochondrial dysfunction causes Ca2+ overload and ECM degradation-mediated muscle damage in C. elegans. Mitochondrial dysfunction impairs muscle health and causes subsequent muscle wasting. This study explores the role of mitochondrial dysfunction as an intramuscular signal for the extracellular matrix (ECM)-based proteolysis and, consequentially, muscle cell dystrophy. We found that inhibition of the mitochondrial electron transport chain causes paralysis as well as muscle structural damage in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. This was associated with a significant decline in collagen content. Both paralysis and muscle damage could be rescued with collagen IV overexpression, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP), and Furin inhibitors in Antimycin A-treated animal as well as in the C. elegans Duchenne muscular dystrophy model. Additionally, muscle cytosolic calcium increased in the Antimycin A-treated worms, and its down-regulation rescued the muscle damage, suggesting that calcium overload acts as one of the early triggers and activates Furin and MMPs for collagen degradation. In conclusion, we have established ECM degradation as an important pathway of muscle damage.-Sudevan, S., Takiura, M., Kubota, Y., Higashitani, N., Cooke, M., Ellwood, R. A., Etheridge, T., Szewczyk, N. J., Higashitani, A. Mitochondrial dysfunction causes Ca2+ overload and ECM degradation-mediated muscle damage in C. elegans. ",
        "Undetected Dysglycemia Is an Important Risk Factor for Two Common Diseases, Myocardial Infarction and Periodontitis: A Report From the PAROKRANK Study. OBJECTIVE: Information on the relationship among dysglycemia (prediabetes or diabetes), myocardial infarction (MI), and periodontitis (PD) is limited. This study tests the hypothesis that undetected dysglycemia is associated with both conditions. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The PAROKRANK (Periodontitis and Its Relation to Coronary Artery Disease) study included 805 patients with a first MI and 805 matched control subjects. All participants without diabetes (91%) were examined with an oral glucose tolerance test. Abnormal glucose tolerance (AGT) (impaired glucose tolerance or diabetes) was categorized according to the World Health Organization. Periodontal status was categorized from dental X-rays as healthy (\u226580% remaining alveolar bone height), moderate (79-66%), or severe (<66%) PD. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs were calculated by logistic regression and were adjusted for age, sex, smoking, education, marital status, and explored associated risks of dysglycemia to PD and MI, respectively. RESULTS: AGT was more common in patients than in control subjects (32% vs. 19%; P < 0.001) and was associated with MI (OR 2.03; 95% CI 1.58-2.60). Undetected diabetes was associated with severe PD (2.50; 1.36-4.63) and more strongly in patients (2.35; 1.15-4.80) than in control subjects (1.80; 0.48-6.78), but not when categorized as AGT (total cohort: 1.07; 0.67-1.72). Severe PD was most frequent in subjects with undetected diabetes, and reversely undetected diabetes was most frequent in patients with severe PD. CONCLUSIONS: In this large case-control study previously undetected dysglycemia was independently associated to both MI and severe PD. In principal, it doubled the risk of a first MI and of severe PD. This supports the hypothesis that dysglycemia drives two common diseases, MI and PD. ",
        "Exploiting interconnected synthetic lethal interactions between PARP inhibition and cancer cell reversible senescence. Senescence is a tumor suppression mechanism defined by stable proliferation arrest. Here we demonstrate that the known synthetic lethal interaction between poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 inhibitors (PARPi) and DNA repair triggers p53-independent ovarian cancer cell senescence defined by senescence-associated phenotypic hallmarks including DNA-SCARS, inflammatory secretome, Bcl-XL-mediated apoptosis resistance, and proliferation restriction via Chk2 and p21 (CDKN1A). The concept of senescence as irreversible remains controversial and here we show that PARPi-senescent cells re-initiate proliferation upon drug withdrawal, potentially explaining the requirement for sustained PARPi therapy in the clinic. Importantly, PARPi-induced senescence renders ovarian and breast cancer cells transiently susceptible to second-phase synthetic lethal approaches targeting the senescence state using senolytic drugs. The combination of PARPi and a senolytic is effective in preclinical models of ovarian and breast cancer suggesting that coupling these synthetic lethalities provides a rational approach to their clinical use and may together be more effective in limiting resistance.

        "Acellular Pertussis Vaccine Effectiveness Over Time. OBJECTIVES: To determine pertussis risk by diphtheria-tetanus-acellular pertussis (DTaP) vaccination status and time since last DTaP dose. METHODS: Children born at Kaiser Permanente Northern California between 1999 and 2016 were followed from 3 months of age until they tested positive for pertussis; disenrolled from Kaiser Permanente Northern California; received the tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid, and acellular pertussis, adsorbed vaccine; turned 11 years of age, or the end of the study period. DTaP vaccination status was categorized on the basis of the number of doses received in relation to the number of doses expected according to the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practice-recommended ages. RESULTS: Among 469\u2009982 children ages 3 months to 11 years, we identified 738 pertussis cases. A total of 99 cases were unvaccinated, 36 were undervaccinated, 515 were fully vaccinated, and 88 were fully vaccinated plus 1 dose. Pertussis risk was 13 times higher among unvaccinated (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] = 13.53; 95% confidence interval [CI] 10.64-17.21) compared with fully vaccinated children and 1.9 times higher (aHR = 1.86; 95% CI 1.32-2.63) among undervaccinated children. Among vaccinated children ages 19 to <84 months, pertussis risk was 5 times higher (aHR = 5.04; 95% CI 1.84-13.80) \u22653 years vs <1 year after vaccination. Among children ages 84 to 132 months, risk was 2 times higher (aHR = 2.32; 95% CI 0.97-5.59) \u22656 years vs <3 years after vaccination. CONCLUSIONS: Undervaccinated and especially unvaccinated children were at greater risk of pertussis. However, most pertussis cases occurred among children age-appropriately vaccinated who were further away from their last DTaP dose, suggesting that suboptimal vaccine effectiveness played a major role in recent pertussis epidemics.

        "Cooperation between Constitutive and Inducible Chemokines Enables T Cell Engraftment and Immune Attack in Solid Tumors. We investigated the role of chemokines in regulating T\u00a0cell accumulation in solid tumors. CCL5 and CXCL9 overexpression was associated with CD8+ T\u00a0cell infiltration in solid tumors. T\u00a0cell infiltration required tumor cell-derived CCL5 and was amplified by IFN-\u03b3-inducible, myeloid cell-secreted CXCL9. CCL5 and CXCL9 coexpression revealed immunoreactive tumors with prolonged survival and response to checkpoint blockade. Loss of CCL5 expression in human tumors was associated with epigenetic silencing through DNA methylation. Reduction of CCL5 expression caused tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) desertification, whereas forced CCL5 expression prevented Cxcl9 expression and TILs loss, and attenuated tumor growth in mice through IFN-\u03b3. The cooperation between tumor-derived CCL5 and IFN-\u03b3-inducible CXCR3 ligands secreted by myeloid cells is key for orchestrating T\u00a0cell infiltration in immunoreactive and immunoresponsive tumors.

        "Effects of saline or albumin fluid bolus in resuscitation: evidence from re-analysis of the FEAST trial. BACKGROUND: Fluid resuscitation is the recommended management of shock, but increased mortality in febrile African children in the FEAST trial. We hypothesised that fluid bolus-induced deaths in FEAST would be associated with detectable changes in cardiovascular, neurological, or respiratory function, oxygen carrying capacity, and blood biochemistry. METHODS: We developed composite scores for respiratory, cardiovascular, and neurological function using vital sign data from the FEAST trial, and used them to compare participants from FEAST with those from four other cohorts and to identify differences between the bolus (n=2097) and no bolus (n=1044) groups of FEAST. We calculated the odds of adverse outcome for each ten-unit increase in baseline score using logistic regression for each cohort. Within FEAST participants, we also compared haemoglobin and plasma biochemistry between bolus and non-bolus patients, assessed the effects of these factors along with the vital sign scores on the contribution of bolus to mortality using Cox proportional hazard models, and used Bayesian clustering to identify subgroups that differed in response to bolus. The FEAST trial is registered with ISRCTN, number ISRCTN69856593. FINDINGS: Increasing respiratory (odds ratio 1\u00b709, 95% CI 1\u00b707-1\u00b711), neurological (1\u00b726, 1\u00b721-1\u00b731), and cardiovascular scores (1\u00b709, 1\u00b705-1\u00b714) were associated with death in FEAST (all p<0\u00b70001), and with adverse outcomes for specific scores in the four other cohorts. In FEAST, fluid bolus increased respiratory and neurological scores and decreased cardiovascular score at 1 h after commencement of the infusion. Fluid bolus recipients had mean 0\u00b733 g/dL (95% CI 0\u00b720-0\u00b746) reduction in haemoglobin concentration after 8 h (p<0\u00b70001), and at 24 h had a decrease of 1\u00b741 mEq/L (95% CI 0\u00b776-2\u00b706; p=0\u00b70002) in mean base excess and increase of 1\u00b765 mmol/L (0\u00b747-2\u00b78; p=0\u00b70070) in mean chloride, and a decrease of 0\u00b796 mmol/L (0\u00b745 to 1\u00b747; p=0\u00b70003) in bicarbonate. There were similar effects of fluid bolus in three patient subgroups, identified on the basis of their baseline characteristics. Hyperchloraemic acidosis and respiratory and neurological dysfunction induced by saline or albumin bolus explained the excess mortality due to bolus in Cox survival models. INTERPRETATION: In the resuscitation of febrile children, albumin and saline boluses can cause respiratory and neurological dysfunction, hyperchloraemic acidosis, and reduction in haemoglobin concentration. The findings support the notion that fluid resuscitation with unbuffered electrolyte solutions may cause harm and their use should be cautioned. The effects of lower volumes of buffered solutions should be evaluated further.

        "Early Acid Suppression Therapy Exposure and Fracture in Young Children. BACKGROUND: Acid suppression therapy (AST), including proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and histamine H2-receptor antagonists (H2RAs), is frequently prescribed to treat symptomatic gastroesophageal reflux in otherwise healthy infants. PPI use has been associated with increased fracture risk in older adults; 2 preliminary studies in children have conflicting results. METHODS: A retrospective cohort of children born 2001 to 2013 who were followed for \u22652 years was formed. Those with osteogenesis imperfecta, cholestasis, or child maltreatment were excluded. Prescription data were used to identify AST prescription before age 1 year. International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification codes identified fractures after age 1 year. A Cox proportional hazard analysis assessed fracture hazard and was adjusted for sex, prematurity, low birth weight, previous fracture, anti-epileptics, and overweight or obesity. RESULTS: Of 851\u2009631 included children, 97\u2009286 (11%) were prescribed AST in the first year of life; 7998 (0.9%) children were prescribed PPI, 71\u2009578 (8%) were prescribed H2RA, and 17\u2009710 (2%) were prescribed both a PPI and H2RA. Infants prescribed AST had an earlier median first fracture age (3.9 vs 4.5 years). After adjustment, increased fracture hazard was associated with PPI use (21%) and PPI and H2RA use (30%), but not H2RA use alone. Longer duration of AST treatment and earlier age of first AST use was associated with increased fracture hazard. CONCLUSIONS: Infant PPI use alone and together with H2RAs is associated with an increased childhood fracture hazard, which appears amplified by days of use and earlier initiation of ASTs. Use of AST in infants should be weighed carefully against possible fracture. ",
        "Early Life Stress and High FKBP5 Interact to Increase Anxiety-Like Symptoms through Altered AKT Signaling in the Dorsal Hippocampus. Clinical studies show a significant association of childhood adversities and FK506-binding protein 5 (FKBP5) polymorphisms on increasing the susceptibility for neuropsychiatric disorders. However, the mechanisms by which early life stress (ELS) influences FKBP5 actions have not been fully elucidated. We hypothesized that interactions between ELS and high FKBP5 induce phenotypic changes that correspond to underlying molecular changes in the brain. To test this, we exposed newborn mice overexpressing human FKBP5 in the forebrain, rTgFKBP5, to ELS using a maternal separation. Two months after ELS, we observed that ELS increased anxiety levels, specifically in mice overexpressing FKBP5, an effect that was more pronounced in females. Biochemically, Protein kinase B (AKT) phosphorylation was reduced in the dorsal hippocampus in rTgFKBP5 mice, which demonstrates that significant molecular changes occur as a result of ELS when FKBP5 levels are altered. Taken together, our results have a significant impact on our understanding mechanisms underlying the gene x environment interaction showing that anxiety and AKT signaling in the hippocampus were affected by the combination of ELS and FKBP5. An increased knowledge of the molecular mechanisms underlying these interactions may help determine if FKBP5 could be an effective target for the treatment of anxiety and other mood-related illnesses.

Importance: Short sleep has been associated with obesity, but to date the association between exposure to artificial light at night (ALAN) while sleeping and obesity is unknown. Objective: To determine whether ALAN exposure while sleeping is associated with the prevalence and risk of obesity. Design, Setting, and Participants: This baseline and prospective analysis included women aged 35 to 74 years enrolled in the Sister Study in all 50 US states and Puerto Rico from July 2003 through March 2009. Follow-up was completed on August 14, 2015. A total of 43\u202f722 women with no history of cancer or cardiovascular disease who were not shift workers, daytime sleepers, or pregnant at baseline were included in the analysis. Data were analyzed from September 1, 2017, through December 31, 2018. Exposures: Artificial light at night while sleeping reported at enrollment, categorized as no light, small nightlight in the room, light outside the room, and light or television in the room. Main Outcomes and Measures: Prevalent obesity at baseline was based on measured general obesity (body mass index [BMI] \u226530.0) and central obesity (waist circumference [WC] \u226588 cm, waist-to-hip ratio [WHR] \u22650.85, or waist-to-height ratio [WHtR]\u22650.5). To evaluate incident overweight and obesity, self-reported BMI at enrollment was compared with self-reported BMI at follow-up (mean [SD] follow-up,\u20095.7 [1.0] years). Generalized log-linear models with robust error variance were used to estimate multivariable-adjusted prevalence ratios (PRs) and relative risks (RRs) with 95% CIs for prevalent and incident obesity. Results: Among the population of 43 722 women (mean [SD] age, 55.4 [8.9] years), having any ALAN exposure while sleeping was positively associated with a higher prevalence of obesity at baseline, as measured using BMI (PR, 1.03; 95% CI, 1.02-1.03), WC (PR, 1.12; 95% CI, 1.09-1.16), WHR (PR, 1.04; 95% CI, 1.00-1.08), and WHtR (PR, 1.07; 95% CI, 1.04-1.09), after adjusting for confounding factors, with P\u2009<\u2009.001 for trend for each measure. Having any ALAN exposure while sleeping was also associated with incident obesity (RR, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.06-1.34). Compared with no ALAN, sleeping with a television or a light on in the room was associated with gaining 5 kg or more (RR, 1.17; 95% CI, 1.08-1.27; P\u2009<\u2009.001 for trend), a BMI increase of 10% or more (RR, 1.13; 95% CI, 1.02-1.26; P\u2009=\u2009.04 for trend), incident overweight (RR, 1.22; 95% CI,1.06-1.40;\u2009P\u2009=\u2009.03 for trend), and incident obesity (RR, 1.33; 95% CI, 1.13-1.57; P\u2009<\u2009.001 for trend). Results were supported by sensitivity analyses and additional multivariable analyses including potential mediators such as sleep duration and quality, diet, and physical activity. Conclusions and Relevance: These results suggest that exposure to ALAN while sleeping may be a risk factor for weight gain and development of overweight or obesity. Further prospective and interventional studies could help elucidate this association and clarify whether lowering exposure to ALAN while sleeping can promote obesity prevention. ",
        "Three Public Health Interventions Could Save 94 Million Lives in 25 Years. BACKGROUND: Preventable noncommunicable diseases, mostly cardiovascular diseases, are responsible for 38 million deaths annually. A few well-documented interventions have the potential to prevent many of these deaths, but a large proportion of the population in need does not have access to these interventions. We quantified the global mortality impact of 3 high-impact and feasible interventions: scaling up treatment of high blood pressure to 70%, reducing sodium intake by 30%, and eliminating the intake of artificial trans fatty acids. METHODS: We used global data on mean blood pressure levels and sodium and trans fat intake by country, age, and sex from a pooled analysis of population health surveys, and regional estimates of current coverage of antihypertensive medications, and cause-specific mortality rates in each country, as well, with projections from 2015 to 2040. We used the most recent meta-analyses of epidemiological studies to derive relative risk reductions for each intervention. We estimated the proportional effect of each intervention on reducing mortality from related causes by using a generalized version of the population-attributable fraction. The effect of antihypertensive medications and lowering sodium intake were modeled through their impact on blood pressure and as immediate increase/reduction to the proposed targets. RESULTS: The combined effect of the 3 interventions delayed 94.3 million (95% uncertainty interval, 85.7-102.7) deaths during 25 years. Increasing coverage of antihypertensive medications to 70% alone would delay 39.4 million deaths (35.9-43.0), whereas reducing sodium intake by 30% would delay another 40.0 million deaths (35.1-44.6) and eliminating trans fat would delay an additional 14.8 million (14.7-15.0). The estimated impact of trans fat elimination was largest in South Asia. Sub-Saharan Africa had the largest proportion of premature delayed deaths out of all delayed deaths. CONCLUSIONS: Three effective interventions can save almost 100 million lives globally within 25 years. National and international efforts to scale up these interventions should be a focus of cardiovascular disease prevention programs. ",
        "BRK phosphorylates SMAD4 for proteasomal degradation and inhibits tumor suppressor FRK to control SNAIL, SLUG, and metastatic potential. The tumor-suppressing function of SMAD4 is frequently subverted during mammary tumorigenesis, leading to cancer growth, invasion, and metastasis. A long-standing concept is that SMAD4 is not regulated by phosphorylation but ubiquitination. Our search for signaling pathways regulated by breast tumor kinase (BRK), a nonreceptor protein tyrosine kinase that is up-regulated in ~80% of invasive ductal breast tumors, led us to find that BRK competitively binds and phosphorylates SMAD4 and regulates transforming growth factor-\u03b2/SMAD4 signaling pathway. A constitutively active BRK (BRK-Y447F) phosphorylates SMAD4, resulting in its recognition by the ubiquitin-proteasome system, which accelerates SMAD4 degradation. Activated BRK-mediated degradation of SMAD4 is associated with the repression of tumor suppressor gene FRK and increased expression of mesenchymal markers, SNAIL, and SLUG. Thus, our data suggest that combination therapies targeting activated BRK signaling may have synergized the benefits in the treatment of SMAD4 repressed cancers. ",
        "Predicting postoperative delirium severity in older adults: The role of surgical risk and executive function. OBJECTIVES: Delirium is an important postoperative complication, yet predictive risk factors for postoperative delirium severity remain elusive. We hypothesized that the NSQIP risk calculation for serious complications (NSQIP-SC) or risk of death (NSQIP-D), and cognitive tests of executive function (Trail Making Tests A and B [TMTA and TMTB]), would be predictive of postoperative delirium severity. Further, we demonstrate how advanced statistical techniques can be used to identify candidate predictors. METHODS/DESIGN: Data from an ongoing perioperative prospective cohort study of 100 adults (65\u00a0y old or older) undergoing noncardiac surgery were analyzed. In addition to NSQIP-SC, NSQIP-D, TMTA, and TMTB, participant age, sex, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score, tobacco use, surgery type, depression, Framingham risk score, and preoperative blood pressure were collected. The Delirium Rating Scale-R-98 (DRS) measured delirium severity; the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) identified delirium. LASSO and best subsets linear regression were employed to identify predictive risk factors. RESULTS: Ninety-seven participants with a mean age of 71.68\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.55, 55% male (31/97 CAM+, 32%), and a mean peak DRS of 21.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.40 were analyzed. LASSO and best subsets regression identified NSQIP-SC and TMTB to predict postoperative delirium severity (P\u00a0<\u00a000.001, adjusted R2 : 0.30). NSQIP-SC and TMTB were also selected as predictors for postoperative delirium incidence (AUROC 0.81, 95% CI, 0.72-0.90). CONCLUSIONS: In this cohort, we identified NSQIP risk score for serious complications and a measure of executive function, TMT-B, to predict postoperative delirium severity using advanced modeling techniques. Future studies should investigate the utility of these variables in a formal delirium severity prediction model. ",
        "LIF regulates CXCL9 in tumor-associated macrophages and prevents CD8+ T cell tumor-infiltration impairing anti-PD1 therapy. Cancer response to immunotherapy depends on the infiltration of CD8+ T cells and the presence of tumor-associated macrophages within tumors. Still, little is known about the determinants of these factors. We show that LIF assumes a crucial role in the regulation of CD8+ T cell tumor infiltration, while promoting the presence of protumoral tumor-associated macrophages. We observe that the blockade of LIF in tumors expressing high levels of LIF decreases CD206, CD163 and CCL2 and induces CXCL9 expression in tumor-associated macrophages. The blockade of LIF releases the epigenetic silencing of CXCL9 triggering CD8+ T cell tumor infiltration. The combination of LIF neutralizing antibodies with the inhibition of the PD1 immune checkpoint promotes tumor regression, immunological memory and an increase in overall survival. ",
        "Preimplant Phosphodiesterase-5 Inhibitor Use Is Associated With Higher Rates of Severe Early Right Heart Failure After Left Ventricular Assist Device Implantation. Background Early right heart failure (RHF) occurs commonly in left ventricular assist device (LVAD) recipients, and increased right ventricular (RV) afterload may contribute. Selective pulmonary vasodilators, like phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors (PDE5i), are used off-label to reduce RV afterload before LVAD implantation, but the association between preoperative PDE5i use and early RHF after LVAD is unknown. Methods and Results We analyzed adult patients from the INTERMACS registry (Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support) who received a continuous flow LVAD after 2012. Patients on PDE5i were propensity-matched 1:1 to controls. The primary outcome was the incidence of severe early RHF, defined as the composite of death from RHF within 30 days, need for RV assist device support within 30 days, or use of inotropes beyond 14 days. Of 11\u2009544 continuous flow LVAD recipients, 1199 (10.4%) received preoperative PDE5i. Compared to controls, patients on PDE5i had higher pulmonary artery systolic pressure (53.4 mm\u2009Hg versus 49.5 mm\u2009Hg) and pulmonary vascular resistance (2.6 WU versus 2.3 WU; P<0.001 for both). Before propensity matching, the incidence of severe early RHF was higher among patients on PDE5i than in controls (29.4% versus 23.1%; unadjusted odds ratio (OR), 1.32; 95% CI, 1.17-1.50). This association persisted after propensity matching (PDE5i, 28.9% versus control 23.7%; OR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.09-1.57), driven by a higher incidence of prolonged inotropic support. Similar results were observed across a wide range of subgroups stratified by markers of pulmonary vascular disease and RV dysfunction. Conclusions Patients treated with preoperative PDE5i had markers of increased RV afterload and HF severity compared to unmatched controls. Even after propensity matching, patients receiving preimplant PDE5i therapy had higher rates of post-LVAD RHF. ",
        "Association between cannabis laws and opioid prescriptions among privately insured adults in the US. We examine the association between opioid prescription patterns in privately insured adults and changes in state cannabis laws among five age groups (18-25, 26-35 36-45, 46-55 and 56-64\u202fyears). Using the 2016 Clinformatics Data Mart, a nationwide commercial health insurance database, we performed a cross-sectional analysis of two types of opioid prescribing (>30-day and >90-day prescriptions) among all adults aged 18-64 based on the stringency of cannabis laws. We found a significant interaction between age and cannabis law on opioid prescriptions. Age-stratified multilevel multivariable analyses showed lower opioid prescription rates in the four younger age groups only in states with medical cannabis laws, when considering both >30\u202fday and >90\u202fday opioid use [>30\u202fday adjusted odds ratio (aOR)\u202f=\u202f0.56, in 18-25, aOR\u202f=\u202f0.67 in 26-35, aOR\u202f=\u202f0.67 in 36-45, and aOR\u202f=\u202f0.76 in 46-54\u202fyears; >90\u202fday aOR\u202f=\u202f0.56, in 18-25, aOR\u202f=\u202f0.68 in 26-35, aOR\u202f=\u202f0.69 in 36-45, and aOR\u202f=\u202f0.77 in 46-54\u202fyears, P\u202f<\u202f0.0001 for all]. This association was not significant in the oldest age group of 55-64\u202fyears. There was no significant association between opioid prescriptions and other categories of cannabis laws (recreational use and decriminalization) in any of the age groups studied. ",
        "The Toxic Triad: Childhood Exposure to Parental Domestic Violence, Parental Addictions, and Parental Mental Illness as Factors Associated With Childhood Physical Abuse. Childhood physical abuse can result in serious behavioral, mental health, and physical health conditions. There is a need for improved strategies to identify households in which childhood physical abuse occurs. This article explores three potential correlates of childhood physical abuse: childhood exposure to parental domestic violence, parental addictions, and parental mental illness. Secondary analyses were conducted using the regionally representative 2010 Brief Risk Factor Surveillance Survey (BRFSS) of adults ( n = 9,241 men, n = 13,627 women) and the analyses were replicated in the 2012 BRFSS ( n = 11,656 men, n = 18,145 women). Bivariate and logistic regression analyses were conducted. Approximately one-quarter of the sample was Hispanic and/or Non-White. In 2010, 78.3% of men who had been exposed to all three of these early adversities reported that they had experienced childhood physical abuse compared with 7.5% of males who did not experience these adversities. Women reported similar levels of childhood physical abuse (66.9% for those reporting all three factors, 5.9% for those with zero risk factors). The 2012 BRFSS analyses resulted in comparable findings. Domestic violence, even in the absence of parental addictions and mental illness, was associated with a high prevalence of childhood physical abuse (between 34% and 38%). Currently, the World Health Organization cautions against routine screening for child abuse due to the high rate of false positives. We propose a two-step strategy to improve targeting: first, identifying households in which two or more adversities exist, and subsequently screening children in these households. Our findings will help improve the targeting of screening and outreach efforts to children most at risk, thereby minimizing the risk of false positives. Our data provide support for universal screening for childhood physical abuse in cases of domestic violence, particularly for those families where parental addictions and/or parental mental illness also exist.

        "Symbiotic Macrophage-Glioma Cell Interactions Reveal Synthetic Lethality in PTEN-Null Glioma. Heterotypic interactions across diverse cell types can enable tumor progression and hold the potential to expand therapeutic interventions. Here, combined profiling and functional studies of glioma cells in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) models establish that PTEN deficiency activates YAP1, which directly upregulates lysyl oxidase (LOX) expression. Mechanistically, secreted LOX functions as a potent macrophage chemoattractant via activation of the \u03b21 integrin-PYK2 pathway in macrophages. These infiltrating macrophages secrete SPP1, which sustains glioma cell survival and stimulates angiogenesis. In PTEN-null GBM models, LOX inhibition markedly suppresses macrophage infiltration and tumor progression. Correspondingly, YAP1-LOX and \u03b21 integrin-SPP1 signaling correlates positively with higher macrophage density and lower overall survival in GBM patients. This symbiotic glioma-macrophage interplay provides therapeutic targets specifically for PTEN-deficient GBM. ",
        "T cell receptor grafting allows virological control of Hepatitis B virus infection. T cell therapy is a promising means to treat chronic HBV infection and HBV-associated hepatocellular carcinoma. T cells engineered to express an HBV-specific T cell receptor (TCR) may achieve cure of HBV infection upon adoptive transfer. We investigated the therapeutic potential and safety of T cells stably expressing high affinity HBV envelope- or core-specific TCRs recognizing European and Asian HLA-A2 subtypes. Both CD8+ and CD4+ T cells from healthy donors and from chronic hepatitis B patients became polyfunctional effector cells when grafted with HBV-specific TCRs and eliminated HBV from infected HepG2-NTCP cell cultures. A single transfer of TCR-grafted T cells into HBV-infected, humanized mice controlled HBV infection and virological markers declined 4-5 log or below detection limit. When - as in a typical clinical setting - only a minority of hepatocytes were infected, engineered T cells specifically cleared infected hepatocytes without damaging non-infected cells. Cell death was compensated by hepatocyte proliferation and alanine amino transferase levels peaking at day 5 to 7 normalized again thereafter. Co-treatment with the entry inhibitor Myrcludex B ensured long-term control of HBV infection. Thus, T cells stably transduced with highly functional TCRs have the potential to mediate clearance of HBV-infected cells causing limited liver injury. ",
        "Risk and protective factors for transgender youths' substance use. Research at the intersection of substance use and protective factors among transgender youth is scarce; emerging evidence suggests high risk for substance use for transgender youth. We analyzed data from 323 transgender youth aged 14-18 (Mage\u202f=\u202f16.67) to investigate the extent that risk (enacted stigma) and protective factors (support from family, school, friends) were related to substance use (i.e., cannabis and tobacco use, binge drinking). Enacted stigma was linked to higher odds of substance use behaviors, family connectedness was related to lower levels of tobacco and cannabis use, and more than one protective factor significantly lowered the probability of engaging in substance use behaviors. Support from multiple sources may be differentially protective against substance use for transgender youth. ",
        "Assessment of Toxic Effects of Ochratoxin A in Human Embryonic Stem Cells. Ochratoxin A (OTA) is a mycotoxin produced by different Aspergillus and Penicillium species, and it is considered a common contaminant in food and animal feed worldwide. On the other hand, human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) have been suggested as a valuable model for evaluating drug embryotoxicity. In this study, we have evaluated potentially toxic effects of OTA in hESCs. By using in vitro culture techniques, specific cellular markers, and molecular biology procedures, we found that OTA produces mild cytotoxic effects in hESCs by inhibiting cell attachment, survival, and proliferation in a dose-dependent manner. Thus, we suggest that hESCs provide a valuable human and cellular model for toxicological studies regarding preimplantation stage of human fetal development. ",
        "Users Of Veteran-Directed Care And Other Purchased Care Have Similar Hospital Use And Costs Over Time. The Veteran-Directed Care (VDC) program facilitates independent community living among adults with multiple chronic conditions and functional limitations. Family caregivers value the choice and flexibility afforded by VDC, but rigorous evidence to support its impact on health care costs and use is needed. We identified veterans enrolled in VDC in fiscal year 2017 and investigated differences in hospital admissions and costs after initial receipt of VDC services. We compared VDC service recipients to a matched comparison group of veterans receiving homemaker or home health aide, home respite, and adult day health care services and found similar decreases in hospital use and costs from before to after enrollment in the groups. Further investigation into trends of nursing home use, identification of veterans most likely to benefit from VDC, and relative costs of operating VDC versus other purchased care programs is needed, but our results suggest that VDC remains a valuable option for supporting veterans and caregivers.

        "Effect of Fluoxetine on Obsessive-Compulsive Behaviors in Children and Adolescents With Autism Spectrum Disorders: A Randomized Clinical Trial. Importance: Selective serotonin receptor inhibitors are prescribed to reduce the severity of core behaviors of autism spectrum disorders, but their efficacy remains uncertain. Objective: To determine the efficacy of fluoxetine for reducing the frequency and severity of obsessive-compulsive behaviors in autism spectrum disorders. Design, Setting, and Participants: Multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial. Participants aged 7.5-18 years with autism spectrum disorders and a total score of 6 or higher on the Children's Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale, modified for pervasive developmental disorder (CYBOCS-PDD) were recruited from 3 tertiary health centers across Australia. Enrollment began November 2010 and ended April 2017. Follow-up ended August 2017. Interventions: Participants were randomized to receive fluoxetine (n\u2009=\u200975) or placebo (n\u2009=\u200971). Study medication was commenced at 4 or 8 mg/d for the first week, depending on weight, and then titrated to a maximum dose of 20 or 30 mg/d over 4 weeks. Treatment duration was 16 weeks. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was the total score on the CYBOCS-PDD (scores range from 0-20; higher scores indicate higher levels of maladaptive behaviors; minimal clinically important difference, 2 points) at 16 weeks postrandomization, analyzed with a linear regression model adjusted for stratification factors (site, age at baseline, and intellectual disability), with an additional prespecified model that included additional adjustment for baseline score, sex, communication level, and imbalanced baseline and demographic variables. Results: Among the 146 participants who were randomized (85% males; mean age, 11.2 years), 109 completed the trial; 31 in the fluoxetine group and 21 in the placebo group dropped out or did not complete treatment. The mean CYBOCS-PDD score from baseline to 16 weeks decreased in the fluoxetine group from 12.80 to 9.02 points (3.72-point decrease; 95% CI, -4.85 to -2.60) and in the placebo group from 13.13 to 10.89 points (2.53-point decrease; 95% CI, -3.86 to -1.19). The between-group mean difference at 16 weeks was -2.01 (95% CI, -3.77 to -0.25; P\u2009=\u2009.03) (adjusted for stratification factors), and in the prespecified model with further adjustment, it was -1.17 (95% CI, -3.01 to 0.67; P\u2009=\u2009.21). Conclusions and Relevance: In this preliminary study of children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorders, treatment with fluoxetine compared with placebo resulted in significantly lower scores for obsessive-compulsive behaviors at 16 weeks. Interpretation is limited by the high dropout rate, null findings of prespecified analyses that accounted for potentially confounding factors and baseline imbalances, and CIs for the treatment effect that included the minimal clinically important difference.

        "Intracortical Dynamics Underlying Repetitive Stimulation Predicts Changes in Network Connectivity. Targeted stimulation can be used to modulate the activity of brain networks. Previously we demonstrated that direct electrical stimulation produces predictable poststimulation changes in brain excitability. However, understanding the neural dynamics during stimulation and its relationship to poststimulation effects is limited but critical for treatment optimization. Here, we applied 10 Hz direct electrical stimulation across several cortical regions in 14 human subjects (6 males) implanted with intracranial electrodes for seizure monitoring. The stimulation train was characterized by a consistent increase in high gamma (70-170 Hz) power. Immediately post-train, low-frequency (1-8 Hz) power increased, resulting in an evoked response that was highly correlated with the neural response during stimulation. Using two measures of network connectivity, corticocortical evoked potentials (indexing effective connectivity), and theta coherence (indexing functional connectivity), we found a stronger response to stimulation in regions that were highly connected to the stimulation site. In these regions, repeated cycles of stimulation trains and rest progressively altered the stimulation response. Finally, after just 2 min (\u223c10%) of repetitive stimulation, we were able to predict poststimulation connectivity changes with high discriminability. Together, this work reveals a relationship between stimulation dynamics and poststimulation connectivity changes in humans. Thus, measuring neural activity during stimulation can inform future plasticity-inducing protocols.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Brain stimulation tools have the potential to revolutionize the treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders. Despite the widespread use of brain stimulation techniques such as transcranial magnetic stimulation, the therapeutic efficacy of these technologies remains suboptimal. This is in part because of a lack of understanding of the dynamic neural changes that occur during stimulation. In this study, we provide the first detailed characterization of neural activity during plasticity induction through intracranial electrode stimulation and recording in 14 medication-resistant epilepsy patients. These results fill a missing gap in our understanding of stimulation-induced plasticity in humans. In the longer-term, these data will also guide our translational efforts toward non-invasive, personalized, closed-loop neuromodulation therapy for neurological and psychiatric disorders in humans.

        "A Pilot Trial of Molecularly Tailored Therapy for Patients with Metastatic Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma. Purpose: Despite the wide adoption of tumor molecular profiling, there is a dearth of evidence linking molecular biomarkers for treatment selection to prediction of treatment outcomes in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer. We initiated a pilot study to test the feasibility of designing a larger phase II trial of molecularly tailored treatment for metastatic pancreatic cancer. Methods: Our study aimed to assess the feasibility of following a treatment algorithm based on the expression of three published predictive markers of response to chemotherapy: ribonucleotide reductase catalytic subunit M1 (for gemcitabine); excision repair cross-complementation group 1 (for platinum agents); and thymidylate synthase (for 5-fluorouracil) in patients with untreated, metastatic pancreatic cancer. Results of the tumor biopsy analysis were used to assign patients to one of seven doublet regimens. Key secondary objectives included response rate (RR), disease control rate (DCR), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS). Results: Between December 2012 and March 2015, 30 patients were enrolled into the study. Ten patients failed screening primarily due to inadequate tumor tissue availability. Of the remaining 20 patients, 19 were assigned into 6 different chemotherapy doublets, and achieved an RR of 28%, with a DCR rate of 78%. The median PFS and OS were 5.78 and 8.21 months, respectively. Conclusions: The incorporation of biomarkers into a treatment algorithm is feasible and resulted in a PFS and OS similar to other doublet therapies for patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer. Based on the results from this pilot study, a larger phase II randomized trial of molecularly targeted therapy versus physicians' choice of standard of care has been initiated in the second-line setting (NCT02967770).

        "Association of Exposure to Artificial Light at Night While Sleeping With Risk of Obesity in Women. Importance: Short sleep has been associated with obesity, but to date the association between exposure to artificial light at night (ALAN) while sleeping and obesity is unknown. Objective: To determine whether ALAN exposure while sleeping is associated with the prevalence and risk of obesity. Design, Setting, and Participants: This baseline and prospective analysis included women aged 35 to 74 years enrolled in the Sister Study in all 50 US states and Puerto Rico from July 2003 through March 2009. Follow-up was completed on August 14, 2015. A total of 43\u202f722 women with no history of cancer or cardiovascular disease who were not shift workers, daytime sleepers, or pregnant at baseline were included in the analysis. Data were analyzed from September 1, 2017, through December 31, 2018. Exposures: Artificial light at night while sleeping reported at enrollment, categorized as no light, small nightlight in the room, light outside the room, and light or television in the room. Main Outcomes and Measures: Prevalent obesity at baseline was based on measured general obesity (body mass index [BMI] \u226530.0) and central obesity (waist circumference [WC] \u226588 cm, waist-to-hip ratio [WHR] \u22650.85, or waist-to-height ratio [WHtR]\u22650.5). To evaluate incident overweight and obesity, self-reported BMI at enrollment was compared with self-reported BMI at follow-up (mean [SD] follow-up,\u20095.7 [1.0] years). Generalized log-linear models with robust error variance were used to estimate multivariable-adjusted prevalence ratios (PRs) and relative risks (RRs) with 95% CIs for prevalent and incident obesity. Results: Among the population of 43 722 women (mean [SD] age, 55.4 [8.9] years), having any ALAN exposure while sleeping was positively associated with a higher prevalence of obesity at baseline, as measured using BMI (PR, 1.03; 95% CI, 1.02-1.03), WC (PR, 1.12; 95% CI, 1.09-1.16), WHR (PR, 1.04; 95% CI, 1.00-1.08), and WHtR (PR, 1.07; 95% CI, 1.04-1.09), after adjusting for confounding factors, with P\u2009<\u2009.001 for trend for each measure. Having any ALAN exposure while sleeping was also associated with incident obesity (RR, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.06-1.34). Compared with no ALAN, sleeping with a television or a light on in the room was associated with gaining 5 kg or more (RR, 1.17; 95% CI, 1.08-1.27; P\u2009<\u2009.001 for trend), a BMI increase of 10% or more (RR, 1.13; 95% CI, 1.02-1.26; P\u2009=\u2009.04 for trend), incident overweight (RR, 1.22; 95% CI,1.06-1.40;\u2009P\u2009=\u2009.03 for trend), and incident obesity (RR, 1.33; 95% CI, 1.13-1.57; P\u2009<\u2009.001 for trend). Results were supported by sensitivity analyses and additional multivariable analyses including potential mediators such as sleep duration and quality, diet, and physical activity. Conclusions and Relevance: These results suggest that exposure to ALAN while sleeping may be a risk factor for weight gain and development of overweight or obesity. Further prospective and interventional studies could help elucidate this association and clarify whether lowering exposure to ALAN while sleeping can promote obesity prevention. ",

A computer algorithm generated a personalised lifestyle prescription for a home-based programme accompanied by supporting resources. The health assessment was repeated 12 weeks later and support phone calls were provided at weeks 1 and 6. PARTICIPANTS: 116 men who completed treatment for prostate cancer. OUTCOME MEASURES: The feasibility and acceptability of the intervention and the delivery model were assessed by evaluating study processes (rate of participant recruitment, consent, retention and adverse events), by analysing delivery data and semi-structured interviews with participants and by focus groups with pharmacy teams. Physical activity (measured with accelerometry at baseline, 3 and 6\u2009months) and patient reported outcomes (activation, dietary intake and quality of life) were evaluated. Change in physical activity was used to inform the sample size calculations for a future trial. RESULTS: Out of 403 invited men, 172 (43%) responded and 116 (29%) participated. Of these, 99 (85%) completed the intervention and 88 (76%) completed the 6-month follow-up (attrition 24%). Certain components of the intervention were feasible and acceptable (eg, community pharmacy delivery), while others were more challenging (eg, fitness assessment) and will be refined for future studies. By 3\u2009months, moderate to vigorous physical activity increased on average by 34\u2009min (95%\u2009CI 6 to 62, p=0.018), but this was not sustained over 6\u2009months. CONCLUSIONS: The community pharmacy intervention was feasible and acceptable. Results are encouraging and warrant a definitive trial to assess the effectiveness of the refined intervention. ",
        "Electronic Consultations in Allergy/Immunology. BACKGROUND: Allergic condition management more often requires allergist guidance than allergy testing; necessary testing may be unavailable at initial drug allergy consultations. Electronic consultations (e-consults) provide expedited, problem-focused, potentially cost-saving care in other medical specialties, but have not yet been studied in Allergy/Immunology. OBJECTIVE: To describe e-consult use at an academic allergy/immunology practice. METHODS: E-consult data (August 10, 2016 through July 31, 2018) and in-person consult data (August 1, 2014 through July 31, 2018) were reviewed to determine consult volume, outcomes, indications, and timing. Referral reasons and wait times were compared with chi-square tests. RESULTS: E-consults grew from 1% to 10% of all new consults, with concurrent growth in in-person consults. Of 306 completed e-consults, 41 (13.4%) made diagnostic, therapeutic, or alternative referral recommendations, with 30 (73%) recommendations followed; 183 (59.8%) patients required an in-person Allergy/Immunology consult, and only 5 (<2%) patients saw an allergist without an e-consult recommendation to do so. E-consults were used more often than in-person consults for adverse drug reactions (66% vs 9%; P < .001), especially penicillin allergy (132, 61% of all e-consults) and immunodeficiency (15% vs 2%; P < .001). Allergists completed e-consults in a median of 11 minutes, with a median turnaround time of 22 hours. E-consult implementation was associated with a decreased median in-person consult wait time (1.5 fewer calendar days; P < .05). CONCLUSIONS: E-consults were increasingly used, particularly for historical adverse drug reactions and immunodeficiency. Implementation of an e-consult program resulted in decreased in-person wait times despite an increase in overall consult volume, supporting this model's ability to provide expedited, problem-focused care.

        "Common Genetic Variations Associated with the Persistence of Immunity following Childhood Immunization. Vaccines have revolutionized public health, preventing millions of deaths each year, particularly in childhood.\u00a0Yet, there is considerable variability in the magnitude and persistence of vaccine-induced immunity. Maintenance of specific antibody is essential for continuity of vaccine-induced serological protection. We conducted a genome-wide association study into the persistence of immunity to three childhood vaccines: capsular group C meningococcal (MenC), Haemophilus influenzae type b, and tetanus toxoid (TT) vaccines. We detail associations between variants in a locus containing a family of signal-regulatory proteins and the persistence MenC immunity. We postulate a regulatory role for the lead SNP, with supporting epigenetic and expression quantitative trait loci data. Furthermore, we define associations between SNPs in the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) locus and the persistence of TT-specific immunity. Moreover, we describe four classical HLA alleles, HLA DRB1\u22170301, HLA DQB1\u22170201, HLA DQB1\u22170602, and HLA DRB1\u22171501, associated with TT-specific immunity, independent of the lead SNP association.

        "CXCR4 regulates Plasmodium development in mouse and human hepatocytes. The liver stage of the etiological agent of malaria, Plasmodium, is obligatory for successful infection of its various mammalian hosts. Differentiation of the rod-shaped sporozoites of Plasmodium into spherical exoerythrocytic forms (EEFs) via bulbous expansion is essential for parasite development in the liver. However, little is known about the host factors regulating the morphological transformation of Plasmodium sporozoites in this organ. Here, we show that sporozoite differentiation into EEFs in the liver involves protein kinase C \u03b6-mediated NF-\u03baB activation, which robustly induces the expression of C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4) in hepatocytes and subsequently elevates intracellular Ca2+ levels, thereby triggering sporozoite transformation into EEFs. Blocking CXCR4 expression by genetic or pharmacological intervention profoundly inhibited the liver-stage development of the Plasmodium berghei rodent malaria parasite and the human Plasmodium falciparum parasite. Collectively, our experiments show that CXCR4 is a key host factor for Plasmodium development in the liver, and CXCR4 warrants further investigation for malaria prophylaxis. ",
        "Impact of Consensus Molecular Subtype on Survival in Patients With Metastatic Colorectal Cancer: Results From CALGB/SWOG 80405 (Alliance). PURPOSE: To determine the predictive and prognostic value of the consensus molecular subtypes (CMSs) of colorectal cancer (CRC) that represent a merging of gene expression-based features largely in primary tumors from six independent classification systems and provide a framework for capturing the intrinsic heterogeneity of CRC in patients enrolled in CALGB/SWOG 80405. PATIENTS AND METHODS: CALGB/SWOG 80405 is a phase III trial that compared the addition of bevacizumab or cetuximab to infusional fluorouracil, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin or fluorouracil, leucovorin, and irinotecan as first-line treatment of advanced CRC. We characterized the CMS classification using a novel NanoString gene expression panel on primary CRCs from 581 patients enrolled in this study to assess the prognostic and predictive value of CMSs in these patients. RESULTS: The CMSs are highly prognostic for overall survival (OS; P < .001) and progression-free survival (PFS; P < .001). Furthermore, CMSs were predictive for both OS (P for interaction < .001) and PFS (P for interaction = .0032). In the CMS1 cohort, patients treated with bevacizumab had a significantly longer OS than those treated with cetuximab (P < .001). In the CMS2 cohort, patients treated with cetuximab had a significantly longer OS than patients treated with bevacizumab (P = .0046). CONCLUSION: These findings highlight the possible clinical utility of CMSs and suggests that refinement of the CMS classification may provide a path toward identifying patients with metastatic CRC who are most likely to benefit from specific targeted therapy as part of the initial treatment.

        "Autologous, micro-fragmented adipose tissue as a treatment for chronic shoulder pain in a wheelchair using individual with spinal cord injury: a case report. Introduction: Shoulder pain is common in persons with chronic spinal cord injury (SCI), with a prevalence reported as high as 70%. Current treatment of shoulder pain includes conservative measures such as physical therapy, pain medications, patient education, injections, and assistive devices. When conservative treatments fail, shoulder surgery is often the next option. Unfortunately, outcomes after shoulder surgery in persons with SCI are limited and conflicting. Case presentation: This is a case of a 54-year-old right-handed male with T10 complete SCI (duration of injury\u2009=\u200910 years) who had a complaint of right-sided shoulder pain for 3 years. The individual used a manual wheelchair as his primary means of mobility and was an avid weight-lifter. Physical examination and MRI demonstrated a rotator cuff tear and degenerative changes of the acromioclavicular joint. He was previously managed conservatively with physical therapy and intermittent corticosteroid injections but failed to improve. He was enrolled in an IRB approved study and underwent an ultrasound-guided injection with autologous, micro-fragmented adipose tissue (MFAT) and ultimately received improvements in pain and function that were maintained a year after treatment. Discussion: To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of treatment of chronic refractory shoulder pain in a person with SCI using MFAT. Complete relief from pain was maintained at the 1-year follow-up. Injection of MFAT under ultrasound guidance is an effective and promising treatment for chronic refractory shoulder pain in upper limb-dependent persons with SCI and warrants further research. ",
        "Tetraploidy causes chromosomal instability in acentriolar mouse embryos. Tetraploidisation is considered a common event in the evolution of chromosomal instability (CIN) in cancer cells. The current model for how tetraploidy drives CIN in mammalian cells is that a doubling of the number of centrioles that accompany the genome doubling event leads to multipolar spindle formation and chromosome segregation errors. By exploiting the unusual scenario of mouse blastomeres, which lack centrioles until the ~64-cell stage, we show that tetraploidy can drive CIN by an entirely distinct mechanism. Tetraploid blastomeres assemble bipolar spindles dictated by microtubule organising centres, and multipolar spindles are rare. Rather, kinetochore-microtubule turnover is altered, leading to microtubule attachment defects and anaphase chromosome segregation errors. The resulting blastomeres become chromosomally unstable and exhibit a dramatic increase in whole chromosome aneuploidies. Our results thus reveal an unexpected mechanism by which tetraploidy drives CIN, in which the acquisition of chromosomally-unstable microtubule dynamics contributes to chromosome segregation errors following tetraploidisation.

        "Pro-Angiogenic Macrophage Phenotype to Promote Myocardial Repair. BACKGROUND: Heart failure following myocardial infarction (MI) remains one of the major causes of death worldwide, and its treatment is a crucial challenge of cardiovascular medicine. An attractive therapeutic strategy is to stimulate endogenous mechanisms of myocardial regeneration. OBJECTIVES: This study evaluates the potential therapeutic treatment with annexin A1 (AnxA1) to induce cardiac repair after MI. METHODS: AnxA1 knockout (AnxA1-/-) and wild-type mice underwent MI induced by ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery. Cardiac functionality was assessed by longitudinal echocardiographic measurements. Histological, fluorescence-activated cell sorting, dot blot analysis, and in\u00a0vitro/ex\u00a0vivo studies were used to assess the myocardial neovascularization, macrophage content, and activity in response to AnxA1. RESULTS: AnxA1-/- mice showed a reduced cardiac functionality and an expansion of proinflammatory macrophages in the ischemic area. Cardiac macrophages from AnxA1-/- mice exhibited a dramatically reduced ability to release the proangiogenic mediator vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A. However, AnxA1 treatment enhanced VEGF-A release from cardiac macrophages, and its delivery in\u00a0vivo markedly improved cardiac performance. The positive effect of AnxA1 treatment on cardiac performance was abolished in wild-type mice transplanted with bone marrow derived from Cx3cr1creERT2Vegfflox/flox or in mice depleted of macrophages. Similarly, cardioprotective effects of AnxA1 were obtained in pigs in which full-length AnxA1 was overexpressed by use of a cardiotropic adeno-associated virus. CONCLUSIONS: AnxA1 has a direct action on cardiac macrophage polarization toward a pro-angiogenic, reparative phenotype. AnxA1 stimulated cardiac macrophages to release high amounts of VEGF-A, thus inducing neovascularization and cardiac repair. ",
        "Maternal drug-related death and suicide are leading causes of postpartum death in California. BACKGROUND: Reducing maternal mortality is a priority in the United States and worldwide. Drug-related deaths and suicide may account for a substantial and growing portion of maternal deaths, yet information on the incidence of and sociodemographic variation in these deaths is scarce. OBJECTIVE: We sought to examine incidence of drug-related and suicide deaths in the 12 months after delivery, including heterogeneity by sociodemographic factors. We also explored maternal decedents' health care utilization prior to death. STUDY DESIGN: This retrospective, population-based cohort study followed up 1,059,713 women who delivered a live-born infant in California hospitals during 2010-2012 to ascertain maternal death. Analyses were conducted using statewide, all-payer, longitudinally-linked hospital and death data. RESULTS: A total of 300 women died during follow-up, a rate of 28.33 deaths per 100,000 person-years. The leading cause of death was obstetric-related problems (6.52 per 100,000 person-years). Drug-related deaths were the second leading cause of death (3.68 per 100,000 person-years), and suicide was the seventh leading cause (1.42 per 100,000 person-years); together these deaths comprised 18% of all maternal deaths. Non-Hispanic white women, Medicaid-insured women, and women residing in micropolitan areas were especially likely to die from drugs/suicide. Two thirds of women who died, including 74% of those who died by drugs/suicide, made \u22651 emergency department or hospital visit between their delivery and death. CONCLUSION: Deaths caused by drugs and suicide are a major contributor to mortality in the postpartum period and warrant increased clinical attention, including recognition by physicians and Maternal Mortality Review Committees as a medical cause of death. Importantly, emergency department and inpatient hospital visits may serve as a point of identification of, and eventually prevention for, women at risk for these deaths. ",
        "Remote poststroke headache in children: Characteristics and association with stroke recurrence. Background: New-onset headache after stroke is common among adult stroke survivors. However, pediatric data are limited. The primary aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of new-headache after pediatric ischemic stroke. Secondary outcomes were to describe the characteristics of patients experiencing poststroke headache and the association between poststroke headache and stroke recurrence. Methods: We conducted a single-center retrospective study on children aged 30 days to 18 years with a confirmed radiographic diagnosis of arterial ischemic stroke (AIS) from January 1, 2008, to December 31, 2016. Patients were identified from an internal database, with additional data abstracted from the electronic medical record. Poststroke headache (occurring >30 days after stroke) was identified through electronic searches of the medical record and confirmed by chart review. Results: Of 115 patients with confirmed AIS, 41 (36%) experienced poststroke headache, with headache developing a median of 6 months after stroke. Fifty-one percent of patients with poststroke headache presented to the emergency department for headache evaluation; 81% of the patients had an inpatient admission for headache. Older age at stroke (odds ratio [OR] 21.5; p = 0.0001) and arteriopathy (OR 8.65; p = 0.0029) were associated with development of poststroke headache in a multivariable analysis. Seventeen patients (15%) had a recurrent stroke during the study period. Poststroke headache was associated with greater risk for stroke recurrence (p = 0.049). Conclusions: Remote poststroke headache is a common morbidity among pediatric stroke survivors, particularly in older children. Headaches may increase health care utilization, including neuroimaging and hospital admissions. We identified a possible association between poststroke headache and stroke recurrence. ",
        "Defining \u03b1-synuclein species responsible for Parkinson's disease phenotypes in mice. Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by fibrillar neuronal inclusions composed of aggregated \u03b1-synuclein (\u03b1-syn). These inclusions are associated with behavioral and pathological PD phenotypes. One strategy for therapeutic interventions is to prevent the formation of these inclusions to halt disease progression. \u03b1-Synuclein exists in multiple structural forms, including disordered, nonamyloid oligomers, ordered amyloid oligomers, and fibrils. It is critical to understand which conformers contribute to specific PD phenotypes. Here, we utilized a mouse model to explore the pathological effects of stable \u03b2-amyloid-sheet oligomers compared with those of fibrillar \u03b1-synuclein. We biophysically characterized these species with transmission EM, atomic-force microscopy, CD spectroscopy, FTIR spectroscopy, analytical ultracentrifugation, and thioflavin T assays. We then injected these different \u03b1-synuclein forms into the mouse striatum to determine their ability to induce PD-related phenotypes. We found that \u03b2-sheet oligomers produce a small but significant loss of dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc). Injection of small \u03b2-sheet fibril fragments, however, produced the most robust phenotypes, including reduction of striatal dopamine terminals, SNc loss of dopamine neurons, and motor-behavior defects. We conclude that although the \u03b2-sheet oligomers cause some toxicity, the potent effects of the short fibrillar fragments can be attributed to their ability to recruit monomeric \u03b1-synuclein and spread in vivo and hence contribute to the development of PD-like phenotypes. These results suggest that strategies to reduce the formation and propagation of \u03b2-sheet fibrillar species could be an important route for therapeutic intervention in PD and related disorders.

        "Government policy interventions to reduce human antimicrobial use: A systematic review and evidence map. BACKGROUND: Growing political attention to antimicrobial resistance (AMR) offers a rare opportunity for achieving meaningful action. Many governments have developed national AMR action plans, but most have not yet implemented policy interventions to reduce antimicrobial overuse. A systematic evidence map can support governments in making evidence-informed decisions about implementing programs to reduce AMR, by identifying, describing, and assessing the full range of evaluated government policy options to reduce antimicrobial use in humans. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Seven databases were searched from inception to January 28, 2019, (MEDLINE, CINAHL, EMBASE, PAIS Index, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Web of Science, and PubMed). We identified studies that (1) clearly described a government policy intervention aimed at reducing human antimicrobial use, and (2) applied a quantitative design to measure the impact. We found 69 unique evaluations of government policy interventions carried out across 4 of the 6 WHO regions. These evaluations included randomized controlled trials (n = 4), non-randomized controlled trials (n = 3), controlled before-and-after designs (n = 7), interrupted time series designs (n = 25), uncontrolled before-and-after designs (n = 18), descriptive designs (n = 10), and cohort designs (n = 2). From these we identified 17 unique policy options for governments to reduce the human use of antimicrobials. Many studies evaluated public awareness campaigns (n = 17) and antimicrobial guidelines (n = 13); however, others offered different policy options such as professional regulation, restricted reimbursement, pay for performance, and prescription requirements. Identifying these policies can inform the development of future policies and evaluations in different contexts and health systems. Limitations of our study include the possible omission of unpublished initiatives, and that policies not evaluated with respect to antimicrobial use have not been captured in this review. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge this is the first study to provide policy makers with synthesized evidence on specific government policy interventions addressing AMR. In the future, governments should ensure that AMR policy interventions are evaluated using rigorous study designs and that study results are published. PROTOCOL REGISTRATION: PROSPERO CRD42017067514.

        "Changes in rapid HIV treatment initiation after national \"treat all\" policy adoption in 6 sub-Saharan African countries: Regression discontinuity analysis. BACKGROUND: Most countries have formally adopted the World Health Organization's 2015 recommendation of universal HIV treatment (\"treat all\"). However, there are few rigorous assessments of the real-world impact of treat all policies on antiretroviral treatment (ART) uptake across different contexts. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We used longitudinal data for 814,603 patients enrolling in HIV care between 1 January 2004 and 10 July 2018 in 6 countries participating in the global International epidemiology Databases to Evaluate AIDS (IeDEA) consortium: Burundi (N = 11,176), Kenya (N = 179,941), Malawi (N = 84,558), Rwanda (N = 17,396), Uganda (N = 96,286), and Zambia (N = 425,246). Using a quasi-experimental regression discontinuity design, we assessed the change in the proportion initiating ART within 30 days of enrollment in HIV care (rapid ART initiation) after country-level adoption of the treat all policy. A modified Poisson model was used to identify factors associated with failure to initiate ART rapidly under treat all. In each of the 6 countries, over 60% of included patients were female, and median age at enrollment ranged from 32 to 36 years. In all countries studied, national adoption of treat all was associated with large increases in rapid ART initiation. Significant increases in rapid ART initiation immediately after treat all policy adoption were observed in Rwanda, from 44.4% to 78.9% of patients (34.5 percentage points [pp], 95% CI 27.2 to 41.7; p < 0.001), Kenya (25.7 pp, 95% CI 21.8 to 29.5; p < 0.001), Burundi (17.7 pp, 95% CI 6.5 to 28.9; p = 0.002), and Malawi (12.5 pp, 95% CI 7.5 to 17.5; p < 0.001), while no immediate increase was observed in Zambia (0.4 pp, 95% CI -2.9 to 3.8; p = 0.804) and Uganda (-4.2 pp, 95% CI -9.0 to 0.7; p = 0.090). The rate of rapid ART initiation accelerated sharply following treat all policy adoption in Malawi, Uganda, and Zambia; slowed in Kenya; and did not change in Rwanda and Burundi. In post hoc analyses restricted to patients enrolling under treat all, young adults (16-24 years) and men were at increased risk of not rapidly initiating ART (compared to older patients and women, respectively). However, rapid ART initiation following enrollment increased for all groups as more time elapsed since treat all policy adoption. Study limitations include incomplete data on potential ART eligibility criteria, such as clinical status, pregnancy, and enrollment CD4 count, which precluded the assessment of rapid ART initiation specifically among patients known to be eligible for ART before treat all. CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis indicates that adoption of treat all policies had a strong effect on increasing rates of rapid ART initiation, and that these increases followed different trajectories across the 6 countries. Young adults and men still require additional attention to further improve rapid ART initiation. ",
        "Curriculum-based outdoor learning for children aged 9-11: A qualitative analysis of pupils' and teachers' views. The relationship between child health, wellbeing and education demonstrates that healthier and happier children achieve higher educational attainment. An engaging curriculum that facilitates children in achieving their academic potential has strong implications for educational outcomes, future employment prospects, and health and wellbeing during adulthood. Outdoor learning is a pedagogical approach used to enrich learning, enhance school engagement and improve pupil health and wellbeing. However, its non-traditional means of achieving curricular aims are not yet recognised beyond the early years by education inspectorates. This requires evidence into its acceptability from those at the forefront of delivery. This study aimed to explore headteachers', teachers' and pupils' views and experiences of an outdoor learning programme within the key stage two curriculum (ages 9-11) in South Wales, United Kingdom. We examine the process of implementation to offer case study evidence through 1:1 interviews with headteachers (n = 3) and teachers (n = 10) and focus groups with pupils aged 9-11 (n = 10) from three primary schools. Interviews and focus groups were conducted at baseline and six months into implementation. Schools introduced regular outdoor learning within the curriculum. This study found a variety of perceived benefits for pupils and schools. Pupils and teachers noticed improvements in pupils' engagement with learning, concentration and behaviour, as well as positive impacts on health and wellbeing and teachers' job satisfaction. Curriculum demands including testing and evidencing work were barriers to implementation, in addition to safety concerns, resources and teacher confidence. Participants supported outdoor learning as a curriculum-based programme for older primary school pupils. However, embedding outdoor learning within the curriculum requires education inspectorates to place higher value on this approach in achieving curricular aims, alongside greater acknowledgment of the wider benefits to children which current measurements do not capture.

        "The association between maternal body mass index and child obesity: A systematic review and meta-analysis. BACKGROUND: There is a global obesity crisis, particularly among women and disadvantaged populations. Early-life intervention to prevent childhood obesity is a priority for public health, global health, and clinical practice. Understanding the association between childhood obesity and maternal pre-pregnancy weight status would inform policy and practice by allowing one to estimate the potential for offspring health gain through channelling resources into intervention. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to examine the dose-response association between maternal body mass index (BMI) and childhood obesity in the offspring. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Searches in MEDLINE, Child Development & Adolescent Studies, CINAHL, Embase, and PsycInfo were carried out in August 2017 and updated in March 2019. Supplementary searches included hand-searching reference lists, performing citation searching, and contacting authors. Two researchers carried out independent screening, data extraction, and quality assessment. Observational studies published in English and reporting associations between continuous and/or categorical maternal and child BMI or z-score were included. Categorical outcomes were child obesity (\u226595th percentile, primary outcome), overweight/obesity (\u226585th percentile), and overweight (85th to 95th percentile). Linear and nonlinear dose-response meta-analyses were conducted using random effects models. Studies that could not be included in meta-analyses were summarised narratively. Seventy-nine of 41,301 studies identified met the inclusion criteria (n = 59 cohorts). Meta-analyses of child obesity included 20 studies (n = 88,872); child overweight/obesity, 22 studies (n = 181,800); and overweight, 10 studies (n = 53,238). Associations were nonlinear and there were significantly increased odds of child obesity with maternal obesity (odds ratio [OR] 3.64, 95% CI 2.68-4.95) and maternal overweight (OR 1.89, 95% CI 1.62-2.19). Significantly increased odds were observed for child overweight/obesity (OR 2.69, 95% CI 2.10-3.46) and for child overweight (OR 1.80, 95% CI 1.25, 2.59) with maternal obesity. A limitation of this research is that the included studies did not always report the data in a format that enabled inclusion in this complex meta-analysis. CONCLUSIONS: This research has identified a 264% increase in the odds of child obesity when mothers have obesity before conception. This study provides substantial evidence for the need to develop interventions that commence prior to conception, to support women of childbearing age with weight management in order to halt intergenerational obesity.

        "Excitatory rubral cells encode the acquisition of novel complex motor tasks. The red nucleus (RN) is required for limb control, specifically fine motor coordination. There is some evidence for a role of the RN in reaching and grasping, mainly from lesion studies, but results so far have been inconsistent. In addition, the role of RN neurons in such learned motor functions at the level of synaptic transmission has been largely neglected. Here, we show that Vglut2-expressing RN neurons undergo plastic events and encode the optimization of fine movements. RN light-ablation severely impairs reaching and grasping functions while sparing general locomotion. We identify a neuronal population co-expressing Vglut2, PV and C1QL2, which specifically undergoes training-dependent plasticity. Selective chemo-genetic inhibition of these neurons perturbs reaching and grasping skills. Our study highlights the role of the\u00a0Vglut2-positive rubral population in complex fine motor tasks, with its related plasticity representing an important starting point for the investigation of mechanistic substrates of fine motor coordination training.

        "Transgenerational Bisphenol A Causes Deficits in Social Recognition and Alters Postsynaptic Density Genes in Mice. Bisphenol A (BPA) is a ubiquitous endocrine-disrupting chemical. Developmental exposure produces changes in behavior and gene expression in the brain. Here, we examined social recognition behaviors in mice from the third familial generation (F3) after exposure to gestational BPA. Second-generation mice were bred in one of four mating combinations to reveal whether characteristics in F3 were acquired via maternal or paternal exposures. After repeated habituation to the same mouse, offspring of dams from the BPA lineage failed to display increased investigation of a novel mouse. Genes involved in excitatory postsynaptic densities (PSDs) were examined in F3 brains using quantitative PCR. Differential expression of genes important for function and stability of PSDs were assessed at three developmental ages. Several related PSD genes-SH3 and multiple ankyrin repeat domains 1 (Shank1), Homer scaffolding protein 1c (Homer1c), DLG associated protein 1 (Gkap), and discs large MAGUK scaffold protein 4 (PSD95)-were differentially expressed in control- vs BPA-lineage brains. Using a second strain of F3 inbred mice exposed to BPA, we noted the same differences in Shank1 and PSD95 expression in C57BL/6J mice. In sum, transgenerational BPA exposure disrupted social interactions in mice and dysregulated normal expression of PSD genes during neural development. The fact that the same genetic effects were found in two different mouse strains and in several brain regions increased potential for translation. The genetic and functional relationship between PSD and abnormal neurobehavioral disorders is well established, and our data suggest that BPA may contribute in a transgenerational manner to neurodevelopmental diseases.

        "Cell competition corrects noisy Wnt morphogen gradients to achieve robust patterning in the zebrafish embryo. Morphogen signalling forms an activity gradient and instructs cell identities in a signalling strength-dependent manner to pattern developing tissues. However, developing tissues also undergo dynamic morphogenesis, which may produce cells with unfit morphogen signalling and consequent noisy morphogen gradients. Here we show that a cell competition-related system corrects such noisy morphogen gradients. Zebrafish imaging analyses of the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signalling gradient, which acts as a morphogen to establish embryonic anterior-posterior patterning, identify that unfit cells with abnormal Wnt/\u03b2-catenin activity spontaneously appear and produce noise in the gradient. Communication between unfit and neighbouring fit cells via cadherin proteins stimulates apoptosis of the unfit cells by activating Smad signalling and reactive oxygen species production. This unfit cell elimination is required for proper Wnt/\u03b2-catenin gradient formation and consequent anterior-posterior patterning. Because this gradient controls patterning not only in the embryo but also in adult tissues, this system may support tissue robustness and disease prevention. ",

Importance: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) guidance improves the accuracy of prostate biopsy for the detection of clinically significant prostate cancer, but the optimal use of such guidance is not yet clear. Objective: To determine the cancer detection rate (CDR) of targeting MRI-visible lesions vs systematic prostate sampling in the diagnosis of clinically significant prostate cancer in men who were biopsy naive. Design, Setting, and Participants: This paired cohort trial, known as the Prospective Assessment of Image Registration in the Diagnosis of Prostate Cancer (PAIREDCAP) study, was conducted in an academic medical center from January 2015 to April 2018. Men undergoing first-time prostate biopsy were enrolled. Paired-cohort participants were a consecutive series of men with MRI-visible lesions (defined by a Prostate Imaging Reporting & Data System version 2 score \u2009\u2265\u20093), who each underwent 3 biopsy methods at the same sitting: first, a systematic biopsy; second, an MRI-lesion biopsy targeted by cognitive fusion; and third, an MRI-lesion targeted by software fusion. Another consecutive series of men without MRI-visible lesions underwent systematic biopsies to help determine the false-negative rate of MRI during the trial period. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary end point was the detection rate of clinically significant prostate cancer (Gleason grade group \u22652) overall and by each biopsy method separately. The secondary end points were the effects of the Prostate Imaging Reporting & Data System version 2 grade, prostate-specific antigen density, and prostate volume on the primary end point. Tertiary end points were the false-negative rate of MRI and concordance of biopsy-method results by location of detected cancers within the prostate. Results: A total of 300 men participated; 248 had MRI-visible lesions (mean [SD] age, 65.5 [7.7] years; 197 were white [79.4%]), and 52 were control participants (mean [SD] age, 63.6 [5.9] years; 39 were white [75%]). The overall CDR was 70% in the paired cohort group, achieved by combining systematic and targeted biopsy results. The CDR by systematic sampling was 15% in the group without MRI-visible lesions. In the paired-cohort group, CDRs varied from 47% (116 of 248 men) when using cognitive fusion biopsy alone, to approximately 60% when using systematic biopsy (149 of 248 men) or either fusion method alone (154 of 248 men), to 70% (174 of 248 men) when combining systematic and targeted biopsy. Discordance of tumor locations suggests that the different biopsy methods detect different tumors. Thus, combining targeting and systematic sampling provide greatest sensitivity for detection of clinically significant prostate cancer. For all biopsy methods, the Prostate Imaging Reporting & Data System version 2 grade and prostate-specific antigen density were directly associated with CDRs, and prostate volume was inversely associated. Conclusions and Relevance: An MRI-visible lesion in men undergoing first-time prostate biopsy identifies those with a heightened risk of clinically significant prostate cancer. Combining targeted and systematic biopsy offers the best chances of detecting the cancer. ",
        "What did you do yesterday? A meta-analysis of sex differences in episodic memory. To remember what one did yesterday is an example of an everyday episodic memory task, in which a female advantage has sometimes been reported. Here, we quantify the impact of sex on episodic memory performance and investigate whether the magnitude of the sex difference is modified by study-, task-, and sample-specific moderators. Analyses were based on 617 studies conducted between 1973 and 2013 with 1,233,921 participants. A 5-level random-effects meta-analysis showed an overall female advantage in episodic memory (g = 0.19, 95% CI [0.17, 0.21]). The material to be remembered affected the magnitude of this advantage, with a female advantage for more verbal tasks, such as words, sentences, and prose (g = 0.28, 95% CI [0.25, 0.30]), nameable images (g = 0.16, 95% CI [0.11, 0.22]), and locations (g = 0.16, 95% CI [0.11, 0.21]), and a male advantage in more spatial tasks, such as abstract images (g = -0.20, 95% CI [-0.35, -0.05]) and routes (g = -0.24, 95% CI [-0.35, -0.12]). Furthermore, there was a female advantage for materials that cannot easily be placed along the verbal-spatial continuum, such as faces (g = 0.26, 95% CI [0.20, 0.33]), and odor, taste, and color (g = 0.37, 95% CI [0.18, 0.55]). These differences have remained stable since 1973. For verbal episodic memory tasks, differences were larger in Europe, North America, Oceania, and South America than in Asia, and smaller in childhood and old age than for other ages. Taken together, results suggest that men may use their spatial advantage in spatially demanding episodic memory tasks, whereas women do well in episodic memory tasks that are verbalizable and tasks that are neither verbal nor spatial, such as remembering faces and odors/tastes/colors.

        "Energy expenditure differences across lying, sitting, and standing positions in young healthy adults. The time spent in sedentary behaviour represents an important public health burden. To reduce sedentary time in the general population, the simplest, most effective, and most accessible method is to decrease lying and sitting time. We aimed to compare differences on energy expenditure (EE) across lying, sitting, and standing positions; and to analyse the associations between the change on EE of changing from one position to another and anthropometric and body composition parameters in young healthy adults. A total of 55 (69% women) young healthy adults aged 21.7 \u00b1 2.2 participated in the study. We measured EE by indirect calorimetry across lying, sitting, and standing positions following the standard procedures. The EE was significantly higher in standing than in both lying and sitting positions (mean difference: 0.121\u00b10.292 and 0.125\u00b10.241 kcal/min, respectively; all P<0.001), and no differences were observed between lying and sitting positions (P = 1.000). There was a negative association between the EE differences in sitting vs. standing position and lean body mass (P = 0.048), yet no associations between EE differences with the rest of the anthropometric and body composition parameters were observed in each position pair studied (all P>0.321). Our findings support the fact that increasing the time spent standing could be a simple strategy to slightly increase EE. Therefore, our results have important clinical implications including a better monitoring, characterizing, and promoting countermeasures to sedentariness through low-level physical activities. ",
        "New therapeutic options for Alport syndrome. Alport syndrome (AS) is the most frequent inherited kidney disease after autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease. It has three different patterns of inheritance-autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive and X-linked-which in part explains the wide spectrum of disease, ranging from isolated microhaematuria to end-stage renal disease early in life. The search for a treatment for AS is being pursued vigorously, not only because of the obvious unmet need but also because AS is a rare disease and any drug approved will have an orphan drug designation with its various benefits. Moreover, AS patients are quite young with very few comorbidities, which facilitates clinical trials. This review identifies the particularities of each pattern of inheritance but focuses mainly on new drugs or therapeutic targets for the disease. Most treatment-related investigations are directed not at the main abnormality in AS, namely collagen IV composition, but rather at the associated inflammation and fibrosis. Thus, AS may serve as a proof of concept for numerous drugs of potential value in many diseases that cause chronic kidney disease. ",
        "Time of Exercise Specifies the Impact on Muscle Metabolic Pathways and Systemic Energy Homeostasis. While the timing of food intake is important, it is unclear whether the effects of exercise on energy metabolism are restricted to unique time windows. As circadian regulation is key to controlling metabolism, understanding the impact of exercise performed at different times of the day is relevant for physiology and homeostasis. Using high-throughput transcriptomic and metabolomic approaches, we identify distinct responses of metabolic oscillations that characterize exercise in either the early rest phase or the early active phase in mice. Notably, glycolytic activation is specific to exercise at the active phase. At the molecular level, HIF1\u03b1, a central regulator of glycolysis during hypoxia, is selectively activated in a time-dependent manner upon exercise, resulting in carbohydrate exhaustion, usage of alternative energy sources, and adaptation of systemic energy expenditure. Our findings demonstrate that the time\u00a0of day is a critical factor to amplify the beneficial\u00a0impact of exercise on both metabolic pathways\u00a0within skeletal muscle and systemic energy homeostasis.

        "Mild Cognitive Impairment with a High Risk of Progression to Alzheimer's Disease Dementia (MCI-HR-AD): Effect of Souvenaid\u00ae Treatment on Cognition and 18F-FDG PET Scans. Background: Previous studies have shown that Souvenaid (medical food) can have benefits on memory, cognition, and function in early Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Objective: Demonstrate that Souvenaid could improve or maintain cognition and has an effect on neurodegeneration biomarkers. Methods: This cohort study was carried out from June 2015 through December 2016 in the Neurology Department, Infanta Cristina Hospital, Madrid, Spain. MCI-HR-AD were recruited using Petersen criteria, neuropsychology (NPS), and 18F-FDG PET scans to confirm the high risk of progression to dementia with one year of follow-up. Age, sex, vascular risk factors (VRF), and NPS values (Barcelona brief version) were analyzed. 18F-FDG PET scans were analyzed as a visual procedure. The study was approved by the Research Committee of ICH. Statistical analysis was made with SPSS 22.0 version. Results: Subjects included 43 MCI patients (58.5% women; mean age 69.78\u00b17.89): 17 receiving Souvenaid\u00ae treatment (ST), 24 receiving no treatment (WT) and 2 who withdrew. No differences were seen in VRF, only hypercholesterolemia, and were less prevalent in the ST group (p\u200a=\u200a0.002). The rate of progression to dementia was 48.8% (no differences between groups, p\u200a=\u200a0.654). A second round of 18F-FDG PET scans showed a significance worsening of glucose metabolism in WT (p\u200a=\u200a0.001) versus ST, in which it was low (p\u200a=\u200a0.050). For NPS testing, there was a significant worsening in memory performance in the WT group (p\u200a=\u200a0.011) and a stabilization in ST (p\u200a=\u200a0.083), as well as in executive functions and attention (worsening in WT, p\u200a=\u200a0.014). For the Subjective Changing Scale (SCS), caregivers indicated a stabilization/improvement in ST (p\u200a=\u200a0.017). Conclusion: Souvenaid had a significant effect on several cognitive domains, and on SCS in patients with MCI-HR-AD. Its intervention had an impact on preservation on 18F-FDG PET scans. ",
        "Which Violence Against Women Educational Strategies Are Effective for Prequalifying Health-Care Students?: A Systematic Review. Gender-based violence (GBV) is a global public health issue which disproportionately affects women. Health-care providers have an important role in recognizing and addressing GBV in practice, yet research suggests that the issue remains underrecognized, with many qualified professionals reporting lack of confidence and a sense of unpreparedness. Prequalifying GBV educational strategies are inconsistent in both quantity and quality worldwide, and to date, there has been no comprehensive review of those programs' effectiveness. This internationally focused literature review aimed to identify best educational practices in GBV for prequalifying health-care students. A systematic search of six databases yielded 17 studies meeting the inclusion criteria, with all studies examining one or more educational intervention. Quality appraisal was undertaken and data were tabulated to capture relevant information. Thematic findings suggest that interactive educational strategies yield better results than didactic approaches. Similarly, interventions with a focus on practical application of learning are generally preferred over strictly theoretical approaches. Courses of longer duration seem to be more effective in instilling attitudinal changes. Lastly, gendered differences were noted in a number of studies, with female students consistently outperforming males. However, more research is needed before conclusions can be drawn about the effectiveness of single- versus mixed-gender audiences. This review makes a useful contribution to the literature of health education, supporting many findings from previous studies and identifying knowledge gaps to be explored in future research. There are implications for both educators and practitioners in creating discernible change for women in their care. ",
        "Sickle cell disease. Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a group of inherited disorders caused by mutations in HBB, which encodes haemoglobin subunit \u03b2. The incidence is estimated to be between 300,000 and 400,000 neonates globally each year, the majority in sub-Saharan Africa. Haemoglobin molecules that include mutant sickle \u03b2-globin subunits can polymerize; erythrocytes that contain mostly haemoglobin polymers assume a sickled form and are prone to haemolysis. Other pathophysiological mechanisms that contribute to the SCD phenotype are vaso-occlusion and activation of the immune system. SCD is characterized by a remarkable phenotypic complexity. Common acute complications are acute pain events, acute chest syndrome and stroke; chronic complications (including chronic kidney disease) can damage all organs. Hydroxycarbamide, blood transfusions and haematopoietic stem cell transplantation can reduce the severity of the disease. Early diagnosis is crucial to improve survival, and universal newborn screening programmes have been implemented in some countries but are challenging in low-income, high-burden settings. ",
        "Modification and de novo design of non-ribosomal peptide synthetases using specific assembly points within condensation domains. Non-ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) are giant enzyme machines that activate amino acids in an assembly line fashion. As NRPSs are not restricted to the incorporation of the 20 proteinogenic amino acids, their efficient manipulation would enable microbial production of a diverse range of peptides; however, the structural requirements for reprogramming NRPSs to facilitate the production of new peptides are not clear. Here we describe a new fusion point inside the condensation domains of NRPSs that results in the development of the exchange unit condensation domain (XUC) concept, which enables the efficient production of peptides, even containing non-natural amino acids, in yields up to 280\u2009mg\u2009l-1. This allows the generation of more specific NRPSs, reducing the number of unwanted peptide derivatives, but also the generation of peptide libraries. The XUC might therefore be suitable for the future optimization of peptide production and the identification of bioactive peptide derivatives for pharmaceutical and other applications. ",
        "Comparative \"virtual biopsies\" of normal skin and skin lesions using vibrational optical coherence tomography. BACKGROUND: Increased tissue stiffness (also termed modulus) has been shown to be a characteristic of potential tumor metastasis. Measured values of the stiffness of tumors and cancer cells are reported in the literature to increase compared to neighboring normal tissues. Yet the relationship between the mechanical properties of cells and the extracellular matrix has yet to be correlated with the histopathology of cancerous lesions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We have developed a technique to do virtual biopsies of skin lesions by combining images made using optical coherence tomography with stiffness measurements made simultaneously using vibrational analysis. The technique is termed vibrational optical coherence tomography (VOCT). RESULTS: In this paper, we report that precancerous and cancerous lesions are characterized by changes in both the morphology and stiffness of the cellular components of the skin. The ratio of the peak heights that correspond to the epidermal (40-60Hz) and dermal (140-160\u00a0Hz) resonant frequencies appear to be different for benign and cancerous or precancerous lesions compared with normal skin and scar. CONCLUSIONS: Cell-to-cell and epidermal-to-dermal interactions may be very important in evaluating the potential of skin lesions to become malignant. These interactions can be evaluated using VOCT, a new technique for performing \"virtual biopsies\" of skin lesions. ",
        "Encyclopedic tumor analysis for guiding treatment of advanced, broadly refractory cancers: results from the RESILIENT trial. RESILIENT (CTRI/2018/02/011808) was a single arm, open label, phase II/III study to test if label agnostic therapy regimens guided by Encyclopedic Tumor Analysis (ETA) can offer meaningful clinical benefit for patients with relapsed refractory metastatic (r/r-m) malignancies. Patients with advanced refractory solid organ malignancies where disease had progressed following \u22652 lines of systemic treatments were enrolled in the trial. Patients received personalized treatment recommendations based on integrational comprehensive analysis of freshly biopsied tumor tissue and blood. The primary end points were Objective Response Rate (ORR), Progression Free Survival (PFS) and Quality of Life (QoL). Objective Response (Complete Response + Partial Response) was observed in 54 of 126 patients evaluable per protocol (ORR = 42.9%; 95% CI: 34.3%-51.4%, p < 0.0001). At study completion, Disease Control (Complete Response + Partial Response + Stable Disease) was observed in 114 out of 126 patients evaluable per protocol (CBR = 90.5%; 95% CI: 83.9% - 95.0%, p < 0.00001) and Disease Progression in 12 patients. Median duration of follow-up was 138 days (range 31 to 379). Median PFS at study termination was 134 days (range 31 to 379). PFS rate at 90 days and 180 days were 93.9% and 82.5% respectively. The study demonstrated that tumors have latent vulnerabilities that can be identified via integrational multi-analyte investigations such as ETA. This approach identified viable treatment options that could yield meaningful clinical benefit in this cohort of patients with advanced refractory cancers. ",
        "Highly Combinatorial Genetic Interaction Analysis Reveals a Multi-Drug Transporter Influence Network. Many traits are complex, depending non-additively on variant combinations. Even in model systems, such as the yeast S.\u00a0cerevisiae, carrying out the high-order variant-combination testing needed to dissect complex traits remains a daunting challenge. Here, we describe \"X-gene\" genetic analysis (XGA), a strategy for engineering and profiling highly combinatorial gene perturbations. We demonstrate XGA on yeast ABC transporters by engineering 5,353 strains, each deleted for a random subset of 16 transporters, and profiling each strain's resistance to 16 compounds. XGA yielded 85,648 genotype-to-resistance observations, revealing high-order genetic interactions for 13 of the 16 transporters studied. Neural networks yielded intuitive functional models and guided exploration of fluconazole resistance, which was influenced non-additively by five genes. Together, our results showed that highly combinatorial genetic perturbation can functionally dissect complex traits, supporting pursuit of analogous strategies in human cells and other model systems.

        "High-resolution cryo-EM structures of outbreak strain human norovirus shells reveal size variations. Noroviruses are a leading cause of foodborne illnesses worldwide. Although GII.4 strains have been responsible for most norovirus outbreaks, the assembled virus shell structures have been available in detail for only a single strain (GI.1). We present high-resolution (2.6- to 4.1-\u00c5) cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of GII.4, GII.2, GI.7, and GI.1 human norovirus outbreak strain virus-like particles (VLPs). Although norovirus VLPs have been thought to exist in a single-sized assembly, our structures reveal polymorphism between and within genogroups, with small, medium, and large particle sizes observed. Using asymmetric reconstruction, we were able to resolve a Zn2+ metal ion adjacent to the coreceptor binding site, which affected the structural stability of the shell. Our structures serve as valuable templates for facilitating vaccine formulations. ",
        "Vitamin K Status and Mobility Limitation and Disability in Older Adults: The Health, Aging, and Body Composition Study. BACKGROUND: Vitamin K has been implicated in chronic diseases associated with increased risk for mobility disability, such as osteoarthritis and cardiovascular disease. However, the association between vitamin K status and mobility disability is unknown. Therefore, we examined the association between vitamin K status and incident mobility disability in the Health, Aging, and Body Composition Study. METHODS: Plasma phylloquinone (vitamin K1) was categorized as <0.5, 0.5-<1.0 and \u22651.0 nmol/L (n = 1,323, 48% male). Plasma ucMGP, which increases when vitamin K status is low, was measured in 716 participants and categorized into tertiles. Mobility limitation and disability, defined as two consecutive semiannual reports of having any or a lot of difficulty walking a one-fourth mile or climbing 10 steps without resting, were assessed over a median 6-10 years of follow-up. Multivariate Cox proportional hazard models were used to evaluate the association between vitamin K status and incident mobility limitation and disability. RESULTS: Participants with plasma phylloquinone less than 0.5 nmol/L were more likely to develop mobility limitation and disability compared to those with at least 1.0 nmol/L (adjusted HR (95% CI) mobility limitation: 1.27 (1.05-1.53); disability: 1.34 (1.01-1.76)). After further adjustment for knee pain, the associations were partially attenuated (HR (95% CI) mobility limitation: 1.20 (0.99-1.45); disability: 1.26 (0.96-1.67)). Plasma ucMGP was not associated with incident mobility limitation, but was nonlinearly associated with incident mobility disability (HR (95% CI), compared to tertile 1: tertile 2 = 1.64 (1.19-2.27), tertile 3 = 1.17 (0.83-1.66), fully adjusted). CONCLUSION: Our results suggest vitamin K may be involved in the disablement process in older age. Future studies are needed to confirm our findings and clarify the underlying mechanism. ",
        "The Prevalence and Determinants of Vitamin D Status in Community-Dwelling Older Adults: Results from the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA). Vitamin D deficiency is often associated with adverse health outcomes in older adults. The circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) status predominately relies on UV exposure. However, the extent of which northerly latitude exasperates deficiency is less explored in ageing. We aimed to investigate vitamin D deficiency in community-dwelling, older adults, residing at latitudes 50-55\u00b0 north. This study was comprised of 6004 adults, aged >50 years from wave 6 (2012-2013) of the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA). Deficiency was categorised by two criteria: Institute of Medicine (IOM) (<30 nmol/L) and Endocrine Society (ES) (<50 nmol/L). The overall prevalence of Institute of Medicine (IOM) and Endocrine Society (ES) definitions of deficiency were 26.4% and 58.7%, respectively. Females (odds ratio (OR) 1.23; CI: 1.04-1.44), those aged 80+ (OR: 1.42; CI: 1.01-1.93), smoking (OR: 1.88; CI: 1.51-2.34); of non-white ethnicity (OR: 3.8; CI:2.39-6.05); being obese (OR: 1.32; CI:1.09-1.58), and of poor self-reported health (OR:1.99; CI:1.33, 2.96), were more likely to be vitamin D deficient (by IOM). Residents in the south of England had a reduced risk of deficiency (OR: 0.78; CI:0.64-0.95), even after adjustment for socioeconomic and traditional predictors (obesity, age, lifestyle, etc.) of vitamin D status. Other factors, such as being retired, having a normal BMI, engaging in regular vigorous physical activity, vitamin D supplement use, sun travel, and summer season were also significantly positive correlates of deficiency. Similar results were observed for the ES cut-off definition. Importantly, more than half of adults aged >50 years had 25(OH)D concentrations <50 nmol/L. These findings demonstrate that low vitamin D status is highly prevalent in older English adults and the crucial importance of public health strategies throughout midlife and older age to achieve optimal vitamin D status.

        "Short-term strength training reduces gluconeogenesis and NAFLD in obese mice. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has a positive correlation with obesity, insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D). The aerobic training is an important tool in combating NAFLD. However, no studies have demonstrated the molecular effects of short-term strength training on the accumulation of hepatic fat in obese mice. This study aimed to investigate the effects of short-term strength training on the mechanisms of oxidation and lipid synthesis in the liver of obese mice. The short duration protocol was used to avoid changing the amount of adipose tissue. Swiss mice were separated into three groups: lean control (CTL), sedentary obese (OB) and strength training obese (STO). The obese groups were fed a high-fat diet (HFD) and the STO group performed the strength training protocol 1 session/day for 15 days. The short-term strength training reduced hepatic fat accumulation, increasing hepatic insulin sensitivity and controlling hepatic glucose production. The obese animals increased the mRNA of lipogenic genes Fasn and Scd1 and reduced the oxidative genes Cpt1a and Ppara. On the other hand, the STO group presented the opposite results. Finally, the obese animals presented higher levels of lipogenic proteins (ACC and FAS) and proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2), but the short-term strength training was efficient in reducing this condition, regardless of body weight loss. In conclusion, there was a reduction of obesity-related hepatic lipogenesis and inflammation after short-term strength training, independent of weight loss, leading to improvements in hepatic insulin sensitivity and glycemic homeostasis in obese mice. Key points: (1) Short-term strength training (STST) reduced fat accumulation and inflammation in the liver; (2) Hepatic insulin sensitivity and HPG control were increased with STST; (3) The content and activity of ACC and content of FAS were reduced with STST; (4) STST improved hepatic fat accumulation and glycemic homeostasis; (5) STST effects were observed independently of body weight change.

        "Polycomb Protein EED Regulates Neuronal Differentiation through Targeting SOX11 in Hippocampal Dentate Gyrus. EED (embryonic ectoderm development) is a core component of the Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) which catalyzes the methylation of histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27) during the process of self-renewal, proliferation, and differentiation of embryonic stem cells. However, its function in the mammalian nervous system remains unexplored. Here, we report that loss of EED in the brain leads to postnatal lethality, impaired neuronal differentiation, and malformation of the dentate gyrus. Overexpression of Sox11, a downstream target of EED through interaction with H3K27me1, restores the neuronal differentiation capacity of EED-ablated neural stem/progenitor cells (NSPCs). Interestingly, downregulation of Cdkn2a, another downstream target of EED which is regulated in an H3K27me3-dependent manner, reverses the proliferation defect of EED-ablated NSPCs. Taken together, these findings established a critical role of EED in the development of hippocampal dentate gyrus, which might shed new light on the molecular mechanism of intellectual disability in patients with EED mutations.

        "Association of changes in red meat consumption with total and cause specific mortality among US women and men: two prospective cohort studies. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association of changes in red meat consumption with total and cause specific mortality in women and men. DESIGN: Two prospective cohort studies with repeated measures of diet and lifestyle factors. SETTING: Nurses' Health Study and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study, United States. PARTICIPANTS: 53\u2009553 women and 27\u2009916 men without cardiovascular disease or cancer at baseline. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Death confirmed by state vital statistics records, the national death index, or reported by families and the postal system. RESULTS: 14\u2009019 deaths occurred during 1.2 million person years of follow-up. Increases in red meat consumption over eight years were associated with a higher mortality risk in the subsequent eight years among women and men (both P for trend<0.05, P for heterogeneity=0.97). An increase in total red meat consumption of at least half a serving per day was associated with a 10% higher mortality risk (pooled hazard ratio 1.10, 95% confidence interval 1.04 to 1.17). For processed and unprocessed red meat consumption, an increase of at least half a serving per day was associated with a 13% higher mortality risk (1.13, 1.04 to 1.23) and a 9% higher mortality risk (1.09, 1.02 to 1.17), respectively. A decrease in consumption of processed or unprocessed red meat of at least half a serving per day was not associated with mortality risk. The association between increased red meat consumption and mortality risk was consistent across subgroups defined by age, physical activity, dietary quality, smoking status, or alcohol consumption. CONCLUSION: Increases in red meat consumption, especially processed meat, were associated with higher overall mortality rates. ",
        "Human iPSC-Derived Blood-Brain Barrier Chips Enable Disease Modeling and Personalized Medicine Applications. The blood-brain barrier (BBB) tightly regulates the entry of solutes from blood into the brain and is disrupted in several neurological diseases. Using Organ-Chip technology, we created an entirely human BBB-Chip with induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived brain microvascular endothelial-like\u00a0cells (iBMECs), astrocytes, and neurons. The iBMECs formed a tight monolayer that expressed markers specific to brain vasculature. The BBB-Chip exhibited physiologically relevant transendothelial electrical resistance and accurately predicted blood-to-brain permeability of pharmacologics. Upon perfusing the vascular lumen with whole blood, the microengineered capillary wall protected neural cells from plasma-induced toxicity. Patient-derived iPSCs from individuals with neurological diseases predicted disease-specific lack of transporters and disruption of barrier integrity. By combining Organ-Chip technology and human iPSC-derived tissue, we have created a neurovascular unit that recapitulates complex BBB functions, provides a platform for modeling inheritable neurological disorders, and advances drug screening, as well as personalized medicine.

        "Nuclear Pre-snRNA Export Is an Essential Quality Assurance Mechanism for Functional Spliceosomes. Removal of introns from pre-mRNAs is an essential step in eukaryotic gene expression, mediated by spliceosomes that contain snRNAs as key components. Although snRNAs are transcribed in the nucleus and function in the same compartment, all except U6 shuttle to the cytoplasm. Surprisingly, the physiological relevance for shuttling is unclear, in particular because the snRNAs in Saccharomyces cerevisiae were reported to remain nuclear. Here, we show that all yeast pre-snRNAs including U6 undergo a stepwise maturation process after nuclear export by Mex67 and Xpo1. Sm- and Lsm-ring attachment occurs in the cytoplasm and is important for the snRNA re-import, mediated by Cse1 and Mtr10. Finally, nuclear pre-snRNA cleavage and trimethylation of the 5'-cap finalizes shuttling. Importantly, preventing pre-snRNAs from being exported or processed results in faulty spliceosome assembly and subsequent genome-wide splicing defects. Thus, pre-snRNA export is obligatory for functional splicing and resembles an essential evolutionarily conserved quality assurance step. ",

Here we report the functional metagenomic screening of the human gut microbiome for enzymes that can remove the cognate A and B type sugar antigens. Among the genes encoded in our library of 19,500 expressed fosmids bearing gut bacterial DNA, we identify an enzyme pair from the obligate anaerobe Flavonifractor plautii that work in concert to efficiently convert the A antigen to the H antigen of O type blood, via a galactosamine intermediate. The X-ray structure of the N-acetylgalactosamine deacetylase reveals the active site and mechanism of the founding member of an esterase family. The galactosaminidase expands activities within the CAZy family GH36. Their ability to completely convert A to O of the same rhesus type at very low enzyme concentrations in whole blood will simplify their incorporation into blood transfusion practice, broadening blood supply.

        "Intergenerational educational mobility and health satisfaction across the life course: Does the long arm of childhood conditions only become visible later in life?. The contemporaneous association of socioeconomic status (SES) with health is well-established, whereas much less is known about the health-related effects of social mobility (i.e., movements across different SES). This study investigates the impact of SES in childhood and adulthood on health satisfaction across the life course. Using data from the German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP) and education as a central marker of SES, we test whether parental education (i.e., childhood SES) affects adult health satisfaction, directly and/or indirectly through own educational attainment (i.e., adult SES) as a mediating variable. Moreover, we apply diagonal reference models to disentangle the independent effect of intergenerational educational mobility. Our findings show that parental education has both direct and indirect effects. Yet, the relative weight of parents' education as a predictor of health satisfaction is found to depend on when in the life course health satisfaction is measured: parental education shows an increasing relevance as a predictor of health satisfaction at higher ages. On top of (additive) effects of parental and own education, we find significant mobility effects in earlier adulthood: upward educational mobility is conducive to health satisfaction and the reverse for downward educational mobility.

        "Introduction of anti-TNF therapy has not yielded expected declines in hospitalisation and intestinal resection rates in inflammatory bowel diseases: a population-based interrupted time series study. OBJECTIVES: To better understand the real-world impact of biologic therapy in persons with Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), we evaluated the effect of marketplace introduction of infliximab on the population rates of hospitalisations and surgeries and public payer drug costs. DESIGN: We used health administrative data to study adult persons with CD and UC living in Ontario, Canada between 1995 and 2012. We used an interrupted time series design with segmented regression analysis to evaluate the impact of infliximab introduction on the rates of IBD-related hospitalisations, intestinal resections and public payer drug costs over 10 years among patients with CD and 5\u2009years among patients with UC, allowing for a 1-year transition. RESULTS: Relative to what would have been expected in the absence of infliximab, marketplace introduction of infliximab did not produce significant declines in the rates of CD-related hospitalisations (OR at the last observation quarter 1.06, 95% CI 0.811 to 1.39) or intestinal resections (OR 1.10, 95% CI 0.810 to 1.50), or in the rates of UC-related hospitalisations (OR 1.22, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.39) or colectomies (OR 0.933, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.61). The findings were similar among infliximab users, except that hospitalisation rates declined substantially among UC patients following marketplace introduction of infliximab (OR 0.515, 95% CI 0.342 to 0.777). There was a threefold rise over expected trends in public payer drug cost among patients with CD following infliximab introduction (OR 2.98,95% CI 2.29 to 3.86), suggesting robust market penetration in this group, but no significant change among patients with UC (OR 1.06, 95% CI 0.955 to 1.18). CONCLUSIONS: Marketplace introduction of infliximab has not yielded anticipated reductions in the population rates of IBD-related hospitalisations or intestinal resections, despite robust market penetration among patients with CD. Misguided use of infliximab in CD patients and underuse of infliximab in UC patients may largely explain our study findings. ",
        "Genetic associations with age of menopause in familial longevity. OBJECTIVE: We hypothesize that mechanisms associated with extended reproductive age may overlap with mechanisms for the selection of genetic variants that slow aging and decrease risk for age-related diseases. Therefore, the goal of this analysis is to search for genetic variants associated with delayed age of menopause (AOM) among women in a study of familial longevity. METHODS: We performed a meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies for AOM in 1,286 women in the Long Life Family Study (LLFS) and 3,151 women in the Health and Retirement Study, and then sought replication in the Framingham Heart Study (FHS). We used Cox proportional hazard regression of AOM to account for censoring, with a robust variance estimator to adjust for within familial relations. RESULTS: In the meta-analysis, a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) previously associated with AOM reached genome-wide significance (rs16991615; HR\u200a=\u200a0.74, P\u200a=\u200a6.99 \u00d7 10). A total of 35 variants reached >10 level of significance and replicated in the FHS and in a 2015 large meta-analysis (ReproGen Consortium). We also identified several novel SNPs associated with AOM including rs3094005: MICB, rs13196892: TXNDC5 | MUTED, rs72774935: SSBP2 | ATG10, rs9447453: COL12A1, rs114298934: FHL2 | NCK2, rs6467223: TNPO3, rs9666274 and rs10766593: NAV2, and rs7281846: HSPA13. CONCLUSIONS: This work indicates novel associations and replicates known associations between genetic variants and AOM. A number of these associations make sense for their roles in aging.

        "Lower Incidence Rate of Type 1 Diabetes after Receipt of the Rotavirus Vaccine in the United States, 2001-2017. We evaluated whether rotavirus vaccination is associated with the incidence of type 1 diabetes among children. We designed a cohort study of 1,474,535 infants in the United States from 2001-2017, using data from a nationwide health insurer. There was a 33% reduction in the risk of type 1 diabetes with completion of the rotavirus vaccine series compared to the unvaccinated (95% CI: 17%, 46%). Completion of the pentavalent vaccine series was associated with 37% lower risk of type 1 diabetes (95% CI: 22%, 50%). Partial vaccination (incompletion of the series) was not associated with the incidence of type 1 diabetes. There was a 31% reduction in hospitalizations in the 60-day period after vaccination (95% CI: 27%, 35%) compared to unvaccinated children. Overall, there was a 3.4% decrease in incidence annually in children ages 0-4 in the United States from 2006-2017 which coincides with the vaccine introduction in 2006. We conclude that rotavirus vaccination is associated with a reduced incidence of type 1 diabetes. Rotavirus vaccination may be the first practical measure that could play a role in the prevention of this disease. ",
        "Habitual cigarette smoking raises pressor responses to spontaneous bursts of muscle sympathetic nerve activity. Smoking is a risk factor for cardiovascular diseases. Prior reports showed a transient increase in blood pressure (BP) following a spontaneous burst of muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA). We hypothesized that this pressor response would be accentuated in smokers. Using signal-averaging techniques, we examined the BP (Finometer) response to MSNA in 18 otherwise healthy smokers and 42 healthy nonsmokers during resting conditions. The sensitivities of baroreflex control of MSNA and heart rate were also assessed. The mean resting MSNA, heart rate, and mean arterial pressure (MAP) were higher in smokers than nonsmokers. The MAP increase following a burst of MSNA was significantly greater in smokers than nonsmokers (\u03943.4\u2009\u00b1\u20090.3 vs. \u03941.6\u2009\u00b1\u20090.1 mmHg, P < 0.001). The baroreflex sensitivity (BRS) of burst incidence, burst area, or total activity was not different between the two groups. However, cardiac BRS was lower in smokers than nonsmokers (14.6\u2009\u00b1\u20091.7 vs. 24.6\u2009\u00b1\u20091.5 ms/mmHg, P < 0.001). Moreover, the MAP increase following a burst was negatively correlated with the cardiac BRS. These observations suggest that habitual smoking in otherwise healthy individuals raises the MAP increase following spontaneous MSNA and that the attenuated cardiac BRS in the smokers was a contributing factor. We speculate that the accentuated pressor increase in response to spontaneous MSNA may contribute to the elevated resting BP in the smokers. ",
        "Using Extra Virgin Olive Oil to Cook Vegetables Enhances Polyphenol and Carotenoid Extractability: A Study Applying the sofrito Technique. Olive oil is the main source of fat in the Mediterranean diet and the most frequently used ingredient in Mediterranean cuisine. Cooking with olive oil has been attracting attention because it can act as a food excipient, thereby increasing the bioaccessibility and bioavailability of ingested bioactive compounds. The aim of this study was to understand the effect of cooking with olive oil on the bioactive components in other ingredients (tomato, onion, and garlic) of sofrito sauce, a representative model of Mediterranean cuisine. After the cooking process, polyphenols from tomato, onion, and garlic were detected in the olive oil, especially naringenin, ferulic acid, and quercetin, as well as a high content of carotenoid Z-isomers, which are more bioavailable than the E-isomers. Therefore, traditional Mediterranean cuisine could play an important role in the health-improving effects of the Mediterranean diet. ",
        "Therapeutic efficacy of favipiravir against Bourbon virus in mice. Bourbon virus (BRBV) is an emerging tick-borne RNA virus in the orthomyxoviridae family that was discovered in 2014. Although fatal human cases of BRBV have been described, little is known about its pathogenesis, and no antiviral therapies or vaccines exist. We obtained serum from a fatal case in 2017 and successfully recovered the second human infectious isolate of BRBV. Next-generation sequencing of the St. Louis isolate of BRBV (BRBV-STL) showed >99% nucleotide identity to the original reference isolate. Using BRBV-STL, we developed a small animal model to study BRBV-STL tropism in vivo and evaluated the prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy of the experimental antiviral drug favipiravir against BRBV-induced disease. Infection of Ifnar1-/- mice lacking the type I interferon receptor, but not congenic wild-type animals, resulted in uniformly fatal disease 6 to 10 days after infection. RNA in situ hybridization and viral yield assays demonstrated a broad tropism of BRBV-STL with highest levels detected in liver and spleen. In vitro replication and polymerase activity of BRBV-STL were inhibited by favipiravir. Moreover, administration of favipiravir as a prophylaxis or as post-exposure therapy three days after infection prevented BRBV-STL-induced mortality in immunocompromised Ifnar1-/- mice. These results suggest that favipiravir may be a candidate treatment for humans who become infected with BRBV. ",
        "An autoinducer-independent RhlR quorum-sensing receptor enables analysis of RhlR regulation. Quorum sensing is a chemical communication process that bacteria use to coordinate group behaviors. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, an opportunistic pathogen, employs multiple quorum-sensing systems to control behaviors including virulence factor production and biofilm formation. One P. aeruginosa quorum-sensing receptor, called RhlR, binds the cognate autoinducer N-butryl-homoserine lactone (C4HSL), and the RhlR:C4HSL complex activates transcription of target quorum-sensing genes. Here, we use a genetic screen to identify RhlR mutants that function independently of the autoinducer. The RhlR Y64F W68F V133F triple mutant, which we call RhlR*, exhibits ligand-independent activity in vitro and in vivo. RhlR* can drive wildtype biofilm formation and infection in a nematode animal model. The ability of RhlR* to properly regulate quorum-sensing-controlled genes in vivo depends on the quorum-sensing regulator RsaL keeping RhlR* activity in check. RhlR is known to function together with PqsE to control production of the virulence factor called pyocyanin. Likewise, RhlR* requires PqsE for pyocyanin production in planktonic cultures, however, PqsE is dispensable for RhlR*-driven pyocyanin production on surfaces. Finally, wildtype RhlR protein is not sufficiently stabilized by C4HSL to allow purification. However, wildtype RhlR can be stabilized by the synthetic ligand mBTL (meta-bromo-thiolactone) and RhlR* is stable without a ligand. These features enabled purification of the RhlR:mBTL complex and of RhlR* for in vitro examination of their biochemical activities. To our knowledge, this work reports the first RhlR protein purification. ",
        "Risk of spontaneous preterm birth and fetal growth associates with fetal SLIT2. Spontaneous preterm birth (SPTB) is the leading cause of neonatal death and morbidity worldwide. Both maternal and fetal genetic factors likely contribute to SPTB. We performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) on a population of Finnish origin that included 247 infants with SPTB (gestational age [GA] < 36 weeks) and 419 term controls (GA 38-41 weeks). The strongest signal came within the gene encoding slit guidance ligand 2 (SLIT2; rs116461311, minor allele frequency 0.05, p = 1.6\u00d710-6). Pathway analysis revealed the top-ranking pathway was axon guidance, which includes SLIT2. In 172 very preterm-born infants (GA <32 weeks), rs116461311 was clearly overrepresented (odds ratio 4.06, p = 1.55\u00d710-7). SLIT2 variants were associated with SPTB in another European population that comprised 260 very preterm infants and 9,630 controls. To gain functional insight, we used immunohistochemistry to visualize SLIT2 and its receptor ROBO1 in placentas from spontaneous preterm and term births. Both SLIT2 and ROBO1 were located in villous and decidual trophoblasts of embryonic origin. Based on qRT-PCR, the mRNA levels of SLIT2 and ROBO1 were higher in the basal plate of SPTB placentas compared to those from term or elective preterm deliveries. In addition, in spontaneous term and preterm births, placental SLIT2 expression was correlated with variations in fetal growth. Knockdown of ROBO1 in trophoblast-derived HTR8/SVneo cells by siRNA indicated that it regulate expression of several pregnancy-specific beta-1-glycoprotein (PSG) genes and genes involved in inflammation. Our results show that the fetal SLIT2 variant and both SLIT2 and ROBO1 expression in placenta and trophoblast cells may be correlated with susceptibility to SPTB. SLIT2-ROBO1 signaling was linked with regulation of genes involved in inflammation, PSG genes, decidualization and fetal growth. We propose that this receptor-ligand couple is a component of the signaling network that promotes SPTB. ",
        "Assessment of Use of Arteriovenous Graft vs Arteriovenous Fistula for First-time Permanent Hemodialysis Access. Importance: Initial hemodialysis access with arteriovenous fistula (AVF) is associated with superior clinical outcomes compared with arteriovenous graft (AVG) and should be the procedure of choice whenever possible. To address the national underuse of AVF in the United States, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid has established an AVF goal of 66% or greater in 2009. Objective: To explore contemporary practice patterns and physician characteristics associated with high AVG use compared with AVF use. Design, Setting, and Participants: This review of 100% Medicare Carrier claims between January 1, 2016, and December 31, 2017, includes both inpatient and outpatient Medicare claims data. All patients undergoing initial permanent hemodialysis access placement with an AVF or AVG were included. All surgeons performing more than 10 hemodialysis access procedures during the study period were analyzed. Exposures: Placement of an AVF or AVG for initial permanent hemodialysis access. Main Outcomes and Measures: A surgeon-level AVG (vs AVF) use rate was calculated for all included surgeons. Hierarchical logistic regression modeling was used to identify patient-level and surgeon-level factors associated with AVG use. Results: A total of 85\u202f320 patients (median age, 70 [range, 18-103] years; 47\u202f370 men [55.5%]) underwent first-time hemodialysis access placement, of whom 66\u202f489 (77.9%) had an AVF and 18\u202f831 (22.1%) had an AVG. Among the 2397 surgeons who performed more than 10 procedures per year, the median surgeon level AVG use rate was 18.2% (range, 0.0%-96.4%). However, 498 surgeons (20.8%) had an AVG use rate greater than 34%. After accounting for patient characteristics, surgeon factors that were independently associated with AVG use included more than 30 years of clinical practice (vs 21-30 years; odds ratio, 0.85 [95% CI, 0.75-0.96]), metropolitan setting (odds ratio, 1.25 [95% CI, 1.02-1.54]), and vascular surgery specialty (vs general surgery; odds ratio, 0.77 [95% CI, 0.69-0.86]). Surgeons in the Northeast region had the lowest rate of AVG use (vs the South; odds ratio, 0.83 [95% CI, 0.73-0.96]). First-time hemodialysis access benchmarking reports for individual surgeons were created for potential distribution. Conclusions and Relevance: In this study, one-fifth of surgeons had an AVG use rate above the recommended best practices guideline of 34%. Although some of these differences may be explained by patient referral practices, sharing benchmarked performance data with surgeons could be an actionable step in achieving more high-value care in hemodialysis access surgery.

        "Specific activation of pro-Infliximab enhances selectivity and safety of rheumatoid arthritis therapy. During rheumatoid arthritis (RA) treatment, long-term injection of antitumor necrosis factor \u03b1 antibodies (anti-TNF\u03b1 Abs) may induce on-target toxicities, including severe infections (tuberculosis [TB] or septic arthritis) and malignancy. Here, we used an immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) hinge as an Ab lock to cover the TNF\u03b1-binding site of Infliximab by linking it with matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) -2/9 substrate to generate pro-Infliximab that can be specifically activated in the RA region to enhance the selectivity and safety of treatment. The Ab lock significantly inhibits the TNF\u03b1 binding and reduces the anti-idiotypic (anti-Id) Ab binding to pro-Infliximab by 395-fold, 108-fold compared with Infliximab, respectively, and MMP-2/9 can completely restore the TNF\u03b1 neutralizing ability of pro-Infliximab to block TNF\u03b1 downstream signaling. Pro-Infliximab was only selectively activated in the disease site (mouse paws) and presented similar pharmacokinetics (PKs) and bio-distribution to Infliximab. Furthermore, pro-Infliximab not only provided equivalent therapeutic efficacy to Infliximab but also maintained mouse immunity against Listeria infection in the RA mouse model, leading to a significantly higher survival rate (71%) than that of the Infliximab treatment group (0%). The high-selectivity pro-Infliximab maintains host immunity and keeps the original therapeutic efficiency, providing a novel strategy for RA therapy. ",
        "Metabolic regulation of gene expression by histone lactylation. The Warburg effect, which originally described increased production of lactate in cancer, is associated with diverse cellular processes such as angiogenesis, hypoxia, polarization of macrophages and activation of T cells. This phenomenon is intimately linked to several diseases including neoplasia, sepsis and autoimmune diseases1,2. Lactate, which is converted from pyruvate in tumour cells, is widely known as an energy source and metabolic by-product. However, its non-metabolic functions in physiology and disease remain unknown. Here we show that lactate-derived lactylation of histone lysine residues serves as an epigenetic modification that directly stimulates gene transcription from chromatin. We identify 28 lactylation sites on core histones in human and mouse cells. Hypoxia and bacterial challenges induce the production of lactate by glycolysis, and this acts as a precursor that stimulates histone lactylation. Using M1 macrophages that have been exposed to bacteria as a model system, we show that histone lactylation has different temporal dynamics from acetylation. In the late phase of M1 macrophage polarization, increased histone lactylation induces homeostatic genes that are involved in wound healing, including Arg1. Collectively, our results suggest that an endogenous 'lactate clock' in bacterially challenged M1 macrophages turns on gene expression to promote homeostasis. Histone lactylation thus represents an opportunity to improve our understanding of the functions of lactate and its role in diverse pathophysiological conditions, including infection and cancer. ",
        "Multiple cancer pathways regulate telomere\u00a0protection. Telomeres are considered as universal anti-cancer targets, as telomere maintenance is essential to sustain indefinite cancer growth. Mutations in telomerase, the enzyme that maintains telomeres, are among the most frequently found in cancer. In addition, mutations in components of the telomere protective complex, or shelterin, are also found in familial and sporadic cancers. Most efforts to target telomeres have focused in telomerase inhibition; however, recent studies suggest that direct targeting of the shelterin complex could represent a more effective strategy. In particular, we recently showed that genetic deletion of the TRF1 essential shelterin protein impairs tumor growth in aggressive lung cancer and glioblastoma (GBM) mouse models by direct induction of telomere damage independently of telomere length. Here, we screen for TRF1 inhibitory drugs using a collection of FDA-approved drugs and drugs in clinical trials, which cover the majority of pathways included in the Reactome database. Among other targets, we find that inhibition of several kinases of the Ras pathway, including ERK and MEK, recapitulates the effects of Trf1 genetic deletion, including induction of telomeric DNA damage, telomere fragility, and inhibition of cancer stemness. We further show that both bRAF and ERK2 kinases phosphorylate TRF1 in\u00a0vitro and that these modifications are essential for TRF1 location to telomeres in\u00a0vivo. Finally, we use these new TRF1 regulatory pathways as the basis to discover novel drug combinations based on TRF1 inhibition, with the goal of effectively blocking potential resistance to individual drugs in patient-derived glioblastoma xenograft models.

        "Mitochondria Are a Subset of Extracellular Vesicles Released by Activated Monocytes and Induce Type I IFN and TNF Responses in Endothelial Cells. RATIONALE: Extracellular vesicles, including microvesicles, are increasingly recognized as important mediators in cardiovascular disease. The cargo and surface proteins they carry are considered to define their biological activity, including their inflammatory properties. Monocyte to endothelial cell signaling is a prerequisite for the propagation of inflammatory responses. However, the contribution of microvesicles in this process is poorly understood. OBJECTIVE: To elucidate the mechanisms by which microvesicles derived from activated monocytic cells exert inflammatory effects on endothelial cells. METHODS AND RESULTS: LPS (lipopolysaccharide)-stimulated monocytic cells release free mitochondria and microvesicles with mitochondrial content as demonstrated by flow cytometry, quantitative polymerase chain reaction, Western Blot, and transmission electron microscopy. Using RNAseq analysis and quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, we demonstrated that both mitochondria directly isolated from and microvesicles released by LPS-activated monocytic cells, as well as circulating microvesicles isolated from volunteers receiving low-dose LPS-injections, induce type I IFN (interferon), and TNF (tumor necrosis factor) responses in endothelial cells. Depletion of free mitochondria significantly reduced the ability of these microvesicles to induce type I IFN and TNF-dependent genes. We identified mitochondria-associated TNF\u03b1 and RNA from stressed mitochondria as major inducers of these responses. Finally, we demonstrated that the proinflammatory potential of microvesicles and directly isolated mitochondria were drastically reduced when they were derived from monocytic cells with nonrespiring mitochondria or monocytic cells cultured in the presence of pyruvate or the mitochondrial reactive oxygen species scavenger MitoTEMPO. CONCLUSIONS: Mitochondria and mitochondria embedded in microvesicles constitute a major subset of extracellular vesicles released by activated monocytes, and their proinflammatory activity on endothelial cells is determined by the activation status of their parental cells. Thus, mitochondria may represent critical intercellular mediators in cardiovascular disease and other inflammatory settings associated with type I IFN and TNF signaling. ",
        "Long-duration hippocampal sharp wave ripples improve memory. Hippocampal sharp wave ripples (SPW-Rs) have been hypothesized as a mechanism for memory consolidation and action planning. The duration of ripples shows a skewed distribution with a minority of long-duration events. We discovered that long-duration ripples are increased in situations demanding memory in rats. Prolongation of spontaneously occurring ripples by optogenetic stimulation, but not randomly induced ripples, increased memory during maze learning. The neuronal content of randomly induced ripples was similar to short-duration spontaneous ripples and contained little spatial information. The spike content of the optogenetically prolonged ripples was biased by the ongoing, naturally initiated neuronal sequences. Prolonged ripples recruited new neurons that represented either arm of the maze. Long-duration hippocampal SPW-Rs replaying large parts of planned routes are critical for memory. ",
        "Enlarged representation of peripersonal space in pregnancy. Our ability to maintain a coherent bodily self despite continuous changes within and outside our body relies on the highly flexible multisensory representation of the body, and of the space surrounding it: the peripersonal space (PPS). The aim of our study was to investigate whether during pregnancy - when extremely rapid changes in body size and shape occur - a likewise rapid plastic reorganization of the neural representation of the PPS occurs. We used an audio-tactile integration task to measure the PPS boundary at different stages of pregnancy. We found that in the second trimester of pregnancy and postpartum women did not show differences in their PPS size as compared to the control group (non-pregnant women). However, in the third trimester the PPS was larger than the controls' PPS and the shift between representation of near and far space was more gradual. We therefore conclude that during pregnancy the brain adapts to the sudden bodily changes, by expanding the representation of the space around the body. This may represent a mechanism to protect the vulnerable abdomen from injury from surrounding objects. ",
        "Milk polar lipids reduce lipid cardiovascular risk factors in overweight postmenopausal women: towards a gut sphingomyelin-cholesterol interplay. OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether milk polar lipids (PL) impact human intestinal lipid absorption, metabolism, microbiota and associated markers of cardiometabolic health. DESIGN: A double-blind, randomised controlled 4-week study involving 58 postmenopausal women was used to assess the chronic effects of milk PL consumption (0, 3 or 5 g-PL/day) on lipid metabolism and gut microbiota. The acute effects of milk PL on intestinal absorption and metabolism of cholesterol were assessed in a randomised controlled crossover study using tracers in ileostomy patients. RESULTS: Over 4 weeks, milk PL significantly reduced fasting and postprandial plasma concentrations of cholesterol and surrogate lipid markers of cardiovascular disease risk, including total/high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol and apolipoprotein (Apo)B/ApoA1 ratios. The highest PL dose preferentially induced a decreased number of intestine-derived chylomicron particles. Also, milk PL increased faecal loss of coprostanol, a gut-derived metabolite of cholesterol, but major bacterial populations and faecal short-chain fatty acids were not affected by milk PL, regardless of the dose. Acute ingestion of milk PL by ileostomy patients shows that milk PL decreased cholesterol absorption and increased cholesterol-ileal efflux, which can be explained by the observed co-excretion with milk sphingomyelin in the gut. CONCLUSION: The present data demonstrate for the first time in humans that milk PL can improve the cardiometabolic health by decreasing several lipid cardiovascular markers, notably through a reduced intestinal cholesterol absorption involving specific interactions in the gut, without disturbing the major bacterial phyla of gut microbiota.

        "Estimating undetected Ebola spillovers. The preparedness of health systems to detect, treat, and prevent onward transmission of Ebola virus disease (EVD) is central to mitigating future outbreaks. Early detection of outbreaks is critical to timely response, but estimating detection rates is difficult because unreported spillover events and outbreaks do not generate data. Using three independent datasets available on the distributions of secondary infections during EVD outbreaks across West Africa, in a single district (Western Area) of Sierra Leone, and in the city of Conakry, Guinea, we simulated realistic outbreak size distributions and compared them to reported outbreak sizes. These three empirical distributions lead to estimates for the proportion of detected spillover events and small outbreaks of 26% (range 8-40%, based on the full outbreak data), 48% (range 39-62%, based on the Sierra Leone data), and 17% (range 11-24%, based on the Guinea data). We conclude that at least half of all spillover events have failed to be reported since EVD was first recognized. We also estimate the probability of detecting outbreaks of different sizes, which is likely less than 10% for single-case spillover events. Comparing models of the observation process also suggests the probability of detecting an outbreak is not simply the cumulative probability of independently detecting any one individual. Rather, we find that any individual's probability of detection is highly dependent upon the size of the cluster of cases. These findings highlight the importance of primary health care and local case management to detect and contain undetected early stage outbreaks at source. ",
        "Functional paralysis of human natural killer cells by alphaherpesviruses. Natural killer (NK) cells are implicated as important anti-viral immune effectors in varicella zoster virus (VZV) infection. VZV can productively infect human NK cells, yet it is unknown how, or if, VZV can directly affect NK cell function. Here we demonstrate that VZV potently impairs the ability of NK cells to respond to target cell stimulation in vitro, leading to a loss of both cytotoxic and cytokine responses. Remarkably, not only were VZV infected NK cells affected, but VZV antigen negative NK cells that were exposed to virus in culture were also inhibited. This powerful impairment of function was dependent on direct contact between NK cells and VZV infected inoculum cells. Profiling of the NK cell surface receptor phenotype by multiparameter flow cytometry revealed that functional receptor expression is predominantly stable. Furthermore, inhibited NK cells were still capable of releasing cytotoxic granules when the stimulation signal bypassed receptor/ligand interactions and early signalling, suggesting that VZV paralyses NK cells from responding. Phosflow examination of key components in the degranulation signalling cascade also demonstrated perturbation following culture with VZV. In addition to inhibiting degranulation, IFN-\u03b3 and TNF production were also repressed by VZV co-culture, which was most strongly regulated in VZV infected NK cells. Interestingly, the closely related virus, herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1), was also capable of efficiently infecting NK cells in a cell-associated manner, and demonstrated a similar capacity to render NK cells unresponsive to target cell stimulation-however HSV-1 differentially targeted cytokine production compared to VZV. Our findings progress a growing understanding of pathogen inhibition of NK cell function, and reveal a previously unreported strategy for VZV to manipulate the immune response. ",
        "Maternal pre-pregnancy weight status modifies the influence of PUFAs and inflammatory biomarkers in breastmilk on infant growth. BACKGROUND: Human breastmilk contains pro- and anti-inflammatory compounds and hormones that can influence infant growth. However, little is known about the specific interrelationships between these compounds and whether their effects on infant growth may be influenced by pre-pregnancy weight status. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this novel, prospective cohort study was to assess the interrelationships between pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-\u03b1, IL-6), hormones (insulin, leptin) and PUFAs (n-6, n-3) in blood and breastmilk in early postpartum between women with normal BMI (Group 1, n = 18; 18.5<BMI\u226424.9 kg/m2) and with overweight/obesity (Group 2, n = 15; BMI\u226525.0 kg/m2) before pregnancy to determine if these components correlated to infant growth measures at age 4-8 weeks. METHODS: Participants were robustly phenotyped along with their infants at 4-8 weeks postpartum. TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, insulin, leptin, and n-3 and n-6 PUFAs measured in blood and breastmilk and compared between pre-pregnancy BMI groups and with infant weight, length, head circumference and % fat mass. RESULTS: Group 1 women had higher serum leptin (p<0.01) and breastmilk leptin (p<0.001) compared to Group 2. Other inflammatory markers, hormones, and total n-6, n-3 and n-6/n-3 ratio PUFAs were similar between pre-pregnancy BMI groups. No relationships were observed between whey inflammatory markers, hormones, PUFAs and growth measures in infants born to Group 2 women. However, TNF-\u03b1 was positively related and, IL-6, leptin, insulin, total n-6, n-3 and n-6/n-3 PUFAs in whey breastmilk were negatively correlated to infant growth measures in infants born to Group 1 women (p<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Pro-inflammatory qualities of breastmilk were associated with infant growth measures regardless of maternal pre-pregnancy BMI. However, infants born to women with overweight or obesity demonstrated less responsive growth to breastmilk contents. More studies are needed to assess longitudinal effects of this impact. ",
        "Coronary Artery Calcium From Early Adulthood to Middle Age and Left Ventricular Structure and Function. Background The relationship of coronary artery calcium (CAC) with adverse cardiac remodeling is not well established. We aimed to study the association of CAC in middle age and change in CAC from early adulthood to middle age with left ventricular (LV) function. Methods CAC score was measured by computed tomography at CARDIA study (Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults) year-15 examination and at year-25 examination (Y25) in 3043 and 3189 participants, respectively. CAC score was assessed as a continuous variable and log-transformed to account for nonlinearity. Change in CAC from year-15 examination to Y25 was evaluated as the absolute difference of log-transformed CAC from year-15 examination to Y25. LV structure and function were evaluated by echocardiography at Y25. Results At Y25, mean age was 50.1\u00b13.6 years, 56.6% women, 52.4% black. In the multivariable analysis at Y25, higher CAC was related to higher LV mass (\u03b2=1.218; adjusted P=0.007), higher LV end-diastolic volume (\u03b2=0.811; adjusted P=0.007), higher LV end-systolic volume (\u03b2=0.350; adjusted P=0.048), higher left atrial volume (\u03b2=0.214; adjusted P=0.009), and higher E/e' ratio (\u03b2=0.059; adjusted P=0.014). CAC was measured at both year-15 examination and Y25 in 2449 individuals. Higher change in CAC score during follow-up was independently related to higher LV mass index in blacks (\u03b2=4.789; adjusted P<0.001), but not in whites (\u03b2=1.051; adjusted P=0.283). Conclusions Higher CAC in middle age is associated with higher LV mass and volumes and worse LV diastolic function. Being free of CAC from young adulthood to middle age correlates to better LV function at middle age. Higher change in CAC score during follow-up is independently related to higher LV mass index in blacks. ",
        "Stabilization of the cardiac sarcolemma by sarcospan rescues DMD-associated cardiomyopathy. In the current preclinical study, we demonstrate the therapeutic potential of sarcospan (SSPN) overexpression to alleviate cardiomyopathy associated with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) utilizing dystrophin-deficient mdx mice with utrophin haploinsufficiency that more accurately represent the severe disease course of human DMD. SSPN interacts with dystrophin, the DMD disease gene product, and its autosomal paralog utrophin, which is upregulated in DMD as a partial compensatory mechanism. SSPN transgenic mice have enhanced abundance of fully glycosylated \u03b1-dystroglycan, which may further protect dystrophin-deficient cardiac membranes. Baseline echocardiography reveals SSPN improves systolic function and hypertrophic indices in mdx and mdx:utr-heterozygous mice. Assessment of SSPN transgenic mdx mice by hemodynamic pressure-volume methods highlights enhanced systolic performance compared to mdx controls. SSPN restores cardiac sarcolemma stability, the primary defect in DMD disease, reduces fibrotic response and improves contractile function. We demonstrate that SSPN ameliorates more advanced cardiac disease in the context of diminished sarcolemma expression of utrophin and \u03b21D integrin that mitigate disease severity and partially restores responsiveness to \u03b2-adrenergic stimulation. Overall, our current and previous findings suggest SSPN overexpression in DMD mouse models positively impacts skeletal, pulmonary and cardiac performance by addressing the stability of proteins at the sarcolemma that protect the heart from injury, supporting SSPN and membrane stabilization as a therapeutic target for DMD.

        "Vitamin D Deficiency Is Associated With Impaired Muscle Strength And Physical Performance In Community-Dwelling Older Adults: Findings From The English Longitudinal Study Of Ageing. Purpose: Maintaining skeletal muscle function throughout life is a crucial component of successful ageing. Adequate vitamin D status may be important in preserving muscle function. We aimed to determine the association between impaired muscle function and serum vitamin D status in community-dwelling older adults. Falls were explored as a secondary aim. Methods: Data were analyzed from adults aged \u226560 years, from Wave 6 of the English Longitudinal Study of Aging (ELSA). Handgrip strength (HGS) and the short physical performance battery (SPPB) were employed as measures of muscle strength and physical function, respectively. Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] was assessed with concentration <30 nmol/L classed as vitamin D deficient. Results: The study comprised 4157 community-dwelling adults with a mean age of 69.8 (SD 6.9). Overall, 30.6% had low HGS and 12.7% had low SPPB (\u22646). Participants with the lowest serum 25(OH)D (<30 nmol/L) had the highest prevalence of impaired muscle strength and performance (40.4% and 25.2%) compared with participants with levels \u226550 nmol/L (21.6% and 7.9%). Consistent with this, vitamin D deficiency (<30 nmol/L) was a significant determinant of low HGS (OR 1.44 [1.22, 1.71], p<0.001) and poor physical performance (OR 1.65 [1.31, 2.09], p<0.001) in the logistic regression models. Older adults partaking in regular moderate physical activity had significantly lower odds of impaired muscle strength (OR 0.65 [0.58, 0.79]) and physical function (OR 0.30 [0.24, 0.38]), p <0.001, respectively. Single or multiple falls (15.8% and 10.5% in past year) were not associated with vitamin D status. Conclusion: Vitamin D deficiency was associated with impaired muscle strength and performance in a large study of community-dwelling older people. It is generally accepted that vitamin D deficiency at the <30 nmol/L cut-off should be reversed to prevent bone disease, a strategy that may also protect skeletal muscle function in ageing. ",
        "A red orange and lemon by-products extract rich in anthocyanins inhibits the progression of diabetic nephropathy. The major cause of end-stage renal disease is the diabetic nephropathy. Oxidative stress contributes to the development of type II diabetes mellitus (T2DM). In this study we have evaluated the effect of a diet with a new standardized of red orange and lemon extract (RLE) rich in anthocyanins (ANT) in the progression of the kidney disease on Zucker diabetic fatty rats. Oxidative stress and renal function were analyzed. In diabetic rats, the RLE restored the blood glucose levels, body weight, and normalized the reactive oxygen species (ROS) total pathways. The kidney inflammation, in diabetic rats, has not shown significant change, showing that the oxidative stress rather than to inflammatory processes is a triggering factor in the renal complication associated with T2DM. Therefore, the administration of the RLE prevents this complication and this effect could be related to the inhibition of ROS production. ",
        "Rapid Clearance Profile of Plasma Circulating Tumor HPV Type 16 DNA during Chemoradiotherapy Correlates with Disease Control in HPV-Associated Oropharyngeal Cancer. PURPOSE: To identify a profile of circulating tumor human papilloma virus (HPV) DNA (ctHPVDNA) clearance kinetics that is associated with disease control after chemoradiotherapy (CRT) for HPV-associated oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC). EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: A multi-institutional prospective biomarker trial was conducted in 103 patients with (i) p16-positive OPSCC, (ii) M0 disease, and (iii) receipt of definitive CRT. Blood specimens were collected at baseline, weekly during CRT, and at follow-up visits. Optimized multianalyte digital PCR assays were used to quantify ctHPVDNA (types 16/18/31/33/35) in plasma. A control cohort of 55 healthy volunteers and 60 patients with non-HPV-associated malignancy was also analyzed. RESULTS: Baseline plasma ctHPVDNA had high specificity (97%) and high sensitivity (89%) for detecting newly diagnosed HPV-associated OPSCC. Pretreatment ctHPV16DNA copy number correlated with disease burden, tumor HPV copy number, and HPV integration status. We define a ctHPV16DNA favorable clearance profile as having high baseline copy number (>200 copies/mL) and >95% clearance of ctHPV16DNA by day 28 of CRT. Nineteen of 67 evaluable patients had a ctHPV16DNA favorable clearance profile, and none had persistent or recurrent regional disease after CRT. In contrast, patients with adverse clinical risk factors (T4 or >10 pack years) and an unfavorable ctHPV16DNA clearance profile had a 35% actuarial rate of persistent or recurrent regional disease after CRT (P = 0.0049). CONCLUSIONS: A rapid clearance profile of ctHPVDNA may predict likelihood of disease control in patients with HPV-associated OPSCC patients treated with definitive CRT and may be useful in selecting patients for deintensified therapy.

        "Sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease prion infection of human cerebral organoids. For the transmissible, neurogenerative family of prion diseases, few human models of infection exist and none represent structured neuronal tissue. Human cerebral organoids are self-organizing, three-dimensional brain tissues that can be grown from induced pluripotent stem cells. Organoids can model aspects of neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's Disease and Down's Syndrome, reproducing tau hyperphosphorylation and amyloid plaque pathology. To determine whether organoids could be used to reproduce human prion infection and pathogenesis, we inoculated organoids with two sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease prion subtypes. Organoids showed uptake, followed by clearance, of the infectious inoculum. Subsequent re-emergence of prion self-seeding activity indicated de novo propagation. Organoid health assays, prion titer, prion protein electrophoretic mobility and immunohistochemistry demonstrated inoculum-specific differences. Our study shows, for the first time, that cerebral organoids can model aspects of human prion disease and thus offer a powerful system for investigating different human prion subtype pathologies and testing putative therapeutics.

        "Spatially Defined Drug Targeting by in Situ Host-Guest Chemistry in a Living Animal. Ensuring effective drug concentration specifically at sites of need, while limiting systemic side effects, remains a challenge in the discovery and use of new drug molecules. Carriers targeted through biological affinity (e.g., antibodies) afford a common means of drug localization, yet often deliver considerably less than 1% of an administered drug to a desired site in the body. We report on an alternative targeting paradigm using pendant guest motifs to direct molecules to sites distinguished by a hydrogel bearing a high density of a complementary cucurbituril supramolecular host. Host-guest affinity (Keq) of 1012 M-1 serves to spatially localize \u223c4% of a model small molecule within hours of its administration in mice. These high-affinity interactions furthermore ensure long-lasting retention of the model compound at the site of interest, and the site can be serially targeted upon repeated dosing. This supramolecular homing axis extends the localization of small molecule payloads beyond injectable hydrogels, enabling targeting of modified biomaterials. This approach also has promising therapeutic utility, improving efficacy of a guest-modified chemotherapeutic agent in a tumor model. ",
        "Maternal IgA protects against the development of necrotizing enterocolitis in preterm infants. Neonates are protected from colonizing bacteria by antibodies secreted into maternal milk. Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a disease of neonatal preterm infants with high morbidity and mortality that is associated with intestinal inflammation driven by the microbiota1-3. The incidence of NEC is substantially lower in infants fed with maternal milk, although the mechanisms that underlie this benefit are not clear4-6. Here we show that maternal immunoglobulin A (IgA) is an important factor for protection against NEC. Analysis of IgA binding to fecal bacteria from preterm infants indicated that maternal milk was the predominant source of IgA in the first month of life and that a relative decrease in IgA-bound bacteria is associated with the development of NEC. Sequencing of IgA-bound and unbound bacteria revealed that before the onset of disease, NEC was associated with increasing domination by Enterobacteriaceae in the IgA-unbound fraction of the microbiota. Furthermore, we confirmed that IgA is critical for preventing NEC in a mouse model, in which pups that are reared by IgA-deficient mothers are susceptible to disease despite exposure to maternal milk. Our findings show that maternal IgA shapes the host-microbiota relationship of preterm neonates and that IgA in maternal milk is a critical and necessary factor for the prevention of NEC. ",
        "A landmark in drug discovery based on complex natural product synthesis. Despite their outstanding antitumour activity in mice, the limited supply from the natural sources has prevented drug discovery/development based on intact halichondrins. We achieved a total synthesis of C52-halichondrin-B amine (E7130) on a >10\u2009g scale with >99.8% purity under GMP conditions. Interestingly, E7130 not only is a novel microtubule dynamics inhibitor but can also increase intratumoural CD31-positive endothelial cells and reduce \u03b1-SMA-positive cancer-associated fibroblasts at pharmacologically relevant compound concentrations. According to these unique effects, E7130 significantly augment the effect of antitumour treatments in mouse models and is currently in a clinical trial. Overall, our work demonstrates that a total synthesis can address the issue of limited material supply in drug discovery/development even for the cases of complex natural products. ",
        "Close proximity interactions support transmission of ESBL-K. pneumoniae but not ESBL-E. coli in healthcare settings. Antibiotic-resistance of hospital-acquired infections is a major public health issue. The worldwide emergence and diffusion of extended-spectrum \u03b2-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae, including Escherichia coli (ESBL-EC) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (ESBL-KP), is of particular concern. Preventing their nosocomial spread requires understanding their transmission. Using Close Proximity Interactions (CPIs), measured by wearable sensors, and weekly ESBL-EC-and ESBL-KP-carriage data, we traced their possible transmission paths among 329 patients in a 200-bed long-term care facility over 4 months. Based on phenotypically defined resistance profiles to 12 antibiotics only, new bacterial acquisitions were tracked. Extending a previously proposed statistical method, the CPI network's ability to support observed incident-colonization episodes of ESBL-EC and ESBL-KP was tested. Finally, mathematical modeling based on our findings assessed the effect of several infection-control measures. A potential infector was identified in the CPI network for 80% (16/20) of ESBL-KP acquisition episodes. The lengths of CPI paths between ESBL-KP incident cases and their potential infectors were shorter than predicted by chance (P = 0.02), indicating that CPI-network relationships were consistent with dissemination. Potential ESBL-EC infectors were identified for 54% (19/35) of the acquisitions, with longer-than-expected lengths of CPI paths. These contrasting results yielded differing impacts of infection control scenarios, with contact reduction interventions proving less effective for ESBL-EC than for ESBL-KP. These results highlight the widely variable transmission patterns among ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae species. CPI networks supported ESBL-KP, but not ESBL-EC spread. These outcomes could help design more specific surveillance and control strategies to prevent in-hospital Enterobacteriaceae dissemination. ",
        "High fidelity fibre-based physiological sensing deep in tissue. Physiological sensing deep in tissue remains a clinical challenge. Here a flexible miniaturised sensing optrode providing a platform to perform minimally invasive in vivo in situ measurements is reported. Silica microspheres covalently coupled with a high density of ratiometrically configured fluorophores were deposited into etched pits on the distal end of a 150\u2009\u00b5m diameter multicore optical fibre. With this platform, photonic measurements of pH and oxygen concentration with high precision in the distal alveolar space of the lung are reported. We demonstrated the phenomenon that high-density deposition of carboxyfluorescein covalently coupled to silica microspheres shows an inverse shift in fluorescence in response to varying pH. This platform delivered fast and accurate measurements (\u00b10.02\u2009pH units and \u00b10.6\u2009mg/L of oxygen), near instantaneous response time and a flexible architecture for addition of multiple sensors.

        "Protein-based cardiogenic shock patient classifier. AIMS: Cardiogenic shock (CS) is associated with high short-term mortality and a precise CS risk stratification could guide interventions to improve patient outcome. Here, we developed a circulating protein-based score to predict short-term mortality risk among patients with CS. METHODS AND RESULTS: Mass spectrometry analysis of 2654 proteins was used for screening in the Barcelona discovery cohort (n\u2009=\u200948). Targeted quantitative proteomics analyses (n\u2009=\u200951 proteins) were used in the independent CardShock cohort (n\u2009=\u200997) to derive and cross-validate the protein classifier. The combination of four circulating proteins (Cardiogenic Shock 4 proteins-CS4P), discriminated patients with low and high 90-day risk of mortality. CS4P comprises the abundances of liver-type fatty acid-binding protein, beta-2-microglobulin, fructose-bisphosphate aldolase B, and SerpinG1. Within the CardShock cohort used for internal validation, the C-statistic was 0.78 for the CardShock risk score, 0.83 for the CS4P model, and 0.84 (P\u2009=\u20090.033 vs. CardShock risk score) for the combination of CardShock risk score with the CS4P model. The CardShock risk score with the CS4P model showed a marked benefit in patient reclassification, with a net reclassification improvement (NRI) of 0.49 (P\u2009=\u20090.020) compared with CardShock risk score. Similar reclassification metrics were observed in the IABP-SHOCK II risk score combined with CS4P (NRI =0.57; P\u2009=\u20090.032). The CS4P patient classification power was confirmed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). CONCLUSION: A new protein-based CS patient classifier, the CS4P, was developed for short-term mortality risk stratification. CS4P improved predictive metrics in combination with contemporary risk scores, which may guide clinicians in selecting patients for advanced therapies. ",
        "Wearing a Cooling Vest During Half-Time Improves Intermittent Exercise in the Heat. Endurance and intermittent exercise performance are impaired by high ambient temperatures. Various countermeasures are considered to prevent the decline in exercise performance in the heat, convenient, and practical cooling strategies attracts attention. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of wearing a new type of cooling vest which cooled torso and neck during half-time (HT) on intermittent exercise performance that imitated intermittent athletic games. All measurements on the experiments were carried out with the bicycle ergometer. Eight male soccer players performed a familiarization session and two experimental trials of a 2 \u00d7 30 min intermittent cycling exercise protocol, which consisted of a 5 s maximal power pedaling (body weight \u00d70.075 kp) every minutes separated by 25 s unloaded pedaling (80 rpm) and rest (30 s) in the heat (33.0\u00b0C; 50% relative humidity). The two trials included cooling-vest condition (VEST) and control condition (CON), and the difference is with or without wearing cooling vest imposed for 15 min at HT. Mean and peak power output, rectal (Tre) and skin temperature (neck, upper back, chest, right upper arm, and thigh), heart rate (HR), deep thigh temperature, rating of perceived exertion (RPE), and thermal comfort (TC) and thermal sensation (TS) were measured. Mean power output at 2nd half was significantly greater (p < 0.05) in VEST (3rd trial: 589 \u00b1 58 W, 4th trial: 584 \u00b1 58 W) than in CON (3rd trial: 561 \u00b1 53 W, 4th trial: 561 \u00b1 53 W). HR were significantly lower in VEST during HT and higher in VEST at the last maximal pedaling (p < 0.05). At the end of HT, neck skin temperature and mean skin temperature were significantly lower in VEST (32.04 \u00b1 1.47\u00b0C, 33.76 \u00b1 1.08\u00b0C, respectively) than in CON (36.69 \u00b1 0.78\u00b0C, 36.14 \u00b1 0.67\u00b0C, respectively) (p < 0.05). During 2nd half, TS, TC, and RPE were significantly lower in VEST than in CON (p < 0.05). There was no significant difference in Tre and deep thigh temperature throughout each conditions. These results indicate that wearing a new type of cooling vest during HT significantly improves intermittent exercise performance in the heat with decreased neck and mean skin temperature and improved subjective responses.

        "Weight Gain, Hypertension, and the Emergence of a Maladaptive Cardiovascular Phenotype Among US Football Players. Importance: Former US football athletes are at increased risk of cardiovascular (CV) morbidity and mortality compared with the general population and other professional athletes. However, responsible maladaptive CV phenotypes have not been fully characterized. Objective: To address the emergence and progression of multiple independent factors associated with CV risk across serial years of collegiate US football participation. Design, Setting, and Participants: Collegiate US football athletes from 2 National Collegiate Athletic Association Division I programs were recruited as freshmen between June 2014 and June 2017 and analyzed at multiple points throughout 3 complete years of collegiate US football participation (until January 2019). Excluded athletes were those who did not complete any season of US football training because of injury, illness, or leaving the team. Factors associated with CV risk assessed clinically, by transthoracic echocardiography, and by vascular applanation tonometry were recorded. Exposures: The exposure of interest was seasonal US football exposure, including training, competition, and the training environment. Main Outcomes and Measures: Primary outcome measures were left ventricular mass index and geometry (cardiac structure), early diastolic myocardial relaxation velocity (E'; diastolic function), and pulse-wave velocity (arterial stiffness). Results: Of 186 individuals recruited as freshmen, 126 athletes were included in analyzed data. Collegiate US football athletes (62 white individuals [49%]; 63 black individuals [50%]; 77 nonlinemen [61%]; 49 linemen [39%]; 126 male individuals [100%]) weighed a mean (SD) of 101.1 (21.0) kg, with a mean systolic blood pressure of 129.1 (11.6) mm Hg at baseline of the freshman season. Adjusting for race, height, and player position, there were significant increases in weight (mean [SE] \u0394, 4.74 [0.6] kg; P\u2009<\u2009.001), systolic blood pressure (mean [SE] \u0394, 11.6 [1.6] mm Hg; P\u2009<\u2009.001), and pulse-wave velocity (mean [SE] \u0394, 0.24 [0.09] m/s; P\u2009=\u2009.007), and significant declines in E' (mean [SE] \u0394, -1.7 [0.3] cm/s; P\u2009<\u2009.001) across 3 years of US football participation. Weight gain was associated with both arterial stiffening (increased pulse-wave velocity, \u03b2\u2009=\u20090.01 [SE, 0.004]; P\u2009=\u2009.003) and the development of concentric left ventricular hypertrophy (odds ratio, 1.09 [95% CI, 1.05-1.14]; P\u2009<\u2009.001); increased systolic blood pressure was also associated with arterial stiffening (\u03b2\u2009=\u20090.01 [SE, 0.003]; P\u2009=\u2009.007) and the development of concentric left ventricular hypertrophy (odds ratio, 1.04 [95% CI, 1.01-1.07]; P\u2009=\u2009.02). Conclusions and Relevance: Collegiate US football athletes who gain weight and develop increased systolic blood pressure levels are at risk for the development of a pathologic CV phenotype characterized by concentric left ventricular hypertrophy, arterial stiffening, and reduced left ventricular diastolic function. Future work aimed at optimizing CV health in this population, who are young but uniquely at risk, is warranted. ",
        "U.S. Nurse Practitioner Beliefs About Routine HIV Screening: Predicting Behaviors. HIV is a preventable infection. Effective HIV prevention interventions, which include routine HIV screening, have reduced HIV transmission. As health care providers, nurse practitioners (NPs) have a role in screening for HIV. In this study, we explored NP attitudinal, social normative (expectation and priority), and behavioral control (perceived barriers and facilitators) beliefs that predicted their self-reported HIV screening behaviors. The Theory of Planned Behavior guided the study. Data from 141 NPs were collected through a cross-sectional, paper and pencil survey. Findings revealed that the belief that \"my office staff supports routine HIV screening with my patients\" predicted HIV screening, whereas the belief that \"consent from a parent/guardian should be obtained before screening for HIV in a person younger than 18 years\" predicted less HIV screening. Nurse practitioners identified social normative expectations to be most influential in predicting their routine HIV screening behaviors. ",
        "Macrophage subsets exhibit distinct E. coli-LPS tolerisable cytokines associated with the negative regulators, IRAK-M and Tollip. Macrophages (M\u03d5s) play a central role in mucosal immunity by pathogen sensing and instruction of adaptive immune responses. Prior challenge to endotoxin can render M\u03c6s refractory to secondary exposure, suppressing the inflammatory response. Previous studies demonstrated a differential subset-specific sensitivity to endotoxin tolerance (ET), mediated by LPS from the oral pathogen, Porphyromonas gingivalis (PG). The aim of this study was to investigate ET mechanisms associated with M\u03c6 subsets responding to entropathogenic E. coli K12-LPS. M1- and M2-like M\u03c6s were generated in vitro from the THP-1 cell line by differentiation with PMA and Vitamin D3, respectively. This study investigated ET mechanisms induced in M1 and M2 M\u03c6 subsets, by measuring modulation of expression by RT-PCR, secretion of cytokines by sandwich ELISA, LPS receptor, TLR4, as well as endogenous TLR inhibitors, IRAK-M and Tollip by Western blotting. In contrast to PG-LPS tolerisation, E. coli K12-LPS induced ET failed to exhibit a subset-specific response with respect to the pro-inflammatory cytokine, TNF\u03b1, whereas exhibited a differential response for IL-10 and IL-6. TNF\u03b1 expression and secretion was significantly suppressed in both M1- and M2-like M\u03c6s. IL-10 and IL-6, on the other hand, were suppressed in M1s and refractory to suppression in M2s. ET suppressed TLR4 mRNA, but not TLR4 protein, yet induced differential augmentation of the negative regulatory molecules, Tollip in M1 and IRAK-M in M2 M\u03c6s. In conclusion, E. coli K12-LPS differentially tolerises M\u03c6 subsets at the level of anti-inflammatory cytokines, associated with a subset-specific divergence in negative regulators and independent of TLR4 down-regulation.

        "Apelin protects against abdominal aortic aneurysm and the therapeutic role of neutral endopeptidase resistant apelin analogs. Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) remains the second most frequent vascular disease with high mortality but has no approved medical therapy. We investigated the direct role of apelin (APLN) in AAA and identified a unique approach to enhance APLN action as a therapeutic intervention for this disease. Loss of APLN potentiated angiotensin II (Ang II)-induced AAA formation, aortic rupture, and reduced survival. Formation of AAA was driven by increased smooth muscle cell (SMC) apoptosis and oxidative stress in Apln-/y aorta and in APLN-deficient cultured murine and human aortic SMCs. Ang II-induced myogenic response and hypertension were greater in Apln-/y mice, however, an equivalent hypertension induced by phenylephrine, an \u03b1-adrenergic agonist, did not cause AAA or rupture in Apln-/y mice. We further identified Ang converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the major negative regulator of the renin-Ang system (RAS), as an important target of APLN action in the vasculature. Using a combination of genetic, pharmacological, and modeling approaches, we identified neutral endopeptidase (NEP) that is up-regulated in human AAA tissue as a major enzyme that metabolizes and inactivates APLN-17 peptide. We designed and synthesized a potent APLN-17 analog, APLN-NMeLeu9-A2, that is resistant to NEP cleavage. This stable APLN analog ameliorated Ang II-mediated adverse aortic remodeling and AAA formation in an established model of AAA, high-fat diet (HFD) in Ldlr-/- mice. Our findings define a critical role of APLN in AAA formation through induction of ACE2 and protection of vascular SMCs, whereas stable APLN analogs provide an effective therapy for vascular diseases.

        "An Intelligent DNA Nanorobot with in Vitro Enhanced Protein Lysosomal Degradation of HER2. DNA nanorobots have emerged as new tools for nanomedicine with the potential to ameliorate the delivery and anticancer efficacy of various drugs. DNA nanostructures have been considered one of the most promising nanocarriers. In the present study, we report a DNA framework-based intelligent DNA nanorobot for selective lysosomal degradation of tumor-specific proteins on cancer cells. We site-specifically anchored an anti-HER2 aptamer (HApt) on a tetrahedral framework nucleic acid (tFNA). This DNA nanorobot (HApt-tFNA) could target HER2-positive breast cancer cells and specifically induce the lysosomal degradation of the membrane protein HER2. An injection of the DNA nanorobot into a mouse model revealed that the presence of tFNA enhanced the stability and prolonged the blood circulation time of HApt, and HApt-tFNA could therefore drive HER2 into lysosomal degradation with a higher efficiency. The formation of the HER2-HApt-tFNA complexes resulted in the HER2-mediated endocytosis and digestion in lysosomes, which effectively reduced the amount of HER2 on the cell surfaces. An increased HER2 digestion through HApt-tFNA further induced cell apoptosis and arrested cell growth. Hence, this novel DNA nanorobot sheds new light on targeted protein degradation for precision breast cancer therapy. ",

In this study, we aimed to develop probes with higher affinity for the sigma-1 receptor. For this purpose, we synthesized and evaluated compounds, namely, vesamicol derivatives, in which alkyl chains of varying chain length were introduced between a piperazine ring and a benzene ring. The binding affinity of the vesamicol derivatives for the sigma-1 receptor tended to increase depending on the length of the alkyl chain between the benzene ring and the piperazine ring. The sigma-1 receptor of 2-(4-(3-phenylpropyl)piperazin-1-yl)cyclohexan-1-ol (5) (Ki\u202f=\u202f5.8\u202fnM) exhibited the highest binding affinity; therefore, we introduced radioiodine into the benzene ring in 5. The radioiodine labeled probe [125I]2-(4-(3-(4-iodophenyl)propyl)piperazin-1-yl)cyclohexan-1-ol ([125I]10) showed high accumulation in the sigma-1 receptor expressing DU-145 cells both in vitro and in vivo. Co-injection of [125I]10 with an excess level of a sigma receptor ligand, haloperidol, resulted in a significant decrease in the tumor accumulation in vitro and in vivo, indicating sigma receptor-mediated tumor uptake. These results provide useful information for developing sigma-1 receptor imaging probes. ",
        "The extracellular gate shapes the energy profile of an ABC exporter. ABC exporters harness the energy of ATP to pump substrates across membranes. Extracellular gate opening and closure are key steps of the transport cycle, but the underlying mechanism is poorly understood. Here, we generated a synthetic single domain antibody (sybody) that recognizes the heterodimeric ABC exporter TM287/288 exclusively in the presence of ATP, which was essential to solve a 3.2\u2009\u00c5 crystal structure of the outward-facing transporter. The sybody binds to an extracellular wing and strongly inhibits ATPase activity by shifting the transporter's conformational equilibrium towards the outward-facing state, as shown by double electron-electron resonance (DEER). Mutations that facilitate extracellular gate opening result in a comparable equilibrium shift and strongly reduce ATPase activity and drug transport. Using the sybody as conformational probe, we demonstrate that efficient extracellular gate closure is required to dissociate the NBD dimer after ATP hydrolysis to reset the transporter back to its inward-facing state.

        "A Specialized Neural Circuit Gates Social Vocalizations in the Mouse. Vocalizations are fundamental to mammalian communication, but the underlying neural circuits await detailed characterization. Here, we used an intersectional genetic method to label and manipulate neurons in the midbrain periaqueductal gray (PAG) that are transiently active in male mice when they produce ultrasonic courtship vocalizations (USVs). Genetic silencing of PAG-USV neurons rendered males unable to produce USVs and impaired their ability to attract females. Conversely, activating PAG-USV neurons selectively triggered USV production, even in the absence of any female cues. Optogenetic stimulation combined with axonal tracing indicates that PAG-USV neurons gate downstream vocal-patterning circuits. Indeed, activating PAG neurons that innervate the nucleus retroambiguus, but not those innervating the parabrachial nucleus, elicited USVs in both male and female mice. These experiments establish that a dedicated population of PAG neurons gives rise to a descending circuit necessary and sufficient for USV production while also demonstrating the communicative salience of male USVs.

        "Increased Risk of Opioid Overdose Death Following Cold Weather: A Case-Crossover Study. BACKGROUND: The United States is in the midst of an opioid overdose crisis. Little is known about the role of environmental factors in increasing risk of fatal opioid overdose. METHODS: We conducted a case-crossover analysis of 3,275 opioid overdose deaths recorded in Connecticut and Rhode Island in 2014-2017. We compared the mean ambient temperature on the day of death, as well as average temperature up to 14 days before death, to referent periods matched on year, month, and day of week. RESULTS: Low average temperatures over the 3-7 days before death were associated with higher odds of fatal opioid overdose. Relative to 11\u00b0C, an average temperature of 0\u00b0C over the 7 days before death was associated with a 30% higher odds of death (odds ratio: 1.3; 95% confidence interval, 1.1, 1.5). CONCLUSIONS: Low average temperature may be associated with higher risk of death due to opioid overdose. ",
        "Antidepressant treatment, not depression, leads to reductions in behavioral and neural responses to pain empathy. Major depressive disorder (MDD) has been hypothesized to lead to impairments in empathy. Previous cross-sectional studies did not disentangle effects of MDD itself and antidepressant treatment. In this first longitudinal neuroimaging study on empathy in depression, 29 patients with MDD participated in two functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) sessions before and after 3 months of antidepressant therapy. We compared their responses to an empathy for pain task to a group of healthy controls (N\u2009=\u200935). All participants provided self-report ratings targeting cognitive (perspective taking) and affective (unpleasant affect) aspects of empathy. To control for general effects on processing of negative affective states, participants additionally underwent an electrical pain task. Before treatment, we found no differences in empathic responses between controls and patients with MDD. After treatment, patients showed significant decreases in both affective empathy and activity of three a priori selected brain regions associated with empathy for pain. Decreases in affective empathy were moreover correlated with symptom improvement. Moreover, functional connectivity during the empathy task between areas associated with affective (anterior insula) and cognitive (precuneus) empathy decreased between sessions in the MDD group. Neither cognitive empathy nor responses to painful electrical shocks were changed after treatment. These findings contradict previous cross-sectional reports of empathy deficits in acute MDD. Rather, they suggest that antidepressant treatment reduces the aversive responses triggered by exposure to the suffering of others. Importantly, this cannot be explained by a general blunting of negative affect, as treatment did not change self-experienced pain. ",
        "Is Cerebrospinal Fluid Superoxide Dismutase 1 a Biomarker of Tau But Not Amyloid-Induced Neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's Disease?. Copper/zinc superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) scavenges free radicals that may otherwise damage brain parenchyma. Impaired SOD1 activity drives Alzheimer's disease (AD) neuropathology in animal models and postmortem AD brains. Yet, it is unknown how cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) SOD1 is related in vivo to AD-relevant cognitive, neuroimaging, and CSF neurotoxic factors, and what potential mechanisms underlie these associations. We found that higher CSF SOD1 correlated with better global cognition scores, yet less gray matter (GM) and glucose metabolism in AD-sensitive parietal and frontal regions. Higher CSF SOD1 was also associated with more CSF total tau and phosphorylated tau-181, but not beta-amyloid 1-42. Through mediation analyses, higher total tau largely mitigated higher CSF SOD1 and better global cognition associations, and it fully accounted for less predicted regional GM but not glucose metabolism. Among participants who developed AD over 2 years or had AD at baseline, higher CSF SOD1 was initially related to more regional GM. This association became nonsignificant with full mediation via higher CSF total tau, through which higher CSF SOD1 predicted more total tau and in turn less GM. Our observations lead to the hypothesis that SOD1 antioxidation reflects tau but not amyloid accumulation, which may lead to pro-oxidant-based neurodegeneration and cognitive dysfunction. Antioxid.

        "PCP and Wnt pathway components act in parallel during zebrafish mechanosensory hair cell orientation. Planar cell polarity (PCP) plays crucial roles in developmental processes such as gastrulation, neural tube closure and hearing. Wnt pathway mutants are often classified as PCP mutants due to similarities between their phenotypes. Here, we show that in the zebrafish lateral line, disruptions of the PCP and Wnt pathways have differential effects on hair cell orientations. While mutations in the PCP genes vangl2 and scrib cause random orientations of hair cells, mutations in wnt11f1, gpc4 and fzd7a/b induce hair cells to adopt a concentric pattern. This concentric pattern is not caused by defects in PCP but is due to misaligned support cells. The molecular basis of the support cell defect is unknown but we demonstrate that the PCP and Wnt pathways work in parallel to establish proper hair cell orientation. Consequently, hair cell orientation defects are not solely explained by defects in PCP signaling, and some hair cell phenotypes warrant re-evaluation. ",
        "Using wastewater-based analysis to monitor the effects of legalized retail sales on cannabis consumption in Washington State, USA. AIMS: To perform a wastewater-based analysis to explore the impact of newly legalized retail cannabis sales on its use and to determine if this approach could estimate the size of the legal market place, which began 1\u00a0August 2014 in the study area. DESIGN: Laboratory study of raw wastewater samples collected and analyzed over the 3-year period from 2014 to 2016. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Samples obtained from the two wastewater treatment plants that serviced a municipality of 200\u2009000 people in the state of Washington, USA. MEASUREMENTS: Quantitative analysis of 24-hour composite influent samples for the metabolite of the active ingredient in cannabis, 11-nor-9-Carboxy-\u03949-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC-COOH) were performed by liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry. FINDINGS: Wastewater estimates for THC-COOH increased by 9% per quarter, suggesting a doubling in cannabis consumption from 1 December 2013 to 31 December 2016. State-sold THC increased at nearly 70% per quarter, while stores operated from 1 August 2014 to 31 December 2016. Estimating the proportion of the total cannabis market supplied by state-regulated cannabis from these data is not currently achievable. CONCLUSION: A wastewater-based measure of cannabis consumption suggests a significant increase in consumption in Washington, USA following legalization, and that legal sales appear to have displaced a large portion of the illicit market.

        "Genome-wide association study implicates CHRNA2 in cannabis use disorder. Cannabis is the most frequently used illicit psychoactive substance worldwide; around one in ten users become dependent. The risk for cannabis use disorder (CUD) has a strong genetic component, with twin heritability estimates ranging from 51 to 70%. Here we performed a genome-wide association study of CUD in 2,387 cases and 48,985 controls, followed by replication in 5,501 cases and 301,041 controls. We report a genome-wide significant risk locus for CUD (P\u2009=\u20099.31\u2009\u00d7\u200910-12) that replicates in an independent population (Preplication\u2009=\u20093.27\u2009\u00d7\u200910-3, Pmeta-analysis\u2009=\u20099.09\u2009\u00d7\u200910-12). The index variant (rs56372821) is a strong expression quantitative trait locus for cholinergic receptor nicotinic \u03b12 subunit (CHRNA2); analyses of the genetically regulated gene expression identified a significant association of CHRNA2 expression with CUD in brain tissue. At the polygenic level, analyses revealed a significant decrease in the risk of CUD with increased load of variants associated with cognitive performance. The results provide biological insights and inform on the genetic architecture of CUD. ",
        "Regional variations of care in home care and long-term care: a retrospective cohort study. BACKGROUND: Many aging adults undergo progressive loss of autonomy, develop increasingly complex medical needs and experience multiple care transitions. We sought to determine the degree of variation in rates of transfer from home care services and long-term care in several Canadian jurisdictions. METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, we examined transitions from home care services and long-term care to different possible end states: change in health stability (getting better or worse), transfer to hospital, transfer to another care setting or death. We used standardized interRAI assessments from long-term care and home care linked to hospital records (data from the Discharge Abstract Database and National Ambulatory Care Reporting System) from 2010 to 2016. Multistate modelling was used to adjust for patients with complex health status and transitions in care. RESULTS: We report data for 254 664 patients in home care programs and 162 045 residents in long-term care. Compared with patients in Ontario, patients requiring home care services in Alberta and British Columbia had increased odds of being admitted to hospital regardless of the underlying severity of illness (the adjusted odds ratios [OR] ranged from 2.08 to 3.77 in Alberta and from 1.28 to 1.46 in BC). Residents in long-term care in Alberta and BC had less than half the odds of being transferred to hospital, independent of all other factors, when compared with long-term care residents in Ontario (the adjusted OR ranged from 0.38 to 0.39 in Alberta and from 0.33 to 0.44 in BC). INTERPRETATION: Significant variations in transfer rates were observed between provinces, even after controlling for individual patient characteristics. These results suggest that transfers to hospital are largely driven by health care policies, health care professional practice patterns and available infrastructure rather than individual patient needs.

        "Assessment of Machine Learning Detection of Environmental Enteropathy and Celiac Disease in Children. Importance: Duodenal biopsies from children with enteropathies associated with undernutrition, such as environmental enteropathy (EE) and celiac disease (CD), display significant histopathological overlap. Objective: To develop a convolutional neural network (CNN) to enhance the detection of pathologic morphological features in diseased vs healthy duodenal tissue. Design, Setting, and Participants: In this prospective diagnostic study, a CNN consisting of 4 convolutions, 1 fully connected layer, and 1 softmax layer was trained on duodenal biopsy images. Data were provided by 3 sites: Aga Khan University Hospital, Karachi, Pakistan; University Teaching Hospital, Lusaka, Zambia; and University of Virginia, Charlottesville. Duodenal biopsy slides from 102 children (10 with EE from Aga Khan University Hospital, 16 with EE from University Teaching Hospital, 34 with CD from University of Virginia, and 42 with no disease from University of Virginia) were converted into 3118 images. The CNN was designed and analyzed at the University of Virginia. The data were collected, prepared, and analyzed between November 2017 and February 2018. Main Outcomes and Measures: Classification accuracy of the CNN per image and per case and incorrect classification rate identified by aggregated 10-fold cross-validation confusion/error matrices of CNN models. Results: Overall, 102 children participated in this study, with a median (interquartile range) age of 31.0 (20.3-75.5) months and a roughly equal sex distribution, with 53 boys (51.9%). The model demonstrated 93.4% case-detection accuracy and had a false-negative rate of 2.4%. Confusion metrics indicated most incorrect classifications were between patients with CD and healthy patients. Feature map activations were visualized and learned distinctive patterns, including microlevel features in duodenal tissues, such as alterations in secretory cell populations. Conclusions and Relevance: A machine learning-based histopathological analysis model demonstrating 93.4% classification accuracy was developed for identifying and differentiating between duodenal biopsies from children with EE and CD. The combination of the CNN with a deconvolutional network enabled feature recognition and highlighted secretory cells' role in the model's ability to differentiate between these histologically similar diseases.

        "Which healthcare workers work with acute respiratory illness? Evidence from Canadian acute-care hospitals during 4 influenza seasons: 2010-2011 to 2013-2014. BACKGROUND: Healthcare workers (HCWs) are at risk of acquiring and transmitting respiratory viruses while working in healthcare settings. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the incidence of and factors associated with HCWs working during an acute respiratory illness (ARI). METHODS: HCWs from 9 Canadian hospitals were prospectively enrolled in active surveillance for ARI during the 2010-2011 to 2013-2014 influenza seasons. Daily illness diaries during ARI episodes collected information on symptoms and work attendance. RESULTS: At least 1 ARI episode was reported by 50.4% of participants each study season. Overall, 94.6% of ill individuals reported working at least 1 day while symptomatic, resulting in an estimated 1.9 days of working while symptomatic and 0.5 days of absence during an ARI per participant season. In multivariable analysis, the adjusted relative risk of working while symptomatic was higher for physicians and lower for nurses relative to other HCWs. Participants were more likely to work if symptoms were less severe and on the illness onset date compared to subsequent days. The most cited reason for working while symptomatic was that symptoms were mild and the HCW felt well enough to work (67%). Participants were more likely to state that they could not afford to stay home if they did not have paid sick leave and were younger. CONCLUSIONS: HCWs worked during most episodes of ARI, most often because their symptoms were mild. Further data are needed to understand how best to balance the costs and risks of absenteeism versus those associated with working while ill. ",
        "Non-invasive faecal sampling reveals spatial organization and improves measures of genetic diversity for the conservation assessment of territorial species: Caucasian lynx as a case species. The Caucasian lynx, Lynx lynx dinniki, has one of the southernmost distributions in the Eurasian lynx range, covering Anatolian Turkey, the Caucasus and Iran. Little is known about the biology and the genetic status of this subspecies. To collect baseline genetic, ecological and behavioural data and benefit future conservation of L. l. dinniki, we monitored 11 lynx territories (396 km2) in northwestern Anatolia. We assessed genetic diversity of this population by non-invasively collecting 171 faecal samples and trapped and sampled 12 lynx individuals using box traps. We observed high allelic variation at 11 nuclear microsatellite markers, and found no signs of inbreeding despite the potential isolation of this population. We obtained similar numbers of distinct genotypes from the two sampling sources. Our results indicated that first order female relatives occupy neighbouring territories (female philopatry) and that territorial male lynx were highly unrelated to each other and to female territorial lynx, suggesting long distance male dispersal. Particular male and female resident territorial lynx and their offspring (kittens and subadults) were more likely to be trapped than resident floaters or dispersing (unrelated) lynx. Conversely, we obtained more data for unrelated lynx and higher numbers of territorials using non-invasive sampling (faeces). When invasive and non-invasive samples were analysed separately, the spatial organisation of lynx (in terms of female philopatry and females and males occupying permanent ranges) affected measures of genetic diversity in such a way that estimates of genetic diversity were reduced if only invasive samples were considered. It appears that, at small spatial scales, invasive sampling using box traps may underestimate the genetic diversity in carnivores with permanent ranges and philopatry such as the Eurasian lynx. As non-invasive sampling can also provide additional data on diet and spatial organisation, we advocate the use of such samples for conservation genetic studies of vulnerable, endangered or data deficient territorial species.

        "Cavitation dose painting for focused ultrasound-induced blood-brain barrier disruption. Focused ultrasound combined with microbubble for blood-brain barrier disruption (FUS-BBBD) is a promising technique for noninvasive and localized brain drug delivery. This study demonstrates that passive cavitation imaging (PCI) is capable of predicting the location and concentration of nanoclusters delivered by FUS-BBBD. During FUS-BBBD treatment of mice, the acoustic emissions from FUS-activated microbubbles were passively detected by an ultrasound imaging system and processed offline using a frequency-domain PCI algorithm. After the FUS treatment, radiolabeled gold nanoclusters, 64Cu-AuNCs, were intravenously injected into the mice and imaged by positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT). The centers of the stable cavitation dose (SCD) maps obtained by PCI and the corresponding centers of the 64Cu-AuNCs concentration maps obtained by PET coincided within 0.3\u2009\u00b1\u20090.4\u2009mm and 1.6\u2009\u00b1\u20091.1\u2009mm in the transverse and axial directions of the FUS beam, respectively. The SCD maps were found to be linearly correlated with the 64Cu-AuNCs concentration maps on a pixel-by-pixel level. These findings suggest that SCD maps can spatially \"paint\" the delivered nanocluster\u00a0concentration, a technique that we named as cavitation dose painting. This PCI-based cavitation dose painting technique in combination with FUS-BBBD opens new horizons in spatially targeted and modulated brain drug delivery. ",
        "Patterns of Opioid Administration Among Opioid-Naive Inpatients and Associations With Postdischarge Opioid Use: A Cohort Study. Background: Patterns of inpatient opioid use and their associations with postdischarge opioid use are poorly understood. Objective: To measure patterns in timing, duration, and setting of opioid administration in opioid-naive hospitalized patients and to examine associations with postdischarge use. Design: Retrospective cohort study using electronic health record data from 2010 to 2014. Setting: 12 community and academic hospitals in Pennsylvania. Patients: 148\u00a0068 opioid-naive patients (191\u00a0249 admissions) with at least 1 outpatient encounter within 12 months before and after admission. Measurements: Number of days and patterns of inpatient opioid use; any outpatient use (self-report and/or prescription orders) 90 and 365 days after discharge. Results: Opioids were administered in 48% of admissions. Patients were given opioids for a mean of 67.9% (SD, 25.0%) of their stay. Location of administration of first opioid on admission, timing of last opioid before discharge, and receipt of nonopioid analgesics varied substantially. After adjustment for potential confounders, 5.9% of inpatients receiving opioids had outpatient use at 90 days compared with 3.0% of those without inpatient use (difference, 3.0 percentage points [95% CI, 2.8 to 3.2 percentage points]). Opioid use at 90 days was higher in inpatients receiving opioids less than 12 hours before discharge than in those with at least 24 opioid-free hours before discharge (7.5% vs. 3.9%; difference, 3.6 percentage points [CI, 3.3 to 3.9 percentage points]). Differences based on proportion of the stay with opioid use were modest (opioid use at 90 days was 6.4% and 5.4%, respectively, for patients with opioid use for \u226575% vs. \u226425% of their stay; difference, 1.0 percentage point [CI, 0.4 to 1.5 percentage points]). Associations were similar for opioid use 365 days after discharge. Limitation: Potential unmeasured confounders related to opioid use. Conclusion: This study found high rates of opioid administration to opioid-naive inpatients and associations between specific patterns of inpatient use and risk for long-term use after discharge.

        "Quantitative Interactomics in Primary T Cells Provides a Rationale for Concomitant PD-1 and BTLA Coinhibitor Blockade in Cancer Immunotherapy. Deciphering how TCR signals are modulated by coinhibitory receptors is of fundamental and clinical interest. Using quantitative interactomics, we define the composition and dynamics of the PD-1 and BTLA coinhibitory signalosomes in primary effector T\u00a0cells and at the T\u00a0cell-antigen-presenting cell interface. We also solve the existing controversy regarding the role of the SHP-1 and SHP-2 protein-tyrosine phosphatases in mediating PD-1 coinhibition. PD-1 predominantly recruits SHP-2, but when absent, it recruits SHP-1 and remains functional. In contrast, BTLA predominantly recruits SHP-1 and to a lesser extent SHP-2. By separately analyzing the PD-1-SHP-1 and PD-1-SHP-2 complexes, we show that both dampen the TCR and\u00a0CD28 signaling pathways equally. Therefore, our study illustrates how comparison of coinhibitory receptor signaling via quantitative interactomics in primary T\u00a0cells unveils their extent of redundancy and provides a rationale for designing combinations of blocking antibodies in cancer immunotherapy on the basis of undisputed modes of action.

        "Inherited IL-18BP deficiency in human fulminant viral hepatitis. Fulminant viral hepatitis (FVH) is a devastating and unexplained condition that strikes otherwise healthy individuals during primary infection with common liver-tropic viruses. We report a child who died of FVH upon infection with hepatitis A virus (HAV) at age 11 yr and who was homozygous for a private 40-nucleotide deletion in IL18BP, which encodes the IL-18 binding protein (IL-18BP). This mutation is loss-of-function, unlike the variants found in a homozygous state in public databases. We show that human IL-18 and IL-18BP are both secreted mostly by hepatocytes and macrophages in the liver. Moreover, in the absence of IL-18BP, excessive NK cell activation by IL-18 results in uncontrolled killing of human hepatocytes in vitro. Inherited human IL-18BP deficiency thus underlies fulminant HAV hepatitis by unleashing IL-18. These findings provide proof-of-principle that FVH can be caused by single-gene inborn errors that selectively disrupt liver-specific immunity. They also show that human IL-18 is toxic to the liver and that IL-18BP is its antidote. ",
        "Utilization of an Employee Behavioral Health Program and Its Effects on Outcomes for Depression and Anxiety Disorders. OBJECTIVE: To examine the impact of an employer-sponsored behavioral health program on depression and anxiety by assessing dose effect of psychotherapy. METHODS: A retrospective data analysis of patients with baseline scores more than or equal to 10 on the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ9) or the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale (GAD7). Survival analyses were conducted to assess whether those with a higher number of therapy sessions per episode (dose) achieved faster response (score reduction by 50% or below 10). RESULTS: Patients with medium (8 to 12 visits) or high (more than 12 visits) dose achieved faster response than those with low dose (less than eight visits; hazard ratios more than 1.5, P\u200a<\u200a0.05). No significant difference was found between the medium and high dose. CONCLUSION: Higher dose of psychotherapy is correlated with improved behavioral health outcomes, although there appears to be no incremental benefit beyond a certain level. ",
        "Precision Aging: Applying Precision Medicine to the Field of Cognitive Aging. The current \"one size fits all\" approach to our cognitive aging population is not adequate to close the gap between cognitive health span and lifespan. In this review article, we present a novel model for understanding, preventing, and treating age-related cognitive impairment (ARCI) based on concepts borrowed from precision medicine. We will discuss how multiple risk factors can be classified into risk categories because of their interrelatedness in real life, the genetic variants that increase sensitivity to, or ameliorate, risk for ARCI, and the brain drivers or common mechanisms mediating brain aging. Rather than providing a definitive model of risk for ARCI and cognitive decline, the Precision Aging model is meant as a starting point to guide future research. To that end, after briefly discussing key risk categories, genetic risks, and brain drivers, we conclude with a discussion of steps that must be taken to move the field forward. ",
        "Small-molecule allosteric activators of PDE4 long form cyclic AMP phosphodiesterases. Cyclic AMP (cAMP) phosphodiesterase-4 (PDE4) enzymes degrade cAMP and underpin the compartmentalization of cAMP signaling through their targeting to particular protein complexes and intracellular locales. We describe the discovery and characterization of a small-molecule compound that allosterically activates PDE4 long isoforms. This PDE4-specific activator displays reversible, noncompetitive kinetics of activation (increased Vmax with unchanged Km), phenocopies the ability of protein kinase A (PKA) to activate PDE4 long isoforms endogenously, and requires a dimeric enzyme assembly, as adopted by long, but not by short (monomeric), PDE4 isoforms. Abnormally elevated levels of cAMP provide a critical driver of the underpinning molecular pathology of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) by promoting cyst formation that, ultimately, culminates in renal failure. Using both animal and human cell models of ADPKD, including ADPKD patient-derived primary cell cultures, we demonstrate that treatment with the prototypical PDE4 activator compound lowers intracellular cAMP levels, restrains cAMP-mediated signaling events, and profoundly inhibits cyst formation. PDE4 activator compounds thus have potential as therapeutics for treating disease driven by elevated cAMP signaling as well as providing a tool for evaluating the action of long PDE4 isoforms in regulating cAMP-mediated cellular processes.

        "Modifier Gene Candidates in Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease Type 1A: A Case-Only Genome-Wide Association Study. BACKGROUND: Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1A (CMT1A) is caused by a uniform 1.5-Mb duplication on chromosome 17p, which includes the PMP22 gene. Patients often present the classic neuropathy phenotype, but also with high clinical variability. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to identify genetic variants that are potentially associated with specific clinical outcomes in CMT1A. METHODS: We genotyped over 600,000 genomic markers using DNA samples from 971 CMT1A patients and performed a case-only genome-wide association study (GWAS) to identify potential genetic association in a subset of 644 individuals of European ancestry. A total of 14 clinical outcomes were analyzed in this study. RESULTS: The analyses yielded suggestive association signals in four clinical outcomes: difficulty with eating utensils (lead SNP rs4713376, chr6\u200a:\u200a30773314, P\u200a=\u200a9.91\u00d710-7, odds ratio\u200a=\u200a3.288), hearing loss (lead SNP rs7720606, chr5\u200a:\u200a126551732, P\u200a=\u200a2.08\u00d710-7, odds ratio\u200a=\u200a3.439), decreased ability to feel (lead SNP rs17629990, chr4\u200a:\u200a171224046, P\u200a=\u200a1.63\u00d710-7, odds ratio\u200a=\u200a0.336), and CMT neuropathy score (lead SNP rs12137595, chr1\u200a:\u200a4094068, P\u200a=\u200a1.14\u00d710-7, beta\u200a=\u200a3.014). CONCLUSIONS: While the results require validation in future genetic and functional studies, the detected association signals may point to novel genetic modifiers in CMT1A. ",
        "Sensory perception drives food avoidance through excitatory basal forebrain circuits. Appetite is driven by nutritional state, environmental cues, mood, and reward pathways. Environmental cues strongly influence feeding behavior, as they can dramatically induce or diminish the drive to consume food despite homeostatic state. Here, we have uncovered an excitatory neuronal population in the basal forebrain that is activated by food-odor related stimuli, and potently drives hypophagia. Notably, we found that the basal forebrain directly integrates environmental sensory cues to govern feeding behavior, and that basal forebrain signaling, mediated through projections to the lateral hypothalamus, promotes selective avoidance of food and food-related stimuli. Together, these findings reveal a novel role for the excitatory basal forebrain in regulating appetite suppression through food avoidance mechanisms, highlighting a key function for this structure as a potent integrator of sensory information towards governing consummatory behaviors.

        "Higher protein intake is associated with a lower likelihood of frailty among older women, Kuopio OSTPRE-Fracture Prevention Study. PURPOSE: Nordic nutrition recommendations (2012) suggest protein intake\u2009\u2265\u20091.1\u00a0g/kg body weight (BW) to preserve physical function in Nordic older adults. However, no published study has used this cut-off to evaluate the association between protein intake and frailty. This study examined associations between protein intake, and sources of protein intake, with frailty status at the 3-year follow-up. METHODS: Participants were 440 women aged 65\u250072\u00a0years enrolled in the Osteoporosis Risk Factor and Prevention-Fracture Prevention Study. Protein intake g/kg BW and g/d was calculated using a 3-day food record at baseline 2003\u25004. At the 3-year follow-up (2006\u25007), frailty phenotype was defined as the presence of three or more, and prefrailty as the presence of one or two, of the Fried criteria: low grip strength adjusted for body mass index, low walking speed, low physical activity, exhaustion was defined using a low life-satisfaction score, and weight loss\u2009>\u20095% of BW. The association between protein intake, animal protein and plant protein, and frailty status was examined by multinomial regression analysis adjusting for demographics, chronic conditions, and total energy intake. RESULTS: At the 3-year follow-up, 36 women were frail and 206 women were prefrail. Higher protein intake\u2009\u2265\u20091.1\u00a0g/kg BW was associated with a lower likelihood of prefrailty (OR\u2009=\u20090.45 and 95% confidence interval (CI)\u2009=\u20090.01-0.73) and frailty (OR\u2009=\u20090.09 and CI\u2009=\u20090.01-0.75) when compared to protein intake\u2009<\u20091.1\u00a0g/kg BW at the 3-year follow-up. Women in the higher tertile of animal protein intake, but not plant protein, had a lower prevalence of frailty (P for trend\u2009=\u20090.04). CONCLUSIONS: Protein intake\u2009\u2265\u20091.1\u00a0g/kg BW and higher intake of animal protein may be beneficial to prevent the onset of frailty in older women. ",
        "College affirmative action bans and smoking and alcohol use among underrepresented minority adolescents in the United States: A difference-in-differences study. BACKGROUND: College affirmative action programs seek to expand socioeconomic opportunities for underrepresented minorities. Between 1996 and 2013, 9 US states-including California, Texas, and Michigan-banned race-based affirmative action in college admissions. Because economic opportunity is known to motivate health behavior, banning affirmative action policies may have important adverse spillover effects on health risk behaviors. We used a quasi-experimental research design to evaluate the association between college affirmative action bans and health risk behaviors among underrepresented minority (Black, Hispanic, and Native American) adolescents. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We conducted a difference-in-differences analysis using data from the 1991-2015 US national Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS). We compared changes in self-reported cigarette smoking and alcohol use in the 30 days prior to survey among underrepresented minority 11th and 12th graders in states implementing college affirmative action bans (Arizona, California, Florida, Michigan, Nebraska, New Hampshire, Oklahoma, Texas, and Washington) versus outcomes among those residing in states not implementing bans (n = 35 control states). We also assessed whether underrepresented minority adults surveyed in the 1992-2015 Tobacco Use Supplement to the Current Population Survey (TUS-CPS) who were exposed to affirmative action bans during their late high school years continued to smoke cigarettes between the ages of 19 and 30 years. Models adjusted for individual demographic characteristics, state and year fixed effects, and state-specific secular trends. In the YRBS (n = 34,988 to 36,268, depending on the outcome), cigarette smoking in the past 30 days among underrepresented minority 11th-12th graders increased by 3.8 percentage points after exposure to an affirmative action ban (95% CI: 2.0, 5.7; p < 0.001). In addition, there were also apparent increases in past-30-day alcohol use, by 5.9 percentage points (95% CI: 0.3, 12.2; p = 0.041), and past-30-day binge drinking, by 3.5 percentage points (95% CI: -0.1, 7.2, p = 0.058), among underrepresented minority 11th-12th graders, though in both cases adjustment for multiple comparisons resulted in failure to reject the null hypothesis (adjusted p = 0.083 for both outcomes). Underrepresented minority adults in the TUS-CPS (n = 71,575) exposed to bans during their late high school years were also 1.8 percentage points more likely to report current smoking (95% CI: 0.1, 3.6; p = 0.037). Event study analyses revealed a discrete break for all health behaviors timed with policy discussion and implementation. No substantive or statistically significant effects were found for non-Hispanic White adolescents, and the findings were robust to a number of additional specification checks. The limitations of the study include the continued potential for residual confounding from unmeasured time-varying factors and the potential for recall bias due to the self-reported nature of the health risk behavior outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we found evidence that some health risk behaviors increased among underrepresented minority adolescents after exposure to state-level college affirmative action bans. These findings suggest that social policies that shift socioeconomic opportunities could have meaningful population health consequences. ",
        "Impact of moderate versus deep sedation on adenoma detection rate in index average-risk screening colonoscopies. BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The debate between moderate sedation versus deep sedation for index average-risk screening colonoscopies is well known to gastroenterologists. Ensuring the best of all metrics to perform quality colonoscopies for colon cancer prevention is paramount for both patients and physicians alike, because colon cancer remains the leading cause of cancer death and is the most-used screening tool in the United States. The aim of this study was to determine if moderate sedation versus deep sedation affects outcomes of adenoma detection rate (ADR) or polyp detection rate (PDR) in index, average-risk colonoscopies for colon cancer screening. METHODS: A retrospective, single, tertiary care outpatient center study of 585 healthy average-risk patients who underwent index screening colonoscopy between June 1, 2015 to December 31, 2015 (moderate sedation only) and June 1, 2016,to December 31, 2016 (deep sedation only) was performed after Institutional Review Board approval. Demographic data and polyp details were collected to determine ADR and PDR. Patients who were not average risk were excluded from the study. RESULTS: A total of 585 index average-risk screening colonoscopies were included in this study with 57.7% moderate sedation and 42.2% deep sedation. Neither ADR nor PDR was significantly different between the 2 groups (44.1% vs 38.5% [P\u00a0= .18] and 71.9% vs 67.6% [P\u00a0= .27], respectively). CONCLUSIONS: In index average-risk screening colonoscopies, deep sedation appears to have no benefit compared with moderate sedation for ADR and PDR. ",
        "Joint Analysis of Metabolite Markers of Fish Intake and Persistent Organic Pollutants in Relation to Type 2 Diabetes Risk in Swedish Adults. BACKGROUND: There is conflicting evidence regarding the association between fish intake and type 2 diabetes (T2D) incidence, possibly owing to measurement errors in self-reported intake and coexposure to persistent organic pollutants (POPs) present in fish. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to identify plasma metabolites associated with fish intake and to assess their association with T2D risk, independently of POPs, in Swedish adults. METHODS: In a case-control study nested in the Swedish V\u00e4sterbotten Intervention Programme, fasting plasma samples from 421 matched T2D case-control pairs of men and women aged 30-60 y at baseline and 10-y follow-up samples from a subset of 149 pairs were analyzed using untargeted metabolomics. Moreover, 16 plasma POPs were analyzed for the 149 pairs who had repeated samples available. Fish-related plasma metabolites were identified using multivariate modelling and partial correlation analysis. Reproducibility of metabolites and metabolite patterns, derived via principal component analysis (PCA), was assessed by intraclass correlation. A unique component of metabolites unrelated to POPs was dissected by integrating metabolites and POPs using 2-way orthogonal partial least squares regression. ORs of T2D were estimated using conditional logistic regression. RESULTS: We identified 31 metabolites associated with fish intake that had poor to good reproducibility. A PCA-derived metabolite pattern strongly correlated with fish intake (\u03c1\u00a0=\u00a00.37, P\u00a0<\u00a00.001) but showed no association with T2D risk. Integrating fish-related metabolites and POPs led to a unique metabolite component independent of POPs, which tended to be inversely associated with T2D risk (OR: 0.75; 95% CI: 0.54, 1.02, P\u00a0=\u00a00.07). This component mainly consisted of metabolites reflecting fatty fish intake. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that fatty fish intake may be beneficial for T2D prevention, after removing the counteractive effects of coexposure to POPs in Swedish adults. Integrating metabolite markers and POP exposures appears a promising approach to advance the understanding of associations between fish intake and T2D incidence. ",
        "Primary Care Clinician and Clinic Director Experiences of Professional Bias, Harassment, and Discrimination in an Underserved Agricultural Region of California. Importance: Many rural and agricultural communities experience hardship from a shortage of clinicians. The aging of the clinician population threatens future supply in these areas. Developing policies to build a sustainable workforce requires the understanding of experiences from those currently in medical practice. Previous research about rural clinicians has primarily sampled non-Latinx white men, and to a lesser extent, non-Latinx white women; to date, no study has examined differences by race/ethnicity, sexual orientation, or gender identity. Objective: To describe the professional experiences of a diverse group of primary care clinicians and clinic directors in an underserved rural and agricultural region of California. Design, Setting, and Participants: In this qualitative study, semistructured in-depth qualitative interviews were performed with clinicians and clinic directors from December 1, 2017, to December 31, 2018, with a present or recent medical practice in the central San Joaquin Valley region of California. Participants (N\u2009=\u200926) consisted of physicians, nurse practitioners, and clinic directors practicing in primary care settings. Settings included solo and group private practice, academic training programs, community health centers, and rural health clinics. Main Outcomes and Measures: Personal experiences as primary care clinicians and clinic directors, and perceived associations with gender, race/ethnicity, sexual orientation, and gender identity. Results: Of 26 primary care clinicians and clinic directors interviewed, 16 (62%) identified as female, 12 (46%) identified as non-Latinx white, and 3 (12%) identified as a member of a sexual and gender minority group. Participants who self-identified as female, nonwhite, and of certain sexual orientation and gender identity minority groups described burnout from bias, harassment, and hostility in their professional relationships with colleagues and health care staff. These experiences intensified their feelings of community isolation and professional isolation. Harassment and institutional discrimination were factors in the decision of participants to change practices or exit the region entirely. Discriminatory acts against members of sexual and gender minority groups were the most severe, including threats to licensure and denial of hospital admitting privileges. In contrast to the minority group participants, the remaining participants expressed little to no awareness of these negative experiences, or the association between these experiences and retention. Conclusions and Relevance: Professional harassment and discrimination may hamper efforts to improve clinician and clinic director recruitment and retention in underserved rural and agricultural areas and may pose barriers to addressing health disparities within those communities. Additional investigation appears to be needed to assess the extent to which professional harassment and discrimination affect clinicians and clinic directors in similar communities across the United States.

        "Impaired Glymphatic Transport in Spontaneously Hypertensive Rats. The glymphatic system is a brainwide CSF transport system that uses the perivascular space for fast inflow of CSF. Arterial pulsations are a major driver of glymphatic CSF inflow, and hypertension that causes vascular pathologies, such as arterial stiffening and perivascular alterations, may impede the inflow. We used dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI to assess the effect of hypertension on glymphatic transport kinetics in male young and adult spontaneously hypertensive (SHR) rats compared with age-matched normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY). We anesthetized the rats with dexmedetomidine/isoflurane and infused paramagnetic contrast (Gd-DOTA) into the cisterna magna during dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI to quantify glymphatic transport kinetics. Structural MRI analysis showed that cerebroventricular volumes are larger and brain volumes significantly smaller in SHR compared with WKY rats, regardless of age. We observed ventricular reflux of Gd-DOTA in SHR rats only, indicating abnormal CSF flow dynamics secondary to innate hydrocephalus. One-tissue compartment analysis revealed impeded glymphatic transport of Gd-DOTA in SHR compared with WKY rats in both age groups, implying that glymphatic transport, including solute clearance from brain parenchyma, is impaired during evolving hypertension in young SHR, an effect that worsens in states of chronic hypertension. The study demonstrates the suppression of glymphatic clearance in SHR rats and thus offers new insight into the coexistence of hypertension and concomitant vascular pathologies in Alzheimer's disease. The study further highlights the importance of considering the distribution of tracers in the CSF compartment in the analysis of the glymphatic system.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT The glymphatic system contributes to the removal of amyloid \u03b2 from the brain and is disrupted in Alzheimer's disease and aging. Using a rat model of hypertension, we measured gross CSF flow and tracked glymphatic influx and efflux rates with dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI, showing that glymphatic transport is compromised in both early and advanced stages of hypertension. The study provides a new perspective on the importance for brain metabolite and fluid homeostasis of maintaining healthy blood vessels, an increasingly pertinent issue in an aging population that in part may explain the link between vascular pathology and Alzheimer's disease.

        "Nociceptive pulmonary-cardiac reflexes are altered in the spontaneously hypertensive rat. KEY POINTS: We investigated the cardiovascular and respiratory responses of the normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rat and the spontaneously hypertensive (SH) rat to inhalation and intravenous injection of the noxious stimuli allyl isothiocyanate (AITC). AITC inhalation evoked atropine-sensitive bradycardia in conscious WKY rats, and evoked atropine-sensitive bradycardia and atenolol-sensitive tachycardia with premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) in conscious SH rats. Intravenous injection of AITC evoked bradycardia but no tachycardia/PVCs in conscious SHs, while inhalation and injection of AITC caused similar bradypnoea in conscious SH and WKY rats. Anaesthesia (inhaled isoflurane) inhibited the cardiac reflexes evoked by inhaled AITC but not injected AITC. Data indicate the presence of a de novo nociceptive pulmonary-cardiac reflex triggering sympathoexcitation in SH rats, and this reflex is dependent on vagal afferents but is not due to steady state blood pressure or due to remodelling of vagal efferent function. ABSTRACT: Inhalation of noxious irritants/pollutants activates airway nociceptive afferents resulting in reflex bradycardia in healthy animals. Nevertheless, noxious pollutants evoke sympathoexcitation (tachycardia, hypertension) in cardiovascular disease patients. We hypothesize that cardiovascular disease alters nociceptive pulmonary-cardiac reflexes. Here, we studied reflex responses to irritants in normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats and spontaneously hypertensive (SH) rats. Inhaled allyl isothiocyanate (AITC) evoked atropine-sensitive bradycardia with atrial-ventricular (AV) block in conscious WKY rats, thus indicating a parasympathetic reflex. Conversely, inhaled AITC in conscious SH rats evoked complex brady-tachycardia with both AV block and premature ventricular contractions (PVCs). Atropine abolished the bradycardia and AV block, but the atropine-insensitive tachycardia and PVCs were abolished by the \u03b21 -adrenoceptor antagonist atenolol. The aberrant AITC-evoked reflex in SH rats was not reduced by acute blood pressure reduction by captopril. Surprisingly, intravenous AITC only evoked bradycardia in conscious SH and WKY rats. Furthermore, anaesthesia reduced the cardiac reflexes evoked by inhaled but not injected AITC. Nevertheless, anaesthesia had little effect on AITC-evoked respiratory reflexes. Such data suggest distinct differences in nociceptive reflex pathways dependent on cardiovascular disease, administration route and downstream effector. AITC-evoked tachycardia in decerebrate SH rats was abolished by vagotomy. Finally, there was no difference in the cardiac responses of WKY and SH rats to vagal efferent electrical stimulation. Our data suggest that AITC inhalation in SH rats evokes de novo adrenergic reflexes following vagal afferent activation. This aberrant reflex is independent of steady state hypertension and is not evoked by intravenous AITC. We conclude that pre-existing hypertension aberrantly shifts nociceptive pulmonary-cardiac reflexes towards sympathoexcitation. ",
        "Interactions of p53 with poly(ADP-ribose) and DNA induce distinct changes in protein structure as revealed by ATR-FTIR spectroscopy. Due to multiple domains and in part intrinsically disordered regions, structural analyses of p53 remain a challenging task, particularly in complex with DNA and other macromolecules. Here, we applied a novel attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopic approach to investigate changes in secondary structure of full-length p53 induced by non-covalent interactions with DNA and poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR). To validate our approach, we confirmed a positive regulatory function of p53's C-terminal domain (CTD) with regard to sequence-specific DNA binding and verified that the CTD mediates p53-PAR interaction. Further, we demonstrate that DNA and PAR interactions result in distinct structural changes of p53, indicating specific binding mechanisms via different domains. A time-dependent analysis of the interplay of DNA and PAR binding to p53 revealed that PAR represents p53's preferred binding partner, which efficiently controls p53-DNA interaction. Moreover, we provide infrared spectroscopic data on PAR pointing to the absence of regular secondary structural elements. Finally, temperature-induced melting experiments via CD spectroscopy show that DNA binding stabilizes the structure of p53, while PAR binding can shift the irreversible formation of insoluble p53 aggregates to higher temperatures. In conclusion, this study provides detailed insights into the dynamic interplay of p53 binding to DNA and PAR at a formerly inaccessible molecular level. ",
        "Mitochondrial complex I inhibitor deguelin induces metabolic reprogramming and sensitizes vemurafenib-resistant BRAFV600E mutation bearing metastatic melanoma cells. Treatment with vemurafenib, a potent and selective inhibitor of mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling downstream of the BRAFV600E oncogene, elicits dramatic clinical responses in patients with metastatic melanoma. Unfortunately, the clinical utility of this drug is limited by a high incidence of drug resistance. Thus, there is an unmet need for alternative therapeutic strategies to treat vemurafenib-resistant metastatic melanomas. We have conducted high-throughput screening of two bioactive compound libraries (Siga and Spectrum libraries) against a metastatic melanoma cell line (A2058) and identified two structurally analogous compounds, deguelin and rotenone, from a cell viability assay. Vemurafenib-resistant melanoma cell lines, A2058R and A375R (containing the BRAFV600E mutation), also showed reduced proliferation when treated with these two compounds. Deguelin, a mitochondrial complex I inhibitor, was noted to significantly inhibit oxygen consumption in cellular metabolism assays. Mechanistically, deguelin treatment rapidly activates AMPK signaling, which results in inhibition of mTORC1 signaling and differential phosphorylation of mTORC1's downstream effectors, 4E-BP1 and p70S6 kinase. Deguelin also significantly inhibited ERK activation and Ki67 expression without altering Akt activation in the same timeframe in the vemurafenib-resistant melanoma cells. These data posit that treatment with metabolic regulators, such as deguelin, can lead to energy starvation, thereby modulating the intracellular metabolic environment and reducing survival of drug-resistant melanomas harboring BRAF V600E mutations.

        "A shorter working week for everyone: How much paid work is needed for mental health and well-being?. There are predictions that in future rapid technological development could result in a significant shortage of paid work. A possible option currently debated by academics, policy makers, trade unions, employers and mass media, is a shorter working week for everyone. In this context, two important research questions that have not been asked so far are: what is the minimum amount of paid employment needed to deliver some or all of the well-being and mental health benefits that employment has been shown to bring? And what is the optimum number of working hours at which the mental health of workers is at its highest? To answer these questions, this study used the UK Household Longitudinal Study (2009-2018) data from individuals aged between 16 and 64. The analytical sample was 156,734 person-wave observations from 84,993 unique persons of whom 71,113 had two or more measurement times. Fixed effects regressions were applied to examine how changes in work hours were linked to changes in mental well-being within each individual over time. This study found that even a small number of working hours (between one and 8\u202fh a week) generates significant mental health and well-being benefits for previously unemployed or economically inactive individuals. The findings suggest there is no single optimum number of working hours at which well-being and mental health are at their highest - for most groups of workers there was little variation in wellbeing between the lowest (1-8\u202fh) through to the highest (44-48\u202fh) category of working hours. These findings provide important and timely empirical evidence for future of work planning, shorter working week policies and have implications for theorising the future models of organising work in society.

        "Incomplete silencing of full mutation alleles in males with fragile X syndrome is associated with autistic features. Background: Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a common monogenic cause of intellectual disability with autism features. While it is caused by loss of the FMR1 product (FMRP), mosaicism for active and inactive FMR1 alleles, including alleles termed premutation (PM: 55-199 CGGs), is not uncommon. Importantly, both PM and active full mutation (FM: \u2265\u2009200\u00a0CGGs) alleles often express elevated levels of mRNA that are thought to be toxic. This study determined if complete FMR1 mRNA silencing from FM alleles and/or levels of FMR1 mRNA (if present) in blood are associated with intellectual functioning and autism features in FXS. Methods: The study cohort included 98 participants (70.4% male) with FXS (FM-only and PM/FM mosaic) aged 1-43\u00a0years. A control group of 14 females were used to establish control FMR1 mRNA reference range. Intellectual functioning and autism features were assessed using the Mullen Scales of Early Learning or an age-appropriate Wechsler Scale and the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule-2nd Edition (ADOS-2), respectively. FMR1 mRNA was analysed in venous blood collected at the time of assessments, using the real-time PCR relative standard curve method. Results: Females with FXS had significantly higher levels of FMR1 mRNA (p\u2009<\u20090.001) than males. FMR1 mRNA levels were positively associated with age (p\u2009<\u20090.001), but not with intellectual functioning and autistic features in females. FM-only males (aged <\u200919\u00a0years) expressing FM FMR1 mRNA had significantly higher ADOS calibrated severity scores compared to FM-only males with completely silenced FMR1 (p\u2009=\u20090.011). However, there were no significant differences between these subgroups on intellectual functioning. In contrast, decreased levels of FMR1 mRNA were associated with decreased intellectual functioning in FXS males (p\u2009=\u20090.029), but not autism features, when combined with the PM/FM mosaic group. Conclusion: Incomplete silencing of toxic FM RNA may be associated with autistic features, but not intellectual functioning in FXS males. While decreased levels of mRNA may be more predictive of intellectual functioning than autism features. If confirmed in future studies, these findings may have implications for patient stratification, outcome measure development, and design of clinical and pre-clinical trials in FXS. ",
        "The S52F FOXF1 Mutation Inhibits STAT3 Signaling and Causes Alveolar Capillary Dysplasia. Rationale: Alveolar capillary dysplasia with misalignment of pulmonary veins (ACDMPV) is a lethal congenital disorder causing respiratory failure and pulmonary hypertension shortly after birth. There are no effective treatments for ACDMPV other than lung transplant, and new therapeutic approaches are urgently needed. Although ACDMPV is linked to mutations in the FOXF1 gene, molecular mechanisms through which FOXF1 mutations cause ACDMPV are unknown.Objectives: To identify molecular mechanisms by which S52F FOXF1 mutations cause ACDMPV.Methods: We generated a clinically relevant mouse model of ACDMPV by introducing the S52F FOXF1 mutation into the mouse Foxf1 gene locus using CRISPR/Cas9 technology. Immunohistochemistry, whole-lung imaging, and biochemical methods were used to examine vasculature in Foxf1.

Foxf1.                         WT/S52F.                      knock-in mice recapitulated histopathologic findings in ACDMPV infants. The S52F FOXF1 mutation disrupted STAT3-FOXF1 protein-protein interactions and inhibited transcription of Stat3, a critical transcriptional regulator of angiogenesis. STAT3 signaling and endothelial proliferation were reduced in Foxf1.                         WT/S52F.                      mice and human ACDMPV lungs. S52F FOXF1 mutant protein did not bind chromatin and was transcriptionally inactive.

Nanoparticle delivery of STAT3 is a promising strategy to treat ACDMPV associated with decreased STAT3 signaling. ",
        "Sleep as a Potential Biomarker of Tau and \u03b2-Amyloid Burden in the Human Brain. Recent proposals suggest that sleep may be a factor associated with accumulation of two core pathological features of Alzheimer's disease (AD): tau and \u03b2-amyloid (A\u03b2). Here we combined PET measures of A\u03b2 and tau, electroencephalogram sleep recordings, and retrospective sleep evaluations to investigate the potential utility of sleep measures in predicting in vivo AD pathology in male and female older adults. Regression analyses revealed that the severity of impaired slow oscillation-sleep spindle coupling predicted greater medial temporal lobe tau burden. A\u03b2 burden was not associated with coupling impairment but instead predicted the diminished amplitude of <1 Hz slow-wave-activity, results that were statistically dissociable from each other. Additionally, comparisons of AD pathology and retrospective, self-reported changes in sleep duration demonstrated that changes in sleep across the lifespan can predict late-life A\u03b2 and tau burden. Thus, quantitative and qualitative features of human sleep represent potential noninvasive, cost-effective, and scalable biomarkers (current and future forecasting) of AD pathology, and carry both therapeutic and public health implications.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Several studies have linked sleep disruption to the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Tau and \u03b2-amyloid (A\u03b2), the primary pathological features of AD, are associated with both objective and subjective changes in sleep. However, it remains unknown whether late life tau and A\u03b2 burden are associated with distinct impairments in sleep physiology or changes in sleep across the lifespan. Using polysomnography, retrospective questionnaires, and tau- and A\u03b2-specific PET, the present study reveals human sleep signatures that dissociably predict levels of brain tau and A\u03b2 in older adults. These results suggest that a night of polysomnography may aid in evaluating tau and A\u03b2 burden, and that treating sleep deficiencies within decade-specific time windows may serve in delaying AD progression.

        "Water dynamics in MCF-7 breast cancer cells: a neutron scattering descriptive study. Water mobility in cancer cells could be a powerful parameter to predict the progression or remission of tumors. In the present descriptive work, new insight into this concept was achieved by combining neutron scattering and thermal analyses. The results provide the first step to untangle the role played by water dynamics in breast cancer cells (MCF-7) after treatment with a chemotherapy drug. By thermal analyses, the cells were probed as micrometric reservoirs of bulk-like and confined water populations. Under this perspective we showed that the drug clearly alters the properties of the confined water. We have independently validated this idea by accessing the cellular water dynamics using inelastic neutron scattering. Finally, analysis of the quasi-elastic neutron scattering data allows us to hypothesize that, in this particular cell line, diffusion increases in the intracellular water in response to the action of the drug on the nanosecond timescale.

Elevating estradiol (E2) in early baboon pregnancy suppressed UAR and EVT vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression, but this did not prove that VEGF mediated this process. Therefore, our primate model of prematurely elevating E2 and contrast-enhanced ultrasound cavitation of microbubble (MB) carriers was used to deliver VEGF DNA to the placental basal plate (PBP) to establish the role of VEGF in UAR. Baboons were treated on days 25 to 59 of gestation (term, 184 days) with E2 alone or with E2 plus VEGF DNA-conjugated MBs briefly infused via a maternal peripheral vein on days 25, 35, 45, and 55. At each of these times an ultrasound beam was directed to the PBP to collapse the MBs and release VEGF DNA. VEGF DNA-labeled MBs per contrast agent was localized in the PBP but not the fetus. Remodeling of uterine arteries >25 \u00b5m in diameter on day 60 was 75% lower (P < 0.001) in E2-treated (7% \u00b1 2%) than in untreated baboons (30% \u00b1 4%) and was restored to normal by E2/VEGF. VEGF protein levels (signals/nuclear area) within the PBP were twofold lower (P < 0.01) in E2-treated (4.2 \u00b1 0.9) than in untreated (9.8 \u00b1 2.8) baboons and restored to normal by E2/VEGF (11.9 \u00b1 1.6), substantiating VEGF transfection. Thus, VEGF gene delivery selectively to the PBP prevented the decrease in UAR elicited by prematurely elevating E2 levels, establishing the role of VEGF in regulating UAR in vivo during primate pregnancy.

        "Epigenetic modifiers DNMT3A and BCOR are recurrently mutated in CYLD cutaneous syndrome. Patients with CYLD cutaneous syndrome (CCS; syn. Brooke-Spiegler syndrome) carry germline mutations in the tumor suppressor CYLD and develop multiple skin tumors with diverse histophenotypes. Here, we comprehensively profile the genomic landscape of 42 benign and malignant tumors across 13 individuals from four multigenerational families and discover recurrent mutations in epigenetic modifiers DNMT3A and BCOR in 29% of benign tumors. Multi-level and microdissected sampling strikingly reveal that many clones with different DNMT3A mutations exist in these benign tumors, suggesting that intra-tumor heterogeneity is common. Integrated genomic, methylation and transcriptomic profiling in selected tumors suggest that isoform-specific DNMT3A2 mutations are associated with dysregulated methylation. Phylogenetic and mutational signature analyses confirm cylindroma pulmonary metastases from primary skin tumors. These findings contribute to existing paradigms of cutaneous tumorigenesis and metastasis. ",
        "High Postural Sway Is an Independent Risk Factor for Osteoporotic Fractures but Not for Mortality in Elderly Women. The aim of this prospective cohort study was to investigate the independent effect of postural sway on overall fracture and osteoporotic fracture risk after controlling for other established fracture risk factors. As a secondary outcome, mortality was also investigated. The study sample is a stratified random sample of 1568 women born between 1932 and 1941, residing in Kuopio province, eastern Finland. Fracture data were obtained through study questionnaires and verified through hospital records. Mortality data were verified through the National Registry. Using static posturography, postural sway was recorded for 1568 women at the fifth year of follow-up in 1994 through 1997. Mediolateral (ML), anteroposterior (AP), and total sway parameters were used for analysis. Mean follow-up time for any fractures, osteoporotic fractures, and mortality was 10.6, 11.4, and 17.5 years, respectively. After adjustment, subjects in the highest quartile of ML sway (HR, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.5 to 2.8) and total sway (HR, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.2 to 2.2) had a higher risk for any fracture. Osteoporotic fracture risk was also higher in the fourth quartile of ML sway (HR, 1.9; 95% CI, 1.1 to 3.0) and total sway (HR, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.0 to 2.8). The models were adjusted for fracture risk assessment tool risk factors and leg-extension strength. Further, women having both lowest bone density and highest postural sway were at 4.9 (95% CI, 2.6 to 9.5) times higher risk of overall fracture and 11.8 (95% CI, 2.7 to 51.3) times higher risk for osteoporotic fracture in comparison with subjects having highest bone density and lowest postural sway. The association between postural sway and mortality was not significant after adjustment. In conclusion, high postural sway is an independent risk factor for any fractures as well as for osteoporotic fractures. A combination of low bone density and high postural sway poses even higher fracture risk than either factor alone. Postural sway does not predict mortality independently. \u00a9 2019 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research. ",
        "Association Between Childhood Behaviors and Adult Employment Earnings in Canada. Importance: Specifying the association between childhood behaviors and adult earnings can inform the development of screening tools and preventive interventions to enhance social integration and economic participation. Objective: To test the association between behaviors at age 6 years and employment earnings at age 33 to 35 years. Design, Setting, and Participants: This study obtained data from the Quebec Longitudinal Study of Kindergarten Children, a population-based sample of boys and girls (n\u2009=\u20093020) born in 1980 or 1981 in Quebec, Canada, and followed up from January 1, 1985, to December 31, 2015. The data included behavioral ratings by kindergarten teachers when the children were aged 5 or 6 years and 2013 to 2015 government tax returns of those same participants at age 33 to 35 years. Data were analyzed from September 2017 to December 2018. Main Outcomes and Measures: Mixed-effects linear regression models were used to test the associations between teacher-rated inattention, hyperactivity, aggression, opposition, anxiety, and prosociality at age 6 years and reported annual earnings on income tax returns at age 33 to 35 years. Participant IQ and family adversity were adjusted for in the analysis. Results: The study included 2850 participants, with a mean (SD) age of 35.9 (0.29) years, of whom 1470 (51.6%) were male and 2740 (96.2%) were white. The mean (SD) personal earnings at follow-up were US $33\u202f300 ($27\u202f500) for men and $19\u202f400 ($15\u202f200) for women. A 1-unit increase in inattention score at age 6 years (males mean\u2009[SD], 2.47 [2.42] vs females mean\u2009[SD], 1.67 [2.07]) was associated with a decrease in annual earnings of $1271.49 (95% CI, -1908.67 to -634.30) for male participants and $924.25 (95% CI, -1424.44 to -425.46) for female participants. A combined aggression-opposition score (males mean\u2009[SD]\u20092.22 [2.52] vs females mean\u2009[SD], 1.05 [1.73]) was associated with a reduction in earnings of $699.83 (95% CI, -1262.49 to -137.17) for males only, albeit with an effect size roughly half that of inattention. A 1-unit increase in prosociality score (males mean\u2009[SD],\u20096.12 [4.30] vs females mean\u2009[SD], 7.90 [4.56]) was associated with an increase in earnings of $476.75 (95% CI,\u2009181.53-771.96) for male participants only. A 1-SD reduction in inattention score at age 6 years would theoretically restore $3077 in annual earnings for male participants and $1915 for female participants. Conclusions and Relevance: In this large population-based sample of kindergarten children, behavioral ratings at 5-6 years were associated with employment earnings 3 decades later, independent of a person's IQ and family background. Inattention and aggression-opposition were associated with lower annual employment earnings, and prosociality with higher earnings but only among male participants; inattention was the only behavioral predictor of income among girls. Early monitoring and support for children demonstrating high inattention and for boys exhibiting high aggression-opposition and low prosocial behaviors could have long-term advantages for those individuals and society.

        "High throughput proteomics identifies a high-accuracy 11 plasma protein biomarker signature for ovarian cancer. Ovarian cancer is usually detected at a late stage and the overall 5-year survival is only 30-40%. Additional means for early detection and improved diagnosis are acutely needed. To search for novel biomarkers, we compared circulating plasma levels of 593 proteins in three cohorts of patients with ovarian cancer and benign tumors, using the proximity extension assay (PEA). A combinatorial strategy was developed for identification of different multivariate biomarker signatures. A final model consisting of 11 biomarkers plus age was developed into a multiplex PEA test reporting in absolute concentrations. The final model was evaluated in a fourth independent cohort and has an AUC\u2009=\u20090.94, PPV\u2009=\u20090.92, sensitivity\u2009=\u20090.85 and specificity\u2009=\u20090.93 for detection of ovarian cancer stages I-IV. The novel plasma protein signature could be used to improve the diagnosis of women with adnexal ovarian mass or in screening to identify women that should be referred to specialized examination. ",
        "Boundary mode lubrication of articular cartilage with a biomimetic diblock copolymer. We report the design of a diblock copolymer with architecture and function inspired by the lubricating glycoprotein lubricin. This diblock copolymer, synthesized by sequential reversible addition-fragmentation chain-transfer polymerization, consists of a cationic cartilage-binding domain and a brush-lubricating domain. It reduces the coefficient of friction of articular cartilage under boundary mode conditions (0.088 \u00b1 0.039) to a level equivalent to that provided by lubricin (0.093 \u00b1 0.011). Additionally, both the EC50 (0.404 mg/mL) and cartilage-binding time constant (7.19 min) of the polymer are comparable to purified human and recombinant lubricin. Like lubricin, the tribological properties of this polymer are dependent on molecular architecture. When the same monomer composition was evaluated either as an AB diblock copolymer or as a random copolymer, the diblock effectively lubricated cartilage under boundary mode conditions whereas the random copolymer did not. Additionally, the individual polymer blocks did not lubricate independently, and lubrication could be competitively inhibited with an excess of binding domain. This diblock copolymer is an example of a synthetic polymer with lubrication properties equal to lubricin under boundary mode conditions, suggesting its potential utility as a therapy for joint pathologies like osteoarthritis.

        "Association Between Reported Long Working Hours and History of Stroke in the CONSTANCES Cohort. Background and Purpose- Long working hours (LWHs) are a potential risk factor for stroke. The aim of this study was to investigate this association in a large general population cohort. Methods- We used the French population-based cohort, CONSTANCES (Cohorte des Consultants des Centres d'Examens de Sant\u00e9), to retrieve information on age, sex, smoking, and working hours from the baseline, self-administered questionnaire. Other cardiovascular risk factors and previous occurrence of stroke were taken from a parallel medical interview. We defined LWH as working time >10 hours daily for at least 50 days per year. Participants with primarily part-time jobs were excluded as were those with stroke before LWH exposure. We used logistic models to estimate the association between LWH and stroke, stratified by age, sex, and occupation. In additional modeling, we excluded subjects whose stroke occurred within 5 years of the first reported work exposure. Results- Among the 143\u2009592 participants in the analyses, there were 1224 (0.9%) strokes, 42\u2009542 (29.6%) reported LWH, and 14\u2009481 (10.1%) reported LWH for 10 years or more. LWH was associated with an increased risk of stroke: adjusted odds ratio of 1.29 (95% CI, 1.11-1.49). Being exposed to LWH for 10 years or more was more strongly associated with stroke, adjusted odds ratio of 1.45 (95% CI, 1.21-1.74). The association showed no differences between men and women but was stronger in white-collar workers under 50 years of age. Conclusions- This large analysis reveals a significant association between stroke and exposure to LWH for 10 years or more. The findings are relevant for individual and global prevention. ",
        "Medication Accuracy in Electronic Health Records for Microbial Keratitis. Importance: Electronic health records (EHRs) contain an abundance of health information. However, researchers need to understand data accuracy to ask appropriate research questions. Objective: To investigate the concordance of the names of medications for microbial keratitis in the structured, formal EHR medication list and the text of clinicians' progress notes. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cross-sectional study, conducted in the cornea section of an ophthalmology department in a tertiary care, referral academic medical center, examined the medications of 53 patients with microbial keratitis treated until disease resolution from July 1, 2015, to August 1, 2018. Documentation of medications was compared between the structured medication list extracted from the EHR server and medications written into the clinical progress note and transcribed by the study team. Exposure: Medication treatment for microbial keratitis. Main Outcomes and Measures: Medication mismatch frequency. Results: The study sample included 24 men and 29 women, with a mean (SD) age of 51.8 (19.6) years. Of the 247 medications identified, 57 (23.1%) of prescribed medications differed between the progress notes and the formal EHR-based medication list. Reasons included medications not prescribed via the EHR ordering system (25 [43.9%]), outside medications not reconciled in the internal EHR medication list (23 [40.4%]), and medications prescribed via the EHR ordering system and in the formal list, but not described in the clinical note (9 [15.8%]). Fortified antimicrobials represented the largest category for medication mismatch between modalities (17 of 70 [24.3%]). Nearly one-third of patients (17 [32.1%]) had at least 1 medication mismatch in their record. Conclusions and Relevance: Almost 1 in 4 medications were mismatched between the progress note and formal medication list in the EHR. These findings suggest that EHR data should be checked for internal consistency before use in research. ",
        "College affirmative action bans and smoking and alcohol use among underrepresented minority adolescents in the United States: A difference-in-differences study. BACKGROUND: College affirmative action programs seek to expand socioeconomic opportunities for underrepresented minorities. Between 1996 and 2013, 9 US states-including California, Texas, and Michigan-banned race-based affirmative action in college admissions. Because economic opportunity is known to motivate health behavior, banning affirmative action policies may have important adverse spillover effects on health risk behaviors. We used a quasi-experimental research design to evaluate the association between college affirmative action bans and health risk behaviors among underrepresented minority (Black, Hispanic, and Native American) adolescents. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We conducted a difference-in-differences analysis using data from the 1991-2015 US national Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS). We compared changes in self-reported cigarette smoking and alcohol use in the 30 days prior to survey among underrepresented minority 11th and 12th graders in states implementing college affirmative action bans (Arizona, California, Florida, Michigan, Nebraska, New Hampshire, Oklahoma, Texas, and Washington) versus outcomes among those residing in states not implementing bans (n = 35 control states). We also assessed whether underrepresented minority adults surveyed in the 1992-2015 Tobacco Use Supplement to the Current Population Survey (TUS-CPS) who were exposed to affirmative action bans during their late high school years continued to smoke cigarettes between the ages of 19 and 30 years. Models adjusted for individual demographic characteristics, state and year fixed effects, and state-specific secular trends. In the YRBS (n = 34,988 to 36,268, depending on the outcome), cigarette smoking in the past 30 days among underrepresented minority 11th-12th graders increased by 3.8 percentage points after exposure to an affirmative action ban (95% CI: 2.0, 5.7; p < 0.001). In addition, there were also apparent increases in past-30-day alcohol use, by 5.9 percentage points (95% CI: 0.3, 12.2; p = 0.041), and past-30-day binge drinking, by 3.5 percentage points (95% CI: -0.1, 7.2, p = 0.058), among underrepresented minority 11th-12th graders, though in both cases adjustment for multiple comparisons resulted in failure to reject the null hypothesis (adjusted p = 0.083 for both outcomes). Underrepresented minority adults in the TUS-CPS (n = 71,575) exposed to bans during their late high school years were also 1.8 percentage points more likely to report current smoking (95% CI: 0.1, 3.6; p = 0.037). Event study analyses revealed a discrete break for all health behaviors timed with policy discussion and implementation. No substantive or statistically significant effects were found for non-Hispanic White adolescents, and the findings were robust to a number of additional specification checks. The limitations of the study include the continued potential for residual confounding from unmeasured time-varying factors and the potential for recall bias due to the self-reported nature of the health risk behavior outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we found evidence that some health risk behaviors increased among underrepresented minority adolescents after exposure to state-level college affirmative action bans. These findings suggest that social policies that shift socioeconomic opportunities could have meaningful population health consequences. ",
        "The association between self-reported poor oral health and gastrointestinal cancer risk in the UK Biobank: A large prospective cohort study. Background: Controversy remains as to whether poor oral health is independently associated with gastrointestinal cancers, due to potential confounding by smoking, alcohol and poor nutrition. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between oral health conditions and gastrointestinal cancer risk. Methods: Data from the large, prospective UK Biobank cohort, which includes n\u2009=\u2009475,766 participants, were analysed. Cox proportional hazard models were applied to estimate the relationship between gastrointestinal cancer risk and self-reported poor oral health (defined as painful gums, bleeding gums and/or having loose teeth), adjusting for confounders. Results: During an average six years of follow-up, n\u2009=\u20094069 gastrointestinal cancer cases were detected, of which 13% self-reported poor oral health. Overall, there was no association between self-reported poor oral health and risk of gastrointestinal cancer detected (hazard ratio 0.97, 95% confidence interval 0.88-1.07). In site-specific analysis, an increased risk of hepatobiliary cancers was observed in those with self-reported poor oral health (hazard ratio 1.32, 95% confidence interval 0.95-1.80), which was stronger for hepatocellular carcinoma (hazard ratio 1.75, 95% confidence interval 1.04-2.92). Conclusion: Overall there was no association between self-reported poor oral health and gastrointestinal cancer risk. However, there was a suggestion of an increased risk of hepatobiliary cancer, specifically hepatocellular carcinoma. ",
        "Potential Consequences of Minimum-Volume Standards for Hospitals Treating Women With Ovarian Cancer. OBJECTIVE: To assess the potential effects of implementing minimum hospital volume standards for ovarian cancer on survival and access to care. METHODS: We used the National Cancer Database to identify hospitals treating women with ovarian cancer from 2005 to 2015. We estimated the number of patients treated by each hospital during the prior year. Multivariable models were used to estimate the ratio of observed/expected 60-day, and 1-, 2- and 5-year mortalities. The mean predicted observed/expected ratio of hospitals was plotted based on prior year volume. The number of hospitals that would be restricted if minimum-volume standards were implemented was modeled. RESULTS: A total of 136,196 patients treated at 1,321 hospitals were identified. Increasing hospital volume was associated with decreased 60-day (P=.004), 1-year (P<.001), 2-year (P<.001) and 5-year (P=.008) mortality. In 2015, using a minimum-volume cutpoint of one case in the prior year would eliminate 144 (13.6%) hospitals (treated 2.6% of all patients); a cutpoint of three would eliminate 364 (34.5%) hospitals (treated 7.7% of the patients). The mean observed/expected ratios for hospitals with a prior year volume of 1 was 1.14 for 60-day mortality, 1.06 for 1-year mortality, 1.12 for 2-year mortality, and 1.08 for 5-year mortality. Among hospitals with a prior year volume of one, 49.2% had an observed/expected ratio for 2-year mortality of at least 1 (indicating worse than expected performance), and 50.8% had an observed/expected ratio of less than 1 (indicating better than expected performance). The mean observed/expected ratios for hospitals with a prior year volume of two or less were 1.11 for 60-day mortality, 1.09 for 1-year mortality, 1.08 for 2-year mortality, and 1.07 for 5-year mortality. Implementing a minimum-volume standard of one case in the prior year would result in one fewer death for every 198 patients at 60 days, for every 613 patients at 1 year, and for every 62 patients at 5 years. CONCLUSION: Implementation of minimum hospital volume standards could restrict care at a significant number of hospitals, including many centers with better-than-predicted outcomes. ",
        "Evidence for a Heritable Contribution to\u00a0Atrial Fibrillation Associated With\u00a0Fibrosis. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to define the population-based familial clustering of atrial fibrillation (AF) that is associated with fibrosis and describe evidence for a heritable predisposition. BACKGROUND: Although a heritable contribution to AF is well-established and the association of fibrosis with AF is well-recognized, no studies have analyzed the genetic contribution to AF co-occurring with fibrosis. METHODS: AF patients with magnetic resonance imaging-confirmed fibrosis were identified in a population-based health sciences center database linked to a Utah genealogy. Familial clustering of AF/fibrosis was defined by analysis of pairwise case relatedness, estimation of relative risk of AF/fibrosis in relatives, and identification of high-risk AF/fibrosis pedigrees. RESULTS: The 694 individuals identified with AF/fibrosis who had at least 3 generations of genealogy data were found to have significantly elevated pairwise relatedness (p\u00a0< 0.001), even when first- and second-degree relationships were ignored (p\u00a0< 0.001). Significantly elevated risks for AF/fibrosis among first- (relative risk [RR]: 4.65), second- (RR: 3.14), and third-degree (RR: 2.70) relatives of individuals with AF/fibrosis were observed. We identified 157 extended Utah pedigrees with a significant excess of AF/fibrosis among descendants. CONCLUSIONS: There is a strong heritable contribution to predisposition to AF co-occurring with fibrosis. We suggest that this study provides a unique foundation for a search for predisposition genes, specifically for AF co-occurring with\u00a0fibrosis. ",
        "The effect of electrical stimulation therapies on spinal fusion: a cross-disciplinary systematic review and meta-analysis of the preclinical and clinical data. OBJECTIVE: Nonunion is a common complication of spinal fusion surgeries. Electrical stimulation technologies (ESTs)-namely, direct current stimulation (DCS), capacitive coupling stimulation (CCS), and inductive coupling stimulation (ICS)-have been suggested to improve fusion rates. However, the evidence to support their use is based solely on small trials. Here, the authors report the results of meta-analyses of the preclinical and clinical data from the literature to provide estimates of the overall effect of these therapies at large and in subgroups. METHODS: A systematic review of the English-language literature was performed using PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science databases. The query of these databases was designed to include all preclinical and clinical studies examining ESTs for spinal fusion. The primary endpoint was the fusion rate at the last follow-up. Meta-analyses were performed using a Freeman-Tukey double arcsine transformation followed by random-effects modeling. RESULTS: A total of 33 articles (17 preclinical, 16 clinical) were identified, of which 11 preclinical studies (257 animals) and 13 clinical studies (2144 patients) were included in the meta-analysis. Among preclinical studies, the mean fusion rates were higher among EST-treated animals (OR 4.79, p < 0.001). Clinical studies similarly showed ESTs to increase fusion rates (OR 2.26, p < 0.001). Of EST modalities, only DCS improved fusion rates in both preclinical (OR 5.64, p < 0.001) and clinical (OR 2.13, p = 0.03) populations; ICS improved fusion in clinical studies only (OR 2.45, p = 0.014). CCS was not effective at increasing fusion, although only one clinical study was identified. A subanalysis of the clinical studies found that ESTs increased fusion rates in the following populations: patients with difficult-to-fuse spines, those who smoke, and those who underwent multilevel fusions. CONCLUSIONS: The authors found that electrical stimulation devices may produce clinically significant increases in arthrodesis rates among patients undergoing spinal fusion. They also found that the pro-arthrodesis effects seen in preclinical studies are also found in clinical populations, suggesting that findings in animal studies are translatable. Additional research is needed to analyze the cost-effectiveness of these devices. ",
        "Multiple sclerosis relapse risk in the postoperative period: Effects of invasive surgery and anesthesia. BACKGROUND: Postoperative multiple sclerosis (MS) relapses are a concern among patients and providers. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether MS relapse risk is higher postoperatively. METHODS: Data were extracted from medical records of MS patients undergoing surgery at a tertiary center (2000-2016). Conditional logistic regression estimated within-patient unadjusted and age-adjusted odds of postoperative versus preoperative relapse. RESULTS: Among 281 patients and 609 surgeries, 12 postoperative relapses were identified. The odds of postoperative versus preoperative relapse in unadjusted (odds ratio (OR)\u2009=\u20090.56, 95% confidence interval (CI)\u2009=\u20090.18-1.79; p\u2009=\u20090.33) or age-adjusted models (OR\u2009=\u20090.66, 95% CI\u2009=\u20090.20-2.16; p\u2009=\u20090.49) were not increased. CONCLUSIONS: Surgery/anesthesia exposure did not increase postoperative relapse risk. These findings require confirmation in larger studies. ",
        "Supplementation with Akkermansia muciniphila in overweight and obese human volunteers: a proof-of-concept exploratory study. Metabolic syndrome is characterized by a constellation of comorbidities that predispose individuals to an increased risk of developing cardiovascular pathologies as well as type 2 diabetes mellitus1. The gut microbiota is a new key contributor involved in the onset of obesity-related disorders2. In humans, studies have provided evidence for a negative correlation between Akkermansia muciniphila abundance and overweight, obesity, untreated type 2 diabetes mellitus or hypertension3-8. Since the administration of A. muciniphila has never been investigated in humans, we conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled pilot study in overweight/obese insulin-resistant volunteers; 40 were enrolled and 32 completed the trial. The primary end points were safety, tolerability and metabolic parameters (that is, insulin resistance, circulating lipids, visceral adiposity and body mass). Secondary outcomes were gut barrier function (that is, plasma lipopolysaccharides) and gut microbiota composition. In this single-center study, we demonstrated that daily oral supplementation of 1010 A. muciniphila bacteria either live or pasteurized for three months was safe and well tolerated. Compared to placebo, pasteurized A. muciniphila improved insulin sensitivity (+28.62\u2009\u00b1\u20097.02%, P\u2009=\u20090.002), and reduced insulinemia (-34.08\u2009\u00b1\u20097.12%, P\u2009=\u20090.006) and plasma total cholesterol (-8.68\u2009\u00b1\u20092.38%, P\u2009=\u20090.02). Pasteurized A. muciniphila supplementation slightly decreased body weight (-2.27\u2009\u00b1\u20090.92\u2009kg, P\u2009=\u20090.091) compared to the placebo group, and fat mass (-1.37\u2009\u00b1\u20090.82\u2009kg, P\u2009=\u20090.092) and hip circumference (-2.63\u2009\u00b1\u20091.14\u2009cm, P\u2009=\u20090.091) compared to baseline. After three months of supplementation, A. muciniphila reduced the levels of the relevant blood markers for liver dysfunction and inflammation while the overall gut microbiome structure was unaffected. In conclusion, this proof-of-concept study (clinical trial no. NCT02637115 ) shows that the intervention was safe and well tolerated and that supplementation with A. muciniphila improves several metabolic parameters. ",
        "Effects of continuous positive airway pressure on depression and anxiety symptoms in patients with obstructive sleep apnoea: results from the sleep apnoea cardiovascular Endpoint randomised trial and meta-analysis. Background: Whether continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) treatment can improve depression or anxiety symptoms in obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) patients remains uncertain. Methods: Secondary analysis of the Sleep Apnea Cardiovascular Endpoints (SAVE) trial, combined with a systematic review of randomised evidence. The SAVE secondary analyses involved 2410 patients with co-existing moderate-severe OSA and established cardiovascular disease randomly allocated to CPAP treatment plus usual care or usual care alone and followed up for 3\u00b77 (SD 1\u00b76) years. We evaluated the effect of CPAP treatment on depression and anxiety caseness (scores \u2265\u00a08 on the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale depression and anxiety subscales [HADS-D and HADS-A]) for OSA patients. Findings: CPAP treatment was associated with reduced odds of depression caseness (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 0\u00b780, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0\u00b765-0\u00b798, P\u202f=\u202f0\u00b7031) compared to usual care in the SAVE trial and the treatment effect was greater in those with pre-existing depression symptoms. A systematic review of 20 randomised trials including 4255 participants confirmed a benefit of CPAP in reducing depression symptoms in OSA patients: the overall effect (standardised mean difference) was -\u00a00\u00b718 (95% CI -\u00a00\u00b724 to -\u00a00\u00b712). No effect of CPAP treatment on anxiety caseness was found both in patients of the SAVE study (adjusted OR 0\u00b798, 95% CI 0\u00b778-1\u00b724, P\u202f=\u202f0\u00b789) and the systematic review. Interpretation: CPAP reduces depression symptoms in patients with co-existing OSA and CVD independently of improvements in sleepiness. ",
        "Health deficits in community dwelling adults aged 40 to 75\u2009years. BACKGROUND: Middle and older years are associated with age related health deficits but how early this begins and progresses is poorly understood. Better understanding is needed to address early decline and support healthier ageing outcomes. METHODS: Seemingly healthy, community dwelling adults aged 40 to 75\u2009years were recruited via local council and business networks. They completed online surveys about sleep quality, distress and physical activity, and two hours of objective testing of physiologic and anthropometric measures, mobility, cognition, grip strength, foot sensation, dexterity and functional hearing. Analysis compared outcomes for age, gender, and age and gender groups with population norms for 21 health assessments. The total number of non-compliant tests for each participant was calculated by summing the number of non-compliant tests, and the frequency of these scores across the sample was reported. Gender and age effects were tested using ANOVA models. Combined\u00a0age and gender categories were used for subsequent logistic regression modelling, with females aged 40-49\u2009years being the default comparator. RESULTS: Of 561 participants (67% female; mean age 60\u2009years (SD 10.3)), everyone had at least one deficit and median deficits was 5 (IQR 2). More than 50% of participants did not meet anthropometric and exercise norms, while 30 to 40% had reduced functional hearing and cognition. Overall, men performed worse and deficits increased with age particularly for physical activity, audiology, mobility, anthropometry, oximetry and foot sensation. Heart rate, body temperature and dyspnoea were the only variables where compliance was within 95% of expected values. Multiple areas of functional decline were found in people aged in their 40s and 50s. CONCLUSIONS: The health deficits identified are mostly mutable hence identification and interventions to address the multi-system functional decline in people as young as 40 has the capacity to ensure healthier ageing.

        "Temporal Stability and Prognostic Biomarker Potential of the Prostate Cancer Urine miRNA Transcriptome. BACKGROUND: The development of noninvasive tests for the early detection of aggressive prostate tumors is a major unmet clinical need. miRNAs are promising noninvasive biomarkers: they play essential roles in tumorigenesis, are stable under diverse analytical conditions, and can be detected in body fluids. METHODS: We measured the longitudinal stability of 673 miRNAs by collecting serial urine samples from 10 patients with localized prostate cancer. We then measured temporally stable miRNAs in an independent training cohort (n\u2009=\u200999) and created a biomarker predictive of Gleason grade using machine-learning techniques. Finally, we validated this biomarker in an independent validation cohort (n\u2009=\u200940). RESULTS: We found that each individual has a specific urine miRNA fingerprint. These fingerprints are temporally stable and associated with specific biological functions. We identified seven miRNAs that were stable over time within individual patients and integrated them with machine-learning techniques to create a novel biomarker for prostate cancer that overcomes interindividual variability. Our urine biomarker robustly identified high-risk patients and achieved similar accuracy as tissue-based prognostic markers (area under the receiver operating characteristic = 0.72, 95% confidence interval = 0.69 to 0.76 in the training cohort, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.74, 95% confidence interval = 0.55 to 0.92 in the validation cohort). CONCLUSIONS: These data highlight the importance of quantifying intra- and intertumoral heterogeneity in biomarker development. This noninvasive biomarker may usefully supplement invasive or expensive radiologic- and tissue-based assays. "
