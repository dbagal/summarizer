        "Congress of Neurological Surgeons Systematic Review and Evidence-Based Guidelines for Pediatric Myelomeningocele: Executive Summary. BACKGROUND: The incidence of spina bifida (SB) in the developing world is higher than in the United States because of malnutrition and folic acid deficiency during pregnancy. Advances in technology have made prenatal repair of myelomeningocele (MM) possible. OBJECTIVE: The objective of the guidelines are, (1) To create clinical recommendations for best practices, based on a systematic review and analysis of available literature, (2) to obtain multi-disciplinary endorsement of these guidelines from relevant organizations, and (3) to disseminate the educational content to physicians to improve the care of infants with MM. METHODS: The Guidelines Task Force developed search terms and strategies used to search PubMed and Embase for literature published between 1966 and September 2016. Strict inclusion/exclusion criteria were used to screen abstracts and to develop a list of relevant articles for full-text review. RESULTS: Guidelines authors aimed to systematically review the literature and make evidence based recommendations about the timing of closure after birth, hydrocephalus, the impact of prenatal closure, and the effect of prenatal closure on ambulation ability and tethered spinal cord. Evidence concerning persistent ventriculomegaly and cognitive impairment was also evaluated. Hundreds of abstracts were identified and reviewed for each of the 5 topics. A total of 14 studies met stringent inclusion criteria. CONCLUSION: Based on a comprehensive systematic review, a total of 5 clinical practice recommendations were developed, with 1 Level I, 2 Level II and 2 Level III recommendations.The full guideline can be found at https://www.cns.org/guidelines/guidelines-spina-bifida-chapter-1.

        "Associations between blood pressure across adulthood and late-life brain structure and pathology in the neuroscience substudy of the 1946 British birth cohort (Insight 46): an epidemiological study. BACKGROUND: Midlife hypertension confers increased risk for cognitive impairment in late life. The sensitive period for risk exposure and extent that risk is mediated through amyloid or vascular-related mechanisms are poorly understood. We aimed to identify if, and when, blood pressure or change in blood pressure during adulthood were associated with late-life brain structure, pathology, and cognition. METHODS: Participants were from Insight 46, a neuroscience substudy of the ongoing longitudinal Medical Research Council National Survey of Health and Development, a birth cohort that initially comprised 5362 individuals born throughout mainland Britain in one week in 1946. Participants aged 69-71 years received T1 and FLAIR volumetric MRI, florbetapir amyloid-PET imaging, and cognitive assessment at University College London (London, UK); all participants were dementia-free. Blood pressure measurements had been collected at ages 36, 43, 53, 60-64, and 69 years. We also calculated blood pressure change variables between ages. Primary outcome measures were white matter hyperintensity volume (WMHV) quantified from multimodal MRI using an automated method, amyloid-\u03b2 positivity or negativity using a standardised uptake value ratio approach, whole-brain and hippocampal volumes quantified from 3D-T1 MRI, and a composite cognitive score-the Preclinical Alzheimer Cognitive Composite (PACC). We investigated associations between blood pressure and blood pressure changes at and between 36, 43, 53, 60-64, and 69 years of age with WMHV using generalised linear models with a gamma distribution and log link function, amyloid-\u03b2 status using logistic regression, whole-brain volume and hippocampal volumes using linear regression, and PACC score using linear regression, with adjustment for potential confounders. FINDINGS: Between May 28, 2015, and Jan 10, 2018, 502 individuals were assessed as part of Insight 46. 465 participants (238 [51%] men; mean age 70\u00b77 years [SD 0\u00b77]; 83 [18%] amyloid-\u03b2-positive) were included in imaging analyses. Higher systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) at age 53 years and greater increases in SBP and DBP between 43 and 53 years were positively associated with WMHV at 69-71 years of age (increase in mean WMHV per 10 mm Hg greater SBP 7%, 95% CI 1-14, p=0\u00b7024; increase in mean WMHV per 10 mm Hg greater DBP 15%, 4-27, p=0\u00b70057; increase in mean WMHV per one SD change in SBP 15%, 3-29, p=0\u00b7012; increase in mean WMHV per 1 SD change in DBP 15%, 3-30, p=0\u00b7017). Higher DBP at 43 years of age was associated with smaller whole-brain volume at 69-71 years of age (-6\u00b79 mL per 10 mm Hg greater DBP, -11\u00b79 to -1\u00b79, p=0\u00b70068), as were greater increases in DBP between 36 and 43 years of age (-6\u00b75 mL per 1 SD change, -11\u00b71 to -1\u00b79, p=0\u00b70054). Greater increases in SBP between 36 and 43 years of age were associated with smaller hippocampal volumes at 69-71 years of age (-0\u00b703 mL per 1 SD change, -0\u00b706 to -0\u00b7001, p=0\u00b7043). Neither absolute blood pressure nor change in blood pressure predicted amyloid-\u03b2 status or PACC score at 69-71 years of age. INTERPRETATION: High and increasing blood pressure from early adulthood into midlife seems to be associated with increased WMHV and smaller brain volumes at 69-71 years of age. We found no evidence that blood pressure affected cognition or cerebral amyloid-\u03b2 load at this age. Blood pressure monitoring and interventions might need to start around 40 years of age to maximise late-life brain health.

        "Learning Desire Is Predicted by Similar Neural Processing of Naturalistic Educational Materials. Naturalistic stimuli can elicit highly similar brain activity across viewers. How do naturalistic educational materials engage human brains and evoke learning desire? Here, we presented 15 audiovisual course clips (each lasting \u223c120 s) to university students and recorded their neural activity through electroencephalography. Upon finishing all the video viewings, subjects ranked 15 courses in order of learning desire and reported the reasons for high learning desire (i.e., \"value\" and \"interest\"). The brain activity during the video viewing was measured as the neural similarity via intersubject correlation (ISC), that is, correlation between each subject's neural responses and those of others. Based on averaged learning desire rankings across subjects, course clips were classified with high versus medium versus low motivational effectiveness. We found that the ISC of high effective course clips was larger than that of low effective ones. The ISC difference (high vs low) was positively associated with subjects' learning desire difference (high vs low). Such an association occurred when viewing time accumulated to \u223c80 s. Moreover, ISC was correlated with \"interest-based\" rather than \"value-based\" learning desire. These findings advance our understanding of learning motivation via the neural similarity in the context of on-line education and provide potential neurophysiological suggestions for pedagogical practices.

        "Identification of traits and functional connectivity-based neurotraits of chronic pain. Psychological and personality factors, socioeconomic status, and brain properties all contribute to chronic pain but have essentially been studied independently. Here, we administered a broad battery of questionnaires to patients with chronic back pain (CBP) and collected repeated sessions of resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) brain scans. Clustering and network analyses applied on the questionnaire data revealed four orthogonal dimensions accounting for 56% of the variance and defining chronic pain traits. Two of these traits-Pain-trait and Emote-trait-were associated with back pain characteristics and could be related to distinct distributed functional networks in a cross-validation procedure, identifying neurotraits. These neurotraits showed good reliability across four fMRI sessions acquired over five weeks. Further, traits and neurotraits all related to the income, emphasizing the importance of socioeconomic status within the personality space of chronic pain. Our approach is a first step in providing metrics aimed at unifying the psychology and the neurophysiology of chronic pain applicable across diverse clinical conditions. ",
        "Association Between Clinically Meaningful Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Improvement and Risk of Type 2 Diabetes. Importance: Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is associated with increased risk of type 2 diabetes (T2D). Improvement in PTSD has been associated with improved self-reported physical health and hypertension; however, there is no literature, to our knowledge, on whether PTSD improvement is associated with T2D risk. Objective: To examine whether clinically meaningful PTSD symptom reduction is associated with lower risk of T2D. Design, Setting, and Participants: This retrospective cohort study examined Veterans Health Affairs medical record data from 5916 patients who received PTSD specialty care between fiscal years 2008 and 2012 and were followed up through fiscal year 2015. Eligible patients had 1 or more PTSD Checklist (PCL) scores of 50 or higher between fiscal years 2008 and 2012 and a second PCL score within the following 12 months and at least 8 weeks after the first PCL score of 50 or higher. The index date was 12 months after the first PCL score. Patients were free of T2D diagnosis or an antidiabetic medication use for 12 months before the index date and had at least 1 visit after the index date. Data analyses were completed during January 2019. Exposures: Reduction in PCL scores during a 12-month period was used to define patients as those with a clinically meaningful improvement (\u226520-point PCL score decrease) and patients with less or no improvement (<20-point PCL score decrease). Main Outcomes and Measures: Incident T2D diagnosed during a 2- to 6-year follow-up. Results: Medical records from a total of 1598 patients (mean [SD] age, 42.1 [13.4] years; 1347 [84.3%] male; 1060 [66.3%] white) were studied. The age-adjusted cumulative incidence of T2D was 2.6% among patients with a clinically meaningful PCL score decrease and 5.9% among patients without a clinically meaningful PCL score decrease (P\u2009=\u2009.003). After control for confounding, patients with a clinically meaningful PCL score decrease were significantly less likely to develop T2DM compared with those without a clinically meaningful decrease (hazard ratio, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.26-0.98). Conclusions and Relevance: The findings suggest that clinically meaningful reductions in PTSD symptoms are associated with a lower risk of T2D. A decrease in PCL score, whether through treatment or spontaneous improvement, may help mitigate the greater risk of T2D in patients with PTSD. ",
        "Time-Series Analysis of Health Care-Associated Infections in a New Hospital With All Private Rooms. Importance: Health care-associated infections are often caused by multidrug-resistant organisms and substantially factor into hospital costs and avoidable iatrogenic harm. Although it is recommended that new facilities be built with single-room, low-acuity beds, this process is costly and evidence of reductions in health care-associated infections is weak. Objective: To examine whether single-patient rooms are associated with decreased rates of common multidrug-resistant organism transmissions and health care-associated infections. Design, Setting, and Participants: A time-series analysis comparing institution-level rates of new multidrug-resistant organism colonization and health care-associated infections before (January 1, 2013-March 31, 2015) and after (April 1, 2015-March 31, 2018) the move to the hospital with 100% single-patient rooms. In the largest hospital move in Canadian history, inpatients in an older, tertiary care, 417-bed hospital in Montr\u00e9al, Canada, that consisted of mainly mixed 3- and 4-person ward-type rooms were moved to a new 350-bed facility with all private rooms. Exposures: A synchronized move of all patients on April 26, 2015, to a new hospital with 100% single-patient rooms equipped with individual toilets and showers and easy access to sinks for hand washing. Main Outcomes and Measures: Rates of nosocomial vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) colonization, VRE and MRSA infection, and Clostridioides difficile (formerly known as Clostridium difficile) infection (CDI) per 10 000 patient-days. Results: Compared with the 27 months before, during the 36 months after the hospital move, an immediate and sustained reduction in nosocomial VRE colonization (from 766 to 209 colonizations; incidence rate ratio [IRR], 0.25; 95% CI, 0.19-0.34) and MRSA colonization (from 129 to 112 colonizations; IRR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.33-0.96) was noted, as well as VRE infection (from 55 to 14 infections; IRR, 0.30, 95% CI, 0.12-0.75). Rates of CDI (from 236 to 223 infections; IRR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.51-1.76) and MRSA infection (from 27 to 37 infections; IRR, 0.89, 95% CI, 0.34-2.29) did not decrease. Conclusion and Relevance: The move to a new hospital with exclusively single-patient rooms appeared to be associated with a sustained decrease in the rates of new MRSA and VRE colonization and VRE infection; however, the move was not associated with a reduction in CDI or MRSA infection. These findings may have important implications for the role of hospital construction in facilitating infection control. ",
        "Spatio-temporal assessment of illicit drug use at large scale: evidence from 7 years of international wastewater monitoring. BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Wastewater-based epidemiology is an additional indicator of drug use that is gaining reliability to complement the current established panel of indicators. The aims of this study were to: (i) assess spatial and temporal trends of population-normalized mass loads of benzoylecgonine, amphetamine, methamphetamine and 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) in raw wastewater over 7\u00a0years (2011-17); (ii) address overall drug use by estimating the average number of combined doses consumed per day in each city; and (iii) compare these with existing prevalence and seizure data. DESIGN: Analysis of daily raw wastewater composite samples collected over 1\u00a0week per year from 2011 to 2017. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Catchment areas of 143 wastewater treatment plants in 120 cities in 37 countries. MEASUREMENTS: Parent substances (amphetamine, methamphetamine and MDMA) and the metabolites of cocaine (benzoylecgonine) and of \u03949 -tetrahydrocannabinol (11-nor-9-carboxy-\u03949 -tetrahydrocannabinol) were measured in wastewater using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Daily mass loads (mg/day) were normalized to catchment population (mg/1000 people/day) and converted to the number of combined doses consumed per day. Spatial differences were assessed world-wide, and temporal trends were discerned at European level by comparing 2011-13 drug loads versus 2014-17 loads. FINDINGS: Benzoylecgonine was the stimulant metabolite detected at higher loads in southern and western Europe, and amphetamine, MDMA and methamphetamine in East and North-Central Europe. In other continents, methamphetamine showed the highest levels in the United States and Australia and benzoylecgonine in South America. During the reporting period, benzoylecgonine loads increased in general across Europe, amphetamine and methamphetamine levels fluctuated and MDMA underwent an intermittent upsurge. CONCLUSIONS: The analysis of wastewater to quantify drug loads provides near real-time drug use estimates that globally correspond to prevalence and seizure data. ",
        "The Representation of Semantic Information Across Human Cerebral Cortex During Listening Versus Reading Is Invariant to Stimulus Modality. An integral part of human language is the capacity to extract meaning from spoken and written words, but the precise relationship between brain representations of information perceived by listening versus reading is unclear. Prior neuroimaging studies have shown that semantic information in spoken language is represented in multiple regions in the human cerebral cortex, while amodal semantic information appears to be represented in a few broad brain regions. However, previous studies were too insensitive to determine whether semantic representations were shared at a fine level of detail rather than merely at a coarse scale. We used fMRI to record brain activity in two separate experiments while participants listened to or read several hours of the same narrative stories, and then created voxelwise encoding models to characterize semantic selectivity in each voxel and in each individual participant. We find that semantic tuning during listening and reading are highly correlated in most semantically selective regions of cortex, and models estimated using one modality accurately predict voxel responses in the other modality. These results suggest that the representation of language semantics is independent of the sensory modality through which the semantic information is received.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Humans can comprehend the meaning of words from both spoken and written language. It is therefore important to understand the relationship between the brain representations of spoken or written text. Here, we show that although the representation of semantic information in the human brain is quite complex, the semantic representations evoked by listening versus reading are almost identical. These results suggest that the representation of language semantics is independent of the sensory modality through which the semantic information is received. ",
        "Synthetic sequence entanglement augments stability and containment of genetic information in cells. In synthetic biology, methods for stabilizing genetically engineered functions and confining recombinant DNA to intended hosts are necessary to cope with natural mutation accumulation and pervasive lateral gene flow. We present a generalizable strategy to preserve and constrain genetic information through the computational design of overlapping genes. Overlapping a sequence with an essential gene altered its fitness landscape and produced a constrained evolutionary path, even for synonymous mutations. Embedding a toxin gene in a gene of interest restricted its horizontal propagation. We further demonstrated a multiplex and scalable approach to build and test >7500 overlapping sequence designs, yielding functional yet highly divergent variants from natural homologs. This work enables deeper exploration of natural and engineered overlapping genes and facilitates enhanced genetic stability and biocontainment in emerging applications. ",
        "Handgrip Strength Is Associated with Poorer Cognitive Functioning in Aging Americans. BACKGROUND: Measures of handgrip strength may show promise for detecting cognitive erosion during aging. OBJECTIVE: To determine the associations between lower handgrip strength and poorer cognitive functioning for aging Americans. METHODS: There were 13,828 participants aged at least 50 years from the 2006 wave of the Health and Retirement Study included and followed biennially for 8 years. Handgrip strength was assessed with a hand-held dynamometer and cognitive functioning was assessed with a modified version of the Mini-Mental State Examination. Participants aged <65 years with scores 7- 11 had a mild cognitive impairment, \u22646 had a severe cognitive impairment, and \u226411 had any cognitive impairment. Respondents aged \u226565 years with scores 8- 10 had a mild cognitive impairment, \u22647 had a severe cognitive impairment, and \u226410 had any cognitive impairment. Separate covariate-adjusted multilevel logistic models examined the associations between lower handgrip strength and any or severe cognitive impairment. A multilevel ordered logit model analyzed the association between lower handgrip strength and poorer cognitive functioning. RESULTS: Every 5-kg lower handgrip strength was associated with 1.10 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.04, 1.15) and 1.18 (CI: 1.04, 1.32) greater odds for any and severe cognitive impairment, respectively. Similarly, every 5-kg lower handgrip strength was associated with 1.10 (CI: 1.05, 1.14) greater odds for poorer cognitive functioning. CONCLUSIONS: Measurement of handgrip strength is a simple, risk-stratifying method for helping healthcare providers determine poorer cognitive functioning. Interventions aiming to prevent or delay cognitive dysfunction should also implement measures of handgrip strength as an assessment tool for determining efficacy. ",
        "Remote Postischemic Conditioning Promotes Stroke Recovery by Shifting Circulating Monocytes to CCR2+ Proinflammatory Subset. Brain injury from stroke is typically considered an event exclusive to the CNS, but injury progression and repair processes are profoundly influenced by peripheral immunity. Stroke stimulates an acute inflammatory response that results in a massive infiltration of peripheral immune cells into the ischemic area. While these cells contribute to the development of brain injury, their recruitment has been considered as a key step for tissue repair. The paradoxical role of inflammatory monocytes in stroke raises the possibility that the manipulation of peripheral immune cells before infiltration into the brain could influence stroke outcome. One such manipulation is remote ischemic limb conditioning (RLC), which triggers an endogenous tolerance mechanism. We observed that mice subjected to poststroke RLC shifted circulating monocytes to a CCR2+ proinflammatory monocyte subset and had reduced acute brain injury, swelling, and improved motor/gait function in chronic stroke. The RLC benefits were observed regardless of injury severity, with a greater shift to a CCR2+ subset in severe stroke. Adoptive transfer of CCR2-deficient monocytes abolished RLC-mediated protection. The study demonstrates the importance of RLC-induced shift of monocytes to a CCR2+ proinflammatory subset in attenuating acute injury and promoting functional recovery in chronic stroke. The defined immune-mediated mechanism underlying RLC benefits allows for an evidence-based framework for the development of immune-based therapeutic strategies for stroke patients.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Stroke is the leading cause of physical disability worldwide but has few treatment options for patients. Because remote ischemic limb conditioning (RLC) elicits endogenous tolerance in neither an organ- nor a tissue-specific manner, the immune system has been considered a mediator for an RLC-related benefit. Application of RLC after stroke increased a proinflammatory CCR2+ monocyte subset in the blood and the brain. RLC reduced acute stroke injury and promoted motor/gait function during the recovery phase. The RLC benefits were absent in mice that received CCR2-deficient monocytes. This preclinical study shows the importance of CCR2+ proinflammatory monocytes in RLC benefits in stroke and provides a therapeutic RLC platform as a novel immune strategy to improve outcomes in stroke patients.

        "Bis-naphthopyrone pigments protect filamentous ascomycetes from a wide range of predators. It is thought that fungi protect themselves from predation by the production of compounds that are toxic to soil-dwelling animals. Here, we show that a nontoxic pigment, the bis-naphthopyrone aurofusarin, protects Fusarium fungi from a wide range of animal predators. We find that springtails (primitive hexapods), woodlice (crustaceans), and mealworms (insects) prefer feeding on fungi with disrupted aurofusarin synthesis, and mealworms and springtails are repelled by wheat flour amended with the fungal bis-naphthopyrones aurofusarin, viomellein, or xanthomegnin. Predation stimulates aurofusarin synthesis in several Fusarium species and viomellein synthesis in Aspergillus ochraceus. Aurofusarin displays low toxicity in mealworms, springtails, isopods, Drosophila, and insect cells, contradicting the common view that fungal defence metabolites are toxic. Our results indicate that bis-naphthopyrones are defence compounds that protect filamentous ascomycetes from predators through a mechanism that does not involve toxicity. ",
        "BCAA catabolism in brown fat controls energy homeostasis through SLC25A44. Branched-chain amino acid (BCAA; valine, leucine and isoleucine) supplementation is often beneficial to energy expenditure; however, increased circulating\u00a0levels of BCAA are linked to obesity and diabetes. The mechanisms of this paradox remain unclear. Here we report that, on cold exposure, brown adipose tissue (BAT) actively utilizes BCAA in the mitochondria for thermogenesis and promotes systemic BCAA clearance in mice and humans. In turn, a BAT-specific defect in BCAA catabolism attenuates systemic BCAA clearance, BAT fuel oxidation and thermogenesis, leading to diet-induced obesity and glucose intolerance. Mechanistically, active BCAA catabolism in BAT is mediated by SLC25A44, which transports BCAAs into mitochondria. Our results suggest that BAT serves as a key metabolic filter that controls BCAA clearance via SLC25A44, thereby contributing to the improvement of metabolic health. ",
        "Cyfip1 haploinsufficient rats show white matter changes, myelin thinning, abnormal oligodendrocytes and behavioural inflexibility. The biological basis of the increased risk for psychiatric disorders seen in 15q11.2 copy number deletion is unknown. Previous work has shown disturbances in white matter tracts in human carriers of the deletion. Here, in a novel rat model, we recapitulated low dosage of the candidate risk gene CYFIP1 present within the 15q11.2 interval. Using diffusion tensor imaging, we first showed extensive white matter changes in Cyfip1 mutant rats, which were most pronounced in the corpus callosum and external capsule. Transmission electron microscopy showed that these changes were associated with thinning of the myelin sheath in the corpus callosum. Myelin thinning was independent of changes in axon number or diameter but was associated with effects on mature oligodendrocytes, including aberrant intracellular distribution of myelin basic protein. Finally, we demonstrated effects on cognitive phenotypes sensitive to both disruptions in myelin and callosal circuitry. ",
        "Disparities in Oral Cancer Screening Among Dental Professionals: NHANES 2011-2016. INTRODUCTION: As early detection of oral cancers is associated with better survival, oral cancer screening should be included in dental visits for adults. This study examines the rate and predictors of oral cancer screening exams among U.S. adults with a recent dental visit. METHODS: Individuals aged \u226530 years who received a dental visit in the last 2 years, in the 2011-2016 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey were analyzed in December 2018. Weighted multivariable logistic regression models examined the likelihood of intraoral and extraoral oral cancer screening exams, adjusting for age, sex, race/ethnicity, education, marital status, poverty income ratio, health insurance, tobacco smoking, and alcohol consumption. Subgroup analyses were conducted among races/ethnicities, smokers, and alcohol consumers. Statistical significance was set at p<0.01. RESULTS: A total of 37.6% and 31.3% reported receiving an intraoral and extraoral oral cancer screening exam, respectively. Minority racial/ethnic groups versus white, non-Hispanics, less-educated versus more-educated, uninsured and Medicaid-insured versus privately insured, and low-income versus high-income participants were less likely to have received intraoral or extraoral oral cancer screening exams. There was no difference in the likelihood of being screened based on smoking status. Alcohol consumers were more likely to be screened. Among subgroups, less-educated and low-income individuals were less likely to be screened. CONCLUSIONS: A significantly higher proportion of minority race/ethnicity and low SES individuals report not receiving an oral cancer screening exam, despite a recent dental visit. This selective screening by dental professionals is incompliant with guidelines and concerning because these groups are more likely to present with an advanced stage of oral cancer at diagnosis. An understanding of the reasons for discriminatory oral cancer screening practices could help develop effective interventions. ",
        "Environmental pollution is associated with increased risk of psychiatric disorders in the US and Denmark. The search for the genetic factors underlying complex neuropsychiatric disorders has proceeded apace in the past decade. Despite some advances in identifying genetic variants associated with psychiatric disorders, most variants have small individual contributions to risk. By contrast, disease risk increase appears to be less subtle for disease-predisposing environmental insults. In this study, we sought to identify associations between environmental pollution and risk of neuropsychiatric disorders. We present exploratory analyses of 2 independent, very large datasets: 151 million unique individuals, represented in a United States insurance claims dataset, and 1.4 million unique individuals documented in Danish national treatment registers. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) county-level environmental quality indices (EQIs) in the US and individual-level exposure to air pollution in Denmark were used to assess the association between pollution exposure and the risk of neuropsychiatric disorders. These results show that air pollution is significantly associated with increased risk of psychiatric disorders. We hypothesize that pollutants affect the human brain via neuroinflammatory pathways that have also been shown to cause depression-like phenotypes in animal studies. ",
        "Innovations in the Plastic Surgery Care Pathway: Using Telemedicine for Clinical Efficiency and Patient Satisfaction. BACKGROUND: Telemedicine delivers clinical information and permits discussion between providers and patients at a distance. Postoperative visits may be a burden to patients-many of whom travel long distances and miss work opportunities. By implementing a telehealth opportunity, the authors sought to develop a process that optimizes efficiency and provides optimal patient satisfaction. METHODS: Using quality improvement methods that have been highly effective in the business sector, we developed a testable workflow for patients in the postoperative telehealth setting. Seventy-two patients were enrolled and surveyed. A preoperative survey sought to determine travel distance, comfort with technology, access to the Internet and video-enabled devices, and the patient's interest in telehealth. A postoperative survey focused on patient satisfaction with the experience. RESULTS: Using the Lean Six Sigma methodology, the authors developed a telehealth workflow to optimize clinical efficiency. Preoperative surveys revealed that the majority (73 percent) of patients preferred in-person follow-up visits in the clinic. However, the postoperative survey distributed after the telehealth encounter found that nearly 100 percent of patients were satisfied with the telehealth experience. Ninety-six percent of patients said that their questions were answered, and 97 percent of patients stated that they would use telehealth again in the future. CONCLUSIONS: Telehealth encounters enable real-time clinical decision-making by providing patients and visiting nurses access to providers and decreasing patient transportation needs and wait times. Although initially hesitant to opt for a telehealth encounter in lieu of a traditional visit, the great majority of patients voiced satisfaction with the telehealth experience. CLINICAL QUESTION/LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic, IV. ",
        "Borderline personality disorder traits associate with midlife cardiometabolic risk. There is growing interest in relationships between borderline personality disorder (BPD) pathology and physical health outcomes. Diagnostic BPD and BPD-related traits, for instance, have been shown to associate with self-reported cardiovascular disease and various cardiometabolic risk factors. However, potential confounding of these associations by comorbid depression, which itself contributes to risk for heart disease, remains unresolved, and previous research is limited by nearly uniform reliance on self-reported health status. In the present study, we examine the association of BPD traits and contemporaneously assessed depressive mood with instrumented measures of cardiometabolic risk in a midlife community sample (N = 1,295). BPD pathology was measured using dimensional, multi-informant trait measures; depressive symptomology was self-reported; and cardiometabolic risk was indexed via multiple indicators of insulin resistance, adiposity, dyslipidemia, and blood pressure. Structural equation modeling was used to estimate the effects of BPD traits and depressive symptoms on aggregated cardiometabolic risk, adjusting for their shared variance. Results showed both BPD features and depressive symptomatology related to the extent of cardiometabolic risk; when examined simultaneously, only BPD associated independently with risk indicators. In further supporting a link between BPD pathology and cardiovascular disease risk, these findings warrant future work to elucidate intervening behavioral and biological mechanisms.

        "Central American Immigrant Mothers' Mental Health in the Context of Illegality: Structural Stress, Parental Concern, and Trauma. Using a community-based participatory research approach, we surveyed 134 undocumented Central American immigrant mothers to examine correlates of maternal mental health. Drawing upon an ecosystemic framework, predictors of depression included structural and familial stressors, parental concerns, and maternal health factors. Mothers' perceptions of child affect, traumatic stress, and general health ratings were among the most salient predictors. However, structural and familial stressors, such as food insecurity and single parenting, also accounted for significant variance in depression scores. Findings informed community actions such as advocating for mental health care and building awareness of families' lived experiences within the local school system. ",
        "Sustained microglial depletion with CSF1R inhibitor impairs parenchymal plaque development in an Alzheimer's disease model. Many risk genes for the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD) are exclusively or highly expressed in myeloid cells. Microglia are dependent on colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) signaling for their survival. We designed and synthesized a highly selective brain-penetrant CSF1R inhibitor (PLX5622) allowing for extended and specific microglial elimination, preceding and during pathology development. We find that in the 5xFAD mouse model of AD, plaques fail to form in the parenchymal space following microglial depletion, except in areas containing surviving microglia. Instead, A\u03b2 deposits in cortical blood vessels reminiscent of cerebral amyloid angiopathy. Altered gene expression in the 5xFAD hippocampus is also reversed by the absence of microglia. Transcriptional analyses of the residual plaque-forming microglia show they exhibit a disease-associated microglia profile. Collectively, we describe the structure, formulation, and efficacy of PLX5622, which allows for sustained microglial depletion and identify roles of microglia in initiating plaque pathogenesis. ",

BACKGROUND: Activity in the supplementary motor area (SMA) has been associated with tics in Tourette syndrome (TS). The aim of this study was to test a novel intervention-real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging neurofeedback from the SMA-for reduction of tics in adolescents with TS. METHODS: Twenty-one adolescents with TS were enrolled in a double-blind, randomized, sham-controlled, crossover study involving two sessions of neurofeedback from their SMA. The primary outcome measure of tic severity was the Yale Global Tic Severity Scale administered by an independent evaluator before and after each arm. The secondary outcome was control over the SMA assessed in neuroimaging scans, in which subjects were cued to increase/decrease activity in SMA without receiving feedback. RESULTS: All 21 subjects completed both arms of the study and all assessments. Participants had significantly greater reduction of tics on the Yale Global Tic Severity Scale after real neurofeedback as compared with the sham\u00a0control (p < .05). Mean Yale Global Tic Severity Scale Total Tic score decreased from 25.2 \u00b1 4.6 at baseline to 19.9 \u00b1 5.7 at end point in the neurofeedback condition and from 24.8 \u00b1 8.1 to 23.3 \u00b1 8.5 in the sham control condition. The 3.8-point difference is clinically meaningful and corresponds to an effect size of 0.59. However, there were no differences in changes on the secondary measure of control over the SMA. CONCLUSIONS: This first randomized controlled trial of real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging neurofeedback in adolescents with TS suggests that this neurofeedback intervention may be helpful for improving tic symptoms. However, no effects were found in terms of change in control over the SMA, the hypothesized mechanism of action. ",
        "Patient Factors Associated with Opioid Consumption in the Month Following Major Surgery. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine preoperative patient characteristics associated with postoperative outpatient opioid use and assess the frequency of postoperative opioid overprescribing. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Although characteristics associated with inpatient opioid use have been described, data regarding patient factors associated with opioid use after discharge are lacking. This hampers the development of individualized approaches to postoperative prescribing. METHODS: We included opioid-na\u00efve patients undergoing hysterectomy, thoracic surgery, and total knee and hip arthroplasty in a single-center prospective observational cohort study. Preoperative phenotyping included self-report measures to assess pain severity, fibromyalgia survey criteria score, pain catastrophizing, depression, anxiety, functional status, fatigue, and sleep disturbance. Our primary outcome measure was self-reported total opioid use in oral morphine equivalents. We constructed multivariable linear-regression models predicting opioids consumed in the first month following surgery. RESULTS: We enrolled 1181 patients; 1001 had complete primary outcome data and 913 had complete phenotype data. Younger age, non-white race, lack of a college degree, higher anxiety, greater sleep disturbance, heavy alcohol use, current tobacco use, and larger initial opioid prescription size were significantly associated with increased opioid consumption. Median total oral morphine equivalents prescribed was 600\u200amg (equivalent to one hundred twenty 5-mg hydrocodone pills), whereas median opioid consumption was 188\u200amg (38 pills). CONCLUSIONS: In this prospective cohort of opioid-na\u00efve patients undergoing major surgery, we found a number of characteristics associated with greater opioid use in the first month after surgery. Future studies should address the use of non-opioid medications and behavioral therapies in the perioperative period for these higher risk patients. ",
        "Comparative Effectiveness of Combining MTX with Biologic Drug Therapy Versus Either MTX or Biologics Alone for Early Rheumatoid Arthritis in Adults: a Systematic Review and Network Meta-analysis. BACKGROUND: Comparative effectiveness of early rheumatoid arthritis (RA) treatments remains uncertain. PURPOSE: Compare benefits and harms of biologic drug therapies for adults with early RA within 1\u00a0year of diagnosis. DATA SOURCES: English language articles from the 2012 review to October 2017 identified through MEDLINE, Cochrane Library and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts, gray literature, expert recommendations, reference lists of published literature, and supplemental evidence data requests. STUDY SELECTION: Two persons independently selected studies based on predefined inclusion criteria. DATA EXTRACTION: One reviewer extracted data; a second reviewer checked accuracy. Two independent reviewers assigned risk of bias ratings. DATA SYNTHESIS: We identified 22 eligible studies with 9934 participants. Combination therapy with tumor necrosis factor (TNF) or non-TNF biologics plus methotrexate (MTX) improved disease control, remission, and functional capacity compared with monotherapy of either MTX or a biologic. Network meta-analyses found higher ACR50 response (50% improvement) for combination therapy of biologic plus MTX than for MTX monotherapy (relative risk range 1.20 [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.04 to 1.38] to 1.57 [95% CI, 1.30 to 1.88]). No significant differences emerged between treatment discontinuation rates because of adverse events or serious adverse events. Subgroup data (disease activity, prior therapy, demographics, serious conditions) were limited. LIMITATIONS: Trials enrolled almost exclusively selected populations with high disease activity. Network meta-analyses were derived from indirect comparisons relative to MTX due to the dearth of head-to-head studies comparing interventions. No eligible data on biosimilars were found. CONCLUSIONS: Qualitative and network meta-analyses suggest that the combination of MTX with TNF or non-TNF biologics reduces disease activity and improves remission when compared with MTX monotherapy. Overall adverse event and discontinuation rates were similar between treatment groups. REGISTRATION: PROSPERO (available at http://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO/display_record.php?ID=CRD42017079260 ).

        "Quantitative prediction of erythrocyte sickling for the development of advanced sickle cell therapies. Sickle cell disease is induced by a mutation that converts normal adult hemoglobin to sickle hemoglobin (HbS) and engenders intracellular polymerization of deoxy-HbS and erythrocyte sickling. Development of anti-sickling therapies requires quantitative understanding of HbS polymerization kinetics under organ-specific conditions, which are difficult to assess with existing experimental techniques. Thus, we developed a kinetic model based on the classical nucleation theory to examine the effectiveness of potential anti-sickling drug candidates. We validated this model by comparing its predictability against prior in vivo and in vitro experimental results. We used the model to quantify the efficacy of sickling inhibitors and obtain results consistent with recent screening assays. Global sensitivity analysis on the kinetic parameters in the model revealed that the solubility, nucleation rate prefactor, and oxygen affinity are quantities that dictate HbS polymerization. This finding provides quantitative guidelines for the discovery of intracellular processes to be targeted by sickling inhibitors. ",
        "High-density functional diffuse optical tomography based on frequency-domain measurements improves image quality and spatial resolution. Measurements of dynamic near-infrared (NIR) light attenuation across the human head together with model-based image reconstruction algorithms allow the recovery of three-dimensional spatial brain activation maps. Previous studies using high-density diffuse optical tomography (HD-DOT) systems have reported improved image quality over sparse arrays. These HD-DOT systems incorporated multidistance overlapping continuous wave measurements that only recover differential intensity attenuation. We investigate the potential improvement in reconstructed image quality due to the additional incorporation of phase shift measurements, which reflect the time-of-flight of the measured NIR light, within the tomographic reconstruction from high-density measurements. To evaluate image reconstruction with and without the additional phase information, we simulated point spread functions across a whole-scalp field of view in 24 subject-specific anatomical models using an experimentally derived noise model. The addition of phase information improves the image quality by reducing localization error by up to 59% and effective resolution by up to 21% as compared to using the intensity attenuation measurements alone. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the phase data enable images to be resolved at deeper brain regions where intensity data fail, which is further supported by utilizing experimental data from a single subject measurement during a retinotopic experiment.

        "Temporal Changes in Effect Sizes of Studies Comparing Individuals With and Without Autism: A Meta-analysis. Importance: The definition and nature of autism have been highly debated, as exemplified by several revisions of the DSM (DSM-III, DSM-IIIR, DSM-IV, and DSM-5) criteria. There has recently been a move from a categorical view toward a spectrum-based view. These changes have been accompanied by a steady increase in the prevalence of the condition. Changes in the definition of autism that may increase heterogeneity could affect the results of autism research; specifically, a broadening of the population with autism could result in decreasing effect sizes of group comparison studies. Objective: To examine the correlation between publication year and effect size of autism-control group comparisons across several domains of published autism neurocognitive research. Data Sources: This meta-analysis investigated 11 meta-analyses obtained through a systematic search of PubMed for meta-analyses published from January 1, 1966, through January 27, 2019, using the search string autism AND (meta-analysis OR meta-analytic). The last search was conducted on January 27, 2019. Study Selection: Meta-analyses were included if they tested the significance of group differences between individuals with autism and control individuals on a neurocognitive construct. Meta-analyses were only included if the tested group difference was significant and included data with a span of at least 15 years. Data Extraction and Synthesis: Data were extracted and analyzed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) reporting guideline using fixed-effects models. Main Outcomes and Measures: Estimated slope of the correlation between publication year and effect size, controlling for differences in methods, sample size, and study quality. Results: The 11 meta-analyses included data from a total of 27\u202f723 individuals. Demographic data such as sex and age were not available for the entire data set. Seven different psychological and neurologic constructs were analyzed based on data from these meta-analyses. Downward temporal trends for effect size were found for all constructs (slopes: -0.067 to -0.003), with the trend being significant in 5 of 7 cases: emotion recognition (slope: -0.028 [95% CI, -0.048 to -0.007]), theory of mind (-0.045 [95% CI, -0.066 to -0.024]), planning (-0.067 [95% CI, -0.125 to -0.009]), P3b amplitude (-0.048 [95% CI, -0.093 to -0.004]), and brain size (-0.047 [95% CI, -0.077 to -0.016]). In contrast, 3 analogous constructs in schizophrenia, a condition that is also heterogeneous but with no reported increase in prevalence, did not show a similar trend. Conclusions and Relevance: The findings suggest that differences between individuals with autism and those without the diagnosis have decreased over time and that possible changes in the definition of autism from a narrowly defined and homogenous population toward an inclusive and heterogeneous population may reduce our capacity to build mechanistic models of the condition.

        "Fatigue in Parkinson's Disease Associates with Lower Ambulatory Diastolic Blood Pressure. BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE: Fatigue is a common debilitating symptom in Parkinson's disease (PD) of unclear etiology. Hypotension and blood pressure variability are common in PD though their relationship to other non-motor symptoms is less well understood. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study to explore differences in 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure measurements in PD subjects (n\u200a=\u200a35) with and without fatigue. Subjects underwent hourly systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressure testing in their home environment. The presence of fatigue was assessed using the Movement Disorders Society Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) part 1. We compared blood pressure measurements in fatigued vs. non-fatigued PD subjects, assessed over 4 epochs: overnight, morning, midday, and evening. RESULTS: PD subjects with symptoms of fatigue demonstrated lower mean DBP, compared to those without fatigue (67.8\u00b14.8 mmHg vs. 75.6\u00b19.4 t\u200a=\u200a2.57, p\u200a=\u200a0.014). These intergroup differences were most notable in the morning. The two groups did not differ in scoring on the Survey of Autonomic Symptoms or on an office-based blood assessment of SBP or DBP performed on the day of 24-hour monitor initiation. CONCLUSIONS: Fatigue in PD may be a clinical manifestation of low-grade systemic hypotension. ",
        "Omega-3, omega-6, and total dietary polyunsaturated fat for prevention and treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials. OBJECTIVE: To assess effects of increasing omega-3, omega-6, and total polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) on diabetes diagnosis and glucose metabolism. DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analyses. DATA SOURCES: Medline, Embase, Cochrane CENTRAL, WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, Clinicaltrials.gov, and trials in relevant systematic reviews. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials of at least 24 weeks' duration assessing effects of increasing \u03b1-linolenic acid, long chain omega-3, omega-6, or total PUFA, which collected data on diabetes diagnoses, fasting glucose or insulin, glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c), and/or homoeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR). DATA SYNTHESIS: Statistical analysis included random effects meta-analyses using relative risk and mean difference, and sensitivity analyses. Funnel plots were examined and subgrouping assessed effects of intervention type, replacement, baseline risk of diabetes and use of antidiabetes drugs, trial duration, and dose. Risk of bias was assessed with the Cochrane tool and quality of evidence with GRADE. RESULTS: 83 randomised controlled trials (mainly assessing effects of supplementary long chain omega-3) were included; 10 were at low summary risk of bias. Long chain omega-3 had little or no effect on likelihood of diagnosis of diabetes (relative risk 1.00, 95% confidence interval 0.85 to 1.17; 58\u2009643 participants, 3.7% developed diabetes) or measures of glucose metabolism (HbA1c mean difference -0.02%, 95% confidence interval -0.07% to 0.04%; plasma glucose 0.04, 0.02 to 0.07, mmol/L; fasting insulin 1.02, -4.34 to 6.37, pmol/L; HOMA-IR 0.06, -0.21 to 0.33). A suggestion of negative outcomes was observed when dose of supplemental long chain omega-3 was above 4.4 g/d. Effects of \u03b1-linolenic acid, omega-6, and total PUFA on diagnosis of diabetes were unclear (as the evidence was of very low quality), but little or no effect on measures of glucose metabolism was seen, except that increasing \u03b1-linolenic acid may increase fasting insulin (by about 7%). No evidence was found that the omega-3/omega-6 ratio is important for diabetes or glucose metabolism. CONCLUSIONS: This is the most extensive systematic review of trials to date to assess effects of polyunsaturated fats on newly diagnosed diabetes and glucose metabolism, including previously unpublished data following contact with authors. Evidence suggests that increasing omega-3, omega-6, or total PUFA has little or no effect on prevention and treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus.

        "Randomized Trial of Lenalidomide Versus Observation in Smoldering Multiple Myeloma. PURPOSE: Observation is the current standard of care for smoldering multiple myeloma. We hypothesized that early intervention with lenalidomide could delay progression to symptomatic multiple myeloma. METHODS: We conducted a randomized trial that assessed the efficacy of single-agent lenalidomide compared with observation in patients with intermediate- or high-risk smoldering multiple myeloma. Lenalidomide was administered orally at a dose of 25 mg on days 1 to 21 of a 28-day cycle. The primary end point was progression-free survival, with disease progression requiring the development of end-organ damage attributable to multiple myeloma and biochemical progression. RESULTS: One hundred eighty-two patients were randomly assigned-92 patients to the lenalidomide arm and 90 to the observation arm. Median follow-up is 35 months. Response to therapy was observed in 50% (95% CI, 39% to 61%) of patients in the lenalidomide arm, with no responses in the observation arm. Progression-free survival was significantly longer with lenalidomide compared with observation (hazard ratio, 0.28; 95% CI, 0.12 to 0.62; P = .002). One-, 2-, and 3-year progression-free survival was 98%, 93%, and 91% for the lenalidomide arm versus 89%, 76%, and 66% for the observation arm, respectively. Only six deaths have been reported, two in the lenalidomide arm versus four in the observation arm (hazard ratio for death, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.08 to 2.53). Grade 3 or 4 nonhematologic adverse events occurred in 25 patients (28%) on lenalidomide. CONCLUSION: Early intervention with lenalidomide in smoldering multiple myeloma significantly delays progression to symptomatic multiple myeloma and the development of end-organ damage. ",
        "Mild Cognitive Impairment and Receipt of Treatments for Acute Myocardial Infarction in Older Adults. BACKGROUND: Older adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) should receive evidence-based treatments when indicated. Providers and patients may overestimate the risk of dementia in patients with MCI leading to potential under-treatment. However, the association between pre-existing MCI and receipt of evidence-based treatments is uncertain. OBJECTIVE: To compare receipt of treatments for acute myocardial infarction (AMI) between older adults with pre-existing MCI and cognitively normal patients. DESIGN: Prospective study using data from the nationally representative Health and Retirement Study, Medicare, and American Hospital Association. PARTICIPANTS: Six hundred nine adults aged 65 or older hospitalized for AMI between 2000 and 2011 and followed through 2012 with pre-existing MCI (defined as modified Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status score of 7-11) and normal cognition (score of 12-27). MAIN MEASURES: Receipt of cardiac catheterization and coronary revascularization within 30\u00a0days and cardiac rehabilitation within 1\u00a0year of AMI hospitalization. KEY RESULTS: Among the survivors of AMI, 19.2% had pre-existing MCI (55.6% were women and 44.4% were male, with a mean [SD] age of 82.3 [7.5]\u00a0years), and 80.8% had normal cognition (45.7% were women and 54.3% were male, with a mean age of 77.1 [7.1]\u00a0years). Survivors of AMI with pre-existing MCI were significantly less likely than those with normal cognition to receive cardiac catheterization (50% vs 77%; P\u2009<\u20090.001), coronary revascularization (29% vs 63%; P\u2009<\u20090.001), and cardiac rehabilitation (9% vs 22%; P\u2009=\u20090.001) after AMI. After adjusting for patient and hospital factors, pre-existing MCI remained associated with lower use of cardiac catheterization (adjusted hazard ratio (aHR), 0.65; 95% CI, 0.48-0.89; P\u2009=\u20090.007) and coronary revascularization (aHR, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.37-0.81; P\u2009=\u2009.003), but not cardiac rehabilitation (aHR, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.49-2.07; P\u2009=\u20090.98). CONCLUSIONS: Pre-existing MCI is associated with lower use of cardiac catheterization and coronary revascularization but not cardiac rehabilitation after AMI. ",
        "Conserved Pseudoknots in lncRNA MEG3 Are Essential for Stimulation of the p53 Pathway. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are key regulatory molecules, but unlike with other RNAs, the direct link between their tertiary structure motifs and their function has proven elusive. Here we report structural and functional studies of human maternally expressed gene 3 (MEG3), a tumor suppressor lncRNA that modulates the p53 response. We found that, in an evolutionary conserved region of MEG3, two distal motifs interact by base complementarity to form alternative, mutually exclusive pseudoknot structures (\"kissing loops\"). Mutations that disrupt these interactions impair MEG3-dependent p53 stimulation in\u00a0vivo and disrupt MEG3 folding in\u00a0vitro. These findings provide mechanistic insights into regulation of the p53 pathway by MEG3 and reveal how conserved motifs of tertiary structure can regulate lncRNA biological function. ",
        "A critique of pure learning and what artificial neural networks can learn from animal brains. Artificial neural networks (ANNs) have undergone a revolution, catalyzed by better supervised learning algorithms. However, in stark contrast to young animals (including humans), training such networks requires enormous numbers of labeled examples, leading to the belief that animals must rely instead mainly on unsupervised learning. Here we argue that most animal behavior is not the result of clever learning algorithms-supervised or unsupervised-but is encoded in the genome. Specifically, animals are born with highly structured brain connectivity, which enables them to learn very rapidly. Because the wiring diagram is far too complex to be specified explicitly in the genome, it must be compressed through a \"genomic bottleneck\". The genomic bottleneck suggests a path toward ANNs capable of rapid learning. ",
        "The MYC Oncogene Cooperates with Sterol-Regulated Element-Binding Protein to Regulate Lipogenesis Essential for Neoplastic Growth. Lipid metabolism is frequently perturbed in cancers, but the underlying mechanism is unclear. We present comprehensive evidence that oncogene MYC, in collaboration with transcription factor sterol-regulated element-binding protein (SREBP1), regulates lipogenesis to promote tumorigenesis. We used human and mouse tumor-derived cell lines, tumor xenografts, and four conditional transgenic mouse models of MYC-induced tumors to show that MYC regulates lipogenesis genes, enzymes, and metabolites. We found that MYC induces SREBP1, and they collaborate to activate fatty acid (FA) synthesis and drive FA chain elongation from glucose and glutamine. Further, by employing desorption electrospray ionization mass spectrometry imaging (DESI-MSI), we observed in\u00a0vivo lipidomic changes upon MYC induction across different cancers, for example, a\u00a0global increase in glycerophosphoglycerols. After inhibition of FA synthesis, tumorigenesis was blocked, and tumors regressed in both xenograft and primary transgenic mouse models, revealing the vulnerability of MYC-induced tumors to the inhibition of lipogenesis.

        "Utilizing the genomically adjusted radiation dose (GARD) to personalize adjuvant radiotherapy in triple negative breast cancer management. BACKGROUND: Utilizing the linear quadratic model and the radiosensitivity index (RSI), we have derived an expression for the genomically adjusted radiation dose (GARD) to model radiation dose effect. We hypothesize GARD is associated with local recurrence and can be used to optimize individual triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) radiation dose. METHODS: TN patients from two independent datasets were assessed. The first cohort consisted of 58 patients treated at 5 European centers with breast conservation surgery followed by adjuvant radiotherapy (RT). The second dataset consisted of 55 patients treated with adjuvant radiation therapy. FINDINGS: In cohort 1, multivariable analysis revealed that as a dichotomous variable (HR: 2.5 95% CI 1-7.1; p\u202f=\u202f.05), GARD was associated with local control. This was confirmed in the second independent dataset where GARD was the only significant factor associated with local control (HR: 4.4 95% CI 1.1-29.5; p\u202f=\u202f.04). We utilized GARD to calculate an individualized radiation dose for each TN patient in cohort 2 by determining the physical dose required to achieve the GARD target value (GARD\u202f\u2265\u202f21). While 7% of patients were optimized with a dose of 30\u202fGy, 91% of patients would be optimized with 70\u202fGy. INTERPRETATION: GARD is associated with local control following whole breast or post-mastectomy radiotherapy (RT) in TN patients. By modeling RT dose effect with GARD, we demonstrate that no single dose is optimal for all patients and propose the first dose range to optimize RT at an individual patient level in TNBC. ",
        "Effects of primary care cost-sharing among young adults: varying impact across income groups and gender. We estimate the price sensitivity in health care among adolescents and young adults, and assess how it varies across income groups and gender, using a regression discontinuity design. We use the age differential cost-sharing in Swedish primary care as our identification strategy. At the 20th birthday, the copayment increases from \u20ac0 to approx. \u20ac10 per primary care physician visit and close to this threshold the copayment faced by each person is distributed almost as good as if randomized. The analysis is performed using high-quality health care and economic register data of 73,000 individuals aged 18-22. Our results show that the copayment decreases the average number of visits by 7%. Among women visits are reduced by 9%, for low-income individuals by 11%, and for low-income women by 14%. In conclusion, modest copayments have significant utilization effects, and even in a policy context with relatively low income\u00a0inequalities, the effect is substantially larger in low-income groups and among women.

        "Cortical reliability amid noise and chaos. Typical responses of cortical neurons to identical sensory stimuli appear highly variable. It has thus been proposed that the cortex primarily uses a rate code. However, other studies have argued for spike-time coding under certain conditions. The potential role of spike-time coding is directly limited by the internally generated variability of cortical circuits, which remains largely unexplored. Here, we quantify this internally generated variability using a biophysical model of rat neocortical microcircuitry with biologically realistic noise sources. We find that stochastic neurotransmitter release is a critical component of internally generated variability, causing rapidly diverging, chaotic recurrent network dynamics. Surprisingly, the same nonlinear recurrent network dynamics can transiently overcome the chaos in response to weak feed-forward thalamocortical inputs, and support reliable spike times with millisecond precision. Our model shows that the noisy and chaotic network dynamics of recurrent cortical microcircuitry are compatible with stimulus-evoked, millisecond spike-time reliability, resolving a long-standing debate.

        "A Microbiome-Based Index for Assessing Skin Health and Treatment Effects for Atopic Dermatitis in Children. A quantitative and objective indicator for skin health via the microbiome is of great interest for personalized skin care, but differences among skin sites and across human populations can make this goal challenging. A three-city (two Chinese and one American) comparison of skin microbiota from atopic dermatitis (AD) and healthy pediatric cohorts revealed that, although city has the greatest effect size (the skin microbiome can predict the originated city with near 100% accuracy), a microbial index of skin health (MiSH) based on 25 bacterial genera can diagnose AD with 83 to \u223c95% accuracy within each city and 86.4% accuracy across cities (area under the concentration-time curve [AUC],\u20090.90). Moreover, nonlesional skin sites across the bodies of AD-active children (which include shank, arm, popliteal fossa, elbow, antecubital fossa, knee, neck, and axilla) harbor a distinct but lesional state-like microbiome that features relative enrichment of Staphylococcus aureus over healthy individuals, confirming the extension of microbiome dysbiosis across body surface in AD patients. Intriguingly, pretreatment MiSH classifies children with identical AD clinical symptoms into two host types with distinct microbial diversity and treatment effects of corticosteroid therapy. These findings suggest that MiSH has the potential to diagnose AD, assess risk-prone state of skin, and predict treatment response in children across human populations.IMPORTANCE MiSH, which is based on the skin microbiome, can quantitatively assess pediatric skin health across cohorts from distinct countries over large geographic distances. Moreover, the index can identify a risk-prone skin state and compare treatment effect in children, suggesting applications in diagnosis and patient stratification. ",
        "Oral antibiotic use and risk of colorectal cancer in the United Kingdom, 1989-2012: a matched case-control study. BACKGROUND: Microbiome dysbiosis predisposes to colorectal cancer (CRC), but a population-based study of oral antibiotic exposure and risk patterns is lacking. OBJECTIVE: To assess the association between oral antibiotic use and CRC risk. DESIGN: A matched case-control study (incident CRC cases and up to five matched controls) was performed using the Clinical Practice Research Datalink from 1989 to 2012. RESULTS: 28 980 CRC cases and 137\u2009077 controls were identified. Oral antibiotic use was associated with CRC risk, but effects differed by anatomical location. Antibiotic use increased the risk of colon cancer in a dose-dependent fashion (ptrend <0.001). The risk was observed after minimal use, and was greatest in the proximal colon and with antibiotics with anti-anaerobic activity. In contrast, an inverse association was detected between antibiotic use and rectal cancers (ptrend=0.003), particularly with length of antibiotic exposure >60 days (adjusted OR (aOR), 0.85, 95%\u2009CI 0.79 to 0.93) as compared with no antibiotic exposure. Penicillins, particularly ampicillin/amoxicillin increased the risk of colon cancer (aOR=1.09 (1.05 to 1.13)), whereas tetracyclines reduced the risk of rectal cancer (aOR=0.90 (0.84 to 0.97)). Significant interactions were detected between antibiotic use and tumour location (colon vs rectum, pinteraction<0.001; proximal colon versus distal colon, pinteraction=0.019). The antibiotic-cancer association was found for antibiotic exposure occurring >10 years before diagnosis (aOR=1.17 (1.06 to 1.31)). CONCLUSION: Oral antibiotic use is associated with an increased risk of colon cancer but a reduced risk of rectal cancer. This effect heterogeneity may suggest differences in gut microbiota and carcinogenesis mechanisms along the lower intestinal tract. ",
        "Use of a Lymphatic Drug Delivery System and Sonoporation to Target Malignant Metastatic Breast Cancer Cells Proliferating in the Marginal Sinuses. Lymph node (LN) metastasis through the lymphatic network is a major route for cancer dissemination. Tumor cells reach the marginal sinuses of LNs via afferent lymphatic vessels (LVs) and form metastatic lesions that lead to distant metastasis. Thus, targeting of metastatic cells in the marginal sinuses could improve cancer treatment outcomes. Here, we investigated whether lymphatic administration of a drug combined with sonoporation could be used to treat a LN containing proliferating murine FM3A breast cancer cells, which are highly invasive, in its marginal sinus. First, we used contrast-enhanced high-frequency ultrasound and histopathology to analyze the structure of LVs in MXH10/Mo-lpr/lpr mice, which exhibit systemic lymphadenopathy. We found that contrast agent injected into the subiliac LN flowed into the marginal sinus of the proper axillary LN (PALN) and reached the cortex. Next, we examined the anti-tumor effects of our proposed technique. We found that a strong anti-tumor effect was achieved by lymphatic administration of doxorubicin and sonoporation. Furthermore, our proposed method prevented tumor cells in the marginal sinus from invading the parenchyma of the PALN and resulted in tumor necrosis. We conclude that lymphatic administration of a drug combined with sonoporation could exert a curative effect in LNs containing metastatic cells in their marginal sinuses. ",

By using a graphene monolayer as a simple model system for condensed organic matter and utilizing slow highly charged ions (HCIs) as projectiles, we highlight the importance of charge exchange alone for LEE emission. We find a large number of ejected electrons resulting from individual ion impacts (up to 80 electrons/ion for Xe40+). More than 90% of emitted electrons have energies well below 15 eV. This \"splash\" of low-energy electrons is interpreted as the consequence of ion deexcitation via an interatomic Coulombic decay (ICD) process. ",
        "Circulating Micronutrient Biomarkers Are Associated With 3 Measures of Frailty: Evidence From the Irish Longitudinal Study on\u00a0Ageing. OBJECTIVES: To examine the associations between 3 frailty instruments and circulating micronutrients in a large representative sample of older adults. DESIGN: Cross-sectional data from a nationally representative cohort study conducted between October 2009 and July\u00a02011. PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: Adults age \u226550\u00a0years (n\u00a0=\u00a04068) living in the community in Ireland. MEASUREMENTS: Circulating micronutrients (lutein, zeaxanthin, folate, vitamin B-12, and vitamin D) were measured, transformed, and standardized. Frailty was assessed using the Frailty Phenotype, the Frailty Index, and the FRAIL Scale (fatigue, resistance, ambulation, illnesses, and loss of weight), instruments. Multinomial logistic regression determined associations between micronutrients and prefrailty or frailty. Models were adjusted for sociodemographic, lifestyle, health, and seasonal factors. RESULTS: Adjusting for age, sex, and educational attainment, all 3 measures of frailty were associated with lower levels of lutein [relative risk ratios (RRRs): 0.43\u20120.63], zeaxanthin (RRRs: 0.49\u20120.63), and vitamin D (RRRs: 0.51\u20120.75), and with the accumulation of micronutrient insufficiencies (RRRs: 1.42\u20121.90). Attenuated but significant associations were also observed with all measures of prefrailty for lutein, vitamin D, and number of micronutrient insufficiencies. The associations with frailty persisted following additional adjustment for social, lifestyle, and health and seasonal factors, and following multiple test correction. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: We have presented the most consistent evidence in the largest study to date that micronutrient concentrations are associated with prefrailty and frailty in older adults. Our data suggest that low micronutrient status has potential as an easily modifiable marker and intervention target for frailty and supports further investigation into micronutrient supplementation and fortification to prevent frailty and disability among older adults.

        "Effects of access barriers and medication acceptability on buprenorphine-naloxone treatment utilization over 2\u202fyears: Results from a multisite randomized trial of adults with opioid use disorder. BACKGROUND: Nationwide efforts seek to address the opioid epidemic by increasing access to medications for opioid use disorder (OUD), particularly with buprenorphine. A poorly understood challenge is that among individuals with OUD who do receive buprenorphine, many do not adhere to the pharmacotherapy long enough to achieve sustained benefits. We aimed to identify factors associated with buprenorphine treatment utilization over time. METHODS: We used random-intercept modeling to identify factors associated with buprenorphine treatment utilization over 2\u202fyears after first follow-up by 789 individuals with OUD who had participated in a multi-site randomized clinical trial of buprenorphine compared to methadone. Key predictors were participants' reports of buprenorphine treatment accessibility and acceptability (assessed at first follow-up) and their interaction effects, controlling for baseline randomization status, sociodemographics, and other covariates. RESULTS: Approximately 9.3-11.2% of participants utilized buprenorphine treatment over the 2\u202fyears of follow-up. Interaction effects indicated that individuals who perceived buprenorphine to be both accessible and acceptable were most likely to use buprenorphine during follow-up, controlling for other factors. In contrast, individuals who perceived buprenorphine to be unacceptable were least likely to use buprenorphine, regardless the level of perceived access to the medication. Buprenorphine treatment utilization was also negatively associated with Hispanic ethnicity, West coast context, and cumulative months receiving methadone treatment and incarceration during follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: To engage more individuals with OUD in long-term treatment with buprenorphine, interventions should target buprenorphine treatment acceptability, in addition to increasing buprenorphine access, and tailor efforts to meet the needs of vulnerable populations. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The START Follow-up Study on ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01592461). ",
        "A trans-ancestral meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies reveals loci associated with childhood obesity. Although hundreds of genome-wide association studies-implicated loci have been reported for adult obesity-related traits, less is known about the genetics specific for early-onset obesity and with only a few studies conducted in non-European populations to date. Searching for additional genetic variants associated with childhood obesity, we performed a trans-ancestral meta-analysis of 30 studies consisting of up to 13\u2009005 cases (\u226595th percentile of body mass index (BMI) achieved 2-18\u00a0years old) and 15\u2009599 controls (consistently <50th percentile of BMI) of European, African, North/South American and East Asian ancestry. Suggestive loci were taken forward for replication in a sample of 1888 cases and 4689 controls from seven cohorts of European and North/South American ancestry. In addition to observing 18 previously implicated BMI or obesity loci, for both early and late onset, we uncovered one completely novel locus in this trans-ancestral analysis (nearest gene, METTL15). The variant was nominally associated with only the European subgroup analysis but had a consistent direction of effect in other ethnicities. We then utilized trans-ancestral Bayesian analysis to narrow down the location of the probable causal variant at each genome-wide significant signal. Of all the fine-mapped loci, we were able to narrow down the causative variant at four known loci to fewer than 10 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (FAIM2, GNPDA2, MC4R and SEC16B loci). In conclusion, an ethnically diverse setting has enabled us to both identify an additional pediatric obesity locus and further fine-map existing loci. ",
        "The aryl hydrocarbon receptor is a tumor suppressor-like gene in glioblastoma. The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) plays an important role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and also in pathophysiology. For example, the interplay between the gut microbiome and microbially derived AhR ligands protects against inflammation along the gut-brain axis. The AhR and its ligands also inhibit colon carcinogenesis, but it has been reported that the AhR and its ligand kynurenine enhance glioblastoma (GBM). In this study, using both established and patient-derived GBM cells, we re-examined the role of kynurenine and the AhR in GBM, observing that kynurenine does not modulate AhR-mediated gene expression and does not affect invasion of GBM cells. Therefore, using an array of approaches, including ChIP, quantitative real-time PCR, and cell migration assays, we primarily focused on investigating the role of the AhR in GBM at the functional molecular and genomic levels. The results of transient and stable CRISPR/Cas9-mediated AhR knockdown in GBM cells indicated that loss of AhR enhances GBM tumor growth in a mouse xenograft model, increases GBM cell invasion, and up-regulates expression of pro-invasion/pro-migration genes, as determined by ingenuity pathway analysis of RNA-Seq data. We conclude that the AhR is a tumor suppressor-like gene in GBM; future studies are required to investigate whether the AhR could be a potential drug target for treating patients with GBM who express this receptor.

        "Chronic E-Cigarette Use Increases Neutrophil Elastase and Matrix Metalloprotease Levels in the Lung. Rationale: Proteolysis is a key aspect of the lung's innate immune system. Proteases, including neutrophil elastase and MMPs (matrix metalloproteases), modulate cell signaling, inflammation, tissue remodeling, and leukocyte recruitment via cleavage of their target proteins. Excessive proteolysis occurs with chronic tobacco use and is causative for bronchiectasis and emphysema. The effect of e-cigarettes (vaping) on proteolysis is unknown. Objectives: We used protease levels as biomarkers of harm to determine the impact of vaping on the lung. Methods: We performed research bronchoscopies on healthy nonsmokers, cigarette smokers, and e-cigarette users (vapers), and determined protease levels in BAL. In parallel, we studied the effects of e-cigarette components on protease secretion in isolated human blood neutrophils and BAL-derived macrophages. We also analyzed the nicotine concentration in induced sputum and BAL. Measurements and Main Results: Neutrophil elastase, MMP-2, and MMP-9 activities and protein levels were equally elevated in both vapers' and smokers' BAL relative to nonsmokers. In contrast, antiprotease levels were unchanged. We also found that exposure of isolated neutrophils and macrophages to nicotine elicited dose-dependent increases in protease release. After vaping, measurable levels of nicotine were detectable in sputum and BAL, which corresponded to the half-maximal effective concentration values for protease release seen in immune cells. Conclusions: We conclude that vaping induces nicotine-dependent protease release from resident pulmonary immune cells. Thus, chronic vaping disrupts the protease-antiprotease balance by increasing proteolysis in lung, which may place vapers at risk of developing chronic lung disease. These data indicate that vaping may not be safer than tobacco smoking. ",
        "Impaired memory-guided attention in asymptomatic APOE4 carriers. Attention and memory may be impaired in individuals at-risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD), though standard cognitive assessments typically study the two in parallel. In reality, attention and memory interact to facilitate information processing, and thus a more integrative approach is required. Here, we used a novel auditory paradigm to assess how long-term memory for auditory scenes facilitates detection of an auditory target in asymptomatic carriers of Apolipoprotein E4 (APOE4), the principle risk gene for late-onset AD. We tested 60 healthy middle-aged adults with varying doses of APOE4 - 20 APOE4 homozygotes (E4/E4), 20 heterozygotes (E3/E4) and 20 non-carriers (E3/E3) - to determine effect on memory-guided attention. While explicit memory was unaffected by genotype, APOE4 dose significantly impaired memory-guided attention. A relationship between explicit memory and memory-guided attention was observed in non-carriers, but this correlation was not significant in E3/E4 and E4/E4 carriers, suggesting that APOE4 carriers rely less on explicit memory to facilitate attention. Since memory-guided attention declined with age in APOE4 homozygotes, this impairment may reflect early disease rather than being a life-long trait. In sum, asymptomatic individuals at increased genetic risk of AD show an age-dependent decline in attention-memory interaction when memory alone is not impaired. ",
        "Relation of post-traumatic stress disorder symptom severity to the efficacy of an animal-assisted intervention for stress reduction after military aeromedical evacuation. Animal-assisted interventions (AAIs) have been found to decrease stress in some settings, but it is not known if AAI is feasible in an aeromedical staging facility or effective in reducing stress following aeromedical evacuation (AE) of military personnel. An experimental design was used to evaluate the efficacy of AAI at reducing stress in AE military patients (N = 120). Patients participated in a 20-min AAI (n = 60) or 20-min informational session about assistance dogs as an attention-control group (n = 60). Demographics, post-traumatic stress symptom severity (PTSSS), and stress biomarkers (cortisol, alpha-amylase, and immunoglobulin A) were collected regular intervals. AAI was found feasible and efficacious at reducing stress. Cortisol decreased significantly (p < .05) in the AAI group compared with the attention-control group. PTSSS moderated the immunoglobulin A responses to AAI as demonstrated by the interaction of PTSD Checklist-Military Version score, group, and time, F(1, 111.23) = 4.15 p = .044; effect size: d = 0.31. This research supports AAI as a stress-reducing modality in AE patients, particularly those who report higher PTSSS. Implications for future research are discussed. ",
        "Tracking progress in mean longevity: The Lagged Cohort Life Expectancy (LCLE) approach. Cohort life expectancy is an important but rarely used indicator of mean longevity. In this paper, we show that there are specific advantages in lagging this indicator in time by its own value, an approach termed Lagged Cohort Life Expectancy (LCLE). We discuss the usefulness of LCLE as an indicator for tracking progress in mean longevity and introduce a new interpretation of LCLE as a reference age separating 'early' deaths from 'late' deaths, or, equivalently, as the age above which individuals in a population can be considered 'above-average' survivors. Using data from 15 countries in the Human Mortality Database, we show that current LCLE can be estimated with a relatively high degree of certainty, at least in these low-mortality populations. Results shed new light on levels and trends in mean longevity in these populations. ",
        "Abnormalities of saccadic eye movements in dementia due to Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment. Background: There is increasing evidence that people in the early stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD) have subtle impairments in cognitive inhibition that can be detected by using relatively simple eye-tracking paradigms, but these subtle impairments are often missed by traditional cognitive assessments. People with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) are at an increased likelihood of dementia due to AD. No study has yet investigated and contrasted the MCI subtypes in relation to eye movement performance. Methods: In this work we explore whether eye-tracking impairments can distinguish between patients with the amnesic and the non-amnesic variants of MCI. Participants were 68 people with dementia due to AD, 42 had a diagnosis of aMCI, and 47 had a diagnosis of naMCI, and 92 age-matched cognitively healthy controls. Results: The findings revealed that eye-tracking can distinguish between the two forms of MCI. Conclusions: The work provides further support for eye-tracking as a useful diagnostic biomarker in the assessment of dementia. ",
        "Excess hydrogen sulfide and polysulfides production underlies a schizophrenia pathophysiology. Mice with the C3H background show greater behavioral propensity for schizophrenia, including lower prepulse inhibition (PPI), than C57BL/6 (B6) mice. To characterize as-yet-unknown pathophysiologies of schizophrenia, we undertook proteomics analysis of the brain in these strains, and detected elevated levels of Mpst, a hydrogen sulfide (H2 S)/polysulfide-producing enzyme, and greater sulfide deposition in C3H than B6 mice. Mpst-deficient mice exhibited improved PPI with reduced storage sulfide levels, while Mpst-transgenic (Tg) mice showed deteriorated PPI, suggesting that \"sulfide stress\" may be linked to PPI impairment. Analysis of human samples demonstrated that the H2 S/polysulfides production system is upregulated in schizophrenia. Mechanistically, the Mpst-Tg brain revealed dampened energy metabolism, while maternal immune activation model mice showed upregulation of genes for H2 S/polysulfides production along with typical antioxidative genes, partly via epigenetic modifications. These results suggest that inflammatory/oxidative insults in early brain development result in upregulated H2 S/polysulfides production as an antioxidative response, which in turn cause deficits in bioenergetic processes. Collectively, this study presents a novel aspect of the neurodevelopmental theory for schizophrenia, unraveling a role of excess H2 S/polysulfides production. ",
        "Multiomics Profiling Establishes the Polypharmacology of FDA-Approved CDK4/6 Inhibitors and the Potential for Differential Clinical Activity. The target profiles of many drugs are established early in their development and are not systematically revisited at the time of FDA approval. Thus, it is often unclear whether therapeutics with the same nominal targets but different chemical structures are functionally equivalent. In this paper we use five different phenotypic and biochemical assays to compare approved inhibitors of cyclin-dependent kinases 4/6-collectively regarded as breakthroughs in the treatment of hormone receptor-positive breast cancer. We find that transcriptional, proteomic, and phenotypic changes induced by palbociclib, ribociclib, and abemaciclib differ significantly; abemaciclib in particular has advantageous activities partially overlapping those of alvocidib, an older polyselective CDK inhibitor. In cells and mice, abemaciclib inhibits kinases other than CDK4/6 including CDK2/cyclin A/E-implicated in resistance to CDK4/6 inhibition-and CDK1/cyclin B. The multifaceted experimental and computational approaches described here therefore uncover underappreciated differences in CDK4/6 inhibitor activities with potential importance in treating human patients.

        "Metabolic Food Waste and Ecological Impact of Obesity in FAO World's Region. Obesity represents a titanic cost for the world's health systems but also a substantial ecological cost to the environment. High energy foods have been shown to be the major contributor to Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions, challenging the diet-environment-health triangle. The waste of resources and the unnecessary ecological cost due to an excessive consumption of foods leading to obesity have been ignored so far. Metabolic Food Waste [MFW(kg of food)] corresponds to the amount of food leading to Excess Body Fat (EBF) and its impact on the environment, expressed as carbon [MFW(kgCO2eq)], water [MFW(\u00d710 L)] and land footprint [MFW(\u00d710 m2)]. We aim to estimate the MFW(kg of food) in the seven FAO regions, Europe (EU), North America and Oceania (NAO), Latin America (LA), Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), Industrialized Asia (IA), North Africa, West and Central Asia (NAWCA) and South and Southeast Asia (SSEA), and evaluate its impact on ecological footprints. The overall impact of MFW(tons of food) in the world corresponds to 140.7 gigatons associated to overweight and obesity. Between the different regions, EU is responsible of the greatest amount of MFW(tons of food) volume (39.2 gigatons), followed by NAO (32.5 gigatons). In terms of ecological impact, EU and NAO displayed the highest values for all three MFW footprints, about 14 times more than SSA. We provide evidence of the enormous amount of food lost through obesity and its ecological impact. Reducing metabolic food waste associated with obesity will contribute in reducing the ecological impact of unbalanced dietary patterns through an improvement of human health. ",
        "GSK3-CRMP2 signaling mediates axonal regeneration induced by Pten knockout. Knockout of phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN-/-) is neuroprotective and promotes axon regeneration in mature neurons. Elevation of mTOR activity in injured neurons has been proposed as the primary underlying mechanism. Here we demonstrate that PTEN-/- also abrogates the inhibitory activity of GSK3 on collapsin response mediator protein 2 (CRMP2) in retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axons. Moreover, maintenance of GSK3 activity in Gsk3.                         S/A.                      knockin mice significantly compromised PTEN-/--mediated optic nerve regeneration as well as the activity of CRMP2, and to a lesser extent, mTOR. These GSK3S/A mediated negative effects on regeneration were rescued by viral expression of constitutively active CRMP2T/A, despite decreased mTOR activation. Gsk3.                         S/A.                      knockin or CRMP2 inhibition also decreased PTEN-/- mediated neurite growth of RGCs in culture and disinhibition towards CNS myelin. Thus, the GSK3/CRMP2 pathway is essential for PTEN-/- mediated axon regeneration. These new mechanistic insights may help to find novel strategies to promote axon regeneration. ",
        "Diagnosis of epithelial ovarian cancer using a combined protein biomarker panel. BACKGROUND: An early detection tool for EOC was constructed from analysis of biomarker expression data from serum collected during the UKCTOCS. METHODS: This study included 49 EOC cases (19 Type I and 30 Type II) and 31 controls, representing 482 serial samples spanning seven years pre-diagnosis. A logit model was trained by analysis of dysregulation of expression data of four putative biomarkers, (CA125, phosphatidylcholine-sterol acyltransferase, vitamin K-dependent protein Z and C-reactive protein); by scoring the specificity associated with dysregulation from the baseline expression for each individual. RESULTS: The model is discriminatory, passes k-fold and leave-one-out cross-validations and was further validated in a Type I EOC set. Samples were analysed as a simulated annual screening programme, the algorithm diagnosed cases with >30% PPV 1-2 years pre-diagnosis. For Type II cases (~80% were HGS) the algorithm classified 64% at 1 year and 28% at 2 years tDx as severe. CONCLUSIONS: The panel has the potential to diagnose EOC one-two years earlier than current diagnosis. This analysis provides a tangible worked example demonstrating the potential for development as a screening tool and scrutiny of its properties. Limits on interpretation imposed by the number of samples available are discussed. ",
        "A Yap-Myc-Sox2-p53 Regulatory Network Dictates Metabolic Homeostasis and Differentiation in Kras-Driven Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinomas. Employing inducible genetically engineered and orthotopic mouse models, we demonstrate a key role for transcriptional regulator Yap in maintenance of Kras-mutant pancreatic tumors. Integrated transcriptional and metabolomics analysis reveals that Yap transcribes Myc and cooperates with Myc to maintain global transcription of metabolic genes. Yap loss triggers acute metabolic stress, which causes tumor regression while inducing epigenetic reprogramming and Sox2 upregulation in a subset of pancreatic neoplastic cells. Sox2 restores Myc expression and metabolic homeostasis in Yap-deficient neoplastic ductal cells, which gradually re-differentiate into acinar-like cells, partially restoring pancreatic parenchyma in\u00a0vivo. Both the short-term and long-term effects of Yap loss in inducing cell death and re-differentiation, respectively, are blunted in advanced, poorly differentiated p53-mutant pancreatic tumors. Collectively, these findings reveal a highly dynamic and interdependent metabolic, transcriptional, and epigenetic regulatory network governed by Yap, Myc, Sox2, and p53 that dictates pancreatic tumor metabolism, growth, survival, and differentiation.

        "Structural Basis for Allosteric Ligand Recognition in the Human CC Chemokine Receptor 7. The CC chemokine receptor 7 (CCR7) balances immunity and tolerance by homeostatic trafficking of immune cells. In cancer, CCR7-mediated trafficking leads to lymph node metastasis, suggesting the receptor as a promising therapeutic target. Here, we present the crystal structure of human CCR7 fused to the protein Sialidase NanA by using data up to 2.1\u00a0\u00c5 resolution. The structure shows the ligand Cmp2105 bound to an intracellular allosteric binding pocket. A sulfonamide group, characteristic for various chemokine receptor ligands, binds to a patch of conserved residues in the Gi protein binding region between transmembrane helix 7 and helix 8. We demonstrate how structural data can be used in combination with a compound repository and automated thermal stability screening to identify and modulate allosteric chemokine receptor antagonists. We detect both novel (CS-1 and CS-2) and clinically relevant (CXCR1-CXCR2 phase-II antagonist Navarixin) CCR7 modulators with implications for multi-target strategies against cancer. ",
        "PPM1D mutations silence NAPRT gene\u00a0expression and confer NAMPT inhibitor sensitivity in glioma. Pediatric high-grade gliomas are among the deadliest of childhood cancers due to limited knowledge of early driving events in their gliomagenesis and the lack of effective therapies available. In this study, we investigate the oncogenic role of PPM1D, a protein phosphatase often found truncated in pediatric gliomas such as DIPG, and uncover a synthetic lethal interaction between PPM1D mutations and nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT) inhibition. Specifically, we show that mutant PPM1D drives hypermethylation of CpG islands throughout the genome and promotes epigenetic silencing of nicotinic acid phosphoribosyltransferase (NAPRT), a key gene involved in NAD biosynthesis. Notably, PPM1D mutant cells are shown to be sensitive to NAMPT inhibitors in vitro and in vivo, within both engineered isogenic astrocytes and primary patient-derived model systems, suggesting the possible application of NAMPT inhibitors for the treatment of pediatric gliomas. Overall, our results reveal a promising approach for the targeting of PPM1D mutant tumors, and define a critical link between oncogenic driver mutations and NAD metabolism, which can be exploited for tumor-specific cell killing.

        "Major subpopulations of Plasmodium falciparum in sub-Saharan Africa. Understanding genomic variation and population structure of Plasmodium falciparum across Africa is necessary to sustain progress toward malaria elimination. Genome clustering of 2263 P. falciparum isolates from 24 malaria-endemic settings in 15 African countries identified major western, central, and eastern ancestries, plus a highly divergent Ethiopian population. Ancestry aligned to these regional blocs, overlapping with both the parasite's origin and with historical human migration. The parasite populations are interbred and shared genomic haplotypes, especially across drug resistance loci, which showed the strongest recent identity-by-descent between populations. A recent signature of selection on chromosome 12 with candidate resistance loci against artemisinin derivatives was evident in Ghana and Malawi. Such selection and the emerging substructure may affect treatment-based intervention strategies against P. falciparum malaria. ",
        "Performance in candidates declaring versus those not declaring dyslexia in a licensing clinical examination. CONTEXT: High-stakes medical examinations seek to be fair to all candidates, including an increasing proportion of trainee doctors with specific learning differences. We aimed to investigate the performance of doctors declaring dyslexia in the clinical skills assessment (CSA), an objective structured clinical examination for licensing UK general practitioners. METHODS: We employed a cross-sectional design using performance and attribute data from candidates taking the CSA between 2010 and 2017. We compared candidates who declared dyslexia ('early' before their first attempt or 'late' after failing at least once) with those who did not, using multivariable negative binomial regression investigating the effect of declaring dyslexia on passing the CSA, accounting for relevant factors previously associated with performance, including number of attempts, initial score, sex, place of primary medical qualification and ethnicity. RESULTS: Of 20\u00a0879 CSA candidates, 598 (2.9%) declared that they had dyslexia. Candidates declaring dyslexia were more likely to be male (47.3% versus 37.8%; p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and to have a non-UK primary medical qualification (26.9% versus 22.4%; p\u00a0<\u00a00.01), but were no different in ethnicity compared with those who never declared dyslexia. Candidates who declared dyslexia late were significantly more likely to fail compared with those candidates who declared dyslexia early (40.6% versus 9.2%; p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and were more likely to have a non-UK medical qualification (79.3% versus 15.6%; p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) or come from a minority ethnic group (84.9% versus 39.2%; p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). The chance of passing was lower for candidates declaring dyslexia compared to those who never declared dyslexia and lower in those declaring late (incident rate ratio [IRR], 0.82; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.70-0.96) compared with those declaring early (IRR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.93-0.97). CONCLUSIONS: A small proportion of candidates declaring dyslexia were less likely to pass the CSA, particularly if dyslexia was declared late. Further investigation of potential causes and solutions is needed. ",
        "Truckies' Nutrition and Physical Activity: A Cross-sectional Survey in Queensland, Australia. Truck drivers are at increased risk of diet- and physical activity-related chronic diseases. Despite this, there is a paucity of data about Australian truck drivers' diet and physical activity behaviors. A multiple choice and short response survey was distributed to truck drivers attending an Australian Truck Show. The survey asked about self-reported health, source of health information, number of serves of fruit, vegetables, unhealthy food, and sugary drink consumed per day, and frequency of moderate- and vigorous-intensity physical activity per week. The survey was completed by 231 truck drivers---almost all were male, with a mean age of 46 (range 20 to 71) years. Over 85% of survey respondents worked more than 9 hrs per day. Nearly 75% acknowledged the need to make changes to improve their health. Half consumed fewer serves of fruit and 88% consumed fewer serves of vegetables than national recommendations. Over 63% consumed at least one serve of unhealthy foods per day, and 65% drank at least one can of sugary drink per day. Most (80%) undertook less than moderate- and vigorous-intensity physical activity levels provided in national recommendations. Of concern, almost 90% of drivers had above the recommended body mass index---approximately 60% were obese. This is almost double the proportion found in the general population. These findings highlight the importance of health promotion to help drivers make better choices about their health behaviors, which are often underpinned by the limitations of their work environment. Health promotion in transport industry workplaces should be an important topic for future research. ",
        "The Influence of Smoking Status on the Health Profiles of Older Chinese American Men. OBJECTIVE: To examine the influence of smoking status on the health profiles of community-dwelling older Chinese American men in the greater Chicago, IL, area. DESIGN: This study utilized a cross-sectional study design to analyze data obtained from the larger Population Study of Chinese Elderly in Chicago (PINE). SETTING: A population-based study conducted in Chicago. PARTICIPANTS: Baseline data from Chinese American men who participated in PINE (N\u2009=\u20091492). MEASURES: Demographic characteristics measured included age, education years, marital status, income, health insurance coverage, and smoking pack-years. Self-reported smoking status included never smoker, current smoker, and former smoker. Health profile indicators included perceived health status, past 12-month changes in health, chronic medical conditions (heart diseases, stroke, cancer, diabetes, hypertension, high cholesterol, thyroid disease, and osteoarthritis), quality of life, and depression and anxiety. RESULTS: The mean age of the study sample was 72.5 years. Of the sample, 65% reported a smoking history, with 25.1% current smokers and 40.1% former smokers. Current smokers were younger, less educated, and uninsured. Former smokers had the poorest overall health profiles. Compared to former smokers, current smokers were less likely to have heart disease (odds ratio [OR]\u2009=\u20090.59; 95% confidence interval [CI]\u2009=\u20090.39-0.90), hypertension (OR\u2009=\u20090.54; 95% CI\u2009=\u20090.41-0.72), high cholesterol (OR\u2009=\u20090.74; 95% CI\u2009=\u20090.56-0.99), thyroid disease (OR\u2009=\u20090.44; 95% CI\u2009=\u20090.21-0.90), depression (rate ratio [RR]\u2009=\u20090.76; 95% CI\u2009=\u20090.58-0.99), and anxiety (RR\u2009=\u20090.72; 95% CI\u2009=\u20090.59-0.89), and they had fewer overall chronic medical conditions (RR\u2009=\u20090.79; 95% CI\u2009=\u20090.70-0.88) after controlling for demographic factors and smoking pack-year history. Compared to never smokers, former and current smokers reported poorer self-rated health (OR\u2009=\u20091.58; 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.11-2.26) and lower perceived quality of life (OR\u2009=\u20092.11; 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.04-4.29). CONCLUSIONS: Consistent with prior research, smoking rates were elevated among this sample of older Chinese men. Counter to study hypotheses, former smokers had worse overall health.

Patients with increased liver stiffness have a higher risk of developing cancer, however, the role of fluid-solid tissue interactions and their contribution to liver tumor malignancy remains elusive. Tomoelastography is a novel imaging method for mapping quantitatively the solid-fluid tissue properties of soft tissues in vivo. It provides high resolution and thus has clear clinical applications. In this work we used tomoelastography in 77 participants, with a total of 141 focal liver lesions of different etiologies, to investigate the contributions of tissue stiffness and fluidity to the malignancy of liver tumors. Shear-wave speed (c) as surrogate for tissue stiffness and phase-angle (\u03c6) of the complex shear modulus reflecting tissue fluidity were abnormally high in malignant tumors and allowed them to be distinguished from nontumorous liver tissue with high accuracy [c: AUC = 0.88 with 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.83-0.94; \u03c6: AUC = 0.95, 95% CI = 0.92-0.98]. Benign focal nodular hyperplasia and hepatocellular adenoma could be distinguished from malignant lesions on the basis of tumor stiffness (AUC = 0.85, 95% CI = 0.72-0.98; sensitivity = 94%, 95% CI = 89-100; and specificity = 85%, 95% CI = 62-100), tumor fluidity (AUC = 0.86, 95% CI = 0.77-0.96; sensitivity = 83%, 95% CI = 72-93; and specificity = 92%, 95% CI = 77-100) and liver stiffness (AUC = 0.84, 95% CI = 0.74-0.94; sensitivity = 72%, 95% CI = 59-83; and specificity = 88%, 95% CI = 69-100), but not on the basis of liver fluidity. Together, hepatic malignancies are characterized by stiff, yet fluid tissue properties, whereas surrounding nontumorous tissue is dominated by solid properties. Tomoelastography can inform noninvasively on the malignancy of suspicious liver lesions by differentiating between benign and malignant lesions with high sensitivity based on stiffness and with high specificity based on fluidity. SIGNIFICANCE: Solid-fluid tissue properties measured by tomoelastography can distinguish malignant from benign masses with high accuracy and provide quantitative noninvasive imaging biomarkers for liver tumors.

        "Genotype-by-environment interactions inferred from genetic effects on phenotypic variability in the UK Biobank. Genotype-by-environment interaction (GEI) is a fundamental component in understanding complex trait variation. However, it remains challenging to identify genetic variants with GEI effects in humans largely because of the small effect sizes and the difficulty of monitoring environmental fluctuations. Here, we demonstrate that GEI can be inferred from genetic variants associated with phenotypic variability in a large sample without the need of measuring environmental factors. We performed a genome-wide variance quantitative trait locus (vQTL) analysis of ~5.6 million variants on 348,501 unrelated individuals of European ancestry for 13 quantitative traits in the UK Biobank and identified 75 significant vQTLs with P < 2.0 \u00d7 10-9 for 9 traits, especially for those related to obesity. Direct GEI analysis with five environmental factors showed that the vQTLs were strongly enriched with GEI effects. Our results indicate pervasive GEI effects for obesity-related traits and demonstrate the detection of GEI without environmental data. ",
        "Impairments in remote memory caused by the lack of Type 2 IP3 receptors. The second messenger inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3 ) is paramount for signal transduction in biological cells, mediating Ca2+ release from the endoplasmic reticulum. Of the three isoforms of IP3 receptors identified in the nervous system, Type 2 (IP3 R2) is the main isoform expressed by astrocytes. The complete lack of IP3 R2 in transgenic mice was shown to significantly disrupt Ca2+ signaling in astrocytes, while leaving neuronal intracellular pathways virtually unperturbed. Whether and how this predominantly nonneuronal receptor might affect long-term memory function has been a matter of intense debate. In this work, we found that the absence of IP3 R2-mediated signaling did not disrupt normal learning or recent (24-48\u2009h) memory. Contrary to expectations, however, mice lacking IP3 R2 exhibited remote (2-4 weeks) memory deficits. Not only did the lack of IP3 R2 impair remote recognition, fear, and spatial memories, but it also prevented naturally occurring post-encoding memory enhancements consequent to memory consolidation. Consistent with the key role played by the downscaling of synaptic transmission in memory consolidation, we found that NMDAR-dependent long-term depression was abnormal in ex vivo hippocampal slices acutely prepared from IP3 R2-deficient mice, a deficit that could be prevented upon supplementation with D-serine - an NMDA-receptor co-agonist whose synthesis depends upon astrocytes' activity. Our results reveal that IP3 R2 activation, which in the brain is paramount for Ca2+ signaling in astrocytes, but not in neurons, can help shape brain plasticity by enhancing the consolidation of newly acquired information into long-term memories that can guide remote cognitive behaviors.

        "Thermally Processed Oil Exaggerates Colonic Inflammation and Colitis-Associated Colon Tumorigenesis in Mice. Frying in vegetable oil is a popular cooking and food processing method worldwide; as a result, the oils used for frying are widely consumed by the general public and it is of practical importance to better understand their health impacts. To date, the effects of frying oil consumption on human health are inconclusive, making it difficult to establish dietary recommendations or guidelines. Here we show that dietary administration of frying oil, which was prepared under the conditions of good commercial practice, exaggerated dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis and azoxymethane (AOM)/DSS-induced colon tumorigenesis in mice. In addition, dietary administration of frying oil impaired intestinal barrier function, enhanced translocation of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and bacteria from the gut into the systemic circulation, and increased tissue inflammation. Finally, to explore the potential compounds involved in the actions of the frying oil, we isolated polar compounds from the frying oil and found that administration of the polar compounds exacerbated DSS-induced colitis in mice. Together, our results showed that dietary administration of frying oil exaggerated development of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and IBD-associated colon tumorigenesis in mice, and these effects could be mediated by the polar compounds in the frying oil.

        "Mucosal Vaccination with a Self-Adjuvanted Lipopeptide Is Immunogenic and Protective against Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Tuberculosis (TB) remains a staggering burden on global public health. Novel preventative tools are desperately needed to reach the targets of the WHO post-2015 End-TB Strategy. Peptide or protein-based subunit vaccines offer potential as safe and effective generators of protection, and enhancement of local pulmonary immunity may be achieved by mucosal delivery. We describe the synthesis of a novel subunit vaccine via native chemical ligation. Two immunogenic epitopes, ESAT61-20 and TB10.43-11 from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), were covalently conjugated to the TLR2-ligand Pam2Cys to generate a self-adjuvanting lipopeptide vaccine. When administered mucosally to mice, the vaccine enhanced pulmonary immunogenicity, inducing strong Th17 responses in the lungs and multifunctional peripheral T-lymphocytes. Mucosal, but not peripheral vaccination, provided substantial protection against Mtb infection, emphasizing the importance of delivery route for optimal efficacy. ",
        "Dipeptidase-1 Is an Adhesion Receptor for Neutrophil Recruitment in Lungs and Liver. A hallmark feature of inflammation is the orchestrated recruitment of neutrophils from the bloodstream into inflamed tissue. Although selectins and integrins mediate recruitment in many tissues, they have a minimal role in the lungs and liver. Exploiting an unbiased in\u00a0vivo functional screen, we identified a lung and liver homing peptide that functionally abrogates neutrophil recruitment to these organs. Using biochemical, genetic, and confocal intravital imaging approaches, we identified dipeptidase-1 (DPEP1) as the target and established its role as a physical adhesion receptor for neutrophil sequestration independent of its enzymatic activity. Importantly, genetic ablation or functional peptide blocking of DPEP1 significantly reduced neutrophil recruitment to the lungs and liver and provided improved survival in models of endotoxemia. Our data establish DPEP1 as a major adhesion receptor on the lung and liver endothelium and identify a therapeutic target for neutrophil-driven inflammatory diseases of the lungs. ",
        "Horizontal gene transfer overrides mutation in Escherichia coli colonizing the mammalian gut. Bacteria evolve by mutation accumulation in laboratory experiments, but tempo and mode of evolution in natural environments are largely unknown. Here, we study the ubiquitous natural process of host colonization by commensal bacteria. We show, by experimental evolution of Escherichia coli in the mouse intestine, that the ecology of the gut controls the pace and mode of evolution of a new invading bacterial strain. If a resident E. coli strain is present in the gut, the invading strain evolves by rapid horizontal gene transfer (HGT), which precedes and outweighs evolution by accumulation of mutations. HGT is driven by 2 bacteriophages carried by the resident strain, which cause an epidemic phage infection of the invader. These dynamics are followed by subsequent evolution by clonal interference of genetically diverse lineages of phage-carrying (lysogenic) bacteria. We show that the genes uptaken by HGT enhance the metabolism of specific gut carbon sources and provide a fitness advantage to lysogenic invader lineages. A minimal dynamical model explains the temporal pattern of phage epidemics and the complex evolutionary outcome of phage-mediated selection. We conclude that phage-driven HGT is a key eco-evolutionary driving force of gut colonization-it accelerates evolution and promotes genetic diversity of commensal bacteria. ",
        "Simulation Prepares an Interprofessional Team to Evacuate a 60-Bed Level 4 Neonatal Intensive Care Unit. In August 2011, a 5.8 magnitude earthquake struck the Baltimore/Washington, District of Columbia, corridor. The event identified a critical requirement to prepare our interprofessional team to evacuate approximately 60 neonatal patients. A needs assessment indicated that 60% of staff members had little or no knowledge of the unit's evacuation plan and 55% of respondents were not aware of their specific role in an emergency evacuation. The neonatal intensive care unit educators in collaboration with the unit's medical team, the leadership team, the hospital emergency management team, and the unit practice and professional council coordinated the design, implementation, and assessment of the simulated evacuation activity. To encourage realism within the simulated activity, prepared manikins were placed in patient rooms and assigned varying levels of acuity. The training session began with a prebrief session that included a description of the evacuation plan, delineation of roles, responsibilities based on scope of practice, use of the evacuation equipment, and unit emergency bags. Participants engaged in a debrief session following each session during which the staff notably expressed an increased confidence with the evacuation plan, roles, and operation of the evacuation equipment. In addition, the debriefing allowed for identification of latent threats, which the planning group used to streamline the evacuation process. ",
        "Adult mortality in sub-Saharan Africa: cross-sectional study of causes of death in Zambia. OBJECTIVE: To describe the age-sex pattern and socio-economic differentials in causes of death among adults between the ages of 15 and 59\u00a0years in Zambia. METHODS: Using data from the 2010-2012 Zambia sample vital registration with verbal autopsy survey, we calculated the percentage share of causes of death, the age-/sex cause-specific death ratio and cause-eliminated life expectancy at age 15. RESULTS: HIV/AIDS was the leading cause of death across all socio-economic subgroups contributing 40.7% of total deaths during the study period. This was followed by deaths due to injury and accidents (11.2%). Cause-specific death ratios due to HIV/AIDS increased by age and peaked in the 35-39 age group and were higher among females than males. The second-leading cause of death was injuries and accidents for males and tuberculosis for females. The third-leading cause of death was cardiovascular diseases for females and tuberculosis for males. Cause of death patterns varied notably by socio-economic characteristics. Deaths attributable to non-communicable diseases were more evident in adults aged 45-59\u00a0years. Eliminating HIV/AIDS in Zambia as a cause of death could raise life expectancy at age 15 by 5.7\u00a0years for males and by 6.4\u00a0years for females. CONCLUSION: HIV/AIDS-related health programmes and interventions should be further supported and strengthened, as they would significantly contribute to the reduction in adult mortality in Zambia. ",
        "Antibiotic use and the risk of rheumatoid arthritis: a population-based case-control study. BACKGROUND: Antibiotic-induced disturbances of the human microbiota have been implicated in the development of chronic autoimmune conditions. This study aimed to assess whether antibiotic use is associated with the onset of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). METHODS: A nested case-control study was conducted utilising data from the primary care Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD). Patients with an incident diagnosis of RA were identified (1995-2017). Each case was matched on age, gender, and general practice to \u2265\u20095 controls without RA. Conditional logistic regression was used to examine previous antibiotic prescriptions and RA onset after controlling for confounding factors. RESULTS: We identified 22,677 cases of RA, matched to 90,013 controls, with a median follow-up of 10\u2009years before RA diagnosis. The odds of developing RA were 60% higher in those exposed to antibiotics than in those not exposed (OR 1.60; 95% CI 1.51-1.68). A dose- or frequency-dependent association was observed between the number of previous antibiotic prescriptions and RA. All classes of antibiotics were associated with higher odds of RA, with bactericidal antibiotics carrying higher risk than bacteriostatic (45% vs. 31%). Those with antibiotic-treated upper respiratory tract (URT) infections were more likely to be RA cases. However, this was not observed for URT infections not treated with antibiotics. Antifungal (OR\u2009=\u20091.27; 95% CI 1.20-1.35) and antiviral (OR\u2009=\u20091.19; 95% CI 1.14-1.24) prescriptions were also associated with increased odds of RA. CONCLUSION: Antibiotic prescriptions are associated with a higher risk of RA. This may be due to microbiota disturbances or underlying infections driving risk. Further research is needed to explore these mechanisms. ",
        "Multi-platform Approach for Microbial Biomarker Identification Using Borrelia burgdorferi as a Model. The identification of microbial biomarkers is critical for the diagnosis of a disease early during infection. However, the identification of reliable biomarkers is often hampered by a low concentration of microbes or biomarkers within host fluids or tissues. We have outlined a multi-platform strategy to assess microbial biomarkers that can be consistently detected in host samples, using Borrelia burgdorferi, the causative agent of Lyme disease, as an example. Key aspects of the strategy include the selection of a macaque model of human disease, in vivo Microbial Antigen Discovery (InMAD), and proteomic methods that include microbial biomarker enrichment within samples to identify secreted proteins circulating during infection. Using the described strategy, we have identified 6 biomarkers from multiple samples. In addition, the temporal antibody response to select bacterial antigens was mapped. By integrating biomarkers identified from early infection with temporal patterns of expression, the described platform allows for the data driven selection of diagnostic targets. ",
        "Obesity and tooth wear among American adults: the role of sugar-sweetened acidic drinks. BACKGROUND: To explore the association between obesity and tooth wear among American adults and the role of sugar-sweetened acidic drinks consumption in explaining that association. METHODS: We analyzed data from 3541 adult participants in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Obesity was determined using the body mass index and tooth wear was assessed using the modified tooth wear index. Daily intake of four categories of drinks was estimated as the average (drinks/day) of two consecutive 24-h dietary recalls. The association between obesity and number of surfaces with moderate-to-severe tooth wear was assessed in hurdle models adjusting for sociodemographic factors, acid reflux medication, and dental insurance. RESULTS: Overweight and obese adults had more surfaces with moderate-to-severe tooth wear than those with normal body size, after adjusting for confounders. The consumption of sugar-sweetened acidic drinks explained part, but not all the above association. More specifically, the estimate for obesity was fully attenuated, whereas the estimate for overweight was slightly attenuated but remained significant. CONCLUSION: Obesity was positively associated with tooth wear in American adults. This association was only partially accounted for by the consumption of sugar-sweetened acidic drinks, a common risk factor for both conditions. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: Dentists must be aware of the health consequences of sugar-sweetened acidic drinks and advocate for reduction in consumption and/or substitution with healthier alternatives.

        "The effect of trust and proximity on vaccine propensity. The main goal of this paper is to study the effects of (1) trust in government medical experts and (2) proximity to a recent disease outbreak on vaccine propensity. More specifically, we explore how these variables affect attitudes with regards to measles. Using original survey data, collected in January/February 2017, we obtain three main empirical findings. First, contrary to our expectations, an individual's proximity to a recent measles outbreak has no independent effect on vaccination attitudes. Second, corroborating previous studies in the field, we find that trust in institutions such as the CDC has a positive effect on our dependent variable. Third, there is a significant interactive relationship between proximity and trust in governmental medical experts. While distance from a previous measles outbreak has no effect on vaccination attitudes for respondents with medium or high levels of trust, the variable exerts a negative effect for subjects with little confidence in government medical experts. In other words: low-trust individuals who live farther away from a recent measles outbreak harbor less favorable views about vaccination for this particular disease than low-trust respondents who live close to an affected area. This implies that citizens who are skeptical of the CDC and similar institutions base their vaccination decision-making to some degree on whether or not a given disease occurs in close vicinity to their community.

        "Mindfulness training reduces stress and amygdala reactivity to fearful faces in middle-school children. The impact of mindfulness training on stress and associated brain plasticity has been shown in adults, whereas the impact of such training in the developing brain remains unknown. To address this open question, 40 middle-school children were randomized to either mindfulness or coding training (active control) interventions during the school day for eight weeks. Outcome measures were ratings of self-perceived stress and right amygdala activation while viewing fearful, happy, and neutral facial expressions during functional MRI. Prior to intervention, greater stress correlated with greater right amygdala activation in response to fearful versus neutral facial expressions across all children. After intervention, children who received mindfulness training reported lower stress associated with reduced right amygdala activation to fearful faces relative to children in the control condition. Amygdala responses to happy faces were unrelated to either initial stress or mindfulness reduction of stress. Moreover, mindfulness training led to relatively stronger functional connectivity between the right amygdala and ventromedial prefrontal cortex during the viewing of fearful facial expressions. Changes in perceived stress and neuroplasticity occurred in nonmeditative states, indicating that the benefits of mindfulness training generalized beyond the active meditative state. This study provides initial evidence that mindfulness training in children reduces stress and promotes functional brain changes and that such training can be integrated into the school curriculum for entire classes. This study also reveals first evidence that a neurocognitive mechanism for both stress and its reduction by mindfulness training is related specifically to reduced amygdala responses to negative stimuli.

        "Volumetric Bioprinting of Complex Living-Tissue Constructs within Seconds. Biofabrication technologies, including stereolithography and extrusion-based printing, are revolutionizing the creation of complex engineered tissues. The current paradigm in bioprinting relies on the additive layer-by-layer deposition and assembly of repetitive building blocks, typically cell-laden hydrogel fibers or voxels, single cells, or cellular aggregates. The scalability of these additive manufacturing technologies is limited by their printing velocity, as lengthy biofabrication processes impair cell functionality. Overcoming such limitations, the volumetric bioprinting of clinically relevant sized, anatomically shaped constructs, in a time frame ranging from seconds to tens of seconds is described. An optical-tomography-inspired printing approach, based on visible light projection, is developed to generate cell-laden tissue constructs with high viability (>85%) from gelatin-based photoresponsive hydrogels. Free-form architectures, difficult to reproduce with conventional printing, are obtained, including anatomically correct trabecular bone models with embedded angiogenic sprouts and meniscal grafts. The latter undergoes maturation in vitro as the bioprinted chondroprogenitor cells synthesize neo-fibrocartilage matrix. Moreover, free-floating structures are generated, as demonstrated by printing functional hydrogel-based ball-and-cage fluidic valves. Volumetric bioprinting permits the creation of geometrically complex, centimeter-scale constructs at an unprecedented printing velocity, opening new avenues for upscaling the production of hydrogel-based constructs and for their application in tissue engineering, regenerative medicine, and soft robotics.

        "Measurement of Patients' Perceptions of the Quality of Acute Stroke Services: Development and Validation of the STROKE Perception Report. INTRODUCTION: Patients' perceptions of healthcare quality have become an important part of quality measurement. We explored patients' and family's lived experiences during acute stroke hospitalization to develop a quantitative instrument. METHODS: Focus groups were conducted using open-ended scripted questions. Interview data were coded and analyzed using an inductive approach to thematic analysis. Symmetric patient and family instruments were developed based on qualitative domains and serially refined to a set of 30 survey items, 12 stroke knowledge test items, and 5 subject demographic fields. Scales were evaluated for internal consistency reliability using Cronbach \u03b1; construct validity with exploratory factor analysis using principal components with varimax rotation was performed to determine the extent to which items in a scale measure the same underlying factor. Feasibility of an electronic cloud-based survey was also tested. RESULTS: Three main themes emerged: fast action to diagnose and treat stroke, genuine caring, and education to prevent and respond to stroke. A total of 1029 subjects completed the final instrument with no differences in perception found by race, ethnicity, or length of stay. Scales showed satisfactory internal consistency reliability (Cronbach \u03b1 scores, .89-.94); factor loadings across each scale ranged from 0.55 to 0.87. Data entry by electronic pad was perceived by 77% to be more confidential than paper surveys; median score for difficulty was 4 (\"easy to use\"). CONCLUSION: The STROKE Perception Report enables understanding of patients' and family's beliefs about the quality of acute stroke care in essential new domains never explored before. ",
        "The sonic instructor: A music-based biofeedback system for improving weightlifting technique. In this study, we assumed that correct functional movements for weightlifting can be learned with the help of a music-based biofeedback system. We compared musical feedback with verbal feedback from experienced trainers using two independent groups. The focus was on one specific movement called deadlift. Physical parameters under considerations were the spine (i.e. loss of midline stability resulting in flexion) and the forward displacement of the barbell during the repetitions relative to the mid-foot. We recruited 31 recreational weight lifters (21-42 years of age). Results revealed that both feedback types are effective in improving the movements for deadlift. No significant differences were found across the two feedback types, neither in terms of movement, nor in terms of clarity and motivation. The results suggest that the proposed feedback system is a valid tool for technology-aided training and self-training practices. ",
        "MDSC targeting with Gemtuzumab ozogamicin restores T cell immunity and immunotherapy against cancers. BACKGROUND: Targeting of MDSCs is a major clinical challenge in the era of immunotherapy. Antibodies which deplete MDSCs in murine models can reactivate T cell responses. In humans such approaches have not developed due to difficulties in identifying targets amenable to clinical translation. METHODS: RNA-sequencing of M-MDSCs and G-MDSCs from cancer patients was undertaken. Flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry of blood and tumours determined MDSC CD33 expression. MDSCs were treated with Gemtuzumab ozogamicin and internalisation kinetics, and cell death mechanisms determined by flow cytometry, confocal microscopy and electron microscopy. Effects on T cell proliferation and CAR-T cell anti-tumour cytotoxicity were identified in the presence of Gemtuzumab ozogamicin. FINDINGS: RNA-sequencing of human M-MDSCs and G-MDSCs identified transcriptomic differences, but that CD33 is a common surface marker. Flow cytometry indicated CD33 expression is higher on M-MDSCs, and CD33+ MDSCs are found in the blood and tumours regardless of cancer subtype. Treatment of human MDSCs leads to Gemtuzumab ozogamicin internalisation, increased p-ATM, and cell death; restoring T cell proliferation. Anti-GD2-/mesothelin-/EGFRvIII-CAR-T cell activity is enhanced in combination with the anti-MDSC effects of Gemtuzumab ozogamicin. INTERPRETATION: The study identifies that M-MDSCs and G-MDSCs are transcriptomically different but CD33 is a therapeutic target on peripheral and infiltrating MDSCs across cancer subtypes. The immunotoxin Gemtuzumab ozogamicin can deplete MDSCs providing a translational approach to reactivate T cell and CAR-T cell responses against multiple cancers. In the rare conditions of HLH/MAS gemtuzumab ozogamicin provides a novel anti-myeloid strategy.

        "Precise in vivo genome editing via single homology arm donor mediated intron-targeting gene integration for genetic disease correction. In vivo genome editing represents a powerful strategy for both understanding basic biology and treating inherited diseases. However, it remains a challenge to develop universal and efficient in vivo genome-editing tools for tissues that comprise diverse cell types in either a dividing or non-dividing state. Here, we describe a versatile in vivo gene knock-in methodology that enables the targeting of a broad range of mutations and cell types through the insertion of a minigene at an intron of the target gene locus using an intracellularly linearized single homology arm donor. As\u00a0a proof-of-concept, we focused on a mouse model of premature-aging caused by a dominant point mutation, which is difficult to repair using existing in vivo genome-editing tools. Systemic treatment using our new method ameliorated aging-associated phenotypes and extended animal lifespan, thus highlighting the potential of this methodology for a broad range of in vivo genome-editing applications.

The Malaria Cell Atlas provides both a comprehensive view of gene usage in a eukaryotic parasite and an open-access reference dataset for the study of malaria parasites. ",
        "An Automated Text Message Navigation Program Improves the Show Rate for Outpatient Colonoscopy. Background. Numerous barriers to outpatient colonoscopy completion exist, causing undue procedure cancellations and poor bowel preparation. We piloted a text message navigation program to improve colonoscopy adherence. Method. We conducted a prospective study of patients aged 18 to 75 years scheduled for outpatient colonoscopy at an urban endoscopy center in April 2018. An intervention arm consisting of bidirectional, automated text messages prior to the procedure was compared with a usual care arm. We enrolled 21 intervention patients by phone and randomly selected 50 controls. Outcomes included colonoscopy appointment adherence, bowel preparation quality, and colonoscopy completion. Results. The arms had similar demographics and comorbidities. Intervention patients had higher colonoscopy appointment adherence (90% vs. 62%, p = 0.049). There were no significant differences in preparation quality or procedure completeness. Poststudy surveys indicated high patient satisfaction and perceived usefulness of the program. Conclusion. A bidirectional, automated texting navigation program improved colonoscopy adherence rates as compared with usual care. ",
        "Acute Exercise Effects Predict Training Change in Cognition and Connectivity. PURPOSE: Previous studies report memory and functional connectivity of memory systems improve acutely after a single aerobic exercise session or with training, suggesting that the acute effects of aerobic exercise may reflect initial changes that adapt over time. In this trial, for the first time, we test the proof-of-concept of whether the acute and training effects of aerobic exercise on working memory and brain network connectivity are related in the same participants. METHODS: Cognitively normal older participants (N = 34) were enrolled in a randomized clinical trial (NCT02453178). Participants completed fMRI resting state and a face working memory N-back task acutely after light- and moderate-intensity exercises and after a 12-wk aerobic training intervention. RESULTS: Functional connectivity did not change more after moderate-intensity training compared with light-intensity training. However, both training groups showed similar changes in cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) (maximal exercise oxygen uptake, V\u02d9O2peak), limiting group-level comparisons. Acute effects of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise on connections primarily in the default network predicted training enhancements in the same connections. Working memory also improved acutely, especially after moderate-intensity, and greater acute improvements predicted greater working memory improvement with training. Exercise effects on functional connectivity of right lateralized frontoparietal connections were related to both acute and training gains in working memory. CONCLUSIONS: Our data support the concept of acute aerobic exercise effects on functional brain systems and performance as an activity-evoked biomarker for exercise training benefits in the same outcomes. These findings may lead to new insights and methods for improving memory outcomes with aerobic exercise training. ",
        "Vedolizumab versus Adalimumab for Moderate-to-Severe Ulcerative Colitis. BACKGROUND: Biologic therapies are widely used in patients with ulcerative colitis. Head-to-head trials of these therapies in patients with inflammatory bowel disease are lacking. METHODS: In a phase 3b, double-blind, double-dummy, randomized trial conducted at 245 centers in 34 countries, we compared vedolizumab with adalimumab in adults with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis to determine whether vedolizumab was superior. Previous exposure to a tumor necrosis factor inhibitor other than adalimumab was allowed in up to 25% of patients. The patients were assigned to receive infusions of 300 mg of vedolizumab on day 1 and at weeks 2, 6, 14, 22, 30, 38, and 46 (plus injections of placebo) or subcutaneous injections of 40 mg of adalimumab, with a total dose of 160 mg at week 1, 80 mg at week 2, and 40 mg every 2 weeks thereafter until week 50 (plus infusions of placebo). Dose escalation was not permitted in either group. The primary outcome was clinical remission at week 52 (defined as a total score of \u22642 on the Mayo scale [range, 0 to 12, with higher scores indicating more severe disease] and no subscore >1 [range, 0 to 3] on any of the four Mayo scale components). To control for type I error, efficacy outcomes were analyzed with a hierarchical testing procedure, with the variables in the following order: clinical remission, endoscopic improvement (subscore of 0 to 1 on the Mayo endoscopic component), and corticosteroid-free remission at week 52. RESULTS: A total of 769 patients underwent randomization and received at least one dose of vedolizumab (383 patients) or adalimumab (386 patients). At week 52, clinical remission was observed in a higher percentage of patients in the vedolizumab group than in the adalimumab group (31.3% vs. 22.5%; difference, 8.8 percentage points; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.5 to 15.0; P\u2009=\u20090.006), as was endoscopic improvement (39.7% vs. 27.7%; difference, 11.9 percentage points; 95% CI, 5.3 to 18.5; P<0.001). Corticosteroid-free clinical remission occurred in 12.6% of the patients in the vedolizumab group and in 21.8% in the adalimumab group (difference, -9.3 percentage points; 95% CI, -18.9 to 0.4). Exposure-adjusted incidence rates of infection were 23.4 and 34.6 events per 100 patient-years with vedolizumab and adalimumab, respectively, and the corresponding rates for serious infection were 1.6 and 2.2 events per 100 patient-years. CONCLUSIONS: In this trial involving patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis, vedolizumab was superior to adalimumab with respect to achievement of clinical remission and endoscopic improvement, but not corticosteroid-free clinical remission.

        "Tip of the Iceberg: Assessing the Global Socioeconomic Costs of Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias and Strategic Implications for Stakeholders. While it is generally understood that Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related dementias (ADRD) is one of the costliest diseases to society, there is widespread concern that researchers and policymakers are not comprehensively capturing and describing the full scope and magnitude of the socioeconomic burden of ADRD. This review aimed to 1) catalogue the different types of AD-related socioeconomic costs described in the literature; 2) assess the challenges and gaps of existing approaches to measuring these costs; and 3) analyze and discuss the implications for stakeholders including policymakers, healthcare systems, associations, advocacy groups, clinicians, and researchers looking to improve the ability to generate reliable data that can guide evidence-based decision making. A centrally emergent theme from this review is that it is challenging to gauge the true value of policies, programs, or interventions in the ADRD arena given the long-term, progressive nature of the disease, its insidious socioeconomic impact beyond the patient and the formal healthcare system, and the complexities and current deficiencies (in measures and real-world data) in accurately calculating the full costs to society. There is therefore an urgent need for all stakeholders to establish a common understanding of the challenges in evaluating the full cost of ADRD and define approaches that allow us to measure these costs more accurately, with a view to prioritizing evidence-based solutions to mitigate this looming public health crisis.

        "The indelible weight of place: Childhood neighborhood disadvantage, timing of exposure, and obesity across adulthood. I use 28 (1986-2014) years of restricted geocoded NLSY tract-level data and find positive associations between exposure to childhood neighborhood disadvantage and adult obesity and BMI among individuals growing up and entering adulthood during the rise of obesity in the United States. Sibling fixed effects and cousin fixed effects models partially address unobserved confounding nested in the nuclear as well as extended family. Furthermore, exposure to neighborhood disadvantage in adolescence is most salient, providing insight into when policy intervention may be most effective. Results are robust to alternative specifications for neighborhood disadvantage, ages of exposure, and to alternative sampling strategies. ",
        "Investigating the association between body fat and depression via Mendelian randomization. Obesity and depression are major public health concerns that are both associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. There is a considerable body of literature linking obesity to the development of depression. Recent studies using Mendelian randomization indicate that this relationship is causal. Most studies of the obesity-depression association have used body mass index as a measure of obesity. Body mass index is defined as weight (measured in kilograms) divided by the square of height (meters) and therefore does not distinguish between the contributions of fat and nonfat to body weight. To better understand the obesity-depression association, we conduct a Mendelian randomization study of the relationship between fat mass, nonfat mass, height, and depression, using genome-wide association study results from the UK Biobank (n\u2009=\u2009332,000) and the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (n\u2009=\u2009480,000). Our findings suggest that both fat mass and height (short stature) are causal risk factors for depression, while nonfat mass is not. These results represent important new knowledge on the role of anthropometric measures in the etiology of depression. They also suggest that reducing fat mass will decrease the risk of depression, which lends further support to public health measures aimed at reducing the obesity epidemic. ",
        "Glia-neuron interactions underlie state transitions to generalized seizures. Brain activity and connectivity alter drastically during epileptic seizures. The brain networks shift from a balanced resting state to a hyperactive and hypersynchronous state. It is, however, less clear which mechanisms underlie the state transitions. By studying neural and glial activity in zebrafish models of epileptic seizures, we observe striking differences between these networks. During the preictal period, neurons display a small increase in synchronous activity only locally, while the gap-junction-coupled glial network was highly active and strongly synchronized across large distances. The transition from a preictal state to a generalized seizure leads to an abrupt increase in neural activity and connectivity, which is accompanied by a strong alteration in glia-neuron interactions and a\u00a0massive increase in extracellular glutamate. Optogenetic activation of glia excites nearby neurons through the action of glutamate and gap junctions, emphasizing a potential role for glia-glia and glia-neuron connections in the generation of epileptic seizures.

        "Detection of classic and cryptic Strongyloides genotypes by deep amplicon sequencing: A preliminary survey of dog and human specimens collected from remote Australian communities. Strongyloidiasis is caused by the human infective nematodes Strongyloides stercoralis, Strongyloides fuelleborni subsp. fuelleborni and Strongyloides fuelleborni subsp. kellyi. The zoonotic potential of S. stercoralis and the potential role of dogs in the maintenance of strongyloidiasis transmission has been a topic of interest and discussion for many years. In Australia, strongyloidiasis is prevalent in remote socioeconomically disadvantaged communities in the north of the continent. Being an isolated continent that has been separated from other regions for a long geological period, description of diversity of Australian Strongyloides genotypes adds to our understanding of the genetic diversity within the genus. Using PCR and amplicon sequencing (Illumina sequencing technology), we sequenced the Strongyloides SSU rDNA hyper-variable I and hyper-variable IV regions using Strongyloides-specific primers, and a fragment of the mtDNA cox1 gene using primers that are broadly specific for Strongyloides sp. and hookworms. These loci were amplified from DNA extracted from Australian human and dog faeces, and one human sputum sample. Using this approach, we confirm for the first time that potentially zoonotic S. stercoralis populations are present in Australia, suggesting that dogs represent a potential reservoir of human strongyloidiasis in remote Australian communities.

        "The ketogenic diet in children 3 years of age or younger: a 10-year single-center experience. The ketogenic diet (KD) is an effective treatment option for intractable epilepsy. Here, we reviewed the last 10 years of our experience with the KD and characterized its use in patients under 3 years of age. Medical records of all patients under the age of 3 years who were treated with the ketogenic diet from April 2004 to June 2014 were retrospectively reviewed. One hundred and nine patients with drug-resistant epilepsy were included. The mean age at the initiation of the KD was 1.4\u2009\u00b1\u20090.8 years old. The youngest patient was 3 weeks old. After 3 months, 39% (42/109) of patients responded to the KD and experienced more than 50% seizure reduction. Of those 42 patients, 20 (18%) achieved complete seizure control. Patients with a genetic etiology showed a better response to the KD in seizure reduction than the other patients (p\u2009=\u20090.03). Age at initiation of the KD was not related to eventual seizure outcome (p\u2009=\u20090.6). The KD continues to be an effective, safe, and well tolerated treatment option for infants with intractable epilepsy. ",
        "Risk of Wrong-Patient Orders Among Multiple vs Singleton Births in the Neonatal Intensive Care Units of 2 Integrated Health Care Systems. Importance: Multiple-birth infants in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) have nearly identical patient identifiers and may be at greater risk of wrong-patient order errors compared with singleton-birth infants. Objectives: To assess the risk of wrong-patient orders among multiple-birth infants and singletons receiving care in the NICU and to examine the proportion of wrong-patient orders between multiple-birth infants and siblings (intrafamilial errors) and between multiple-birth infants and nonsiblings (extrafamilial errors). Design, Setting, and Participants: A retrospective cohort study was conducted in 6 NICUs of 2 large, integrated health care systems in New York City that used distinct temporary names for newborns per the requirements of The Joint Commission. Data were collected from 4 NICUs at New York-Presbyterian Hospital from January 1, 2012, to December 31, 2015, and 2 NICUs at Montefiore Health System from July 1, 2013, to June 30, 2015. Data were analyzed from May 1, 2017, to December 31, 2017. All infants in the 6 NICUs for whom electronic orders were placed during the study periods were included. Main Outcomes and Measures: Wrong-patient electronic orders were identified using the Wrong-Patient Retract-and-Reorder (RAR) Measure. This measure was used to detect RAR events, which are defined as 1 or more orders placed for a patient that are retracted (ie, canceled) by the same clinician within 10 minutes, then reordered by the same clinician for a different patient within the next 10 minutes. Results: A total of 10\u202f819 infants were included: 85.5% were singleton-birth infants and 14.5% were multiple-birth infants (male, 55.8%; female, 44.2%). The overall wrong-patient order rate was significantly higher among multiple-birth infants than among singleton-birth infants (66.0 vs 41.7 RAR events per 100\u202f000 orders, respectively; adjusted odds ratio, 1.75; 95% CI, 1.39-2.20; P\u2009<\u2009.001). The rate of extrafamilial RAR events among multiple-birth infants (36.1 per 100\u202f000 orders) was similar to that of singleton-birth infants (41.7 per 100\u202f000 orders). The excess risk among multiple-birth infants (29.9 per 100\u202f000 orders) appears to be owing to intrafamilial RAR events. The risk increased as the number of siblings receiving care in the NICU increased; a wrong-patient order error occurred in 1 in 7 sets of twin births and in 1 in 3 sets of higher-order multiple births. Conclusions and Relevance: This study suggests that multiple-birth status in the NICU is associated with significantly increased risk of wrong-patient orders compared with singleton-birth status. This excess risk appears to be owing to misidentification between siblings. These results suggest that a distinct naming convention as required by The Joint Commission may provide insufficient protection against identification errors among multiple-birth infants. Strategies to reduce this risk include using given names at birth, changing from temporary to given names when available, and encouraging parents to select names for multiple births before they are born when acceptable to families.

        "Striatum-related functional activation during reward- versus punishment-based learning in psychosis risk. Psychosis is strongly related to increased striatal dopamine. However, the neural consequences of increased striatal dopamine in psychosis risk are still not fully understood. Consistent with an increase in striatal dopamine, in previous research, psychosis risk has been associated with neural EEG evidence of a greater response to unexpected reward than unexpected punishment feedback on a reversal-learning task. However, previous research has not directly examined whether psychosis risk is associated with altered striatal activation when receiving unexpected feedback on this task. There were two groups of participants: an antipsychotic medication-naive psychosis risk group (n\u2009=\u200921) who had both (a) extreme levels of self-reported psychotic-like beliefs and experiences and (b) interview-rated current-attenuated psychotic symptoms; and a comparison group (n\u2009=\u200920) who had average levels of self-reported psychotic-like beliefs and experiences. Participants completed a reversal-leaning task during fMRI scanning. As expected, in both ROI and whole-brain analyses, the psychosis risk group exhibited greater striatal activation (for whole-brain analyses, the peak was located in the right caudate) to unexpected reward than unexpected punishment feedback relative to the comparison group. These results indicate that psychosis risk is associated with a relatively increased neural sensitivity to unexpected reward than unexpected punishment outcomes and appears consistent with increased striatal dopamine. The results may help us better understand and detect striatal dysfunction in psychosis risk. ",
        "Phase I/Ib Study of Pembrolizumab Plus Vorinostat in Advanced/Metastatic Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer. PURPOSE: Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) enhance tumor immunogenicity through several mechanisms and may improve response to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). In a phase I/Ib trial, we tested the oral HDACi vorinostat combined with the programmed cell death protein 1 inhibitor pembrolizumab in advanced/metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients received intravenous pembrolizumab (200 mg every 3 weeks) plus oral vorinostat (200 or 400 mg/day). Primary endpoint was safety/tolerability. Secondary endpoints included response rate, progression-free survival, disease control rate (DCR), and overall survival. Tumor gene expression changes, T-cell density, and myeloid cell levels were studied in serial tissue specimens. RESULTS: Thirty-three patients were treated (13 in phase I, 20 in phase Ib). In phase I, both ICI-na\u00efve and ICI-pretreated patients were enrolled to determine dose-limiting toxicities (DLT). No DLTs were observed, and the recommended phase I dose was pembrolizumab 200 mg and vorinostat 400 mg. Any-grade adverse events were mainly fatigue (33%) and nausea/vomiting (27%). Of six ICI-na\u00efve and 24 ICI-pretreated patients evaluable for response, four (13%) had partial response [two confirmed, one unconfirmed with subsequent prolonged stable disease (SD), one unconfirmed with subsequent progressive disease (PD)], 16 (53%) had SD, and 10 (33%) had PD for a DCR of 67%. In the ICI-pretreated cohort, three patients (one confirmed, two unconfirmed) had partial response and 10 had SD. Pretreatment CD8+ T-cell presence in tumor stromal regions was associated with treatment benefit. CONCLUSIONS: Pembrolizumab plus vorinostat was well tolerated and demonstrated preliminary antitumor activity despite progression on prior ICI treatment. ",
        "Profiling surface proteins on individual exosomes using a proximity barcoding assay. Exosomes have been implicated in numerous biological processes, and they may serve as important disease markers. Surface proteins on exosomes carry information about their tissues of origin. Because of the heterogeneity of exosomes it is desirable to investigate them individually, but this has so far remained impractical. Here, we demonstrate a proximity-dependent barcoding assay to profile surface proteins of individual exosomes using antibody-DNA conjugates and next-generation sequencing. We first validate the method using artificial streptavidin-oligonucleotide complexes, followed by analysis of the variable composition of surface proteins on individual exosomes, derived from human body fluids or cell culture media. Exosomes from different sources are characterized by the presence of specific combinations of surface proteins and their abundance, allowing exosomes to be separately quantified in mixed samples to serve as markers for tissue-specific engagement in disease.

        "Identification of Racial Inequities in Access to Specialized Inpatient Heart Failure Care at an Academic Medical Center. BACKGROUND: Racial inequities for patients with heart failure (HF) have been widely documented. HF patients who receive cardiology care during a hospital admission have better outcomes. It is unknown whether there are differences in admission to a cardiology or general medicine service by race. This study examined the relationship between race and admission service, and its effect on 30-day readmission and mortality Methods: We performed a retrospective cohort study from September 2008 to November 2017 at a single large urban academic referral center of all patients self-referred to the emergency department and admitted to either the cardiology or general medicine service with a principal diagnosis of HF, who self-identified as white, black, or Latinx. We used multivariable generalized estimating equation models to assess the relationship between race and admission to the cardiology service. We used Cox regression to assess the association between race, admission service, and 30-day readmission and mortality. RESULTS: Among 1967 unique patients (66.7% white, 23.6% black, and 9.7% Latinx), black and Latinx patients had lower rates of admission to the cardiology service than white patients (adjusted rate ratio, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.84-0.98, for black; adjusted rate ratio, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.72-0.97 for Latinx). Female sex and age >75 years were also independently associated with lower rates of admission to the cardiology service. Admission to the cardiology service was independently associated with decreased readmission within 30 days, independent of race. CONCLUSIONS: Black and Latinx patients were less likely to be admitted to cardiology for HF care. This inequity may, in part, drive racial inequities in HF outcomes. ",
        "A single-cell transcriptome atlas of the adult human retina. The retina is a specialized neural tissue that senses light and initiates image processing. Although the functional organization of specific retina cells has been well studied, the molecular profile of many cell types remains unclear in humans. To comprehensively profile the human retina, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing on 20,009 cells from three donors and compiled a reference transcriptome atlas. Using unsupervised clustering analysis, we identified 18 transcriptionally distinct cell populations representing all known neural retinal cells: rod photoreceptors, cone photoreceptors, M\u00fcller glia, bipolar cells, amacrine cells, retinal ganglion cells, horizontal cells, astrocytes, and microglia. Our data captured molecular profiles for healthy and putative early degenerating rod photoreceptors, and revealed the loss of MALAT1 expression with longer post-mortem time, which potentially suggested a novel role of MALAT1 in rod photoreceptor degeneration. We have demonstrated the use of this retina transcriptome atlas to benchmark pluripotent stem cell-derived cone photoreceptors and an adult M\u00fcller glia cell line. This work provides an important reference with unprecedented insights into the transcriptional landscape of human retinal cells, which is fundamental to understanding retinal biology and disease. ",
        "Dengue virus-elicited tryptase induces endothelial permeability and shock. Dengue virus (DENV) infection causes a characteristic pathology in humans involving dysregulation of the vascular system. In some patients with dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF), vascular pathology can become severe, resulting in extensive microvascular permeability and plasma leakage into tissues and organs. Mast cells (MCs), which line blood vessels and regulate vascular function, are able to detect DENV in vivo and promote vascular leakage. Here, we identified that a MC-derived protease, tryptase, is consequential for promoting vascular permeability during DENV infection, through inducing breakdown of endothelial cell tight junctions. Injected tryptase alone was sufficient to induce plasma loss from the circulation and hypovolemic shock in animals. A potent tryptase inhibitor, nafamostat mesylate, blocked DENV-induced vascular leakage in vivo. Importantly, in two independent human dengue cohorts, tryptase levels correlated with the grade of DHF severity. This study defines an immune mechanism by which DENV can induce vascular pathology and shock. ",
        "Novel Oral mTORC1/2 Inhibitor TAK-228 Has Synergistic Antitumor Effects When Combined with Paclitaxel or PI3K\u03b1 Inhibitor TAK-117 in Preclinical Bladder Cancer Models. Advanced bladder cancer is associated with a poor prognosis and limited treatment options. The PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway is frequently activated in this disease and can be a potential therapeutic target for treatment intervention. We studied the antitumor efficacy of a new targeted therapy, TAK-228 (oral mTORC1/2 inhibitor), in preclinical models of bladder cancer. We evaluated the effects of TAK-228 in combination with a PI3K\u03b1 inhibitor (TAK-117) or with chemotherapy (paclitaxel). We used six bladder cancer cell lines and in vivo xenografts models. TAK-228 strongly inhibited cell proliferation in vitro, and reduced tumor growth and angiogenesis in vivo. Three possible biomarkers of response to TAK-228 (basal levels of 4E-BP1, p-4E-BP1/4E-BP1 ratio, or eIF4E/4E-BP1 ratio) were identified. The combination of TAK-228 and TAK-117 had synergistic effects in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, TAK-228 demonstrated greater efficiency when combined with paclitaxel. TAK-228 also showed ex vivo activity in tumor tissue from patients with treatment-na\u00efve bladder cancer. TAK-228 is a promising investigational agent that induces a strong effect on cell proliferation, tumor growth, and angiogenesis in bladder cancer models. High synergistic effects were observed with TAK-228 combined with a PI3K inhibitor or with chemotherapy. These results are currently being investigated in a clinic trial of TAK-228 plus paclitaxel in patients with metastatic bladder cancer (NCT03745911). IMPLICATIONS: Strong synergistic effects were observed when combining TAK-228 with TAK-117 (a PI3K\u03b1 inhibitor) or with paclitaxel chemotherapy. A phase II study at our institution is currently evaluating the efficacy of TAK-228 combined with paclitaxel in patients with metastatic bladder cancer. ",
        "A Rapid Method for Label-Free Enrichment of Rare Trophoblast Cells from Cervical Samples. Extravillous trophoblasts (EVTs) have the potential to provide the entire fetal genome for prenatal testing. Previous studies have demonstrated the presence of EVTs in the cervical canal and the ability to retrieve a small quantity of these cells by cervical sampling. However, these small quantities of trophoblasts are\u00a0far\u00a0outnumbered by the population of cervical cells in the sample, making isolation of the trophoblasts challenging. We have developed a method to enrich trophoblast cells from a cervical sample using differential settling of the cells in polystyrene wells. We tested the addition of small quantities of JEG-3 trophoblast cell line cells into clinical samples from standard Pap tests taken at 5 to 20 weeks of gestation to determine the optimal work flow. We observed that a 4\u2009min incubation in the capture wells led to a maximum in JEG-3 cell settling on the surface (71\u2009\u00b1\u200910% of the initial amount added) with the removal of 91\u2009\u00b1\u20093% of the cervical cell population, leading to a 700% enrichment in JEG-3 cells. We hypothesized that settling of mucus in the cervical sample affects the separation. Finally, we performed a proof-of-concept study using our work flow and CyteFinder cell picking to verify enrichment and pick individual JEG-3 and trophoblast cells free of cervical cells. Ultimately, this work provides a rapid, facile, and cost-effective method for enriching native trophoblasts from cervical samples for use in subsequent non-invasive prenatal testing using methods including single cell picking.

        "Immuno-subtyping of breast cancer reveals distinct myeloid cell profiles and immunotherapy resistance mechanisms. Cancer-induced immune responses affect tumour progression and therapeutic response. In multiple murine models and clinical datasets, we identified large variations of neutrophils and macrophages that define 'immune subtypes' of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), including neutrophil-enriched (NES) and macrophage-enriched subtypes (MES). Different tumour-intrinsic pathways and mutual regulation between macrophages (or monocytes) and neutrophils contribute to the development of a dichotomous myeloid compartment. MES contains predominantly macrophages that are CCR2-dependent and exhibit variable responses to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB). NES exhibits systemic and local accumulation of immunosuppressive neutrophils (or granulocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells), is resistant to ICB, and contains a minority of macrophages that seem to be unaffected by CCR2 knockout. A MES-to-NES conversion mediated acquired ICB resistance of initially sensitive MES models. Our results demonstrate diverse myeloid cell frequencies, functionality and potential roles in immunotherapies, and highlight the need to better understand the inter-patient heterogeneity of the myeloid compartment.

        "The Low Toxicity of Graphene Quantum Dots is Reflected by Marginal Gene Expression Changes of Primary Human Hematopoietic Stem Cells. Graphene quantum dots (GQDs) are a promising next generation nanomaterial with manifold biomedical applications. For real world applications, comprehensive studies on their influence on the functionality of primary human cells are mandatory. Here, we report the effects of GQDs on the transcriptome of CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells after an incubation time of 36\u2009hours. Of the 20 800 recorded gene expressions, only one, namely the selenoprotein W, 1, is changed by the GQDs in direct comparison to CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells cultivated without GQDs. Only a meta analysis reveals that the expression of 1171 genes is weakly affected, taking into account the more prominent changes just by the cell culture. Eight corresponding, weakly affected signaling pathways are identified, which include, but are not limited to, the triggering of apoptosis. These results suggest that GQDs with sizes in the range of a few nanometers hardly influence the CD34+ cells on the transcriptome level after 36\u2009h of incubation, thereby demonstrating their high usability for in vivo studies, such as fluorescence labeling or delivery protocols, without strong effects on the functional status of the cells.

        "Systematic identification of cancer cell vulnerabilities to natural killer cell-mediated immune surveillance. Only a subset of cancer patients respond to T-cell checkpoint inhibitors, highlighting the need for alternative immunotherapeutics. We performed CRISPR-Cas9 screens in a leukemia cell line to identify perturbations that enhance natural killer effector functions. Our screens defined critical components of the tumor-immune synapse and highlighted the importance of cancer cell interferon-\u03b3 signaling in modulating NK activity. Surprisingly, disrupting the ubiquitin ligase substrate adaptor DCAF15 strongly sensitized cancer cells to NK-mediated clearance. DCAF15 disruption induced an inflamed state in leukemic cells, including increased expression of lymphocyte costimulatory molecules. Proteomic and biochemical analysis revealed that cohesin complex members were endogenous client substrates of DCAF15. Genetic disruption of DCAF15 was phenocopied by treatment with indisulam, an anticancer drug that functions through DCAF15 engagement. In AML patients, reduced DCAF15 expression was associated with improved survival. These findings suggest that DCAF15 inhibition may have useful immunomodulatory properties in the treatment of myeloid neoplasms. ",
        "Mapping insoluble indole metabolites in the gastrointestinal environment of a murine colorectal cancer model using desorption/ionisation on porous silicon imaging. Indole derivatives are a structurally diverse group\u00a0of compounds found in food, toxins, medicines, and produced by commensal microbiota. On contact with acidic stomach conditions, indoles undergo condensation to generate metabolites that vary in solubility, activity and toxicity as they move through the gut. Here, using halogenated ions, we map promising chemo-preventative indoles, i) 6-bromoisatin (6Br), ii) the mixed indole natural extract (NE) 6Br is found in, and iii) the highly insoluble metabolites formed in vivo using desorption/ionisation on porous silicon-mass spectrometry imaging (DIOS-MSI). The functionalised porous silicon architecture allowed insoluble metabolites to be detected that would otherwise evade most analytical platforms, providing direct evidence for identifying the therapeutic component, 6Br, from the mixed indole NE. As a therapeutic lead, 0.025\u2009mg/g 6Br acts as a chemo-preventative compound in a 12 week genotoxic mouse model; at this dose 6Br significantly reduces epithelial cell proliferation, tumour precursors (aberrant crypt foci; ACF); and tumour numbers while having minimal effects on liver, blood biochemistry and weight parameters compared to controls. The same could not be said for the NE where 6Br originates, which significantly increased liver damage markers. DIOS-MSI revealed a large range of previously unknown insoluble metabolites that could contribute to reduced efficacy and increased toxicity. ",
        "Smartphone-Based Paper Microfluidic Particulometry of Norovirus from Environmental Water Samples at the Single Copy Level. Human enteric viruses can be highly infectious and thus capable of causing disease upon ingestion of low doses ranging from 100 to 102 virions. Norovirus is a good example with a minimum infectious dose as low as a few tens of virions, that is, below femtogram scale. Norovirus detection from commonly implicated environmental matrices (water and food) involves complicated concentration of viruses and/or amplification of the norovirus genome, thus rendering detection approaches not feasible for field applications. In this work, norovirus detection was performed on a microfluidic paper analytic device without using any sample concentration or nucleic acid amplification steps by directly imaging and counting on-paper aggregation of antibody-conjugated, fluorescent submicron particles. An in-house developed smartphone-based fluorescence microscope and an image-processing algorithm isolated the particles aggregated by antibody-antigen binding, leading to an extremely low limit of norovirus detection, as low as 1 genome copy/\u03bcL in deionized water and 10 genome copies/\u03bcL in reclaimed wastewater.

        "MiR322 mediates cardioprotection against ischemia/reperfusion injury via FBXW7/notch pathway. Myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (MI/R) causes loss of cardiomyocytes via oxidative stress-induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis. miR322, orthologous to human miR-424, was identified as an ischemia-induced angiogenic miRNA, but its cellular source and function in the setting of acute MI/R remains largely unknown. Using LacZ-tagged miR322 cluster reporter mice, we observed that vascular endothelial cells are the major cellular source of the miR322 cluster in adult hearts. Moreover, miR322 levels were significantly reduced in the heart at 24\u202fh after MI/R injury. Intramyocardial injection of mimic-miR322 significantly diminished cardiac apoptosis (as determined by expression levels of active caspase 3 by Western blot analysis and immunostaining for TUNEL) and reduced infarct size by about 40%, in association with reduced FBXW7 and increased active Notch 1 levels in the ischemic hearts. FBXW7, which is an ubiquitin ligase that is crucial for activated Notch1 turnover, was identified as a direct target of miR322 via FBXW7 3'UTR reporter assay. Co-injection of FBXW7 plasmid with mimic-miR322 in ischemic hearts abolished the effect of mimic-miR322 to reduce apoptosis and infarct size in MI/R hearts. These data identify FBXW7 as a direct target of miR322 and suggest that miR322 could have potential therapeutic application for cardioprotection against ischemia/reperfusion-induced injury. ",
        "Proteasome inhibition preserves longitudinal growth of denervated muscle and prevents neonatal neuromuscular contractures. Muscle contractures are a prominent and disabling feature of many neuromuscular disorders, including the 2 most common forms of childhood neurologic dysfunction: neonatal brachial plexus injury (NBPI) and cerebral palsy. There are currently no treatment strategies to directly alter the contracture pathology, as the pathogenesis of these contractures is unknown. We previously showed in a mouse model of NBPI that contractures result from impaired longitudinal muscle growth. Current presumed explanations for growth impairment in contractures focus on the dysregulation of muscle stem cells, which differentiate and fuse to existing myofibers during growth, as this process has classically been thought to control muscle growth during the neonatal period. Here, we demonstrate in a mouse model of NBPI that denervation does not prevent myonuclear accretion and that reduction in myonuclear number has no effect on functional muscle length or contracture development, providing definitive evidence that altered myonuclear accretion is not a driver of neuromuscular contractures. In contrast, we observed elevated levels of protein degradation in NBPI muscle, and we demonstrate that contractures can be pharmacologically prevented with the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib. These studies provide what we believe is the first strategy to prevent neuromuscular contractures by correcting the underlying deficit in longitudinal muscle growth. ",
        "Prenatal exposure to organophosphate pesticides and functional neuroimaging in adolescents living in proximity to pesticide application. We have reported consistent associations of prenatal organophosphate pesticide (OP) exposure with poorer cognitive function and behavior problems in our Center for the Health Assessment of Mothers and Children of Salinas (CHAMACOS), a birth cohort of Mexican American youth in California's agricultural Salinas Valley. However, there is little evidence on how OPs affect neural dynamics underlying associations. We used functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to measure cortical activation during tasks of executive function, attention, social cognition, and language comprehension in 95 adolescent CHAMACOS participants. We estimated associations of residential proximity to OP use during pregnancy with cortical activation in frontal, temporal, and parietal regions using multiple regression models, adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics. OP exposure was associated with altered brain activation during tasks of executive function. For example, with a 10-fold increase in total OP pesticide use within 1 km of maternal residence during pregnancy, there was a bilateral decrease in brain activation in the prefrontal cortex during a cognitive flexibility task (\u03b2 = -4.74; 95% CI: -8.18, -1.31 and \u03b2 = -4.40; 95% CI: -7.96, -0.84 for the left and right hemispheres, respectively). We also found that prenatal OP exposure was associated with sex differences in brain activation during a language comprehension task. This first functional neuroimaging study of prenatal OP exposure suggests that pesticides may impact cortical brain activation, which could underlie previously reported OP-related associations with cognitive and behavioral function. Use of fNIRS in environmental epidemiology offers a practical alternative to neuroimaging technologies and enhances our efforts to assess the impact of chemical exposures on neurodevelopment. ",
        "Feeding the Australian family: challenges for mothers, nutrition and equity. Australian women shoulder the bulk of household duties including family food provisioning, despite increasing participation in the workforce. This research aimed to understand employed mothers' daily-lived experience of family food provisioning, in particular, the intersection between family food provisioning, gender inequality and nutritional guidelines as they impact women's time and health. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 22 employed mothers in South Australia. Participants had at least one child aged less than 13 years. Qualitative data was analysed using a thematic content approach. Time-scarcity was common and associated with stress in relation to family food provisioning; this relationship was particularly apparent among employed mothers who were also studying. Most mothers valued nutrition and strove to provide nutritious meals, although they tended to work from their own nutritional understandings, not the national nutrition guidelines; they saw the nutrition guidelines as unhelpful because of the time demands that were implied. The study invites policy makers, practitioners and researchers to consider time for family food provisioning as a social determinant of family as well as women's health, and structural strategies to address this health inequity for women.

        "Tailored tetravalent antibodies potently and specifically activate Wnt/Frizzled pathways in cells, organoids and mice. Secreted Wnt proteins regulate development and adult tissue homeostasis by binding and activating cell-surface Frizzled receptors and co-receptors including LRP5/6. The hydrophobicity of Wnt proteins has complicated their purification and limited their use in basic research and as therapeutics. We describe modular tetravalent antibodies that can recruit Frizzled and LRP5/6 in a manner that phenocopies the activities of Wnts both in vitro and in vivo. The modular nature of these synthetic Frizzled and LRP5/6 Agonists, called FLAgs, enables tailored engineering of specificity for one, two or multiple members of the Frizzled family. We show that FLAgs underlie differentiation of pluripotent stem cells, sustain organoid growth, and activate stem cells in vivo. Activation of Wnt signaling circuits with tailored FLAgs will enable precise delineation of functional outcomes directed by distinct receptor combinations and could provide a new class of therapeutics to unlock the promise of regenerative medicine.

        "Depressive Symptoms and Onset of Functional Disability Over 2 Years: A Prospective Cohort Study. OBJECTIVES: This prospective cohort study examined the relationship between depressive symptoms and onset of functional disability over 2 years among US Chinese older adults, a rapidly growing minority older adult population. DESIGN AND SETTING: This study used survey data from 2713 Chinese older adults who completed both baseline (2011-2013) and follow-up (2013-2015) interviews of the Population Study of Chinese Elderly in Chicago. Depressive symptoms were assessed at baseline by the nine-item Patient Health Questionnaire. Functional disability was measured by three validated scales, Katz Index of Independence in Activities of Daily Living (ADLs), the Lawton Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADLs) scale, and the Rosow and Breslau mobility scale. Multivariate logistic regression was conducted to examine the relationship between baseline depressive symptoms and the development of functional disability (ADLs, IADLs, mobility) at 2-year follow-up while adjusting for covariates. RESULTS: Of the 2713 participants, 5.2% experienced ADL disability onset, 35.6% experienced IADL disability onset, and 23.3% experienced mobility disability onset over 2 years. After adjusting for covariates, the odds of ADL disability onset (odds ratio [OR]\u2009=\u20091.06; 95% confidence interval [CI]\u2009=\u20091.02-1.11), IADL disability onset (OR\u2009=\u20091.05; 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.01-1.09), and mobility disability onset (OR\u2009=\u20091.05; 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.01-1.09) were consistently higher in US Chinese older adults with higher levels of depressive symptoms than their less-depressed counterparts. Other significant risk factors included older age and more chronic physical conditions. CONCLUSION: Study findings underscore a significant relationship between depressive symptoms and onset of functional disability. Screening and, subsequently, treating depressive symptoms have the potential to reduce disability among US Chinese older adults. Culturally relevant depressive symptom screening may help identify Chinese older adults who are at greater risks for the development of functional disability. J Am Geriatr Soc 67:S538-S544, 2019. ",
        "Mechanical properties of cortical bone and their relationships with age, gender, composition and microindentation properties in the elderly. The growing incidence of skeletal fractures poses a significant challenge to ageing societies. Since a major part of physiological loading in the lower limbs is carried by cortical bone, it would be desirable to better understand the structure-mechanical property relationships and scale effects in this tissue. This study aimed at assessing whether microindentation properties combined with chemical and morphological information are usable to predict macroscopic elastic and strength properties in a donor- and site-matched manner. Specimens for quasi-static macroscopic tests in tension, compression, and torsion and microindentation were prepared from a cohort of 19 male and 20 female donors (46 to 99 years). All tests were performed under fully hydrated conditions. The chemical composition of the extra-cellular matrix was investigated with Raman spectroscopy. The results of the micro-mechanical tests were combined with morphological and compositional properties using a power law relationship to predict the macro-mechanical results. Microindentation properties were not gender dependent, remarkably constant over age, and showed an overall small variation with standard deviations of approximately 10 %. Similar results were obtained for chemical tissue composition. Macro-mechanical stiffness and strength were significantly related to porosity for all load cases (p<0.05). In case of macroscopic yield strain and work-to-failure this was only true in torsion and compression, respectively. The correlations of macro-mechanical with micro-mechanical, morphological, and chemical properties showed no significance for cement line density, mineralisation, or variations in the microindentation results and were dominated by porosity with a moderate explanatory power of predominately less than 50 %. The results confirm that age, with minor exceptions gender, and small variations in average mineralisation have negligible effect on the tissue microindentation properties of human lamellar bone in the elderly. Furthermore, our findings suggest that microindentation experiments are suitable to predict macroscopic mechanical properties in the elderly only on average and not on a one to one basis. The presented data may help to form a better understanding of the mechanisms of ageing in bone tissue and of the length scale at which they are active. This may be used for future prediction of fracture risk in the elderly. ",
        "Maternal high-fat diet results in cognitive impairment and hippocampal gene expression changes in rat offspring. Consumption of a high-fat diet has long been known to increase risk for obesity, diabetes, and the metabolic syndrome. Further evidence strongly suggests that these same metabolic disorders are associated with an increased risk of cognitive impairment later in life. Now faced with an expanding global burden of obesity and increasing prevalence of dementia due to an aging population, understanding the effects of high-fat diet consumption on cognition is of increasingly critical importance. Further, the developmental origins of many adult onset neuropsychiatric disorders have become increasingly clear, indicating a need to investigate effects of various risk factors, including diet, across the lifespan. Here, we use a rat model to assess the effects of maternal diet during pregnancy and lactation on cognition and hippocampal gene expression of offspring. Behaviorally, adult male offspring of high-fat fed dams had impaired object recognition memory and impaired spatial memory compared to offspring of chow-fed dams. In hippocampus, we found decreased expression of Insr, Lepr, and Slc2a1 (GLUT1) among offspring of high-fat fed dams at postnatal day 21. The decreased expression of Insr and Lepr persisted at postnatal day 150. Together, these data provide additional evidence to suggest that maternal exposure to high-fat diet during pregnancy and lactation can have lasting effects on the brain, behavior, and cognition on adult offspring.

        "Hierarchical Template Matching for 3D Myocardial Tracking and Cardiac Strain Estimation. Myocardial tracking and strain estimation can non-invasively assess cardiac functioning using subject-specific MRI. As the left-ventricle does not have a uniform shape and functioning from base to apex, the development of 3D MRI has provided opportunities for simultaneous 3D tracking, and 3D strain estimation. We have extended a Local Weighted Mean (LWM) transformation function for 3D, and incorporated in a Hierarchical Template Matching model to solve 3D myocardial tracking and strain estimation problem. The LWM does not need to solve a large system of equations, provides smooth displacement of myocardial points, and adapt local geometric differences in images. Hence, 3D myocardial tracking can be performed with 1.49\u2009mm median error, and without large error outliers. The maximum error of tracking is up to 24% reduced compared to benchmark methods. Moreover, the estimated strain can be insightful to improve 3D imaging protocols, and the computer code of LWM could also be useful for geo-spatial and manufacturing image analysis researchers. ",
        "VE-Cadherin Is Required for Lymphatic Valve Formation and Maintenance. The lymphatic vasculature requires intraluminal valves to maintain forward lymph flow. Lymphatic valves form and are constantly maintained by oscillatory fluid flow throughout life, yet the earliest steps of how lymphatic endothelial cells are able to respond to fluid shear stress remain unknown. Here, we show that the adherens junction protein VE-cadherin is required for the upregulation of valve-specific transcription factors. Conditional deletion of VE-cadherin in\u00a0vivo prevented valve formation in the embryo and caused postnatal regression of nearly all lymphatic valves in multiple tissues. Since VE-cadherin is known to signal through \u03b2-catenin and the VEGFR/AKT pathway, each pathway was probed. Expression of a constitutively active \u03b2-catenin mutant or direct pharmacologic activation of AKT in\u00a0vivo significantly rescued valve regression in the VE-cadherin-deficient lymphatic vessels. In conclusion, VE-cadherin-dependent signaling is required for lymphatic valve formation and maintenance and therapies to augment downstream pathways hold potential to treat lymphedema in patients.

        "Targeting PFKFB3 alleviates cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury in mice. The glycolytic rate in neurons is low in order to allow glucose to be metabolized through the pentose-phosphate pathway (PPP), which regenerates NADPH to preserve the glutathione redox status and survival. This is controlled by 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase-3 (PFKFB3), the pro-glycolytic enzyme that forms fructose-2,6-bisphosphate, a powerful allosteric activator of 6-phosphofructo-1-kinase. In neurons, PFKFB3 protein is physiologically inactive due to its proteasomal degradation. However, upon an excitotoxic stimuli, PFKFB3 becomes stabilized to activate glycolysis, thus hampering PPP mediated protection of redox status leading to neurodegeneration. Here, we show that selective inhibition of PFKFB3 activity by the small molecule AZ67 prevents the NADPH oxidation, redox stress and apoptotic cell death caused by the activation of glycolysis triggered upon excitotoxic and oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation models in mouse primary neurons. Furthermore, in vivo administration of AZ67 to mice significantly alleviated the motor discoordination and brain infarct injury in the middle carotid artery occlusion ischemia/reperfusion model. These results show that pharmacological inhibition of PFKFB3 is a suitable neuroprotective therapeutic strategy in excitotoxic-related disorders such as stroke. ",
        "Probiotics Reduce Health Care Cost and Societal Impact of Flu-Like Respiratory Tract Infections in the USA: An Economic Modeling Study. Acute respiratory tract infections (RTIs) of viral origin place a substantial burden on health care resources and society. Randomized controlled trials have shown positive effects of probiotics on clinical outcomes in these commonly occurring RTIs. Two meta-analyses published by the York Health Economics Consortium (YHEC) and Cochrane reported the efficacy of probiotics in reducing incidence and duration of RTIs, number of antibiotic courses, and days absent from work. The aim of this study was to assess the potential health-economic impact of probiotics on RTI-associated events and expenses in the US primary care setting. A state-transition microsimulation model reproduced a study population representative of the US national demographics for age and gender (1/1,000 sample). RTI incidence was based on the influenza-like illness outpatient consultation rate reported by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) FluView. Data on vaccination, on factors that negatively impact RTI outcomes, on resource utilization, and on productivity loss were obtained from US national databases. Analyses were performed for both meta-analyses independently. Outcomes included cost savings for the health care payer, related to a reduced number of RTI episodes, less outpatient consultations, and decreased medical prescriptions as well as cost savings from a broader societal perspective related to productivity loss. The analysis showed that generalized probiotic intake in the US population for 2017-2018 would have allowed cost savings for the health care payer of 4.6 million USD based on the YHEC scenario and 373 million USD for the Cochrane scenario, by averting 19 million and 54.5 million RTI sick days, respectively, compared to no probiotics. Antibiotic prescriptions decreased with 1.39-2.16 million courses, whereas absence from work decreased by 3.58-4.2 million days when applying the YHEC and Cochrane data, respectively. When productivity loss is included, total savings for society represented 784 million or 1.4 billion USD for the YHEC and Cochrane scenarios, respectively. Subgroup analyses demonstrated an incremental benefit of probiotics in at-risk groups, which might be of relevance for targeted interventions. Sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of the model outcomes. Our analysis demonstrated a positive impact of probiotics on the health care and economic burden of flu-like RTIs. Improved disease outcomes translated into considerable cost savings for both the payer and society. ",
        "Dissecting the dynamics of signaling events in the BMP, WNT, and NODAL cascade during self-organized fate patterning in human gastruloids. During gastrulation, the pluripotent epiblast self-organizes into the 3 germ layers-endoderm, mesoderm and ectoderm, which eventually form the entire embryo. Decades of research in the mouse embryo have revealed that a signaling cascade involving the Bone Morphogenic Protein (BMP), WNT, and NODAL pathways is necessary for gastrulation. In vivo, WNT and NODAL ligands are expressed near the site of gastrulation in the posterior of the embryo, and knockout of these ligands leads to a failure to gastrulate. These data have led to the prevailing view that a signaling gradient in WNT and NODAL underlies patterning during gastrulation; however, the activities of these pathways in space and time have never been directly observed. In this study, we quantify BMP, WNT, and NODAL signaling dynamics in an in vitro model of human gastrulation. Our data suggest that BMP signaling initiates waves of WNT and NODAL signaling activity that move toward the colony center at a constant rate. Using a simple mathematical model, we show that this wave-like behavior is inconsistent with a reaction-diffusion-based Turing system, indicating that there is no stable signaling gradient of WNT/NODAL. Instead, the final signaling state is homogeneous, and spatial differences arise only from boundary effects. We further show that the durations of WNT and NODAL signaling control mesoderm differentiation, while the duration of BMP signaling controls differentiation of CDX2-positive extra-embryonic cells. The identity of these extra-embryonic cells has been controversial, and we use RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) to obtain their transcriptomes and show that they closely resemble human trophoblast cells in vivo. The domain of BMP signaling is identical to the domain of differentiation of these trophoblast-like cells; however, neither WNT nor NODAL forms a spatial pattern that maps directly to the mesodermal region, suggesting that mesoderm differentiation is controlled dynamically by the combinatorial effect of multiple signals. We synthesize our data into a mathematical model that accurately recapitulates signaling dynamics and predicts cell fate patterning upon chemical and physical perturbations. Taken together, our study shows that the dynamics of signaling events in the BMP, WNT, and NODAL cascade in the absence of a stable signaling gradient control fate patterning of human gastruloids. ",
        "Neural Organization of Hierarchical Motor Sequence Representations in the Human Neocortex. Although it is widely accepted that the brain represents movement sequences hierarchically, the neural implementation of this organization is still poorly understood. To address this issue, we experimentally manipulated how participants represented sequences of finger presses at the levels of individual movements, chunks, and entire sequences. Using representational fMRI analyses, we then examined how this hierarchical structure was reflected in the fine-grained brain activity patterns of the participants while they performed the 8 trained sequences. We found clear evidence of each level of the movement hierarchy at the representational level. However, anatomically, chunk and sequence representations substantially overlapped in the premotor and parietal cortices, whereas individual movements were uniquely represented in the primary motor cortex. The findings challenge the common hypothesis of an orderly anatomical separation of different levels of an action hierarchy and argue for a special status of the distinction between individual movements and sequential context.

        "Podoplanin-Expressing Macrophages Promote Lymphangiogenesis and Lymphoinvasion in Breast Cancer. Among mammary tumor-infiltrating immune cells, the highest expression of podoplanin (PDPN) is found in a subset of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). We hereby demonstrate that PDPN is involved in the attachment of this TAM subset to lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs). Mechanistically, the binding of PDPN to LEC-derived galectin 8 (GAL8) in a glycosylation-dependent manner promotes the activation of pro-migratory integrin \u03b21. When proximal to lymphatics, PDPN-expressing macrophages (PoEMs) stimulate local matrix remodeling and promote vessel growth and lymphoinvasion. Anti-integrin \u03b21 blockade, macrophage-specific Pdpn knockout, or GAL8 inhibition impairs TAM adhesion to LECs, restraining lymphangiogenesis and reducing lymphatic cancer spread. In breast cancer patients, association of PoEMs with tumor lymphatic vessels correlates with incidences of lymph node and distant organ metastasis. ",
        "Cognitive and Neuroanatomic Accounts of Referential Communication in Focal Dementia. The primary function of language is to communicate-that is, to make individuals reach a state of mutual understanding about a particular thought or idea. Accordingly, daily communication is truly a task of social coordination. Indeed, successful interactions require individuals to (1) track and adopt a partner's perspective and (2) continuously shift between the numerous elements relevant to the exchange. Here, we use a referential communication task to study the contributions of perspective taking and executive function to effective communication in nonaphasic human patients with behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD). Similar to previous work, the task was to identify a target object, embedded among an array of competitors, for an interlocutor. Results indicate that bvFTD patients are impaired relative to control subjects in selecting the optimal, precise response. Neuropsychological testing related this performance to mental set shifting, but not to working memory or inhibition. Follow-up analyses indicated that some bvFTD patients perform equally well as control subjects, while a second, clinically matched patient group performs significantly worse. Importantly, the neuropsychological profiles of these subgroups differed only in set shifting. Finally, structural MRI analyses related patient impairment to gray matter disease in orbitofrontal, medial prefrontal, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, all regions previously implicated in social cognition and overlapping those related to set shifting. Complementary white matter analyses implicated uncinate fasciculus, which carries projections between orbitofrontal and temporal cortices. Together, these findings demonstrate that impaired referential communication in bvFTD is cognitively related to set shifting, and anatomically related to a social-executive network including prefrontal cortices and uncinate fasciculus.

        "Effectiveness of a Disability Preventive Intervention for Minority and Immigrant Elders: The Positive Minds-Strong Bodies Randomized Clinical Trial. OBJECTIVE: To test the acceptability and effectiveness of a disability prevention intervention, Positive Minds-Strong Bodies (PMSB), offered by paraprofessionals to mostly immigrant elders in four languages. DESIGN: Randomized trial of 307 participants, equally randomized into intervention or enhanced usual care. SETTING: Community-based organizations in Massachusetts, New York, Florida, and Puerto Rico serving minority elders. Data collected at baseline, 2, 6, and 12 months, between May 2015 and March 2019. PARTICIPANTS: English-, Spanish-, Mandarin-, or Cantonese-speaking adults, age 60+, not seeking disability prevention services, but eligible per elevated mood symptoms and minor to moderate physical dysfunction. INTERVENTIONS: Ten individual sessions of cognitive behavioral therapy (PM) concurrently offered with 36 group sessions of strengthening exercise training (SB) over 6 months compared to enhanced usual care. MEASUREMENTS: Acceptability defined as satisfaction and attendance to >50% of sessions. Effectiveness determined by changes in mood symptoms (HSCL-25 and GAD-7), functional performance (SPPB), self-reported disability (LLFDI), and disability days (WHODAS 2.0). RESULTS: Around 77.6% of intervention participants attended over half of PM Sessions; 53.4% attended over half of SB sessions. Intent-to-treat analyses at 6 months showed significant intervention effects: improved functioning per SPPB and LLFDI, and lowered mood symptoms per HSCL-25. Intent-to-treat analyses at 12 months showed that effects remained significant for LLFDI and HSCL-25, and disability days (per WHODAS 2.0) significantly decreased 6-month after the intervention. CONCLUSIONS: PMSB offered by paraprofessionals in community-based organizations demonstrates good acceptability and seems to improve functioning, with a compliance-benefit effect showing compliance as an important determinant of the intervention response.

        "Modulation of tonotopic ventral medial geniculate body is behaviorally relevant for speech recognition. Sensory thalami are central sensory pathway stations for information processing. Their role for human cognition and perception, however, remains unclear. Recent evidence suggests an involvement of the sensory thalami in speech recognition. In particular, the auditory thalamus (medial geniculate body, MGB) response is modulated by speech recognition tasks and the amount of this task-dependent modulation is associated with speech recognition abilities. Here, we tested the specific hypothesis that this behaviorally relevant modulation is present in the MGB subsection that corresponds to the primary auditory pathway (i.e., the ventral MGB [vMGB]). We used ultra-high field 7T fMRI to identify the vMGB, and found a significant positive correlation between the amount of task-dependent modulation and the speech recognition performance across participants within left vMGB, but not within the other MGB subsections. These results imply that modulation of thalamic driving input to the auditory cortex facilitates speech recognition. ",
        "Retrospective analysis reveals significant association of hypoglycemia with tramadol and methadone in contrast to other opioids. Tramadol is one of the most commonly used analgesics worldwide, classified as having a low abuse potential by U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency, and often recommended in pain management guidelines. Its pain-relieving mechanism of action is attributed to mild \u03bc-opioid receptor agonism, serotonin and norepinephrine mediated nociception modulation, and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor, NMDAR, antagonism. However, recent case reports and case-control studies have shown an association between tramadol use and hypoglycemia. The growing concern over increasing tramadol use and unexpected side effects warranted a further comparative and quantitative analysis of tramadol adverse reactions. In this study we analyzed over twelve million reports from United States Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System and provided evidence of increased propensity for hypoglycemia in patients taking tramadol when compared to patients taking other opioids, serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, and drugs affecting NMDAR activity. Additionally, we identified that only methadone from the opioid cohort behaves similarly to tramadol and has an association with hypoglycemia. ",
        "27-Hydroxycholesterol Promotes Adiposity and Mimics Adipogenic Diet-Induced Inflammatory Signaling. 27-Hydroxycholesterol (27HC) is an abundant cholesterol metabolite and has detrimental effects on the cardiovascular system, whereas its impact on adiposity is not well known. In this study, we found that elevations in 27HC cause increased body weight gain in mice fed a high-fat/high-cholesterol diet in an estrogen receptor \u03b1-dependent manner. Regardless of diet type, body fat mass was increased by 27HC without changes in food intake or fat absorption. 27HC did not alter energy expenditure in mice fed a normal chow diet and increased visceral white adipose mass by inducing hyperplasia but not hypertrophy. Although 27HC did not augment adipocyte terminal differentiation, it increased the adipose cell population that differentiates to mature adipocytes. RNA sequencing analysis revealed that 27HC treatment of mice fed a normal chow diet induces inflammatory gene sets similar to those seen after high-fat/high-cholesterol diet feeding, whereas there was no overlap in inflammatory gene expression among any other 27HC administration/diet change combination. Histological analysis showed that 27HC treatment increased the number of total and M1-type macrophages in white adipose tissues. Thus, 27HC promotes adiposity by directly affecting white adipose tissues and by increasing adipose inflammatory responses. Lowering serum 27HC levels may lead to an approach targeting cholesterol to prevent diet-induced obesity. ",
        "Noncommunicable disease among adults with cerebral palsy: A matched cohort study. OBJECTIVE: To compare the incidence of noncommunicable diseases between adults with and without cerebral palsy (CP). METHODS: A cohort study was conducted using primary care data from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink. Cox models, stratified by matched set and adjusted for potential confounders, were fitted to compare the risk of any noncommunicable disease, cancer, cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and respiratory disease between adults with and without CP. RESULTS: The analysis included 1,705 adults with CP and 5,115 age-, sex-, and general practice-matched adults without CP. There was evidence from adjusted analyses that adults with CP had 75% increased risk of developing any noncommunicable disease compared to adults without CP (hazard ratio [HR] 1.75, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.58-1.94). Specifically, they had increased risk of cardiovascular disease (HR 1.76, 95% CI 1.48-2.11) and respiratory disease (HR 2.61, 95% CI 2.14-3.19). There was no evidence of increased risk of cancer or type 2 diabetes mellitus. CONCLUSIONS: Adults with CP had increased risk of noncommunicable disease, specifically cardiovascular and respiratory disease. These findings highlight the need for clinical vigilance regarding identification of noncommunicable disease in people with CP and further research into the etiology and management of noncommunicable disease in this population.

        "A cell-free DNA metagenomic sequencing assay that integrates the host injury response to infection. High-throughput metagenomic sequencing offers an unbiased approach to identify pathogens in clinical samples. Conventional metagenomic sequencing, however, does not integrate information about the host, which is often critical to distinguish infection from infectious disease, and to assess the severity of disease. Here, we explore the utility of high-throughput sequencing of cell-free DNA (cfDNA) after bisulfite conversion to map the tissue and cell types of origin of host-derived cfDNA, and to profile the bacterial and viral metagenome. We applied this assay to 51 urinary cfDNA isolates collected from a cohort of kidney transplant recipients with and without bacterial and viral infection of the urinary tract. We find that the cell and tissue types of origin of urinary cfDNA can be derived from its genome-wide profile of methylation marks, and strongly depend on infection status. We find evidence of kidney and bladder tissue damage due to viral and bacterial infection, respectively, and of the recruitment of neutrophils to the urinary tract during infection. Through direct comparison to conventional metagenomic sequencing as well as clinical tests of infection, we find this assay accurately captures the bacterial and viral composition of the sample. The assay presented here is straightforward to implement, offers a systems view into bacterial and viral infections of the urinary tract, and can find future use as a tool for the differential diagnosis of infection.

        "Comparison of Trends in Self-reported Cigarette Consumption and Sales in England, 2011 to 2018. Importance: Population cigarette consumption is declining in many countries. Accurate estimates of long- and short-term changes are vital for policy evaluation and planning. Survey data and sales data that are used to make these estimates each have important potential biases, so triangulation using different methods is required for robust estimation. Objectives: To compare monthly estimates of cigarette consumption in England from a nationally representative survey and recorded cigarette sales and to triangulate an accurate estimate of changes in cigarette consumption since 2011. Design, Setting, and Participants: This study used time series analyses based on survey data and recorded cigarette sales to estimate and compare trends in population cigarette consumption in England from 2011 to 2018. Survey participants were representative samples of 1700 people aged 16 years or older each month in England. Main Outcomes and Measures: Monthly cigarette retail sales data from August 2011 through February 2018 were obtained from a data agency. Monthly self-reports of cigarette consumption were collected over the same period using the Smoking Toolkit Study. Results: A total of 136\u202f677 individuals (51.1% female; mean [SD] age, 46.7 [18.8] years) were surveyed. Over the study period, mean monthly cigarette consumption in England was 2.85 billion (95% CI, 2.78 billion to 2.93 billion) cigarettes based on survey data compared with 3.08 billion (95% CI, 3.03 billion to 3.13 billion) estimated from sales data. Over the whole period, cigarette consumption declined by 24.4% based on survey data and 24.1% based on sales data. This equated to 118.4 million and 117.4 million fewer cigarettes consumed per month (or approximately 1.4 billion per year) based on survey data and sales data, respectively. After adjusting for underlying trends, month-by-month changes in cigarette consumption were closely aligned: a 1% change in survey-estimated cigarette consumption was associated with a 0.98% (95% CI, 0.53%-1.44%) change in sales estimates. Conclusions and Relevance: Survey data and sales data were closely aligned in showing that overall cigarette sales in England have declined by almost a quarter since 2011, amounting to more than 1 billion fewer cigarettes smoked each year. The alignment between the 2 methods provides increased confidence in the accuracy of parameters provided by the Smoking Toolkit Study and sales data. It indicates that estimated changes in cigarette consumption are robust and provide a meaningful basis for policy evaluation and planning. ",
        "Potato ingestion is as effective as carbohydrate gels to support prolonged cycling performance. Carbohydrate (CHO) ingestion is an established strategy to improve endurance performance. Race fuels should not only sustain performance but also be readily digested and absorbed. Potatoes are a whole-food-based option that fulfills these criteria, yet their impact on performance remains unexamined. We investigated the effects of potato pur\u00e9e ingestion during prolonged cycling on subsequent performance vs. commercial CHO gel or a water-only condition. Twelve cyclists (70.7\u2009\u00b1\u20097.7 kg, 173\u2009\u00b1\u20098 cm, 31\u2009\u00b1\u20099 yr, 22\u2009\u00b1\u20095.1% body fat; means\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD) with average peak oxygen consumption (V\u0307o2peak) of 60.7\u2009\u00b1\u20099.0 mL\u00b7kg-1\u00b7min-1 performed a 2-h cycling challenge (60-85% V\u0307o2peak) followed by a time trial (TT; 6 kJ/kg body mass) while consuming potato, gel, or water in a randomized-crossover design. The race fuels were administered with [U-13C6]glucose for an indirect estimate of gastric emptying rate. Blood samples were collected throughout the trials. Blood glucose concentrations were higher (P < 0.001) in potato and gel conditions compared with water condition. Blood lactate concentrations were higher (P = 0.001) after the TT completion in both CHO conditions compared with water condition. TT performance was improved (P = 0.032) in both potato (33.0\u2009\u00b1\u20094.5 min) and gel (33.0\u2009\u00b1\u20094.2 min) conditions compared with water condition (39.5\u2009\u00b1\u20097.9 min). Moreover, no difference was observed in TT performance between CHO conditions (P = 1.00). In conclusion, potato and gel ingestion equally sustained blood glucose concentrations and TT performance. Our results support the effective use of potatoes to support race performance for trained cyclists.NEW & NOTEWORTHY The ingestion of concentrated carbohydrate gels during prolonged exercise has been shown to promote carbohydrate availability and improve exercise performance. Our study aim was to expand and diversify race fueling menus for athletes by providing an evidence-based whole-food alternative to the routine ingestion of gels during training and competition. Our work shows that russet potato ingestion during prolonged cycling is as effective as carbohydrate gels to support exercise performance in trained athletes. ",
        "Association of Cesarean Delivery With Risk of Neurodevelopmental and Psychiatric Disorders in the Offspring: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis. Importance: Birth by cesarean delivery is increasing globally, particularly cesarean deliveries without medical indication. Children born via cesarean delivery may have an increased risk of negative health outcomes, but the evidence for psychiatric disorders is incomplete. Objective: To evaluate the association between cesarean delivery and risk of neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders in the offspring. Data Sources: Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, and PsycINFO were searched from inception to December 19, 2018. Search terms included all main mental disorders in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Fifth Edition). Study Selection: Two researchers independently selected observational studies that examined the association between cesarean delivery and neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders in the offspring. Data Extraction and Synthesis: Two researchers independently extracted data according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) and Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) reporting guidelines and assessed study quality using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Random-effects meta-analyses were used to pool odds ratios (ORs) with 95% CIs for each outcome. Sensitivity and influence analyses tested the robustness of the results. Main Outcomes and Measures: The ORs for the offspring with any neurodevelopmental or psychiatric disorder who were born via cesarean delivery compared with those were born via vaginal delivery. Results: A total of 6953 articles were identified, of which 61 studies comprising 67 independent samples were included, totaling 20\u202f607\u202f935 deliveries. Compared with offspring born by vaginal delivery, offspring born via cesarean delivery had increased odds of autism spectrum disorders (OR, 1.33; 95% CI, 1.25-1.41; I2\u2009=\u200969.5%) and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (OR, 1.17; 95% CI, 1.07-1.26; I2\u2009=\u200979.2%). Estimates were less precise for intellectual disabilities (OR, 1.83; 95% CI, 0.90-3.70; I2\u2009=\u200988.2%), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OR, 1.49; 95% CI, 0.87-2.56; I2\u2009=\u200967.3%), tic disorders (OR, 1.31; 95% CI, 0.98-1.76; I2\u2009=\u200975.6%), and eating disorders (OR, 1.18; 95% CI, 0.96-1.47; I2\u2009=\u200992.7%). No significant associations were found with depression/affective psychoses or nonaffective psychoses. Estimates were comparable for emergency and elective cesarean delivery. Study quality was high for 82% of the cohort studies and 50% of the case-control studies. Conclusions and Relevance: The findings suggest that cesarean delivery births are associated with an increased risk of autism spectrum disorder and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, irrespective of cesarean delivery modality, compared with vaginal delivery. Future studies on the mechanisms behind these associations appear to be warranted. ",
        "An In\u00a0Vitro Human Segmentation Clock Model Derived from Embryonic Stem Cells. Defects in somitogenesis result in vertebral malformations at birth known as spondylocostal dysostosis (SCDO). Somites are formed with a species-specific periodicity controlled by the \"segmentation clock,\" which comprises a group of oscillatory genes in the presomitic mesoderm. Here, we report that a segmentation clock model derived from human embryonic stem cells shows many hallmarks of the mammalian segmentation clock in\u00a0vivo, including a dependence on the NOTCH and WNT signaling pathways. The gene expression oscillations are highly synchronized, displaying a periodicity specific to the human clock. Introduction of a point of mutation into HES7, a specific mutation previously associated with clinical SCDO, eliminated clock gene oscillations, successfully reproducing the defects in the segmentation clock. Thus, we provide a model for studying the previously inaccessible human segmentation clock to better understand the mechanisms contributing to congenital skeletal defects. ",
        "Long-term wildlife mortality surveillance in northern Congo: a model for the detection of Ebola virus disease epizootics. Ebolavirus (EBOV) has caused disease outbreaks taking thousands of lives, costing billions of dollars in control efforts and threatening great ape populations. EBOV ecology is not fully understood but infected wildlife and consumption of animal carcasses have been linked to human outbreaks, especially in the Congo Basin. Partnering with the Congolese Ministry of Health, we conducted wildlife mortality surveillance and educational outreach in the northern Republic of Congo (RoC). Designed for EBOV detection and to alert public health authorities, we established a low-cost wildlife mortality reporting network covering 50 000 km2. Simultaneously, we delivered educational outreach promoting behavioural change to over 6600 people in rural northern RoC. We achieved specimen collection by training project staff on a safe sampling protocol and equipping geographically distributed bases with sampling kits. We established in-country diagnostics for EBOV testing, reducing diagnostic turnaround time to 3 days and demonstrated the absence of EBOV in 58 carcasses. Central Africa remains a high-risk EBOV region, but RoC, home to the largest remaining populations of great apes, has not had an epidemic since 2005. This effort continues to function as an untested early warning system in RoC, where people and great apes have died from past Ebola virus disease outbreaks. This article is part of the theme issue 'Dynamic and integrative approaches to understanding pathogen spillover'. ",
        "Development of a SFTSV DNA vaccine that confers complete protection against lethal infection in ferrets. Although the incidence of severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus (SFTSV) infection has increased from its discovery with a mortality rate of 10-20%, no effective vaccines are currently available. Here we describe the development of a SFTSV DNA vaccine, its immunogenicity, and its protective efficacy. Vaccine candidates induce both a neutralizing antibody response and multifunctional SFTSV-specific T cell response in mice and ferrets. When the vaccine efficacy is investigated in aged-ferrets that recapitulate fatal clinical symptoms, vaccinated ferrets are completely protected from lethal SFTSV challenge without developing any clinical signs. A serum transfer study reveals that anti-envelope antibodies play an important role in protective immunity. Our results suggest that Gn/Gc may be the most effective antigens for inducing protective immunity and non-envelope-specific T cell responses also can contribute to protection against SFTSV infection. This study provides important insights into the development of an effective vaccine, as well as corresponding immune parameters, to control SFTSV infection. ",
        "Gout and the risk of advanced chronic kidney disease in the UK health system: a national cohort study. OBJECTIVE: Evaluate the association between gout and risk of advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD). DESIGN: Retrospective matched cohort study. SETTING: UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink. PARTICIPANTS: The analysis included data for 68\u2009897 patients with gout and 554\u2009964 matched patients without gout. Patients were aged \u226518 years, registered at UK practices, had \u226512 months of clinical data and had data linked with Hospital Episode Statistics. Patients were excluded for history of advanced CKD, juvenile gout, cancer, HIV, tumour lysis syndrome, Lesch-Nyhan syndrome or familial Mediterranean fever. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Advanced CKD was defined as first occurrence of: (1) dialysis, kidney transplant, diagnosis of end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) or stage 5 CKD (diagnostic codes in Read system or International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision); (2) estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) <10 mL/min/1.73 m\u00b2; (3) doubling of serum creatinine from baseline and (4) death associated with CKD. RESULTS: Advanced CKD incidence was higher for patients with gout (8.54 per 1000 patient-years; 95% CI 8.26 to 8.83) versus without gout (4.08; 95%\u2009CI 4.00 to 4.16). Gout was associated with higher advanced CKD risk in both unadjusted analysis (HR, 2.00; 95%\u2009CI 1.92 to 2.07) and after adjustment (HR, 1.29; 95%\u2009CI 1.23 to 1.35). Association was strongest for ESKD (HR, 2.13; 95%\u2009CI 1.73 to 2.61) and was present for eGFR <10\u2009mL/min/1.73\u2009m\u00b2 (HR, 1.45; 95%\u2009CI 1.30 to 1.61) and serum creatinine doubling (HR, 1.13; 95%\u2009CI 1.08 to 1.19) but not CKD-associated death (HR, 1.14; 95%\u2009CI 0.99 to 1.31). Association of gout with advanced CKD was replicated in propensity-score matched analysis (HR, 1.23; 95%\u2009CI 1.17 to 1.29) and analysis limited to patients with incident gout (HR, 1.28; 95%\u2009CI 1.22 to 1.35). CONCLUSIONS: Gout is associated with elevated risk of CKD progression. Future studies should investigate whether controlling gout is protective and reduces CKD risk. ",
        "Indoor bacterial microbiota and development of asthma by 10.5\u00a0years of age. BACKGROUND: Early-life indoor bacterial exposure is associated with the risk of asthma, but the roles of specific bacterial genera are poorly understood. OBJECTIVE: We sought to determine whether individual bacterial genera in indoor microbiota predict the development of asthma. METHODS: Dust samples from living rooms were collected at 2\u00a0months of age. The dust microbiota was characterized by using Illumina MiSeq sequencing amplicons of the bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA gene. Children (n\u00a0=\u00a0373) were followed up for ever asthma until the age of 10.5\u00a0years. RESULTS: Richness was inversely associated with asthma after adjustments (P\u00a0=\u00a0.03). The phylogenetic microbiota composition in asthmatics patients' homes was characteristically different from that in nonasthmatic subjects' homes (P\u00a0=\u00a0.02, weighted UniFrac, adjusted association, permutational multivariate analysis of variance, PERMANOVA-S). The first 2 axis scores of principal coordinate analysis of the weighted UniFrac distance matrix were inversely associated with asthma. Of 658 genera detected in the dust samples, the relative abundances of 41 genera correlated (r\u00a0>\u00a0|0.4|) with one of these axes. Lactococcus genus was a risk factor for asthma (adjusted odds ratio, 1.36 [95% CI, 1.13-1.63] per interquartile range change). The abundance of 12 bacterial genera (mostly from the Actinomycetales order) was associated with lower asthma risk (P\u00a0<\u00a0.10), although not independently of each other. The sum relative abundance of these 12 intercorrelated genera was significantly protective and explained the majority of the association of richness with less asthma. CONCLUSION: Our data confirm that phylogenetic differences in the microbiota of infants' homes are associated with subsequent asthma risk and suggest that communities of selected bacteria are more strongly linked to asthma protection than individual bacterial taxa or mere richness.

        "Single-Cell Glia and Neuron Gene Expression in the Central Amygdala in Opioid Withdrawal Suggests Inflammation With Correlated Gut Dysbiosis. Drug-seeking in opioid dependence is due in part to the severe negative emotion associated with the withdrawal syndrome. It is well-established that negative emotional states emerge from activity in the amygdala. More recently, gut microflora have been shown to contribute substantially to such emotions. We measured gene expression in single glia and neurons gathered from the amygdala using laser capture microdissection and simultaneously measured gut microflora in morphine-dependent and withdrawn rats to investigate drivers of negative emotion in opioid withdrawal. We found that neuroinflammatory genes, notably Tnf, were upregulated in the withdrawal condition and that astrocytes, in particular, were highly active. We also observe a decreased Firmicutes to Bacteroides ratio in opioid withdrawal indicating gut dysbiosis. We speculate that these inflammatory and gut microflora changes contribute to the negative emotion experienced in opioid withdrawal that motivates dependence. ",
        "Synchronized stimulation and continuous insulin sensing in a microfluidic human Islet on a Chip designed for scalable manufacturing. Pancreatic \u03b2 cell function is compromised in diabetes and is typically assessed by measuring insulin secretion during glucose stimulation. Traditionally, measurement of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion involves manual liquid handling, heterogeneous stimulus delivery, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays that require large numbers of islets and processing time. Though microfluidic devices have been developed to address some of these limitations, traditional methods for islet testing remain the most common due to the learning curve for adopting microfluidic devices and the incompatibility of most device materials with large-scale manufacturing. We designed and built a thermoplastic, microfluidic-based Islet on a Chip compatible with commercial fabrication methods, that automates islet loading, stimulation, and insulin sensing. Inspired by the perfusion of native islets by designated arterioles and capillaries, the chip delivers synchronized glucose pulses to islets positioned in parallel channels. By flowing suspensions of human cadaveric islets onto the chip, we confirmed automatic capture of islets. Fluorescent glucose tracking demonstrated that stimulus delivery was synchronized within a two-minute window independent of the presence or size of captured islets. Insulin secretion was continuously sensed by an automated, on-chip immunoassay and quantified by fluorescence anisotropy. By integrating scalable manufacturing materials, on-line, continuous insulin measurement, and precise spatiotemporal stimulation into an easy-to-use design, the Islet on a Chip should accelerate efforts to study and develop effective treatments for diabetes.

        "A Helical Polypeptide-Based Potassium Ionophore Induces Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress-Mediated Apoptosis by Perturbing Ion Homeostasis. Perturbation of potassium homeostasis can affect various cell functions and lead to the onset of programmed cell death. Although ionophores have been intensively used as an ion homeostasis disturber, the mechanisms of cell death are unclear and the bioapplicability is limited. In this study, helical polypeptide-based potassium ionophores are developed to induce endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-mediated apoptosis. The polypeptide-based potassium ionophores disturb ion homeostasis and then induce prolonged ER stress in the cells. The ER stress results in oxidative environments that accelerate the activation of mitochondria-dependent apoptosis. Moreover, ER stress-mediated apoptosis is triggered in a tumor-bearing mouse model that suppresses tumor proliferation. This study provides the first evidence showing that helical polypeptide-based potassium ionophores trigger ER stress-mediated apoptosis by perturbation of potassium homeostasis. ",
        "A microfluidic patterned model of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease: applications to disease progression and zonation. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and its progressive form non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) affect 25% of the world population. NAFLD is predicted to soon become the main cause of liver morbidity and transplantation. The disease is characterized by a progressive increase of lipid accumulation in hepatocytes, which eventually induce fibrosis and inflammation, and can ultimately cause cirrhosis and hepatic carcinoma. Here, we created a patterned model of NAFLD on a chip using free fatty acid gradients to recapitulate a spectrum of disease conditions in a single continuous liver tissue. We established the NAFLD progression via quantification of intracellular lipid accumulation and transcriptional levels of fatty acid transporters and NAFLD pathogenesis markers. We then used this platform to create oxygen driven steatosis zonation mimicking the sinusoidal lipid distribution on a single continuous tissue and showed that this fat zonation disappears under progressed steatosis, in agreement with in vivo observations and recent computational studies. While we focus on free fatty acids and oxygen as the drivers of NAFLD, the microfluidic platform here is extensible to simultaneous use of other drivers. ",
        "The Effect of Financial Incentives on Patient Decisions to Undergo Low-value Head Computed Tomography Scans. BACKGROUND: Excessive diagnostic testing and defensive medicine contribute to billions of dollars in avoidable costs in the United States annually. Our objective was to determine the influence of financial incentives, accompanied with information regarding test risk and benefit, on patient preference for diagnostic testing. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional survey of patients at the University of Michigan emergency department (ED). Each participant was presented with a hypothetical scenario involving an ED visit following minor traumatic brain injury. Participants were given information regarding potential benefit (detecting brain hemorrhage) and risk (developing cancer) of head computed tomography scan, as well as an incentive of $0 or $100 to forego testing. We used 0.1 and 1% for test benefit and risk, and values for risk, benefit, and financial incentive varied across participants. Our primary outcome was patient preference to undergo testing. We also collected demographic and numeracy information. We then used logistic regression to estimate odds ratios (ORs), which were adjusted for multiple potential confounders. Our sample size was designed to find at least 300 events (preference for testing) to allow for inclusion of up to 30 covariates in fully adjusted models. We had 85% to 90% power to detect a 10% absolute difference in testing rate across groups, assuming a 95% significance level. RESULTS: We surveyed 913 patients. Increasing test benefit from 0.1% to 1% significantly increased test acceptance (adjusted OR [AOR]\u00a0= 1.6, 95% confidence interval [CI]\u00a0= 1.2 to 2.1) and increasing test risk from 0.1% to 1% significantly decreased test acceptance (AOR\u00a0= 0.70, 95% CI\u00a0= 0.52 to 0.93). Finally, a $100 incentive to forego low-value testing significantly reduced test acceptance (AOR\u00a0= 0.6; 95% CI\u00a0= 0.4 to 0.8). CONCLUSIONS: Providing financial incentives to forego testing significantly decreased patient preference for testing, even when accounting for test benefit and risk. This work is preliminary and hypothetical and requires confirmation in larger patient cohorts facing these actual decisions. ",
        "English only? Monolinguals in linguistically diverse contexts have an edge in language learning. Accumulating evidence shows how language context shapes bilingual language use and its cognitive consequences. However, few studies have considered the impact of language context for monolinguals. Although monolinguals' language processing is assumed to be relatively stable and homogeneous, some research has shown novel learning through exposure alone. Monolinguals living in linguistically diverse contexts regularly overhear languages they do not understand, and may absorb information about those languages in ways that shape their language networks. The current study used behavioral and ERP measures to compare monolinguals living in a linguistically diverse environment and a unilingual environment in their ability to learn vowel harmony in Finnish. Monolinguals in both contexts demonstrated similar learning of studied words; however, their ERPs differed for generalization. Monolinguals in the diverse context revealed an anterior late positivity, whereas monolinguals in the unilingual context showed no effect. The results suggest that linguistic diversity promotes new language learning. ",
        "Elevated Anandamide, Enhanced Recall of Fear Extinction, and Attenuated Stress Responses Following Inhibition of Fatty Acid Amide Hydrolase: A Randomized, Controlled Experimental Medicine Trial. BACKGROUND: Posttraumatic stress disorder, an area of large unmet medical needs, is characterized by persistence of fear memories and maladaptive stress responses. In rodents, elevation of the endocannabinoid anandamide due to inhibition of fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) facilitates fear extinction and protects against the anxiogenic effects of stress. We recently reported that elevated anandamide levels in people homozygous for a loss-of-function FAAH mutation are associated with a similar phenotype, suggesting a translational validity of the preclinical findings. METHODS: In this double-blind, placebo-controlled experimental medicine study, healthy adults were randomized to an FAAH inhibitor (PF-04457845, 4 mg orally, once daily; n\u00a0= 16) or placebo (n\u00a0= 29) for 10 days. On days 9 and 10, participants completed a task battery assessing psychophysiological indices of fear learning, stress reactivity, and stress-induced affective responses. RESULTS: FAAH inhibition produced a 10-fold increase in baseline anandamide. This was associated with potentiated recall of fear extinction memory when tested 24 hours after extinction training. FAAH inhibition also attenuated autonomic stress reactivity, assessed via electrodermal activity, and protected against stress-induced negative affect, measured via facial electromyography. CONCLUSIONS: Our data provide preliminary human evidence that FAAH inhibition can improve the recall of fear extinction memories and attenuate the anxiogenic effects of stress, in a direct translation of rodent findings. The beneficial effects of FAAH inhibition on fear extinction, as well as stress- and affect-related behaviors, provide a strong rationale for developing this drug class as a treatment for posttraumatic stress disorder.

        "Genetic manipulation of cell line\u00a0derived reticulocytes enables dissection of host malaria invasion requirements. Investigating the role that host erythrocyte proteins play in malaria infection is hampered by the genetic intractability of this anucleate cell. Here we report that reticulocytes derived through in vitro differentiation of an enucleation-competent immortalized erythroblast cell line (BEL-A) support both successful invasion and intracellular development of the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum. Using CRISPR-mediated gene knockout and subsequent complementation, we validate an essential role for the erythrocyte receptor basigin in P. falciparum invasion and demonstrate rescue of invasive susceptibility by receptor re-expression. Successful invasion of reticulocytes complemented with a truncated mutant excludes a functional role for the basigin cytoplasmic domain during invasion. Contrastingly, knockout of cyclophilin B, reported to participate in invasion and interact with basigin, did not impact invasive susceptibility of reticulocytes. These data establish the use of reticulocytes derived from immortalized erythroblasts as a powerful model system to explore hypotheses regarding host receptor requirements for P. falciparum invasion.

        "Parenting Stress Undermines Mother-Child Brain-to-Brain Synchrony: A Hyperscanning Study. Synchrony refers to the coordinated interplay of behavioural and physiological signals that reflect the bi-directional attunement of one partner to the other's psychophysiological, cognitive, emotional, and behavioral state. In mother-child relationships, a synchronous pattern of interaction indicates parental sensitivity. Parenting stress has been shown to undermine mother-child behavioural synchrony. However, it has yet to be discerned whether parenting stress affects brain-to-brain synchrony during everyday joint activities. Here, we show that greater parenting stress is associated with less brain-to-brain synchrony in the medial left cluster of the prefrontal cortex when mother and child engage in a typical dyadic task of watching animation videos together. This brain region overlaps with the inferior frontal gyrus, the frontal eye field, and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, which are implicated in inference of mental states and social cognition. Our result demonstrates the adverse effect of parenting stress on mother-child attunement that is evident at a brain-to-brain level. Mother-child brain-to-brain asynchrony may underlie the robust association between parenting stress and poor dyadic co-regulation. We anticipate our study to form the foundation for future investigations into mechanisms by which parenting stress impairs the mother-child relationship. ",
        "Transient Hypoxemia Disrupts Anatomical and Functional Maturation of Preterm Fetal Ovine CA1 Pyramidal Neurons. Children who survive premature birth often exhibit reductions in hippocampal volumes and deficits in working memory. However, it is unclear whether synaptic plasticity and cellular mechanisms of learning and memory can be elicited or disrupted in the preterm fetal hippocampus. CA1 hippocampal neurons were exposed to two common insults to preterm brain: transient hypoxia-ischemia (HI) and hypoxia (Hx). We used a preterm fetal sheep model using both sexes in twin 0.65 gestation fetuses that reproduces the spectrum of injury and abnormal growth in preterm infants. Using Cavalieri measurements, hippocampal volumes were reduced in both Hx and HI fetuses compared with controls. This volume loss was not the result of neuronal cell death. Instead, morphometrics revealed alterations in both basal and apical dendritic arborization that were significantly associated with the level of systemic hypoxemia and metabolic stress regardless of etiology. Anatomical alterations of CA1 neurons were accompanied by reductions in probability of presynaptic glutamate release, long-term synaptic plasticity and intrinsic excitability. The reduction in intrinsic excitability was in part due to increased activity of the channels underlying the fast and slow component of the afterhyperpolarization in Hx and HI. Our studies suggest that even a single brief episode of hypoxemia can markedly disrupt hippocampal maturation. Hypoxemia may contribute to long-term working memory disturbances in preterm survivors by disrupting neuronal maturation with resultant functional disturbances in hippocampal action potential throughput. Strategies directed at limiting the duration or severity of hypoxemia during brain development may mitigate disturbances in hippocampal maturation.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Premature infants commonly sustain hypoxia-ischemia, which results in reduced hippocampal growth and life-long disturbances in learning and memory. We demonstrate that the circuitry related to synaptic plasticity and cellular mechanisms of learning and memory (LTP) are already functional in the fetal hippocampus. Unlike adults, the fetal hippocampus is surprisingly resistant to cell death from hypoxia-ischemia. However, the hippocampus sustains robust structural and functional disturbances in the dendritic maturation of CA1 neurons that are significantly associated with the magnitude of a brief hypoxic stress. Since transient hypoxic episodes occur commonly in preterm survivors, our findings suggest that the learning problems that ensue may be related to the unique susceptibility of the hippocampus to brief episodes of hypoxemia.

        "Blood-brain barrier permeable nano immunoconjugates induce local immune responses for glioma therapy. Brain glioma treatment with checkpoint inhibitor antibodies to cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (a-CTLA-4) and programmed cell death-1 (a-PD-1) was largely unsuccessful due to their inability to cross blood-brain barrier (BBB). Here we describe targeted nanoscale immunoconjugates (NICs) on natural biopolymer scaffold, poly(\u03b2-L-malic acid), with covalently attached a-CTLA-4 or a-PD-1 for systemic\u00a0delivery across the BBB and activation of local brain anti-tumor immune response. NIC treatment of mice bearing intracranial GL261 glioblastoma (GBM) results in an increase of CD8+ T cells, NK cells and macrophages with a decrease of regulatory T cells (Tregs) in the brain tumor area. Survival of GBM-bearing mice treated with NIC combination is significantly longer compared to animals treated with single checkpoint inhibitor-bearing NICs or free a-CTLA-4 and a-PD-1. Our study demonstrates trans-BBB delivery of tumor-targeted polymer-conjugated checkpoint inhibitors as an effective GBM treatment via activation of both systemic and local privileged brain tumor immune response.

        "Driving Cessation and Social Isolation in Older Adults. Objective: This study investigated the impact of driving cessation on social isolation in older adults. Method: Data were obtained from Rounds 1 through 6 of the National Health and Aging Trends Study. The study sample consisted of 6,916 Medicare beneficiaries aged 65 or above who were eligible drivers at baseline. Mixed-effects ordered logistic regression and piecewise regression were used to examine the impact of driving cessation on social isolation. Results: In multivariable mixed-effects ordered logistic regression, past-year nondrivers had a twofold increase in the odds of being in a higher social isolation category (odds ratio [OR] = 2.1, p < .001). Piecewise regression analysis showed that social isolation scores increased by 0.08 points (p = .024) following an incident of driving cessation. Discussion: Driving cessation is associated with a higher risk of social isolation in older adults. Interventions to reduce social isolation among older adults may improve public health by targeting older adults who have recently stopped driving. ",
        "Incidence and Demographic Burden of HPV-Associated Oropharyngeal Head and Neck Cancers in the United States. BACKGROUND: Human papillomavirus (HPV)-positive oropharyngeal head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) is increasing in the United States. Current epidemiologic assessments of the national burden of HPV-positive OPSCC are needed. METHODS: The Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results HPV Status Database included 12,017 patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma of pharyngeal subsites, including OPSCC and non-OPSCC head and neck cancer subsites (hypopharynx, nasopharynx, and \"other pharynx\"), diagnosed from 2013 to 2014. Age-adjusted incidence rates per 100,000 persons by HPV status were calculated. An exploratory Fine-Gray competing-risks regression determined the associations between HPV status and cancer-specific mortality. RESULTS: From 2013 to 2014, the U.S. incidence of HPV-positive OPSCC was 4.62 [95% confidence interval (CI), 4.51-4.73] versus 1.82 (95% CI, 1.75-1.89) per 100,000 persons for HPV-negative OPSCC. The incidence of HPV-positive versus negative non-OPSCC of the head and neck was 0.62 (95% CI, 0.58-0.66) versus 1.38 (95% CI, 1.32-1.44). White race (5.47) and male sex (8.00) had the highest incidences of HPV-positive OPSCC, with a unimodal age incidence distribution peaking at ages 60 to 64 years (27.23). HPV positivity was associated with lower cancer-specific mortality than HPV-negative disease for OPSCC [adjusted HR (aHR), 0.40; P < 0.001], but not non-OPSCC (aHR, 1.08; P = 0.81), Pinteraction = 0.002. CONCLUSIONS: The U.S. incidence of HPV-positive OPSCC was 4.62 per 100,000 persons. Most cases were found in white male patients younger than 65 years, where it represents the sixth most common incident nonskin cancer. The favorable prognosis associated with HPV appears to be limited to the oropharynx. IMPACT: This large population-based epidemiologic assessment of the U.S. population defines the incidence and demographic burden of HPV-positive OPSCC. ",
        "Dermal and muscle fibroblasts and skeletal myofibers survive chikungunya virus infection and harbor persistent RNA. Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is an arthritogenic alphavirus that acutely causes fever as well as severe joint and muscle pain. Chronic musculoskeletal pain persists in a substantial fraction of patients for months to years after the initial infection, yet we still have a poor understanding of what promotes chronic disease. While replicating virus has not been detected in joint-associated tissues of patients with persistent arthritis nor in various animal models at convalescent time points, viral RNA is detected months after acute infection. To identify the cells that might contribute to pathogenesis during this chronic phase, we developed a recombinant CHIKV that expresses Cre recombinase (CHIKV-3'-Cre). CHIKV-3'-Cre replicated in myoblasts and fibroblasts, and it induced arthritis during the acute phase in mice. Importantly, it also induced chronic disease, including persistent viral RNA and chronic myositis and synovitis similar to wild-type virus. CHIKV-3'-Cre infection of tdTomato reporter mice resulted in a population of tdTomato+ cells that persisted for at least 112 days. Immunofluorescence and flow cytometric profiling revealed that these tdTomato+ cells predominantly were myofibers and dermal and muscle fibroblasts. Treatment with an antibody against Mxra8, a recently defined host receptor for CHIKV, reduced the number of tdTomato+ cells in the chronic phase and diminished the levels of chronic viral RNA, implicating these tdTomato+ cells as the reservoir of chronic viral RNA. Finally, isolation and flow cytometry-based sorting of the tdTomato+ fibroblasts from the skin and ankle and analysis for viral RNA revealed that the tdTomato+ cells harbor most of the persistent CHIKV RNA at chronic time points. Therefore, this CHIKV-3'-Cre and tdTomato reporter mouse system identifies the cells that survive CHIKV infection in vivo and are enriched for persistent CHIKV RNA. This model represents a useful tool for studying CHIKV pathogenesis in the acute and chronic stages of disease. ",
        "A scoping review of post opioid-overdose interventions. INTRODUCTION: Nonfatal opioid overdose is a significant risk factor for subsequent fatal overdose. The time after a nonfatal overdose may provide a critical engagement opportunity to both reduce subsequent overdose risk and link individuals to treatment. Post-overdose interventions have emerged in affected communities throughout the United States (US). The objective of this scoping review is to identify US-based post-overdose intervention models (1) described in peer-reviewed literature and (2) implemented in public health and community settings. METHODS: Using the adapted PRISMA Checklist for Scoping Reviews, we searched PubMed, PsychInfo, Academic OneFile, and federal and state databases for peer-reviewed and gray literature descriptions of post-overdose programs. We developed search strings with a reference librarian. We included studies or programs with at least the following information available: name of program, description of key components, intervention team, and intervention timing. RESULTS: We identified a total of 27 programs, 3 from the peer-reviewed literature and 24 from the gray literature. 9 programs operated out of the ED, while 18 programs provided post-overdose support in other ways: through home or overdose location visits, mobile means, or as law enforcement diversion. Commonly, they include partnerships among public safety and community service providers. CONCLUSIONS: Programs are emerging throughout the US to care for individuals after a nonfatal opioid overdose. There is variability in the timing, components, and follow-up in these programs and little is known about their effectiveness. Future work should focus on evaluation and testing of post-overdose programs so that best practices for care can be implemented. ",
        "Roles of three distinct neurogenic motor patterns during pellet propulsion in guinea-pig distal colon. KEY POINTS: Enteric neural circuits enable isolated preparations of guinea-pig distal colon to propel solid and fluid contents by a self-sustaining neuromechanical loop process. In addition there are at least three neural mechanisms which are not directly involved in propulsion: cyclic motor complexes, transient neural events and distal colon migrating motor complexes. In excised guinea-pig colon we simultaneously recorded high resolution manometry, video-imaging of colonic wall movements and electrophysiological recordings from smooth muscle, which enabled us to identify mechanisms that underlie the propulsion of colonic content. The results show that the intermittent propulsion during emptying of the multiple natural faecal pellets is due to the intermittent activation of cyclic motor complexes and this is facilitated by transient neural events. Loss or dysfunction of these activities is likely to underlie disordered gastrointestinal transit. ABSTRACT: It is well known that there are different patterns of electrical activity in smooth muscle cells along different regions of the gastrointestinal tract. These different patterns can be generated by myogenic and/or neurogenic mechanisms. However, what patterns of electrical activity underlie the propulsion of natural faecal content remains unknown, particularly along the large intestine, where large quantities of water are reabsorbed and semi-solid faeces form. In this study, we developed a novel approach which enables for the first time the simultaneous recording of high resolution intraluminal manometry, electrophysiology from the smooth muscle, and spatio-temporal video imaging of colonic wall movements. Using this approach we were able to reveal the nature of enteric neuromuscular transmission and patterns of motor activity responsible for the movement of content. Three distinct neurogenic patterns of electrical activity were recorded even in the absence of propulsive movement. These were the cyclic motor complexes (CMCs), the transient neural events (TNEs) and the slowly propagating distal colonic migrating motor complexes (DCMMCs). We present evidence that the initiation of pellet propulsion is due to a cyclic motor complex (CMC) occurring oral to the pellet. Furthermore, we discovered that the intermittent propulsion of natural faecal pellets is generated by intermittent activation of CMCs; and this propulsion is facilitated by hexamethonium-sensitive TNEs. However, TNEs were not required for propulsion. The findings reveal the patterns of electrical activity that underlie propulsion of natural colonic content and demonstrate that propulsion is generated by a complex interplay between distinct enteric neural circuits.

        "IL-1R3 blockade broadly attenuates the functions of six members of the IL-1 family, revealing their contribution to models of disease. Interleukin (IL)-1R3 is the co-receptor in three signaling pathways that involve six cytokines of the IL-1 family (IL-1\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-33, IL-36\u03b1, IL-36\u03b2 and IL-36\u03b3). In many diseases, multiple cytokines contribute to disease pathogenesis. For example, in asthma, both IL-33 and IL-1 are of major importance, as are IL-36 and IL-1 in psoriasis. We developed a blocking monoclonal antibody (mAb) to human IL-1R3 (MAB-hR3) and demonstrate here that this antibody specifically inhibits signaling via IL-1, IL-33 and IL-36 in vitro. Also, in three distinct in vivo models of disease (crystal-induced peritonitis, allergic airway inflammation and psoriasis), we found that targeting IL-1R3 with a single mAb to mouse IL-1R3 (MAB-mR3) significantly attenuated heterogeneous cytokine-driven inflammation and disease severity. We conclude that in diseases driven by multiple cytokines, a single antagonistic agent such as a mAb to IL-1R3 is a therapeutic option with considerable translational benefit. ",
        "Host-Microbe-Drug-Nutrient Screen Identifies Bacterial Effectors of Metformin Therapy. Metformin is the first-line therapy for treating type 2 diabetes and a promising anti-aging drug. We set out to address the fundamental question of how gut microbes and nutrition, key regulators of host physiology, affect the effects of metformin. Combining two tractable genetic models, the bacterium E.\u00a0coli and the nematode C.\u00a0elegans, we developed a high-throughput four-way screen to define the underlying host-microbe-drug-nutrient interactions. We show that microbes integrate cues from metformin and the diet through the phosphotransferase signaling pathway that converges on the transcriptional regulator Crp. A detailed experimental characterization of metformin effects downstream of Crp in combination with metabolic modeling of the microbiota in metformin-treated type 2 diabetic patients predicts the production of microbial agmatine, a regulator of metformin effects on host lipid metabolism and lifespan. Our high-throughput screening platform paves the way for identifying exploitable drug-nutrient-microbiome interactions to improve host health and longevity through targeted microbiome therapies.

        "Complex Oscillatory Waves Emerging from Cortical Organoids Model Early Human Brain Network Development. Structural and transcriptional changes during early brain maturation follow fixed developmental programs defined by genetics. However, whether this is true for functional network activity remains unknown, primarily due to experimental inaccessibility of the initial stages of the living human brain. Here, we developed human cortical organoids that dynamically change cellular populations during maturation and exhibited consistent increases in electrical activity over the span of several months. The spontaneous network formation displayed periodic and regular oscillatory events that were dependent on glutamatergic and GABAergic signaling. The oscillatory activity transitioned to more spatiotemporally irregular patterns, and synchronous network events resembled features similar to those observed in preterm human electroencephalography. These results show that the development of structured network activity in a human neocortex model may follow stable genetic programming. Our approach provides opportunities for investigating and manipulating the role of network activity in the developing human cortex. ",
        "Helicobacter pylori senses bleach (HOCl) as a chemoattractant using a cytosolic chemoreceptor. The gastric pathogen Helicobacter pylori requires a noncanonical cytosolic chemoreceptor transducer-like protein D (TlpD) for efficient colonization of the mammalian stomach. Here, we reconstituted a complete chemotransduction signaling complex in vitro with TlpD and the chemotaxis (Che) proteins CheW and CheA, enabling quantitative assays for potential chemotaxis ligands. We found that TlpD is selectively sensitive at micromolar concentrations to bleach (hypochlorous acid, HOCl), a potent antimicrobial produced by neutrophil myeloperoxidase during inflammation. HOCl acts as a chemoattractant by reversibly oxidizing a conserved cysteine within a 3His/1Cys Zn-binding motif in TlpD that inactivates the chemotransduction signaling complex. We found that H. pylori is resistant to killing by millimolar concentrations of HOCl and responds to HOCl in the micromolar range by increasing its smooth-swimming behavior, leading to chemoattraction to HOCl sources. We show related protein domains from Salmonella enterica and Escherichia coli possess similar reactivity toward HOCl. We propose that this family of proteins enables host-associated bacteria to sense sites of tissue inflammation, a strategy that H. pylori uses to aid in colonizing and persisting in inflamed gastric tissue.

        "Deficits in Enrichment-Dependent Neurogenesis and Enhanced Anxiety Behaviors Mediated by Expression of Alzheimer's Disease-Linked Ps1 Variants Are Rescued by Microglial Depletion. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that presently affects an estimated 5.7 million Americans. Understanding the basis for this disease is key for the development of a future successful treatment. In this effort, we previously reported that mouse prion protein-promoter-driven, ubiquitous expression of familial AD (FAD)-linked human PSEN1 variants in transgenic mice impairs environmental enrichment (EE)-induced proliferation and neurogenesis of adult hippocampal neural progenitor cells (AHNPCs) and in a non-cell autonomous manner. These findings were confirmed in PS1M146V/+ mice that harbor an FAD-linked mutation in the endogenous PSEN1 gene. We now demonstrate that CSF1R antagonist-mediated microglial depletion in transgenic male mice expressing mutant presenilin 1 (PS1) or PS1M146V/+ \"knock-in\" mice leads to a complete rescue of deficits in proliferation, differentiation and survival of AHNPCs. Moreover, microglia depletion suppressed the heightened baseline anxiety behavior observed in transgenic mice expressing mutant PS1 and PS1M146V/+ mice to levels observed in mice expressing wild-type human PS1 or nontransgenic mice, respectively. These findings demonstrate that in mice expressing FAD-linked PS1, microglia play a critical role in the regulation of EE-dependent AHNPC proliferation and neurogenesis and the modulation of affective behaviors.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Inheritance of mutations in genes encoding presenilin 1 (PS1) causes familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD). Mutant PS1 expression enhances the levels and assembly of toxic A\u03b242 peptides and impairs the self-renewal and neuronal differentiation of adult hippocampal neural progenitor cells (AHNPCs) following environmental enrichment (EE) that is associated with heightened baseline anxiety. We now show that microglial depletion fully restores the EE-mediated impairments in AHNPC phenotypes and suppresses the heightened baseline anxiety observed in mice expressing FAD-linked PS1. Thus, we conclude that the memory deficits and anxiety-related behaviors in patients with PS1 mutations is a reflection not just of an increase in the levels of A\u03b242 peptides, but to impairments in the self-renewal and neuronal differentiation of AHNPCs that modulate affective behaviors.

        "Notch Coordinates Periodontal Ligament Maturation through Regulating Lamin A. Tooth eruption is a continuous biological process with dynamic changes at cellular and tissue levels, particularly within the periodontal ligament (PDL). Occlusion completion is a significant physiological landmark of dentition establishment. However, the importance of the involvement of molecular networks engaging in occlusion establishment on the final PDL maturation is still largely unknown. In this study, using rat and mouse molar teeth and a human PDL cell line for RNAseq and proteomic analysis, we systematically screened the key molecular links in regulating PDL maturation before and after occlusion establishment. We discovered Notch, a key molecular pathway in regulating stem cell fate and differentiation, is a major player in the event. Intercepting the Notch pathway by deleting its key canonical transcriptional factor, RBP-Jkappa, using a conditional knockout strategy in the mice delayed PDL maturation. We also identified that Lamin A, a cell nuclear lamina member, is a unique marker of PDL maturation, and its expression is under the control of Notch signaling. Our study therefore provides a deep insight of how PDL maturation is regulated at the molecular level, and we expect the outcomes to be applied for a better understanding of the molecular regulation networks in physiological conditions such as tooth eruption and movement and also for periodontal diseases.

        "Prevalence and Consequences of the Nonmedical Use of Amphetamine Among Persons Calling Poison Control Centers. Objective: To describe consequences of the nonmedical use (NMU) of prescription amphetamines (AMPs). Method: Data from the U.S. National Poison Data System yielded four groups: intravenous NMU (IV NMU) intentionally injected AMP, Nasal NMU intentionally inhaled AMP but did not inject, Oral NMU intentionally ingested AMP, and controls reported unintentional oral exposure to AMP. Results: The Nasal NMU group was at greater risk of admission to a health care facility. All NMU groups were at greater risk for adverse clinical effects. IV NMU had the greatest number of adverse effects, followed by Nasal and Oral NMU. Nasal NMU had a greater risk for major medical outcomes versus Oral NMU. The IV NMU group was 21.9 times more likely to die from AMP NMU than controls. Oral NMU conferred a significantly greater risk of suicide attempts. Conclusion: Oral and nonoral NMU of AMP are associated with significant risks of morbidity and mortality. ",
        "Neurobiological roots of psychopathy. Psychopathy is an extreme form of antisocial behavior, with about 1% prevalence in the general population, and 10-30% among incarcerated criminal offenders. Although the heritability of severe antisocial behavior is up to 50%, the genetic background is unclear. The underlying molecular mechanisms have remained unknown but several previous studies suggest that abnormal glucose metabolism and opioidergic neurotransmission contribute to violent offending and psychopathy. Here we show using iPSC-derived cortical neurons and astrocytes from six incarcerated extremely antisocial and violent offenders, three nonpsychopathic individuals with substance abuse, and six healthy controls that there are robust alterations in the expression of several genes and immune response-related molecular pathways which were specific for psychopathy. In neurons, psychopathy was associated with marked upregulation of RPL10P9 and ZNF132, and downregulation of CDH5 and OPRD1. In astrocytes, RPL10P9 and MT-RNR2 were upregulated. Expression of aforementioned genes explained 30-92% of the variance of psychopathic symptoms. The gene expression findings were confirmed with qPCR. These genes may be relevant to the lack of empathy and emotional callousness seen in psychopathy, since several studies have linked these genes to autism and social interaction. ",
        "Family Perceptions of Quality of End-of-Life Care for Veterans with Advanced CKD. BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Little is known about the quality of end-of-life care for patients with advanced CKD. We describe the relationship between patterns of end-of-life care and dialysis treatment with family-reported quality of end-of-life care in this population. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: We designed a retrospective observational study among a national cohort of 9993 veterans with advanced CKD who died in Department of Veterans Affairs facilities between 2009 and 2015. We used logistic regression to evaluate associations between patterns of end-of-life care and receipt of dialysis (no dialysis, acute dialysis, maintenance dialysis) with family-reported quality of end-of-life care. RESULTS: Overall, 52% of cohort members spent \u22652 weeks in the hospital in the last 90 days of life, 34% received an intensive procedure, and 47% were admitted to the intensive care unit, in the last 30 days, 31% died in the intensive care unit, 38% received a palliative care consultation in the last 90 days, and 36% were receiving hospice services at the time of death. Most (55%) did not receive dialysis, 12% received acute dialysis, and 34% received maintenance dialysis. Patients treated with acute or maintenance dialysis had more intensive patterns of end-of-life care than those not treated with dialysis. After adjustment for patient and facility characteristics, receipt of maintenance (but not acute) dialysis and more intensive patterns of end-of-life care were associated with lower overall family ratings of end-of-life care, whereas receipt of palliative care and hospice services were associated with higher overall ratings. The association between maintenance dialysis and overall quality of care was attenuated after additional adjustment for end-of-life treatment patterns. CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with advanced CKD, care focused on life extension rather than comfort was associated with lower family ratings of end-of-life care regardless of whether patients had received dialysis.

        "A null model of the mouse whole-neocortex micro-connectome. In connectomics, the study of the network structure of connected neurons, great advances are being made on two different scales: that of macro- and meso-scale connectomics, studying the connectivity between populations of neurons, and that of micro-scale connectomics, studying connectivity between individual neurons. We combine these two complementary views of connectomics to build a first draft statistical model of the micro-connectome of a whole mouse neocortex based on available data on region-to-region connectivity and individual whole-brain axon reconstructions. This process reveals a targeting principle that allows us to predict the innervation logic of individual axons from meso-scale data. The resulting connectome recreates biological trends of targeting on all scales and predicts that an established principle of scale invariant topological organization of connectivity can be extended down to the level of individual neurons. It can serve as a powerful null model and as a substrate for whole-brain simulations. ",
        "Use of gabapentinoid medications among US adults with cancer, 2005-2015. BACKGROUND: Gabapentinoid use for long-term cancer pain control may be problematic, given unclear mechanisms of action and increased concerns for physical dependence. The purpose of this report is to examine trends of gabapentinoid use among US adults with cancer from 2005 to 2015. METHODS: We conducted a serial, cross-sectional study using data from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS). We performed multiple logistic regression to examine the annual percentages of gabapentinoid users, which were adjusted for age, sex, and US region of residence. The amount of gabapentinoid prescriptions filled in 2015 was also estimated. RESULTS: The adjusted percentage of gabapentinoid users in 2015 was 5.60% (3.79%, 7.41%), 2.39 times greater than the percentage in 2005 (p < .001). By 2015, the number of gabapentinoid prescriptions had grown to approximately 3.52 million (2.40 million, 4.65 million). CONCLUSION: We observed greater than a twofold increase in the trend of gabapentinoid medication use among US adults with cancer. Investigations on the long-term efficacy of gabapentinoids for complex pain syndromes, and mitigation of risks, is essential to guide informed clinical management and keep patients safe. ",
        "Transient heat release during induced mitochondrial proton uncoupling. Non-shivering thermogenesis through mitochondrial proton uncoupling is one of the dominant thermoregulatory mechanisms crucial for normal cellular functions. The metabolic pathway for intracellular temperature rise has widely been considered as steady-state substrate oxidation. Here, we show that a transient proton motive force (pmf) dissipation is more dominant than steady-state substrate oxidation in stimulated thermogenesis. Using transient intracellular thermometry during stimulated proton uncoupling in neurons of Aplysia californica, we observe temperature spikes of ~7.5\u2009K that decay over two time scales: a rapid decay of ~4.8\u2009K over ~1\u2009s followed by a slower decay over ~17\u2009s. The rapid decay correlates well in time with transient electrical heating from proton transport across the mitochondrial inner membrane. Beyond ~33\u2009s, we do not observe any heating from intracellular sources, including substrate oxidation and pmf dissipation. Our measurements demonstrate the utility of transient thermometry in better understanding the thermochemistry of mitochondrial metabolism. ",
        "Association Between Declined Offers of Deceased Donor Kidney Allograft and Outcomes in Kidney Transplant Candidates. Importance: In the United States, substantial disparities in access to kidney transplant exist for wait-listed candidates with end-stage renal disease. The implications of transplant centers' willingness to accept kidney offers for access to transplant and mortality outcomes are unknown. Objective: To determine the outcomes for wait-listed kidney transplant candidates after the transplant center's refusal of a deceased donor kidney offer. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study obtained data from the United Network for Organ Sharing Potential Transplant Recipient data set on all deceased donor kidney offers in the United States made between January 1, 2008, and December 31, 2015. The final study cohort included adult patients who were wait-listed for kidney transplant and received at least 1 allograft offer during the study period (N\u2009=\u2009280\u202f041). Data analysis was conducted from June 1, 2018, to March 30, 2019. Exposure: Candidate state of residence. Main Outcomes and Measures: Waiting list outcome event groups included received deceased donor allograft, received living donor allograft, died while on the waiting list, removed from the waiting list without a transplant, or still on the waiting list at the end of follow-up. Results: Among the 280\u202f041 kidney transplant candidates included in the study, the mean (SD) age at wait-listing was 51.1 (13.1) years, and male patients were predominant (171 517 [61.2%]). In this cohort, 81 750 candidates (29.2%) received a deceased donor kidney allograft, 30 870 (11.0%) received a living donor allograft, 25 967 (9.3%) died while on the waiting list, and 59 359 (21.2%) were removed from the waiting list. Overall, 10 candidates with at least 1 previous allograft offer died each day during the study period. Time to first offer was similar for candidates who received deceased donor kidney allograft compared with those who died while waiting (median [interquartile range {IQR}] time, 79 [16-426] days vs 78 [17-401] days, respectively). Deceased donor allograft recipients had a median of 17 offers (IQR, 6-44) over 422 days (IQR, 106-909 days), whereas candidates who died while waiting received a median of 16 offers (IQR, 6-41) over 651 days (IQR, 304-1117 days). Most kidneys (84%) were declined on behalf of at least 1 candidate before being accepted for transplant. As reported by centers, organ or donor quality concerns accounted for 8 416 474 (92.6%) of all declined offers, whereas offers were infrequently refused because of patient-related factors (232 193 [2.6%]), logistical limitations (49 492 [0.5%]), or other concerns. The odds of death after an offer and the median number of offers received prior to death varied considerably by state. Conclusions and Relevance: This study found that transplant candidates appeared to receive a large number of viable deceased donor kidney offers that were refused on their behalf by transplant centers, potentially exacerbating the detrimental consequences of the organ shortage; increased transparency in organ allocation process and decisions may improve patient-centered care and access to kidney transplant.

        "Evaluating the Economic Impact of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgical Efforts in the Developing World: The ReSurge Experience. BACKGROUND: As the global burden of disease continues to rise, it becomes increasingly important to determine the sustainability of specialty surgery in the developing world. The authors aim to (1) evaluate the cost-effectiveness of plastic and reconstructive surgery in the developing world and (2) quantify the economic benefit. METHODS: In this study, the authors performed a retrospective analysis of surgical trips performed by ReSurge International from 2014 to 2017. The organization gathered data on trip information, cost, and clinical characteristics. The authors measured the cost-effectiveness of the interventions using cost per disability-adjusted life-years and defined cost-effectiveness using World Health Organization Choosing Interventions That Are Cost-Effective thresholds. The authors also performed a cost-to-benefit analysis using the human capital approach. RESULTS: A total of 22 surgical trips from eight different developing countries were included in this study. The authors analyzed a total of 756 surgical interventions. The cost-effectiveness of the surgical trips ranged from $52 to $11,410 per disability-adjusted life-year averted. The economic benefit for the 22 surgical trips was $9,795,384. According to World Health Organization Choosing Interventions That Are Cost-Effective thresholds, 21 of the surgical trips were considered very cost-effective or cost-effective. CONCLUSIONS: Plastic and reconstructive operations performed during short-term surgical trips performed by this organization are economically sustainable. High-volume trips and those treating complex surgical conditions prove to be the most cost-effective. To continue to receive monetary funding, providing fiscally sustainable surgical care to low- and middle-income countries is imperative. ",
        "Comparable Rates of Integrated Myofibrillar Protein Synthesis Between Endurance-Trained Master Athletes and Untrained Older Individuals. Background: An impaired muscle anabolic response to exercise and protein nutrition is thought to underpin age-related muscle loss, which may be exacerbated by aspects of biological aging that may not be present in older individuals who have undertaken long-term high-level exercise training, or master athletes (MA). The aim of this study was to compare rested-state and exercise-induced rates of integrated myofibrillar protein synthesis (iMyoPS) and intracellular signaling in endurance trained MA and healthy age-matched untrained individuals (Older Controls). Methods: In a parallel study design, iMyoPS rates were determined over 48 h in the rested-state and following a bout of unaccustomed resistance exercise (RE) in OC (n = 8 males; 73.5 \u00b1 3.3 years) and endurance-trained MA (n = 7 males; 68.9 \u00b1 5.7 years). Intramuscular anabolic signaling was also determined. During the iMyoPS measurement period, physical activity was monitored via accelerometry and dietary intake was controlled. Results: Anthropometrics, habitual activity, and dietary intake were similar between groups. There was no difference in rested-state rates of iMyoPS between OC (1.47 \u00b1 0.06%\u22c5day-1) and MA (1.46 \u00b1 0.08%\u22c5day-1). RE significantly increased iMyoPS above rest in both OC (1.60 \u00b1 0.08%\u22c5day-1, P < 0.01) and MA (1.61 \u00b1 0.08%\u22c5day-1, P < 0.01), with no difference between groups. Akt Thr308 phosphorylation increased at 1 h post-RE in OC (P < 0.05), but not MA. No other between-group differences in intramuscular signaling were apparent at any time-point. Conclusion: While our sample size is limited, these data suggest that rested-state and RE-induced iMyoPS are indistinguishable between MA and OC. Importantly, the OC retain a capacity for RE-induced stimulation of skeletal muscle remodeling. ",
        "Unique genetic basis of the distinct antibiotic potency of high acetic acid production in the probiotic yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae var. boulardii. The yeast Saccharomyces boulardii has been used worldwide as a popular, commercial probiotic, but the basis of its probiotic action remains obscure. It is considered conspecific with budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which is generally used in classical food applications. They have an almost identical genome sequence, making the genetic basis of probiotic potency in S. boulardii puzzling. We now show that S. boulardii produces at 37\u00b0C unusually high levels of acetic acid, which is strongly inhibitory to bacterial growth in agar-well diffusion assays and could be vital for its unique application as a probiotic among yeasts. Using pooled-segregant whole-genome sequence analysis with S. boulardii and S. cerevisiae parent strains, we succeeded in mapping the underlying QTLs and identified mutant alleles of SDH1 and WHI2 as the causative alleles. Both genes contain a SNP unique to S. boulardii (sdh1F317Y and whi2S287*) and are fully responsible for its high acetic acid production. S. boulardii strains show different levels of acetic acid production, depending on the copy number of the whi2S287* allele. Our results offer the first molecular explanation as to why S. boulardii could exert probiotic action as opposed to S. cerevisiae They reveal for the first time the molecular-genetic basis of a probiotic action-related trait in S. boulardii and show that antibacterial potency of a probiotic microorganism can be due to strain-specific mutations within the same species. We suggest that acquisition of antibacterial activity through medium acidification offered a selective advantage to S. boulardii in its ecological niche and for its application as a probiotic. ",
        "Temporal Dynamics of Transdermal Alcohol Concentration Measured via New-Generation Wrist-Worn Biosensor. BACKGROUND: The development of a transdermal alcohol biosensor could represent a tremendous advance toward curbing problematic drinking. But several factors limit the usefulness of extant transdermal technology, including relatively lengthy delays between blood alcohol concentration (BAC) and transdermal alcohol concentration (TAC), as well as the large/bulky designs of currently available transdermal sensors (e.g., ankle monitors). The current research examined the lag time between BAC and TAC using a prototype of BACtrack Skyn-a new-generation wrist-worn transdermal sensor featuring a compact design and smartphone integration. METHODS: Participants (N\u00a0=\u00a030) received either a dose of alcohol (target BAC 0.08%) or a nonalcoholic beverage in the laboratory while wearing both the AMS SCRAM ankle monitor and a Skyn prototype. Participants were monitored in the laboratory until breath alcohol concentration (BrAC) dropped below 0.025%. RESULTS: Device failure rates for Skyn prototypes were relatively high (18 to 38%) compared with nonprototype SCRAM devices (2%). Among participants with usable data, both Skyn- and SCRAM-measured TAC showed strong correlations with BrAC, and both Skyn and SCRAM devices detected alcohol within 30\u00a0minutes of first alcohol administration. Skyn-measured TAC peaked over 1\u00a0hour earlier than SCRAM-measured TAC (54 versus 120\u00a0minutes after peak BrAC, respectively), and time-series models suggested that, on average across all measured portions of the BrAC curve, Skyn TAC lagged behind BrAC by 24\u00a0minutes, whereas SCRAM TAC lagged behind BrAC by 69\u00a0minutes-all differences statistically significant at p\u00a0<\u00a00.001. CONCLUSIONS: Results provide preliminary evidence for the validity of a new-generation wrist-worn transdermal sensor under controlled laboratory conditions and further suggest favorable properties of this sensor as they pertain to the latency of transdermal alcohol detection. The prototype version of Skyn employed here displayed a higher failure rate compared with SCRAM, and, in future, more reliable and robust Skyn prototypes will be required suitable to field testing across diverse environmental conditions.

        "Fine Particle Air Pollution and Physiological Reactivity to Social Stress in Adolescence: The Moderating Role of Anxiety and Depression. OBJECTIVE: Exposure to high levels of fine particle air pollution (PM2.5) is associated with adolescent pathophysiology. It is unclear, however, if PM2.5 is associated with physiology within psychosocial contexts, such as social stress, and whether some adolescents are particularly vulnerable to PM2.5-related adverse effects. This study examined the association between PM2.5 and autonomic reactivity to social stress in adolescents and tested whether symptoms of anxiety and depression moderated this association. METHODS: Adolescents from Northern California (N = 144) participated in a modified Trier Social Stress Test while providing high-frequency heart rate variability and skin conductance level data. PM2.5 data were recorded from CalEnviroScreen. Adolescents reported on their own symptoms of anxiety and depression using the Youth Self-Report, which has been used in prior studies and has good psychometric properties (Cronbach's \u03b1 in this sample was .86). RESULTS: Adolescents residing in neighborhoods characterized by higher concentrations of PM2.5 demonstrated greater autonomic reactivity (i.e., indexed by lower heart rate variability and higher skin conductance level) (\u03b2 = .27; b = .44, p = .001, 95% CI = 0.19 to 0.68) in response to social stress; this association was not accounted for by socioeconomic factors. In addition, adolescents who reported more severe anxiety and depression symptoms showed the strongest association between PM2.5 and autonomic reactivity to social stress (\u03b2 = .53; b = .86, p < .001, 95% CI = 0.48 to 1.23). CONCLUSIONS: Exposure to PM2.5 may heighten adolescent physiological reactivity to social stressors. Moreover, adolescents who experience anxiety and depression may be particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of PM2.5 on stress reactivity. ",
        "Epigenetic loss of RNA-methyltransferase NSUN5 in glioma targets ribosomes to drive a stress adaptive translational program. Tumors have aberrant proteomes that often do not match their corresponding transcriptome profiles. One possible cause of this discrepancy is the existence of aberrant RNA modification landscapes in the so-called epitranscriptome. Here, we report that human glioma cells undergo DNA methylation-associated epigenetic silencing of NSUN5, a candidate RNA methyltransferase for 5-methylcytosine. In this setting, NSUN5 exhibits tumor-suppressor characteristics in vivo glioma models. We also found that NSUN5 loss generates an unmethylated status at the C3782 position of 28S rRNA that drives an overall depletion of protein synthesis, and leads to the emergence of an adaptive translational program for survival under conditions of cellular stress. Interestingly, NSUN5 epigenetic inactivation also renders these gliomas sensitive to bioactivatable substrates of the stress-related enzyme NQO1. Most importantly, NSUN5 epigenetic inactivation is a hallmark of glioma patients with long-term survival for this otherwise devastating disease. ",
        "Aberrant axon branching via Fos-B dysregulation in FUS-ALS motor neurons. BACKGROUND: The characteristic structure of motor neurons (MNs), particularly of the long axons, becomes damaged in the early stages of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). However, the molecular pathophysiology of axonal degeneration remains to be fully elucidated. METHOD: Two sets of isogenic human-induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSCs)-derived MNs possessing the single amino acid difference (p.H517D) in the fused in sarcoma (FUS) were constructed. By combining MN reporter lentivirus, MN specific phenotype was analyzed. Moreover, RNA profiling of isolated axons were conducted by applying the microfluidic devices that enable axon bundles to be produced for omics analysis. The relationship between the target gene, which was identified as a pathological candidate in ALS with RNA-sequencing, and the MN phenotype was confirmed by intervention with si-RNA or overexpression to hiPSCs-derived MNs and even in vivo. The commonality was further confirmed with other ALS-causative mutant hiPSCs-derived MNs and human pathology. FINDINGS: We identified aberrant increasing of axon branchings in FUS-mutant hiPSCs-derived MN axons compared with isogenic controls as a novel phenotype. We identified increased level of Fos-B mRNA, the binding target of FUS, in FUS-mutant MNs. While Fos-B reduction using si-RNA or an inhibitor ameliorated the observed aberrant axon branching, Fos-B overexpression resulted in aberrant axon branching even in vivo. The commonality of those phenotypes was further confirmed with other ALS causative mutation than FUS. INTERPRETATION: Analyzing the axonal fraction of hiPSC-derived MNs using microfluidic devices revealed that Fos-B is a key regulator of FUS-mutant axon branching.

        "Evidence for bidirectional and trans-synaptic parasympathetic and sympathetic propagation of alpha-synuclein in rats. The conversion of endogenous alpha-synuclein (asyn) to pathological asyn-enriched aggregates is a hallmark of Parkinson's disease (PD). These inclusions can be detected in the central and enteric nervous system (ENS). Moreover, gastrointestinal symptoms can appear up to 20\u00a0years before the diagnosis of PD. The dual-hit hypothesis posits that pathological asyn aggregation starts in the ENS, and retrogradely spreads to the brain. In this study, we tested this hypothesis by directly injecting preformed asyn fibrils into the duodenum wall of wild-type rats and transgenic rats with excess levels of human asyn. We provide a meticulous characterization of the bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) transgenic rat model with respect to initial propagation of pathological asyn along the parasympathetic and sympathetic pathways to the brainstem, by performing immunohistochemistry at early time points post-injection. Induced pathology was observed in all key structures along the sympathetic and parasympathetic pathways (ENS, autonomic ganglia, intermediolateral nucleus of the spinal cord (IML), heart, dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus, and locus coeruleus (LC)) and persisted for at least 4\u00a0months post-injection. In contrast, asyn propagation was not detected in wild-type rats, nor in vehicle-injected BAC rats. The presence of pathology in the IML, LC, and heart indicate trans-synaptic spread of the pathology. Additionally, the observed asyn inclusions in the stomach and heart may indicate secondary anterograde propagation after initial retrograde spreading. In summary, trans-synaptic propagation of asyn in the BAC rat model is fully compatible with the \"body-first hypothesis\" of PD etiopathogenesis. To our knowledge, this is the first animal model evidence of asyn propagation to the heart, and the first indication of bidirectional asyn propagation via the vagus nerve, i.e., duodenum-to-brainstem-to-stomach. The BAC rat model could be very valuable for detailed mechanistic studies of the dual-hit hypothesis, and for studies of disease modifying therapies targeting early pathology in the gastrointestinal tract.

        "Habitual tea drinking modulates brain efficiency: evidence from brain connectivity evaluation. The majority of tea studies have relied on neuropsychological measures, and much fewer on neuroimaging measures, especially for interregional connections. To date, there has been no exploration of the effect of tea on system-level brain networks. We recruited healthy older participants to two groups according to their history of tea drinking frequency and investigated both functional and structural networks to reveal the role of tea drinking on brain organization. The results showed that tea drinking gave rise to the more efficient structural organization, but had no significant beneficial effect on the global functional organization. The suppression of hemispheric asymmetry in the structural connectivity network was observed as a result of tea drinking. We did not observe any significant effects of tea drinking on the hemispheric asymmetry of the functional connectivity network. In addition, functional connectivity strength within the default mode network (DMN) was greater for the tea-drinking group, and coexistence of increasing and decreasing connective strengths was observed in the structural connectivity of the DMN. Our study offers the first evidence of the positive contribution of tea drinking to brain structure and suggests a protective effect on age-related decline in brain organisation. ",
        "The association between heat exposure and hospitalization for undernutrition in Brazil during 2000-2015: A nationwide case-crossover study. BACKGROUND: Global warming is predicted to indirectly result in more undernutrition by threatening crop production. Whether temperature rise could affect undernutrition directly is unknown. We aim to quantify the relationship between short-term heat exposure and risk of hospitalization due to undernutrition in Brazil. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We collected hospitalization and weather data for the hot season (the 4 adjacent hottest months for each city) from 1,814 Brazilian cities during 1 January 2000-31 December 2015. We used a time-stratified case-crossover design to quantify the association between heat exposure and hospitalization due to undernutrition. Region-specific odds ratios (ORs) were used to calculate the attributable fractions (AFs). A total of 238,320 hospitalizations for undernutrition were recorded during the 2000-2015 hot seasons. Every 1\u00b0C increase in daily mean temperature was associated with a 2.5% (OR 1.025, 95% CI 1.020-1.030, p < 0.001) increase in hospitalizations for undernutrition across lag 0-7 days. The association was greatest for individuals aged \u226580 years (OR 1.046, 95% CI 1.034-1.059, p < 0.001), 0-4 years (OR 1.039, 95% CI 1.024-1.055, p < 0.001), and 5-19 years (OR 1.042, 95% CI 1.015-1.069, p = 0.002). Assuming a causal relationship, we estimate that 15.6% of undernutrition hospitalizations could be attributed to heat exposure during the study period. The AF grew from 14.1% to 17.5% with a 1.1\u00b0C increase in mean temperature from 2000 to 2015. The main limitations of this study are misclassification of different types of undernutrition, lack of individual temperature exposure data, and being unable to adjust for relative humidity. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that global warming might directly increase undernutrition morbidity, by a route other than by threatening food security. This short-term effect is increasingly important with global warming. Global strategies addressing the syndemic of climate change and undernutrition should focus not only on food systems, but also on the prevention of heat exposure. ",
        "XX sex chromosome complement promotes atherosclerosis in mice. Men and women differ in circulating lipids and coronary artery disease (CAD). While sex hormones such as estrogens decrease CAD risk, hormone replacement therapy increases risk. Biological sex is determined by sex hormones and chromosomes, but effects of sex chromosomes on circulating lipids and atherosclerosis are unknown. Here, we use mouse models to separate effects of sex chromosomes and hormones on atherosclerosis, circulating lipids and intestinal fat metabolism. We assess atherosclerosis in multiple models and experimental paradigms that distinguish effects of sex chromosomes, and male or female gonads. Pro-atherogenic lipids and atherosclerosis are greater in XX than XY mice, indicating a primary effect of sex chromosomes. Small intestine expression of enzymes involved in lipid absorption and chylomicron assembly are greater in XX male and female mice with higher intestinal lipids. Together, our results show that an XX sex chromosome complement promotes the bioavailability of dietary fat to accelerate atherosclerosis. ",
        "Renal clearable catalytic gold nanoclusters for in vivo disease monitoring. Ultrasmall gold nanoclusters (AuNCs) have emerged as agile probes for in vivo imaging, as they exhibit exceptional tumour accumulation and efficient renal clearance properties. However, their intrinsic catalytic activity, which can enable an increased detection sensitivity, has yet to be explored for in vivo sensing. By exploiting the peroxidase-mimicking activity of AuNCs and the precise nanometre-size filtration of the kidney, we designed multifunctional protease nanosensors that respond to disease microenvironments to produce a direct colorimetric urinary readout of the disease state in less than one hour. We monitored the catalytic activity of AuNCs in the collected urine of a mouse model of colorectal cancer in which tumour-bearing mice showed a 13-fold increase in colorimetric signal compared to healthy mice. The nanosensors were eliminated completely through hepatic and renal excretion within four weeks of injection with no evidence of toxicity. We envision that this modular approach will enable the rapid detection of a diverse range of diseases by exploiting their specific enzymatic signatures. ",
        "Energy expenditure differences across lying, sitting, and standing positions in young healthy adults. The time spent in sedentary behaviour represents an important public health burden. To reduce sedentary time in the general population, the simplest, most effective, and most accessible method is to decrease lying and sitting time. We aimed to compare differences on energy expenditure (EE) across lying, sitting, and standing positions; and to analyse the associations between the change on EE of changing from one position to another and anthropometric and body composition parameters in young healthy adults. A total of 55 (69% women) young healthy adults aged 21.7 \u00b1 2.2 participated in the study. We measured EE by indirect calorimetry across lying, sitting, and standing positions following the standard procedures. The EE was significantly higher in standing than in both lying and sitting positions (mean difference: 0.121\u00b10.292 and 0.125\u00b10.241 kcal/min, respectively; all P<0.001), and no differences were observed between lying and sitting positions (P = 1.000). There was a negative association between the EE differences in sitting vs. standing position and lean body mass (P = 0.048), yet no associations between EE differences with the rest of the anthropometric and body composition parameters were observed in each position pair studied (all P>0.321). Our findings support the fact that increasing the time spent standing could be a simple strategy to slightly increase EE. Therefore, our results have important clinical implications including a better monitoring, characterizing, and promoting countermeasures to sedentariness through low-level physical activities. ",
        "FAK activity sustains intrinsic and acquired ovarian cancer resistance to platinum chemotherapy. Gene copy number alterations, tumor cell stemness, and the development of platinum chemotherapy resistance contribute to high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) recurrence. Stem phenotypes involving Wnt-\u03b2-catenin, aldehyde dehydrogenase activities, intrinsic platinum resistance, and tumorsphere formation are here associated with spontaneous gains in Kras, Myc and FAK (KMF) genes in a new aggressive murine model of ovarian cancer. Adhesion-independent FAK signaling sustained KMF and human tumorsphere proliferation as well as resistance to cisplatin cytotoxicity. Platinum-resistant tumorspheres can acquire a dependence on FAK for growth. Accordingly, increased FAK tyrosine phosphorylation was observed within HGSOC patient tumors surviving neo-adjuvant chemotherapy. Combining a FAK inhibitor with platinum overcame chemoresistance and triggered cell apoptosis. FAK transcriptomic analyses across knockout and reconstituted cells identified 135 targets, elevated in HGSOC, that were regulated by FAK activity and \u03b2-catenin including Myc, pluripotency and DNA repair genes. These studies reveal an oncogenic FAK signaling role supporting chemoresistance. ",
        "GREB1 induced by Wnt signaling promotes development of hepatoblastoma by suppressing TGF\u03b2 signaling. The \u03b2-catenin mutation is frequently observed in hepatoblastoma (HB), but the underlying mechanism by which Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling induces HB tumor formation is unknown. Here we show that expression of growth regulation by estrogen in breast cancer 1 (GREB1) depends on Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling in HB patients. GREB1 is localized to the nucleus where it binds Smad2/3 in a competitive manner with p300 and inhibits TGF\u03b2 signaling, thereby promoting HepG2 HB cell proliferation. Forced expression of \u03b2-catenin, YAP, and c-Met induces HB-like mouse liver tumor (BYM mice), with an increase in GREB1 expression and HB markers. Depletion of GREB1 strongly suppresses marker gene expression and HB-like liver tumorigenesis, and instead enhances TGF\u03b2 signaling in BYM mice. Furthermore, antisense oligonucleotides for GREB1 suppress the formation of HepG2 cell-induced tumors and HB-like tumors in vivo. We propose that GREB1 is a target molecule of Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling and required for HB progression. ",
        "Association between neighbourhood socioeconomic features and residential fire incidence, related casualties and children: a cross-sectional population-based study in 4 Canadian provinces. BACKGROUND: This study assessed whether socioeconomic factors affect the rates of residential fire incidence and fire-related injuries and deaths, and whether children are affected differently than the general population. METHODS: We employed a cross-sectional study design using data for British Columbia, Alberta, Manitoba and Ontario from the National Fire Information Database, which includes fire incidents and losses reported by provincial fire marshals across Canada between 2005 and 2015. It also contains 2011 census subdivision social domain data from Statistics Canada based on fire location. Multivariable negative binomial regressions tested the significance of relations between census subdivision socioeconomic factors (average household size, educational attainment, median income and unemployment rate) and the rates of residential fires and casualties per person-year, and casualties per fire incident. RESULTS: Census subdivisions with higher educational attainment and unemployment rates had higher rates of residential fires (incidence rate ratio [IRR] 1.07, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.05-1.10, and IRR 1.24, 95% CI 1.18-1.31, respectively) and of residential fire casualties per person-year (IRR 1.09, 95% CI 1.05-1.13, and IRR 1.29, 95% CI 1.20-1.40, respectively). Census subdivisions with smaller average households had higher rates of residential fire casualties per person-year (IRR 0.43, 95% CI 0.22-0.83) and per fire incident (IRR 0.75, 95% CI 0.58-0.97), and the association was even stronger for children (IRR 0.17, 95% CI 0.08-0.36, and IRR 0.41, 95% CI 0.20-0.86, respectively). INTERPRETATION: The results suggest that efforts to prevent residential fires should be prioritized in neighbourhoods with higher educational attainment and unemployment, whereas house fire safety programs should be intensified in neighbourhoods with smaller households to prevent fire casualties, especially among children, once a fire does occur.

        "Surgical excision, Mohs micrographic surgery, external-beam radiotherapy, or brachytherapy for indolent skin cancer: An international meta-analysis of 58 studies with 21,000 patients. BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to compare the cosmesis and recurrence rates of conventional excision (CE), Mohs micrographic surgery (MMS), external-beam radiation therapy (EBRT), or brachytherapy (BT), for basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma of the skin. METHODS: Population, Intervention, Control, Outcome, Study Design (PICOS), Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA), and Meta-Analyses of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) methods were used to identify studies on PubMed (from 1985 to 2018), including patients with American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) T1-T2N0 basal cell carcinomas and squamous cell carcinomas and \u226510\u00a0months follow-up who received CE, MMS, EBRT, or BT. The primary endpoint was cosmesis, classified as \"good,\" \"fair,\" or \"poor.\" The secondary endpoint was 1-year recurrence. Fixed-effects and random-effects meta-analyses were performed to evaluate primary and secondary outcomes with respect to treatment modality. RESULTS: In total, 18,095 studies met initial search criteria. There were 24 CE, 13 MMS, 19 EBRT, and 7 BT studies included with a total of 21,371 patients. The summary effect size for \"good\" cosmesis was 81% (95% CI, 70.6%-89.6%), 74.6% (95% CI, 63%-84.6%), and 97.6% (95% CI, 91.3%-100%) for CE, EBRT, and BT, respectively. Good cosmesis was 96.0% in the only MMS study that reported cosmesis. BT had improved \"good\" cosmesis over EBRT (P\u00a0=\u00a0.0025) and was similar to CE and MMS. No significant differences were seen for \"fair\" or \"poor\" cosmesis. One-year recurrence rates were low throughout at 0.8% (95% CI, 0.3%-1.6%), 0.2% (95% CI, 0%-0.6%), 2% (95% CI, 1.3%-2.7%), and 0% (95% CI, 0%-0.5%) for CE, MMS, EBRT, and BT, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: For T1-T2N0 skin cancers, BT and MMS have improved cosmesis over EBRT and CE. It is unclear whether this is because of treatment superiority or selection and reporting bias. Local control is similar among all modalities at 1 year. ",
        "Regional Variation in the Association of Poverty and Heart Failure Mortality in the 3135 Counties of the United States. Background There is significant geographical variation in heart failure (HF) mortality across the United States. County socioeconomic factors that influence these outcomes are unknown. We studied the association between county socioeconomic factors and HF mortality and compared it with coronary heart disease (CHD) mortality. Methods and Results This is a cross-sectional analysis of socioeconomic factors and mortality in HF and CHD across 3135 US counties from 2010 to 2015. County-level poverty, education, income, unemployment, health insurance status, and cause-specific mortality rates were collected from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and US Census Bureau databases. Poverty had the strongest correlation with both HF and CHD mortality, disproportionately higher for HF (r=0.48) than CHD (r=0.24). HF mortality increased by 5.2 deaths/100\u00a0000 for each percentage increase in county poverty prevalence in a frequency-weighted, demographic-adjusted, multivariate regression model. The greatest attenuation in the poverty regression coefficient (66.4%) was seen after adjustment for prevalence of diabetes mellitus and obesity. Subgroup analysis by census region showed that this relationship was the strongest in the South and weakest in the Northeast (6.1 versus 1.4 deaths/100\u00a0000 per 1% increase in county poverty in a demographics-adjusted model). Conclusions County poverty is the strongest socioeconomic factor associated with HF and CHD mortality, an association that is stronger with HF than with CHD and varied by census region. Over half of the association was explained by differences in the prevalence of diabetes mellitus and obesity across the counties. Health policies targeting improvement in these risk factors may address and possibly minimize health disparities caused by socioeconomic factors. ",
        "Early progression to active tuberculosis is a highly heritable trait driven by 3q23 in Peruvians. Of the 1.8 billion people worldwide infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis, 5-15% will develop active tuberculosis (TB). Approximately half will progress to active TB within the first 18 months after infection, presumably because they fail to mount an effective initial immune response. Here, in a genome-wide genetic study of early TB progression, we genotype 4002 active TB cases and their household contacts in Peru. We quantify genetic heritability ([Formula: see text]) of early TB progression to be 21.2% (standard error 0.08). This suggests TB progression has a strong genetic basis, and is comparable to traits with well-established genetic bases. We identify a novel association between early TB progression and variants located in a putative enhancer region on chromosome 3q23 (rs73226617, OR\u2009=\u20091.18; P\u2009=\u20093.93\u2009\u00d7\u200910-8). With in silico and in vitro analyses we identify rs73226617 or rs148722713 as the likely functional variant and ATP1B3 as a potential causal target gene with monocyte specific function. ",
        "Distinct methylation levels of mature microRNAs in gastrointestinal cancers. The biological significance of micro (mi)RNAs has traditionally been evaluated according to their RNA expression levels based on the assumption that miRNAs recognize and regulate their targets in an unvarying fashion. Here we show that a fraction of mature miRNAs including miR-17-5p, -21-5p, and -200c-3p and let-7a-5p harbor methyl marks that potentially alter their stability and target recognition. Importantly, methylation of these miRNAs was significantly increased in cancer tissues as compared to paired normal tissues. Furthermore, miR-17-5p methylation level in serum samples distinguished early pancreatic cancer patients from healthy controls with extremely high sensitivity and specificity. These findings provide a basis for diagnostic strategies for early-stage cancer and add a dimension to our understanding of miRNA biology. ",
        "3D cellular reconstruction of cortical glia and parenchymal morphometric analysis from Serial Block-Face Electron Microscopy of juvenile rat. With the rapid evolution in the automation of serial electron microscopy in life sciences, the acquisition of terabyte-sized datasets is becoming increasingly common. High resolution serial block-face imaging (SBEM) of biological tissues offers the opportunity to segment and reconstruct nanoscale structures to reveal spatial features previously inaccessible with simple, single section, two-dimensional images. In particular, we focussed here on glial cells, whose reconstruction efforts in literature are still limited, compared to neurons. We imaged a 750,000 cubic micron volume of the somatosensory cortex from a juvenile P14 rat, with 20\u2009nm accuracy. We recognized a total of 186 cells using their nuclei, and classified them as neuronal or glial based on features of the soma and the processes. We reconstructed for the first time 4 almost complete astrocytes and neurons, 4 complete microglia and 4 complete pericytes, including their intracellular mitochondria, 186 nuclei and 213 myelinated axons. We then performed quantitative analysis on the three-dimensional models. Out of the data that we generated, we observed that neurons have larger nuclei, which correlated with their lesser density, and that astrocytes and pericytes have a higher surface to volume ratio, compared to other cell types. All reconstructed morphologies represent an important resource for computational neuroscientists, as morphological quantitative information can be inferred, to tune simulations that take into account the spatial compartmentalization of the different cell types.

        "Sex-specific transcriptional and proteomic signatures in schizophrenia. It has remained unclear why schizophrenia typically manifests after adolescence and which neurobiological mechanisms are underlying the cascade leading to the actual onset of the illness. Here we show that the use of induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neurons of monozygotic twins from pairs discordant for schizophrenia enhances disease-specific signal by minimizing genetic heterogeneity. In proteomic and pathway analyses, clinical illness is associated especially with altered glycosaminoglycan, GABAergic synapse, sialylation, and purine metabolism pathways. Although only 12% of all 19,462 genes are expressed differentially between healthy males and females, up to 61% of the illness-related genes are sex specific. These results on sex-specific genes are replicated in another dataset. This implies that the pathophysiology differs between males and females, and may explain why symptoms appear after adolescence when the expression of many sex-specific genes change, and suggests the need for sex-specific treatments.

        "A Randomized Trial of a 1-Hour Troponin T Protocol in Suspected Acute Coronary Syndromes: The Rapid Assessment of Possible Acute Coronary Syndrome in the Emergency Department With High-Sensitivity Troponin T Study (RAPID-TnT). BACKGROUND: High-sensitivity troponin assays promise earlier discrimination of myocardial infarction. Yet, the benefits and harms of this improved discriminatory performance when incorporated within rapid testing protocols, with respect to subsequent testing and clinical events, has not been evaluated in an in-practice patient-level randomized study. This multicenter study evaluated the noninferiority of a 0/1-hour high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T (hs-cTnT) protocol in comparison with a 0/3-hour masked hs-cTnT protocol in patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome presenting to the emergency department (ED). METHODS: Patients were randomly assigned to either a 0/1-hour hs-cTnT protocol (reported to the limit of detection [<5 ng/L]) or masked hs-cTnT reported to \u226429 ng/L evaluated at 0/3-hours (standard arm). The 30-day primary end point was all-cause death and myocardial infarction. Noninferiority was defined as an absolute margin of 0.5% determined by Poisson regression. RESULTS: In total, 3378 participants with an emergency presentation were randomly assigned between August 2015 and April 2019. Ninety participants were deemed ineligible or withdrew consent. The remaining participants received care guided either by the 0/1-hour hs-cTnT protocol (n=1646) or the 0/3-hour standard masked hs-cTnT protocol (n=1642) and were followed for 30 days. Median age was 59 (49-70) years, and 47% were female. Participants in the 0/1-hour arm were more likely to be discharged from the ED (0/1-hour arm: 45.1% versus standard arm: 32.3%, P<0.001) and median ED length of stay was shorter (0/1-hour arm: 4.6 [interquartile range, 3.4-6.4] hours versus standard arm: 5.6 (interquartile range, 4.0-7.1) hours, P<0.001). Those randomly assigned to the 0/1-hour protocol were less likely to undergo functional cardiac testing (0/1-hour arm: 7.5% versus standard arm: 11.0%, P<0.001). The 0/1-hour hs-cTnT protocol was not inferior to standard care (0/1-hour arm: 17/1646 [1.0%] versus 16/1642 [1.0%]; incidence rate ratio, 1.06 [ 0.53-2.11], noninferiority P value=0.006, superiority P value=0.867), although an increase in myocardial injury was observed. Among patients discharged from ED, the 0/1-hour protocol had a negative predictive value of 99.6% (95% CI, 99.0-99.9%) for 30-day death or myocardial infarction. CONCLUSIONS: This in-practice evaluation of a 0/1-hour hs-cTnT protocol embedded in ED care enabled more rapid discharge of patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome. Improving short-term outcomes among patients with newly recognized troponin T elevation will require an evolution in management strategies for these patients.

        "Cognitive behavioural therapy for irritable bowel syndrome: 24-month follow-up of participants in the ACTIB randomised trial. BACKGROUND: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is common, affecting 10-20% of the adult population worldwide, with many people reporting ongoing symptoms despite first-line therapies. Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is recommended in guidelines for refractory IBS but there is insufficient access to CBT for IBS and uncertainty about whether benefits last in the longer term. Assessing Cognitive behavioural Therapy for IBS (ACTIB) was a large, randomised, controlled trial of two forms of CBT for patients with refractory IBS. ACTIB results showed that, at 12 months, both forms of CBT for IBS were significantly more effective than treatment as usual at reducing IBS symptom severity in adults with refractory IBS. This follow-up study aimed to evaluate 24-month clinical outcomes of participants in the ACTIB trial. METHODS: In the ACTIB three-group, randomised, controlled trial, 558 adults with refractory IBS were randomly allocated to receive either therapist-delivered telephone CBT (telephone-CBT group), web-based CBT with minimal therapist support (web-CBT group), or treatment as usual (TAU group) and were followed up for 12 months. Participants were adults with refractory IBS (clinically significant symptoms for \u226512 months despite being offered first-line therapies), recruited by letter and opportunistically from 74 general practices and three gastroenterology centres in London and the south of England (UK) between May 1, 2014, and March 31, 2016. Primary outcome measures were IBS Symptom Severity Score (IBS-SSS) and Work and Social Adjustment Scale (WSAS), assessed in the intention-to-treat (ITT) population with multiple imputation. This study was a non-prespecified naturalistic follow-up and analysis of the participants of the ACTIB trial at 24 months assessing the same outcomes as the original trial. Outcome measures were completed online by participants or a paper questionnaire was posted, or telephone follow-up undertaken. The ACTIB trial is registered with the International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial Number registry, number ISRCTN44427879. FINDINGS: 24-month follow-up of outcomes was achieved for 323 (58%) of 558 participants: 119 (64%) of 186 in the telephone-CBT group, 99 (54%) of 185 in the web-CBT group, and 105 (56%) of 187 in the TAU group. At 24 months, mean IBS-SSS was 40\u00b75 points (95% CI 15\u00b70 to 66\u00b70; p=0\u00b7002) lower in the telephone-CBT group and 12\u00b79 points (-12\u00b79 to 38\u00b78; p=0\u00b733) lower in the web-CBT group than in the TAU group. The mean WSAS score was 3\u00b71 points (1\u00b73 to 4\u00b79; p<0\u00b7001) lower in the telephone-CBT group and 1\u00b79 points (0\u00b71 to 3\u00b77; p=0\u00b7036) lower in the web-CBT group than in the TAU group. A clinically significant IBS-SSS change (\u226550 points) from baseline to 24 months was found in 84 (71%) of 119 participants in the telephone-CBT group, in 62 (63%) of 99 in the web-CBT group, and in 48 (46%) of 105 in the TAU group. In total 41 adverse events were reported between 12 to 24 months: 11 in the telephone-CBT group, 15 in the web-CBT group, and 15 in the TAU group. Of these, eight were reported as gastrointestinal related, five as psychological, and six as musculoskeletal. There were no adverse events related to treatment. INTERPRETATION: At 24-month follow-up, sustained improvements in IBS were seen in both CBT groups compared with TAU, although some previous gains were reduced compared with the 12-month outcomes. IBS-specific CBT has the potential to provide long-term improvement in IBS, achievable within a usual clinical setting. Increasing access to CBT for IBS could achieve long-term patient benefit.

        "Spatial optimization for radiation therapy of brain tumours. Glioblastomas are the most common primary brain tumours. They are known for their highly aggressive growth and invasion, leading to short survival times. Treatments for glioblastomas commonly involve a combination of surgical intervention, chemotherapy, and external beam radiation therapy (XRT). Previous works have not only successfully modelled the natural growth of glioblastomas in vivo, but also show potential for the prediction of response to radiation prior to treatment. This suggests that the efficacy of XRT can be optimized before treatment in order to yield longer survival times. However, while current efforts focus on optimal scheduling of radiotherapy treatment, they do not include a similarly sophisticated spatial optimization. In an effort to improve XRT, we present a method for the spatial optimization of radiation profiles. We expand upon previous results in the general problem and examine the more physically reasonable cases of 1-step and 2-step radiation profiles during the first and second XRT fractions. The results show that by including spatial optimization in XRT, while retaining a constant prescribed total dose amount, we are able to increase the total cell kill from the clinically-applied uniform case.

        "Disrupted hippocampal growth hormone secretagogue receptor 1\u03b1 interaction with dopamine receptor D1 plays a role in Alzheimer's disease. Hippocampal lesions are a defining pathology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the molecular mechanisms that underlie hippocampal synaptic injury in AD have not been fully elucidated. Current therapeutic efforts for AD treatment are not effective in correcting hippocampal synaptic deficits. Growth hormone secretagogue receptor 1\u03b1 (GHSR1\u03b1) is critical for hippocampal synaptic physiology. Here, we report that GHSR1\u03b1 interaction with \u03b2-amyloid (A\u03b2) suppresses GHSR1\u03b1 activation, leading to compromised GHSR1\u03b1 regulation of dopamine receptor D1 (DRD1) in the hippocampus from patients with AD. The simultaneous application of the selective GHSR1\u03b1 agonist MK0677 with the selective DRD1 agonist SKF81297 rescued Ghsr1\u03b1 function from A\u03b2 inhibition, mitigating hippocampal synaptic injury and improving spatial memory in an AD mouse model. Our data reveal a mechanism of hippocampal vulnerability in AD and suggest that a combined activation of GHSR1\u03b1 and DRD1 may be a promising approach for treating AD. ",
        "Transfusion of Anaerobically or Conventionally Stored Blood After Hemorrhagic Shock. BACKGROUND: Resuscitation from hemorrhagic shock (HS) by blood transfusion restores oxygen (O2) delivery and provides hemodynamic stability. Current regulations allow red blood cells (RBCs) to be stored and used for up to 42 days. During storage, RBCs undergo many structural and functional changes. These storage lesions have been associated with adverse events and increased mortality after transfusion, increasing the need for improved RBC storage protocols. This study evaluates the efficacy of anaerobically stored RBCs to resuscitate rats from severe HS compared with conventionally stored RBCs. METHODS AND RESULTS: Rat RBCs were stored under anaerobic, anaerobic/hypercapnic, or conventional conditions for a period of 3 weeks. Hemorrhage was induced by controlled bleeding, shock was maintained for 30 min, and RBCs were transfused to restore and maintain blood pressure near the prhemorrhage level. All storage conditions met current regulatory 24-h posttransfusion recovery requirements. Transfusion of anaerobically stored RBCs required significantly less RBC volume to restore and maintain hemodynamics. Anaerobic or anaerobic/hypercapnic RBCs restored hemodynamics better than conventionally stored RBCs. Resuscitation with conventionally stored RBCs impaired indices of left ventricular cardiac function, increased hypoxic tissue staining and inflammatory markers, and affected organ function compared with anaerobically stored RBCs. CONCLUSIONS: Resuscitation from HS via transfusion of anaerobically stored RBCs recovered cardiac function, restored hemodynamic stability, and improved outcomes. ",
        "Oral Health Symptoms and Cognitive Function Among US Community-Dwelling Chinese Older Adults. BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Limited research is available on the relationship between oral health symptoms and cognitive function among community-dwelling US Chinese older adults. The purpose of this study was to examine the associations between tooth/gum symptoms and changes in cognitive function. DESIGN: Two-wave epidemiological study. SETTING: Population Study of Chinese Elderly in Chicago (PINE). PARTICIPANTS: US Chinese older adults (N = 2713; mean age = 72.6 y; 58.4% women). MEASUREMENTS: We selected self-reported oral (tooth and gum) symptoms as independent variables. To examine changes in cognitive function (wave 2: Baseline), we chose the following three domains: episodic memory (East Boston Memory Test); executive function (Symbol Digit Modalities Test); and working memory (Digit Span Backwards). In addition, we assessed global cognitive function by constructing a composite measure. RESULTS: At baseline, 1297 participants (47.8%) reported having teeth symptoms, and 513 participants (18.9%) reported having gum symptoms. Adjusting for sociodemographic and health-related characteristics, participants who reported having teeth symptoms at baseline experienced their global cognition decrease by 0.07 units (estimate = -0.07; p = .003) and their episodic memory decrease by 0.07 units (estimate = -0.07; p = .026). Participants who reported having teeth symptoms at baseline experienced a faster rate of decline in global cognition for every additional year (estimate = 0.02; p = .047). However, this effect disappeared once we adjusted for all covariates (estimate = 0.02; p = .069). We found no significant relationship between baseline gum symptoms and change of cognitive function. CONCLUSION: Having teeth symptoms was associated with a decline in cognitive function among US Chinese older adults. Developing policy measures aimed at ameliorating health and improving cognition in this high-risk fast-growing population in the United States would need to include oral health preventive and dental care services.

        "Sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 3 in the medial prefrontal cortex promotes stress resilience by reducing inflammatory processes. Stress can promote the development of psychiatric disorders, though some individuals are more vulnerable to stress compared to others who are more resilient. Here we show that the sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 3 (S1PR3) in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) of rats regulates resilience to chronic social defeat stress. S1PR3 expression is elevated in the mPFC of resilient compared to vulnerable and control rats. Virally-mediated over-expression of S1PR3 in the mPFC produces a resilient phenotype whereas its knock-down produces a vulnerable phenotype, characterized by increased anxiety- and depressive-like behaviors, and these effects are mediated by TNF\u03b1. Furthermore, we show that S1PR3 mRNA in blood is reduced in veterans with PTSD compared to combat-exposed control subjects and its expression negatively correlates with symptom severity. Together, these data identify S1PR3 as a regulator of stress resilience and reveal sphingolipid receptors as important substrates of relevance to stress-related psychiatric disorders. ",
        "Non-classical tissue monocytes and two functionally distinct populations of interstitial macrophages populate the mouse lung. Resident tissue macrophages (RTM) can fulfill various tasks during development, homeostasis, inflammation and repair. In the lung, non-alveolar RTM, called interstitial macrophages (IM), importantly contribute to tissue homeostasis but remain little characterized. Here we show, using single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq), two phenotypically distinct subpopulations of long-lived monocyte-derived IM, i.e. CD206+ and CD206-IM, as well as a discrete population of extravasating CD64+CD16.2+ monocytes. CD206+ IM are peribronchial self-maintaining RTM that constitutively produce high levels of chemokines and immunosuppressive cytokines. Conversely, CD206-IM preferentially populate the alveolar interstitium and exhibit features of antigen-presenting cells. In addition, our data support that CD64+CD16.2+ monocytes arise from intravascular Ly-6Clo patrolling monocytes that enter the tissue at steady-state to become putative precursors of CD206-IM. This study expands our knowledge about the complexity of lung IM and reveals an ontogenic pathway for one IM subset, an important step for elaborating future macrophage-targeted therapies. ",
        "Coffee intake protects against symptomatic gallstone disease in the general population: a Mendelian randomization study. BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Coffee intake is associated with low risk of symptomatic gallstone disease (GSD). We tested the hypothesis that high coffee intake causally protects against symptomatic GSD using a Mendelian randomization design. METHODS: First, we tested whether high coffee intake was associated with low risk of GSD in 104\u00a0493 individuals from the general population. Mean follow-up was 8\u00a0years (range:\u00a0<1-13\u00a0years). Secondly, we tested whether two genetic variants near CYP1A1/A2 (rs2472297) and AHR (rs4410790), combined as an allele score, were associated with higher coffee intake measured as a continuous variable. Thirdly, we tested whether the allele score was associated with lower risk of GSD in 114\u00a0220 individuals including 7294 gallstone events. Mean follow-up was 38\u00a0years (range: <1-40\u00a0years). RESULTS: In observational analysis, those with coffee intake of >6 cups daily had 23% lower risk of GSD compared to individuals without coffee intake [hazard ratio (HR)\u00a0=\u00a00.77 (95% confidence interval: 0.61-0.94)]. In genetic analysis, there was a stepwise higher coffee intake of up to 41% (caffeine per day) in individuals with 4 (highest) versus 0 (lowest) coffee intake alleles (P for trend\u00a0=\u00a03\u00a0x\u00a010-178 ) and a corresponding stepwise lower risk of GSD up to 19%[HR\u00a0=\u00a00.81 (0.69-0.96)]. The estimated observational odds ratio for GSD for a one cup per day higher coffee intake was 0.97 (0.96-0.98), equal to 3% lower risk. The corresponding genetic odds ratio was 0.89 (0.83-0.95), equal to 11% lower risk. CONCLUSION: High coffee intake is associated observationally with low risk of GSD, and with genetic evidence to support a causal relationship. ",
        "Free Time and Physical Activity Among Americans 15 Years or Older: Cross-Sectional Analysis of the American Time Use Survey. INTRODUCTION: Many Americans fail to meet physical activity guidelines. We investigated whether this failure is due in part to a lack of free time. METHODS: We analyzed data from the American Time Use Survey, 2014 through 2016, with 32,048 respondents aged 15 years or older, categorizing every activity during a 24-hour period. Free or leisure time includes time spent socializing, being entertained, in sports and recreation activities, volunteering, in religious activities, taking classes for personal interest, and in associated travel time. Working in the labor market, education (unless only for personal interest), household work and home production (cooking, cleaning, child care, shopping), or self-care (sleeping, eating, grooming) are not free time. We stratified by sociodemographic characteristics, health, and body mass index, and we calculated descriptive statistics adjusted for the multistage sampling design. RESULTS: Americans averaged more than 5 hours (>300 minutes) of free time per day; no subgroup reported having less than 4.5 hours (270 minutes) of free time. Men had more free time (mean [standard deviation], 356 [3] min/d) and spent more on leisure time physical activity (mean [SD], 24 [3] min/d) than women did (free time mean [SD], 318 [2] min/d, P < .001; and leisure time physical activity mean [SD], 14 [1] min/d, P < .001). Compared with those with a higher income and a college education, those with income below 185% of federal poverty guidelines and those with a high school education reported more free time but spent more time on television, movies, and other screen time and less on physical activity (all comparisons P < .001). CONCLUSION: Lack of free time is not responsible for low levels of leisure time physical activity at the population level. ",
        "Can Hearing Aids Delay Time to Diagnosis of Dementia, Depression, or Falls in Older Adults?. OBJECTIVE: To examine the association between hearing aids (HAs) and time to diagnosis of Alzheimer disease (AD) or dementia, anxiety or depression, and injurious falls among adults, aged 66 years and older, within 3 years of hearing loss (HL) diagnosis. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: We used 2008 to 2016 national longitudinal claims data (based on office visit, inpatient, or outpatient healthcare encounters) from a large private payer. We used Kaplan-Meier curves to examine unadjusted disease-free survival and crude and adjusted Cox regression models to examine associations between HAs and time to diagnosis of three age-related/HL-associated conditions within 3 years of HL diagnosis. All models were adjusted for age, sex, race/ethnicity, census divisions, and prior diagnosis of cardiovascular conditions, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, obesity, and diabetes. PARTICIPANTS: The participants included 114 862 adults, aged 66 years and older, diagnosed with HL. MEASUREMENT: Diagnosis of (1) AD or dementia; (2) depression or anxiety; and (3) injurious falls. INTERVENTION: Use of HAs. RESULTS: Large sex and racial/ethnic differences exist in HA use. Approximately 11.3% of women vs 13.3% of men used HAs (95% confidence interval [CI] difference = -0.024 to -0.016). Approximately 13.6% of whites (95% CI = 0.13-0.14) vs 9.8% of blacks (95% CI = 0.09-0.11) and 6.5% of Hispanics (95% CI = 0.06-0.07) used HAs. The risk-adjusted hazard ratios of being diagnosed with AD/dementia, anxiety/depression, and injurious falls within 3 years after HL diagnosis, for those who used HAs vs those who did not, were 0.82 (95% CI = 0.76-0.89), 0.89 (95% CI = 0.86-0.93), and 0.87 (95% CI = 0.80-0.95), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Use of HAs is associated with delayed diagnosis of AD, dementia, depression, anxiety, and injurious falls among older adults with HL. Although we have shown an association between use of HAs and reduced risk of physical and mental decline, randomized trials are needed to determine whether, and to what extent, the relationship is causal.

        "Effect of Weight Change Following Intentional Weight Loss on Bone Health in Older Adults with Obesity. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to examine change in bone mineral density (BMD) and trabecular bone score among older adult weight regainers (WR) and weight maintainers (WM). METHODS: Observational data come from 77 older adults (mean\u00a0age:\u00a067 [SD 5] years; 69% women; 70% white) with obesity (mean\u00a0BMI: 33.6 [SD \u20093.7] kg/m2 ) who lost weight during an 18-month weight loss intervention. Total body mass and body composition, along with regional (total hip, femoral neck, lumbar spine) BMD and trabecular bone score, were measured at baseline, 18 months, and 30 months. WR (n\u2009=\u200936) and WM (n\u2009=\u200941) categories were defined as a \u2265\u20095% or <\u20095% weight gain from 18 to 30 months, respectively. RESULTS: Among skeletal indices, only total hip BMD was significantly reduced during the 18-month intervention period in both WRs (-3.9%; 95% CI: -5.8% to -2.0%) and WMs (-2.4%; 95% CI: -4.3% to -0.5%; P\u2009=\u20090.07). After adjustment for relevant baseline covariates and weight change from 0 to 18 months, 30-month change in total hip BMD was -2.6% (95% CI: -4.3% to -0.9%) and -3.9% (95% CI: -5.7% to -2.1%) among WRs and WMs, respectively (P\u2009=\u20090.07). CONCLUSIONS: Loss of hip BMD persists in the year after a weight loss intervention among older adults with obesity, regardless of weight regain status. ",
        "The association between medication non-adherence and adverse health outcomes in ageing populations: A systematic review and meta-analysis. AIMS: The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to synthesise the evidence relating to medication non-adherence and its association with health outcomes in people aged \u226550\u00a0years. METHODS: Seven databases were searched up to February 2019 for observational studies that measured medication (non-)adherence as a predictor of the following health outcomes in adults aged \u226550\u00a0years: healthcare utilisation (hospitalisation, emergency department visits, outpatient visits and general practitioner visits), mortality, adverse clinical events and quality of life. Screening and quality assessment using validated criteria were completed by 2 reviewers independently. Random effects models were used to generate pooled estimates of association using adjusted study results. The full methodological approach was published on PROSPERO (ID: CRD42017077264). RESULTS: Sixty-six studies were identified for qualitative synthesis, with 11 of these studies eligible for meta-analyses. A meta-analysis including 3 studies measuring medication non-adherence in adults aged \u226555\u00a0years showed a significant association with all-cause hospitalisation (adjusted odds ratio 1.17, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.12, 1.21). A meta-analysis including 2 studies showed that medication non-adherence was not significantly associated with an emergency department visit (adjusted odds ratio 1.05, 95% CI 0.90, 1.22). Good adherence was associated with a 21% reduction in long-term mortality risk in comparison to medication non-adherence (adjusted hazard ratio 0.79, 95% CI 0.63, 0.98). CONCLUSION: Medication non-adherence may be significantly associated with all-cause hospitalisation and mortality in older people. Medication adherence should be monitored and addressed in this cohort to minimise hospitalisation, improve clinical outcomes and reduce healthcare costs. ",
        "Population Impact Attributable to Modifiable Risk Factors for Hyperuricemia. OBJECTIVE: To examine modifiable risk factors in relation to the presence of hyperuricemia and to estimate the proportion of hyperuricemia cases in the general population that could be prevented by risk factor modification, along with estimates of the variance explained. METHODS: Using data obtained from 14,624 adults representative of the US civilian noninstitutionalized population, we calculated adjusted prevalence ratios for hyperuricemia, population attributable risks (PARs), and the variance explained according to the following 4 factors: body mass index (BMI; \u226525 kg/m2 ), alcohol intake, nonadherence to a Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet, and diuretic use. RESULTS: BMI, alcohol intake, adherence to a DASH-style diet, and diuretic use were all associated with serum urate levels and the presence of hyperuricemia in a dose-dependent manner. The corresponding PARs of hyperuricemia cases for overweight/obesity (prevalence 60%), nonadherence to a DASH-style diet (prevalence 82%), alcohol use (prevalence 48%), and diuretic use (prevalence 8%) were 44% (95% confidence interval [95% CI] 41%, 48%), 9% (95% CI 3%, 16%), 8% (95% CI 5%, 11%), and 12% (95% CI 11%, 14%), respectively, whereas the corresponding variances explained were 8.9%, 0.1%, 0.5%, and 5.0%. Our simulation study showed the variance nearing 0% as exposure prevalence neared 100%. CONCLUSION: In this nationally representative study, 4 modifiable risk factors (BMI, the DASH diet, alcohol use, and diuretic use) could be used to individually account for a notable proportion of hyperuricemia cases. However, the corresponding serum urate variance explained by these risk factors was very small and paradoxically masked their high prevalences, providing real-life empirical evidence for its limitations in assessing common risk factors.

        "Sex and Height Influence Neck Posture When Using Electronic Handheld Devices. With increased tablet ownership in the United States comes increased levels of neck flexion compared to desktop or laptop computer use, and these neck postures have been linked to increases in neck pain. Importantly, tablet viewing postures can be achieved in multiple ways and could be determined by the morphology of the individual and/or other extraneous factors. In this study, we aim to preliminarily evaluate how neck postures vary during tablet use among individuals and link this variation to other factors such as sex, height, weight, presence/absence of temporomandibular joint disorder (TMD), and morphology of the head and neck. We analyzed two-dimensional landmarks placed on lateral-view radiographs of 22 participants (10 female and 12 male) seated in neutral, upright, fully flexed, semi-reclined, and reclined postures. We utilize geometric morphometric techniques, which are advantageous for evaluating shape variation and have not been extensively applied to biomechanical analyses. We found skeletal morphology to be significantly related to sex and height in all but the neutral posture (P\u2009<\u20090.05), and weight was marginally significantly related to shape in the semi-reclined posture (P = 0.047). Morphologically, male participants exhibited more flexion at the articulatio atlantooccipitalis than females, and females showed greater mandibular protrusion than males, although this result is likely related to height. No relationship was found between posture and TMD. This research establishes a framework for future work that uses geometric morphometric analyses to evaluate how neck postures vary in relation to TMD. Clin.

        "ITGA5 inhibition in pancreatic stellate cells attenuates desmoplasia and potentiates efficacy of chemotherapy in pancreatic cancer. Abundant desmoplastic stroma is the hallmark for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), which not only aggravates the tumor growth but also prevents tumor penetration of chemotherapy, leading to treatment failure. There is an unmet clinical need to develop therapeutic solutions to the tumor penetration problem. In this study, we investigated the therapeutic potential of integrin \u03b15 (ITGA5) receptor in the PDAC stroma. ITGA5 was overexpressed in the tumor stroma from PDAC patient samples, and overexpression was inversely correlated with overall survival. In vitro, knockdown of ITGA5 inhibited differentiation of human pancreatic stellate cells (hPSCs) and reduced desmoplasia in vivo. Our novel peptidomimetic AV3 against ITGA5 inhibited hPSC activation and enhanced the antitumor effect of gemcitabine in a 3D heterospheroid model. In vivo, AV3 showed a strong reduction of desmoplasia, leading to decompression of blood vasculature, enhanced tumor perfusion, and thereby the efficacy of gemcitabine in co-injection and patient-derived xenograft tumor models.

        "Salmonella persisters promote the spread of antibiotic resistance plasmids in the gut. The emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria through mutations or the acquisition of genetic material such as resistance plasmids represents a major public health issue1,2. Persisters are subpopulations of bacteria that survive antibiotics by reversibly adapting their physiology3-10, and can promote the emergence of antibiotic-resistant mutants11. We investigated whether persisters can also promote the spread of resistance plasmids. In contrast to mutations, the transfer of resistance plasmids requires the co-occurrence of both a donor and a recipient bacterial strain. For our experiments, we chose the facultative intracellular entero-pathogen Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (S.\u00a0Typhimurium) and Escherichia coli, a common member of the microbiota12. S.\u00a0Typhimurium forms persisters that survive antibiotic therapy in several host tissues. Here we show that tissue-associated S.\u00a0Typhimurium persisters represent long-lived reservoirs of plasmid donors or recipients. The formation of reservoirs of S.\u00a0Typhimurium persisters requires Salmonella pathogenicity island (SPI)-1 and/or SPI-2 in gut-associated tissues, or SPI-2 at systemic sites. The re-seeding of these persister bacteria into the gut lumen enables the co-occurrence of donors with gut-resident recipients, and thereby favours plasmid transfer between various strains of Enterobacteriaceae. We observe up to 99% transconjugants within two to three days of re-seeding. Mathematical modelling shows that rare re-seeding events may suffice for a high frequency of conjugation. Vaccination reduces the formation of reservoirs of persisters after oral infection with S.\u00a0Typhimurium, as well as subsequent plasmid transfer. We conclude that-even without selection for plasmid-encoded resistance genes-small reservoirs of pathogen persisters can foster the spread of promiscuous resistance plasmids in the gut. ",
        "Association between pubic hair grooming and prevalent sexually transmitted infection among female university students. Recent findings have suggested an association between pubic hair grooming and self-reported history of sexually transmitted infection (STI), specifically gonococcal infection (GC), chlamydial infection (CT), or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). We evaluated the association between self-reported extreme grooming and laboratory-confirmed prevalence of GC/CT. Between April 2017 and April 2018, we enrolled English-speaking, adult, female students at a large, Midwestern university who presented on-campus for STI testing. Participants completed a questionnaire on demographics and sexual and grooming behaviors, which was linked to their GC/CT test results based on nucleic acid amplification testing. We defined extreme grooming as removal of all pubic hair either at least weekly in the past 12 months or \u22656 times in the past 30 days. We used two separate logistic regression models to determine whether odds of GC/CT varied by extreme groomer status for either time interval. In the study sample of 214 women, prevalence of GC/CT was 9.8%. Nearly all participants (98.1%) reported ever grooming; 53.6% were extreme groomers in the past year and 18% in the past month. Extreme grooming was not associated with prevalent GC/CT in the past year (odds ratio [OR] = 0.8; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.3-1.9; adjusted OR = 0.7; 95% CI: 0.3-2.0) or in the past month (OR = 0.5; 95% CI: 0.1-2.0; aOR = 0.4; 95% CI: 0.1-1.9). Pubic hair grooming was common among female university students attending for STI testing. Findings do not support pubic hair grooming as an STI risk factor in this population. ",
        "The transcribed pseudogene RPSAP52 enhances the oncofetal HMGA2-IGF2BP2-RAS axis through LIN28B-dependent and independent let-7 inhibition. One largely unknown question in cell biology is the discrimination between inconsequential and functional transcriptional events with relevant regulatory functions. Here, we find that the oncofetal HMGA2 gene is aberrantly reexpressed in many tumor types together with its antisense transcribed pseudogene RPSAP52. RPSAP52 is abundantly present in the cytoplasm, where it interacts with the RNA binding protein IGF2BP2/IMP2, facilitating its binding to mRNA targets, promoting their translation by mediating their recruitment on polysomes and enhancing proliferative and self-renewal pathways. Notably, downregulation of RPSAP52 impairs the balance between the oncogene LIN28B and the tumor suppressor let-7 family of miRNAs, inhibits cellular proliferation and migration in vitro and slows down tumor growth in vivo. In addition, high levels of RPSAP52 in patient samples associate with a worse prognosis in sarcomas. Overall, we reveal the roles of a transcribed pseudogene that may display properties of an oncofetal master regulator in human cancers. ",
        "Acrolein-mediated alpha-synuclein pathology involvement in the early post-injury pathogenesis of mild blast-induced Parkinsonian neurodegeneration. Survivors of blast-induced traumatic brain injury (bTBI) have increased susceptibility to Parkinson's disease (PD), characterized by \u03b1-synuclein aggregation and the progressive degeneration of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons. Using an established bTBI rat model, we evaluated the changes of \u03b1-synuclein and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), known hallmarks of PD, and acrolein, a reactive aldehyde and marker of oxidative stress, with the aim of revealing key pathways leading to PD post-bTBI. Indicated in both animal models of PD and TBI, acrolein is likely a point of pathogenic convergence. Here we show that after a single mild bTBI, acrolein is elevated up to a week, systemically in urine, and in whole brain tissue, specifically the substantia nigra and striatum. Acrolein elevation is accompanied by heightened \u03b1-synuclein oligomerization, dopaminergic dysregulation, and acrolein/\u03b1-synuclein interaction in the same brain regions. We further show that acrolein can directly modify and oligomerize \u03b1-synuclein in vitro. Taken together, our data suggests acrolein likely plays an important role in inducing PD pathology following bTBI by encouraging \u03b1-synuclein aggregation. These results are expected to advance our understanding of the long-term post-bTBI pathological changes leading to the development of PD, and suggest intervention targets to curtail such pathology.

        "Human origins in a southern African palaeo-wetland and first migrations. Anatomically modern humans originated in Africa around 200\u00a0thousand years ago (ka)1-4. Although some of the oldest skeletal remains suggest an eastern African origin2, southern Africa is home to contemporary populations that represent the earliest branch of human genetic phylogeny5,6. Here we generate, to our knowledge, the largest resource for the poorly represented and deepest-rooting maternal L0 mitochondrial DNA branch (198 new mitogenomes for a total of 1,217 mitogenomes) from contemporary southern Africans and show the geographical isolation of L0d1'2, L0k and L0g KhoeSan descendants south of the Zambezi river in Africa. By establishing mitogenomic timelines, frequencies and dispersals, we show that the L0 lineage emerged within the residual Makgadikgadi-Okavango palaeo-wetland of southern Africa7, approximately 200\u00a0ka (95% confidence interval, 240-165\u00a0ka). Genetic divergence points to a sustained 70,000-year-long existence of the L0 lineage before an out-of-homeland northeast-southwest dispersal between 130 and 110\u00a0ka. Palaeo-climate proxy and model data suggest that increased humidity opened green corridors, first to the northeast then to the southwest. Subsequent drying of the homeland corresponds to a sustained effective population size (L0k), whereas wet-dry cycles and probable adaptation to marine foraging allowed the southwestern migrants to achieve population growth (L0d1'2), as supported by extensive south-coastal archaeological evidence8-10. Taken together, we propose a southern African origin of anatomically modern humans with sustained homeland occupation before the first migrations of people that\u00a0appear to have\u00a0been driven by regional climate\u00a0changes.

        "Electronic cigarette use and sleep health in young adults. Poor sleep health is associated with numerous health concerns, and sleep problems are exacerbated by cigarette smoking. Although rates of traditional tobacco use are declining, rates of electronic cigarette (e-cigarette) use are comparatively high and growing. Given that nicotine is a primary mechanism by which smoking negatively impacts sleep health, e-cigarette use may also be linked to poor sleep health; however, no research has investigated this association. Participants were 1,664 college students, 40.9% of whom reported ever trying or currently using an e-cigarette. Questionnaires assessed demographic information, sleep health and e-cigarette use status and patterns. All measures were completed remotely via a secure online survey. Analysis of covariance was used to compare the sleep health of daily/non-daily e-cigarette users to (a) non-users and (b) users of combustible cigarettes. Gender and drinks per week were included as covariates in analyses. Current combustible and e-cigarette users reported significantly more sleep difficulties than never users. Users of e-cigarettes reported greater use of sleep medication than combustible cigarette users. Similar to combustible cigarette smoking, e-cigarette use (vs. non-use) was associated with worse sleep health, even among non-daily e-cigarette users. These findings may indicate a need for assessment of and education on the role of e-cigarette use in sleep health among individuals who report experimentation with or current use of e-cigarettes. Future research should examine these relationships prospectively. ",
        "White matter cortico-striatal tracts predict apathy subtypes in Huntington's disease. BACKGROUND: Apathy is the neuropsychiatric syndrome that correlates most highly with Huntington's disease progression, and, like early patterns of neurodegeneration, is associated with lesions to cortico-striatal connections. However, due to its multidimensional nature and elusive etiology, treatment options are limited. OBJECTIVES: To disentangle underlying white matter microstructural correlates across the apathy spectrum in Huntington's disease. METHODS: Forty-six Huntington's disease individuals (premanifest (N\u202f=\u202f22) and manifest (N\u202f=\u202f24)) and 35 healthy controls were scanned at 3-tesla and underwent apathy evaluation using the short-Problem Behavior Assessment and short-Lille Apathy Rating Scale, with the latter being characterized into three apathy domains, namely emotional, cognitive, and auto-activation deficit. Diffusion tensor imaging was used to study whether individual differences in specific cortico-striatal tracts predicted global apathy and its subdomains. RESULTS: We elucidate that apathy profiles may develop along differential timelines, with the auto-activation deficit domain manifesting prior to motor onset. Furthermore, diffusion tensor imaging revealed that inter-individual variability in the disruption of discrete cortico-striatal tracts might explain the heterogeneous severity of apathy profiles. Specifically, higher levels of auto-activation deficit symptoms significantly correlated with increased mean diffusivity in the right uncinate fasciculus. Conversely, those with severe cognitive apathy demonstrated increased mean diffusivity in the right frontostriatal tract and left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex to caudate nucleus tract. CONCLUSIONS: The current study provides evidence that white matter correlates associated with emotional, cognitive, and auto-activation subtypes may elucidate the heterogeneous nature of apathy in Huntington's disease, as such opening a door for individualized pharmacological management of apathy as a multidimensional syndrome in other neurodegenerative disorders.

        "Risk of rebleeding, vascular events and death after gastrointestinal bleeding in anticoagulant and/or antiplatelet users. BACKGROUND: Patients with gastrointestinal bleeding during anticoagulant and/or antiplatelet therapy represent a clinical challenge. AIM: To determine the risk/rates of rebleeding, vascular events and death in patients treated with antiplatelet or anticoagulant agents who developed major gastrointestinal bleeding METHODS: This was an observational cohort study of patients who developed gastrointestinal bleeding while on antiplatelet and/or anticoagulant therapy. Drug use information was collected prospectively during bleeding events. Cox proportional hazards models were used to evaluate rebleeding, vascular events and death. RESULTS: Among 871 patients (mean age 78.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a08.6\u00a0years), 38.9% used an anticoagulant, 52.5% used an antiplatelet and 8.6% used both; 93.1% interrupted treatment after gastrointestinal bleeding and 80.5% restarted therapy within 7.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a036.4\u00a0days; 38.7% had upper gastrointestinal bleeds, 46.7% lower gastrointestinal bleeds and 14.6% gastrointestinal bleeds of unknown origin. Median follow-up was 24.9\u00a0months (IQR: 7.0-38.0). Resumption of both therapies was associated with a higher risk of rebleeding, lower risk of ischaemic events or death and a similar risk for upper and lower gastrointestinal events. Resumption of therapy\u00a0\u2264\u00a07\u00a0days after bleeding showed a similar pattern with no differences in death. Rebleeding rates were higher in anticoagulant vs antiplatelet patients (138.0 vs 99.0 events per 1000 patient-years), and the bleeding location was identical in 61.8% of cases. CONCLUSIONS: Resumption of anticoagulant or antiplatelet therapy after a gastrointestinal bleeding event was associated with a lower risk of vascular events and death and a higher rebleeding risk. The benefits of early reinstitution of anticoagulant/antiplatelet therapy outweigh the gastrointestinal-related risks. ",
        "Discovery of novel bacterial queuine salvage enzymes and pathways in human pathogens. Queuosine (Q) is a complex tRNA modification widespread in eukaryotes and bacteria that contributes to the efficiency and accuracy of protein synthesis. Eukaryotes are not capable of Q synthesis and rely on salvage of the queuine base (q) as a Q precursor. While many bacteria are capable of Q de novo synthesis, salvage of the prokaryotic Q precursors preQ0 and preQ1 also occurs. With the exception of Escherichia coli YhhQ, shown to transport preQ0 and preQ1, the enzymes and transporters involved in Q salvage and recycling have not been well described. We discovered and characterized 2 Q salvage pathways present in many pathogenic and commensal bacteria. The first, found in the intracellular pathogen Chlamydia trachomatis, uses YhhQ and tRNA guanine transglycosylase (TGT) homologs that have changed substrate specificities to directly salvage q, mimicking the eukaryotic pathway. The second, found in bacteria from the gut flora such as Clostridioides difficile, salvages preQ1 from q through an unprecedented reaction catalyzed by a newly defined subgroup of the radical-SAM enzyme family. The source of q can be external through transport by members of the energy-coupling factor (ECF) family or internal through hydrolysis of Q by a dedicated nucleosidase. This work reinforces the concept that hosts and members of their associated microbiota compete for the salvage of Q precursors micronutrients. ",
        "Functional Logic of Layer 2/3 Inhibitory Connectivity in the Ferret Visual Cortex. Understanding how cortical inhibition shapes circuit function requires identifying the connectivity rules relating the response properties of inhibitory interneurons and their postsynaptic targets. Here we explore the orientation tuning of layer 2/3 inhibitory inputs in the ferret visual cortex using a combination of in\u00a0vivo axon imaging, functional input mapping, and physiology. Inhibitory boutons exhibit robust orientation-tuned responses with preferences that can differ significantly from the cortical column in which they reside. Inhibitory input fields measured with patterned optogenetic stimulation and intracellular recordings revealed that these inputs originate from a wide range of orientation domains, inconsistent with a model of co-tuned inhibition and excitation. Intracellular synaptic conductance measurements confirm that individual neurons can depart from a co-tuned regime. Our results argue against a simple rule for the arrangement of inhibitory inputs supplied by layer 2/3 circuits and suggest that heterogeneity in presynaptic inhibitory networks contributes to neural response properties.

        "Mobile Photoplethysmographic Technology to Detect Atrial Fibrillation. BACKGROUND: Low detection and nonadherence are major problems in current management approaches for patients with suspected atrial fibrillation (AF). Mobile health devices may enable earlier AF detection and improved AF management. OBJECTIVES: This study sought to investigate the effectiveness of AF screening in a large population-based cohort using smart device-based photoplethysmography (PPG) technology, combined with a clinical care AF management pathway using a mobile health approach. METHODS: AF screening was performed with smart devices using PPG technology, which were made available for the population\u00a0\u226518 years of age across China. Monitoring for at least 14\u00a0days with a wristband (Honor Band 4) or wristwatch (Huawei Watch GT, Honor Watch, Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd., Shenzhen, China) was allowed. The patients with \"possible AF\" episodes using the PPG algorithm were further confirmed by health providers among the MAFA (mobile AF app) Telecare center and network hospitals, with clinical evaluation, electrocardiogram, or 24-h Holter monitoring. RESULTS: There were 246,541 individuals who downloaded the PPG screening app, and 187,912 individuals used smart devices to monitor their pulse rhythm between October 26, 2018, and May 20, 2019. Among those with PPG monitoring (mean age 35 years, 86.7% male), 424 (of 187,912, 0.23%) (mean age 54 years, 87.0% male) received a \"suspected AF\" notification. Of those effectively followed up, 227 individuals (of 262, 87.0%) were confirmed as having AF, with the positive predictive value of PPG signals being 91.6% (95% confidential interval [CI]: 91.5% to 91.8%). Both suspected AF and identified AF markedly increased with age (p for trend\u00a0<0.001), and individuals in Northeast China had the highest proportion of detected AF of 0.28% (95%\u00a0CI: 0.20% to 0.39%). Of the individuals with identified AF, 216 (of 227, 95.1%) subsequently entered a program of integrated AF management using a mobile AF application; approximately 80% of high-risk patients were successfully anticoagulated. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the present study, continuous home monitoring with smart device-based PPG technology could be a feasible approach for AF screening. This would help efforts at screening and detection of AF, as well as early interventions to reduce stroke and other AF-related complications.

        "Large-Scale Networks for Auditory Sensory Gating in the Awake Mouse. The amplitude of the brain response to a repeated auditory stimulus is diminished as compared to the response to the first tone (T1) for interstimulus intervals (ISI) lasting up to hundreds of milliseconds. This adaptation process, called auditory sensory gating (ASG), is altered in various psychiatric diseases including schizophrenia and is classically studied by focusing on early evoked cortical responses to the second tone (T2) using 500-ms ISI. However, mechanisms underlying ASG are still not well-understood. We investigated ASG in awake mice from the brainstem to cortex at variable ISIs (125-2000 ms) using high-density EEG and intracerebral recordings. While ASG decreases at longer ISIs, it is still present at durations (500-2000 ms) far beyond the time during which brain responses to T1 could still be detected. T1 induces a sequence of specific stable scalp EEG topographies that correspond to the successive activation of distinct neural networks lasting about 350 ms. These brain states remain unaltered if T2 is presented during this period, although T2 is processed by the brain, suggesting that ongoing networks of brain activity are active for longer than early evoked-potentials and are not overwritten by an upcoming new stimulus. Intracerebral recordings demonstrate that ASG is already present at the level of ventral cochlear nucleus (vCN) and inferior colliculus and is amplified across the hierarchy in bottom-up direction. This study uncovers the extended stability of sensory-evoked brain states and long duration of ASG, and sheds light on generators of ASG and possible interactions between bottom-up and top-down mechanisms.

        "Impact of Hypertension and Preeclampsia Intervention Trial At Near Term-I (HYPITAT-I) on obstetric management and outcome in The Netherlands. OBJECTIVE: The Hypertension and Preeclampsia Intervention Trial At near Term-I (HYPITAT-I) randomized controlled trial showed that, in women with gestational hypertension or mild pre-eclampsia at term, induction of labor, compared with expectant management, was associated with improved maternal outcome without compromising neonatal outcome. The aim of the current study was to evaluate the impact of these findings on obstetric management and maternal and perinatal outcomes in The Netherlands. METHODS: We retrieved data for the period 2000-2014 from the Dutch National Perinatal Registry, including 143\u2009749 women with gestational hypertension or pre-eclampsia and a singleton fetus in cephalic presentation, delivered between 36\u2009+\u20090 and 40\u2009+\u20096\u2009weeks of gestation (hypertensive disorder of pregnancy (HDP) group). Pregnant women without HDP were used as the reference group (n\u2009=\u20091\u2009649\u2009510). The HYPITAT-I trial was conducted between 2005 and 2008. To study the impact of HYPITAT-I, we compared rate of induction of labor, mode of delivery and maternal and perinatal outcomes in the periods before (2000-2005) and after (2008-2014) the trial. We also differentiated between hospitals that participated in HYPITAT-I and those that did not. RESULTS: In the HDP group, the rate of induction of labor increased from 51.1% before the HYPITAT-I trial to 64.2% after it (relative risk (RR), 1.26; 95%\u00a0CI, 1.24-1.27). Maternal mortality decreased from 0.022% before the trial to 0.004% after it (RR, 0.20; 95%\u00a0CI, 0.06-0.70) and perinatal death decreased from 0.49% to 0.27% (RR, 0.54; 95%\u00a0CI, 0.45-0.65), which was attributable mostly to a decrease in fetal death. Both the increase in induction rate and the reduction in hypertensive complications were more pronounced in hospitals that participated in the HYPITAT-I trial than in those that did not. Following HYPITAT-I, the rate of induction of labor also increased (by 4.6 percentage points) in the reference group; however, the relative increase in the HDP group (13.1 percentage points) was significantly greater (P\u2009<\u20090.001 for the interaction). The reduction in maternal and perinatal deaths did not differ significantly between the HDP and reference groups. There was a decreased incidence of placental abruption in both HDP and reference groups, which was significantly greater in the HDP than in the reference group (P\u2009<\u20090.001 for the interaction). There was also an increased incidence of emergency Cesarean section in both HDP and reference groups; however, this change was significantly greater in the reference than in the HDP group (P\u2009<\u20090.001 for the interaction). CONCLUSION: Following the HYPITAT-I trial, there was a higher rate of induction of labor and improved obstetric outcome in term pregnancies complicated by HDP in The Netherlands.

        "Annual Spending per Patient and Quality in Hospital-Owned Versus Physician-Owned Organizations: an Observational Study. BACKGROUND: Recent studies that compared patient spending in hospital-owned physician practices versus physician-owned groups did not compare quality of care. Past studies had incomplete measures of physician-hospital integration, or lacked patient-level data. OBJECTIVE: To measure the association between physician-hospital integration and both spending and quality using patient-level data and explicit physician-hospital contracting information. DESIGN: Retrospective review of claims data from 2014 through 2016. Adjustments were made for patient, physician, and regional characteristics. PATIENTS: Patients aged 19 to 64 enrolled in a Blue Cross Blue Shield Texas Preferred Provider Organization in the four largest metropolitan areas in Texas who could be attributed to a physician practice based on claims. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Annual spending per patient was compared for patients treated by a physician practice that is billing through a hospital, versus billing through an independent physician practice; spending was also subdivided by BETOS category, by site and type of care, and percent of patients with positive spending by subcategory. Quality measures included readmission within 30\u00a0days of discharge for hospitalized patients, appropriate care for diabetic patients, and screening mammography for women ages 50-64. RESULTS: Estimates suggest that patients in a preferred provider organization incur spending which is 5.8 percentage points higher when treated by doctors in hospital-owned versus physician-owned practices (95% CI 1.7 to 9.9; p\u2009=\u20090.006). Spending is significantly higher for durable medical equipment, imaging, unclassified services, and outpatient care. The spending difference appears attributable to greater service utilization rather than higher prices. There was no consistent difference in care quality for hospital-owned versus physician-owned practices. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: We find that financial integration between physicians and hospitals raises patient spending, but not care quality. Given that higher spending raises the price of health insurance, policy makers should carefully consider policies that limit consolidation of hospitals and physicians. ",
        "Upconversion superballs for programmable photoactivation of therapeutics. Upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) are the preferred choice for deep-tissue photoactivation, owing to their unique capability of converting deep tissue-penetrating near-infrared light to UV/visible light for photoactivation. Programmed photoactivation of multiple molecules is critical for controlling many biological processes. However, syntheses of such UCNPs require epitaxial growth of multiple shells on the core nanocrystals and are highly complex/time-consuming. To overcome this bottleneck, we have modularly assembled two distinct UCNPs which can individually be excited by 980/808\u2009nm light, but not both. These orthogonal photoactivable UCNPs superballs are used for programmed photoactivation of multiple therapeutic processes for enhanced\u00a0efficacy. These include sequential activation of endosomal escape through photochemical-internalization for enhanced cellular\u00a0uptake, followed by photocontrolled gene knockdown of superoxide dismutase-1 to increase sensitivity to reactive oxygen species and finally, photodynamic therapy under these favorable conditions. Such programmed activation translated to significantly higher therapeutic efficacy in vitro and in vivo in comparison to conventional, non-programmed activation. ",
        "Initial clinical application of tissue pH neutralization after esophageal button battery removal in children. OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: Pediatric esophageal button battery (BB) injuries can progress even after removal and continue to be a significant source of morbidity and mortality. The objective in this case series is to present initial safety data for the human application of intraoperative tissue pH neutralization using 0.25% acetic acid irrigation after BB removal. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective case series. METHODS: Pediatric patients who underwent rigid esophagoscopy for BB removal between October 2016 and December 2017 and who had the injury site irrigated with 120 to 150\u2009mL sterile 0.25% acetic acid (pH\u2009=\u20093) were included in the study. Outcome measures included visual tissue appearance after irrigation, immediate or delayed esophageal perforation, and evidence of eventual esophageal stricture formation. RESULTS: Six pediatric patients (aged 19\u2009months-10\u2009years) had a 3\u2009V lithium BB lodged in the esophagus for 2 to 18\u2009hours and had irrigation of the esophageal injury site with sterile 0.25% acetic acid in the operating room after BB removal. None of the patients showed any evidence of thermal tissue injury. By surgeon assessment, all cases had improved visual esophageal tissue appearance. Neither immediate post-operative or delayed onset esophageal perforation nor eventual stricture development were seen. CONCLUSIONS: Esophageal irrigation in the operating room with sterile 0.25% acetic acid after BB removal, to neutralize the highly alkaline tissue microenvironment (pH\u200910-13) was safe and resulted in improved visual mucosal appearance. This immediate tissue pH neutralization may help halt the progression of liquefactive necrosis by immediately bringing tissue pH to physiologic range. This post-removal irrigation technique is recommended by current National Capital Poison Center BB guidelines. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 4 Laryngoscope, 129:1772-1776, 2019. ",
        "Dual lysosomal-mitochondrial targeting by antihistamines to eradicate leukaemic cells. BACKGROUND: Despite great efforts to identify druggable molecular targets for AML, there remains an unmet need for more effective therapies. METHODS: An in silico screening was performed using Connectivity Maps to identify FDA-approved drugs that may revert an early leukaemic transformation gene signature. Hit compounds were validated in AML cell lines. Cytotoxic effects were assessed both in primary AML patient samples and healthy donor blood cells. Xenotransplantation assays were undertaken to determine the effect on engraftment of hit compounds. The mechanism of action responsible for the antileukaemic effect was studied focussing on lysosomes and mitochondria. FINDINGS: We identified a group of antihistamines (termed ANHAs) with distinct physicochemical properties associated with their cationic-amphiphilic nature, that selectively killed leukaemic cells. ANHAs behaved as antileukaemic agents against primary AML samples ex vivo, sparing healthy cells. Moreover, ANHAs severely impaired the in vivo leukaemia regeneration capacity. ANHAs' cytotoxicity relied on simultaneous mitochondrial and lysosomal disruption and induction of autophagy and apoptosis. The pharmacological effect was exerted based on their physicochemical properties that permitted the passive targeting of both organelles, without the involvement of active molecular recognition. INTERPRETATION: Dual targeting of lysosomes and mitochondria constitutes a new promising therapeutic approach for leukaemia treatment, supporting the further clinical development. FUND: This work was funded by the Fundaci\u00f3n Mutua Madrile\u00f1a (RMR), CaixaImpulse (RMR), the Spanish Ministry of Economy (RMR), the Josep Carreras International Leukaemia Foundation (RMR), l'Obra Social \"La Caixa\" (RMR), and Generalitat de Catalunya (IJC).

        "Intestinal serotonin and fluoxetine exposure modulate bacterial colonization in the gut. The gut microbiota regulates levels of serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)) in the intestinal epithelium and lumen1-5. However, whether 5-HT plays a functional role in bacteria from the gut microbiota remains unknown. We demonstrate that elevating levels of intestinal lumenal 5-HT by oral supplementation or genetic deficiency in the host 5-HT transporter (SERT) increases the relative abundance of spore-forming members of the gut microbiota, which were previously reported to promote host 5-HT biosynthesis. Within this microbial community, we identify Turicibacter sanguinis as a gut bacterium that expresses a neurotransmitter sodium symporter-related protein with sequence and structural homology to mammalian SERT. T. sanguinis imports 5-HT through a mechanism that is inhibited by the selective 5-HT reuptake inhibitor fluoxetine. 5-HT reduces the expression of sporulation factors and membrane transporters in T. sanguinis, which is reversed by fluoxetine exposure. Treating T. sanguinis with 5-HT or fluoxetine modulates its competitive colonization in the gastrointestinal tract of antibiotic-treated mice. In addition, fluoxetine reduces the membership of T. sanguinis in the gut microbiota of conventionally colonized mice. Host association with T. sanguinis alters intestinal expression of multiple gene pathways, including those important for lipid and steroid metabolism, with corresponding reductions in host systemic triglyceride levels and inguinal adipocyte size. Together, these findings support the notion that select bacteria indigenous to the gut microbiota signal bidirectionally with the host serotonergic system to promote their fitness in the intestine.

        "Sorafenib with Transarterial Chemoembolization Achieves Improved Survival vs. Sorafenib Alone in Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma: A Nationwide Population-Based Cohort Study. We hypothesized that sorafenib plus transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) would confer survival benefits over sorafenib alone for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (aHCC). We investigated this while using the population-based All-Cancer Dataset to assemble a cohort (n = 3674; median age, 60; 83% men) of patients receiving sorafenib for aHCC (Child-Pugh A) with macro-vascular invasion or nodal/distant metastases. The patients were classified into the sorafenib-TACE group (n = 426) or the propensity score-matched sorafenib-alone group (n = 1686). All of the participants were followed up until death or the end of the study. Time-dependent Cox model and the Mantel-Byar test were used for survival analysis. During the median follow-ups of 221 and 133 days for the sorafenib-TACE and sorafenib-alone groups, 164 (39%) and 916 (54%) deaths occurred, respectively; the corresponding median overall survivals (OS) were 381 and 204 days, respectively (hazard ratio, HR: 0.74; 95% confidence interval, CI, 0.63-0.88; p = 0.021). The one-year and six-month OS were 53.5% and 80.3% in the sorafenib-TACE group and 32.4% and 54.4% in the sorafenib-alone group, respectively. The major complications were comparable between the two groups. The addition of TACE to sorafenib improves survival, with a 26% reduction in mortality. These findings provide strong real-world evidence that supports this combination strategy for eligible Child-Pugh A aHCC patients. ",
        "Mortality After Discontinuation of Primary Care-Based Chronic Opioid Therapy for Pain: a Retrospective Cohort Study. BACKGROUND: Despite known risks of using chronic opioid therapy (COT) for pain, the risks of discontinuation of COT are largely uncharacterized. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate mortality, prescription opioid use, and primary care utilization of patients discontinued from COT, compared with patients maintained on opioids. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study of patients with chronic pain enrolled in an opioid registry as of May 2010. PARTICIPANTS: Patients with chronic pain enrolled in the opioid registry of a primary care clinic at an urban safety-net hospital in Seattle, WA. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Discontinuation from the opioid registry was the exposure of interest. Pre-specified main outcomes included mortality, prescription and primary care utilization data, and reasons for discontinuation. Data was collected through March 2015. KEY RESULTS: The study cohort comprised 572 patients with a mean age of 54.9\u2009\u00b1\u200910.1\u00a0years. COT was discontinued in 344 patients (60.1%); 254 (73.8%) discontinued patients subsequently filled at least one opioid prescription in Washington State, and 187 (54.4%) continued to visit the clinic. During the study period, 119 (20.8%) registry patients died, and 21 (3.7%) died of definite or possible overdose: 17 (4.9%) discontinued patients died of overdose, whereas 4 (1.75%) retained patients died of overdose. Most patients had at least one provider-initiated reason for COT discontinuation. Discontinuation of COT was associated with a hazard ratio for death of 1.35 (95% CI, 0.92 to 1.98, p\u2009=\u20090.122) and for overdose death of 2.94 (1.01-8.61, p\u2009=\u20090.049), after adjusting for age and race. CONCLUSIONS: In this cohort of patients prescribed COT for chronic pain, mortality was high. Discontinuation of COT did not reduce risk of death and was associated with increased risk of overdose death. Improved clinical strategies, including multimodal pain management and treatment of opioid use disorder, may be needed for this high-risk group. ",
        "Transmission-mode MALDI-2 mass spectrometry imaging of cells and tissues at subcellular resolution. Matrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization mass spectrometry imaging in transmission-mode geometry (t-MALDI-MSI) can provide molecular information with a pixel size of 1\u2009\u00b5m and smaller, which makes this label-free method highly interesting for characterizing the chemical composition of tissues and cells on a (sub)cellular level. However, a major hindrance for wider use of the technology is the reduced ion abundance at small pixel sizes. Here we mitigate this problem by use of laser-induced post-ionization (MALDI-2) and by adapting a t-MALDI-2 ion source to an Orbitrap mass analyzer. We demonstrate the crucial sensitivity and accuracy boosts that are achieved with this combination by visualizing the distribution of numerous phospho- and glycolipids in mouse cerebellum and kidney slices, and in cultured Vero B4 cells. With brain tissue, a pixel size of 600\u2009nm was achieved. Our method could constitute a valuable new tool for research in cell biology and biomedicine. ",
        "Owners' perception of acquiring infections through raw pet food: a comprehensive internet-based survey. There has been concerns related to the risk of bacterial contamination from raw pet food to humans, but research is still scarce. The purpose of this cross-sectional study was to use a worldwide internet survey-based data to evaluate the impact of raw pet foods on human health from the owners' experience. From 16\u2009475 households, 0.2 per cent (n=39) reported having had a transmission of pathogen from the raw pet food to a human family member during the time that raw feeding had been used in the household. Only in three of those households the same pathogen that was found in the human sample was analysed and confirmed also in the raw pet food (0.02 per cent of all data). Moreover, 0.1 per cent (n=24) reported suspecting that a disease could have been transmitted to a human from the pet food. Feeding salmon and turkey, using more than 50 per cent of the diet as raw foods and preparing the raw food in the same place and utensils as the family foods all had negative association with infections. Having 2 to 6 year-old children living in the household was associated with more infections, although adults were the most frequently infected. ",
        "Relationships between concurrent language ability and mental health outcomes in a South African sample of 13-year-olds. Children and adolescents with delayed or disordered language development are at increased risk of a number of negative outcomes, including social and emotional problems and mental health difficulties. Yet, in low- and middle- income countries, where risk factors for compromised language development are known to be prevalent, there is a lack of research on the association between child and adolescent language ability and mental health outcomes. This study evaluates data from a cross-sectional study in Khayelitsha, a semi-urban impoverished community near Cape Town, South Africa. To measure language ability, behaviour and mental health, adolescents aged 13 (n = 200) were assessed using the Riddles subtest of the Kaufman Assessment Battery for Children Version 2, the parent report Child Behaviour Checklist, and the self-report Moods and Feelings Questionnaire and the Self-Esteem Questionnaire. We conducted univariate and multivariate analyses to determine associations between language skills, self-esteem and mental health in this group of adolescents. Poor language ability was related to a range of concurrent adverse difficulties, such as attention deficits, self-esteem problems, social withdrawal, and depressive symptoms. Increased levels of language ability were related to better psychosocial profiles. In some cases, only individuals with a low level of language (bottom 10% of sample) were at increased risk of maladaptive outcomes. This study replicates the well-established relationship between language ability and poorer mental health found within high income countries in an upper middle-income country setting. Locally accessible support for children with reduced language ability is required, given the longer-term consequences of poorer mental health. ",
        "Surgical, speech, and hearing outcomes at five years of age in internationally adopted children and Swedish-born children with cleft lip and/or palate. Internationally adopted children (IAC) with a cleft lip and/or palate (CL/P) tend to arrive with un-operated palates at an age at which their Swedish-born peers have completed their primary palate surgery. Our aim of the present study was to analyze surgical, speech and hearing outcomes of IAC at age 5 and compare with those of a matched group of Swedish-born children. Fifty children with CL/P born in 1994-2005 participated in the study. Twenty-five IAC were matched according to age, sex and cleft type with 25 Swedish-born children. Audio recordings were perceptually analyzed by two experienced, blinded speech-language pathologists. Hearing and speech statuses were evaluated on the same day for all children. Surgical timing and complications as in fistulas and requirement for secondary velopharyngeal (VP) surgery, speech evaluation results, and present hearing status were analyzed for all children of age 5\u2009years. Results showed that primary palatal surgery was delayed by a mean of 21\u2009months in IAC. IAC had a higher prevalence of velopharyngeal impairment that was statistically significant, a higher fistula rate, and experienced more secondary surgery than Swedish-born peers. Hearing loss due to middle ear disease was slightly more common among IAC, whereas the rate of treatment with tympanostomy tubes was similar between the two groups. In conclusion, IAC with CL/P represent a challenge for CL/P teams because of the heterogeneous nature of the patient group and difficulties associated with delayed treatment, and the results show the importance of close follow-up over time.

        "Association of Race/Ethnicity With Emergency Department Destination of Emergency Medical Services Transport. Importance: Evidence from national studies indicates systematic differences in hospitals in which racial/ethnic minorities receive care, with most care obtained in a small proportion of hospitals. Little is known about the source of these differences. Objectives: To examine the patterns of emergency department (ED) destination of emergency medical services (EMS) transport according to patient race/ethnicity, and to compare the patterns between those transported by EMS and those who did not use EMS. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study of US EMS and EDs used Medicare claims data from January 1, 2006, to December 31, 2012. Enrollees aged 66 years or older with continuous fee-for-service Medicare coverage (N\u2009=\u2009864\u202f750) were selected for the sample. Zip codes with a sizable count (>10) of Hispanic, non-Hispanic black, and non-Hispanic white enrollees were used for comparison of EMS use across racial/ethnic subgroups. Data on all ED visits, with and without EMS use, were obtained. Data analysis was performed from December 18, 2018, to July 7, 2019. Main Outcomes and Measures: The main outcome measure was whether an EMS transport destination was the most frequent ED destination among white patients (reference ED). The secondary outcomes were (1) whether the ED destination was a safety-net hospital and (2) the distance of EMS transport from the ED destination. Results: The study cohort comprised 864\u202f750 Medicare enrollees from 4175 selected zip codes who had 458\u202f701 ED visits using EMS transport. Of these EMS-transported enrollees, 26.1% (127 555) were younger than 75 years, and most were women (302\u202f430 [66.8%]). Overall, the proportion of white patients transported to the reference ED was 61.3% (95% CI, 61.0% to 61.7%); this rate was lower among black enrollees (difference of -5.3%; 95% CI, -6.0% to -4.6%) and Hispanic enrollees (difference of -2.5%; 95% CI, -3.2% to -1.7%). A similar pattern was found among patients with high-risk acute conditions; the proportion transported to the reference ED was 61.5% (95% CI, 60.7% to 62.2%) among white enrollees, whereas this proportion was lower among black enrollees (difference of -6.7%; 95% CI, -8.3% to -5.0%) and Hispanic enrollees (difference of -2.6%; 95% CI, -4.5% to -0.7%). In major US cities, a larger black-white discordance in ED destination was observed (-9.3%; 95% CI, -10.9% to -7.7%). Black and Hispanic patients were more likely to be transported to a safety-net ED compared with their white counterparts; the proportion transported to a safety-net ED among white enrollees (18.5%; 95% CI, 18.1% to 18.7%) was lower compared with that among black enrollees (difference of 2.7%; 95% CI, 2.2% to 3.2%) and Hispanic enrollees (difference of 1.9%; 95% CI, 1.3% to 2.4%). Concordance rates of non-EMS-transported ED visits were statistically significantly lower than for EMS-transported ED visits; the concordance rate among white enrollees of 52.9% (95% CI, 52.1% to 53.6%) was higher compared with that among black enrollees (difference of -4.8%; 95% CI, -6.4% to -3.3%) and Hispanic enrollees (difference of -3.0%; 95% CI, -4.7% to -1.3%). Conclusions and Relevance: This study found race/ethnicity variation in ED destination for patients using EMS transport, with black and Hispanic patients more likely to be transported to a safety-net hospital ED compared with white patients living in the same zip code.

        "Transcriptional Signature Derived from Murine Tumor-Associated Macrophages Correlates with Poor Outcome in Breast Cancer Patients. Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are frequently the most abundant immune cells in cancers and are associated with poor survival. Here, we generated TAM molecular signatures from K14cre;Cdh1flox/flox;Trp53flox/flox (KEP) and MMTV-NeuT (NeuT) transgenic mice that resemble human invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) and HER2+ tumors, respectively. Determination of TAM-specific signatures requires comparison with healthy mammary tissue macrophages to avoid overestimation of gene expression differences. TAMs from the two models feature a distinct transcriptomic profile, suggesting that the cancer subtype dictates their phenotype. The KEP-derived signature reliably correlates with poor overall survival in ILC but not in triple-negative breast cancer patients, indicating that translation of murine TAM signatures to patients is cancer subtype dependent. Collectively, we show that a transgenic mouse tumor model can yield a TAM signature relevant for human breast cancer outcome prognosis and provide a generalizable strategy for determining and applying immune cell signatures provided the murine model reflects the human disease.

        "PD-L1- and calcitriol-dependent liposomal antigen-specific regulation of systemic inflammatory autoimmune disease. Autoimmune diseases resulting from MHC class II-restricted autoantigen-specific T cell immunity include the systemic inflammatory autoimmune conditions rheumatoid arthritis and vasculitis. While currently treated with broad-acting immunosuppressive drugs, a preferable strategy is to regulate antigen-specific effector T cells (Teffs) to restore tolerance by exploiting DC antigen presentation. We targeted draining lymph node (dLN) phagocytic DCs using liposomes encapsulating 1\u03b1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (calcitriol) and antigenic peptide to elucidate mechanisms of tolerance used by DCs and responding T cells under resting and immunized conditions. PD-L1 expression was upregulated in dLNs of immunized relative to naive mice. Subcutaneous administration of liposomes encapsulating OVA323-339 and calcitriol targeted dLN PD-L1hi DCs of immunized mice and reduced their MHC class II expression. OVA323-339/calcitriol liposomes suppressed expansion, differentiation, and function of Teffs and induced Foxp3+ and IL-10+ peripheral Tregs in an antigen-specific manner, which was dependent on PD-L1. Peptide/calcitriol liposomes modulated CD40 expression by human DCs and promoted Treg induction in vitro. Liposomes encapsulating calcitriol and disease-associated peptides suppressed the severity of rheumatoid arthritis and Goodpasture's vasculitis models with suppression of antigen-specific memory T cell differentiation and function. Accordingly, peptide/calcitriol liposomes leverage DC PD-L1 for antigen-specific T cell regulation and induce antigen-specific tolerance in inflammatory autoimmune diseases. ",
        "Interferon Signaling Is Diminished with Age and Is Associated with Immune Checkpoint Blockade Efficacy in Triple-Negative Breast Cancer. Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy, which targets T cell-inhibitory receptors, has revolutionized cancer treatment. Among the breast cancer subtypes, evaluation of ICB has been of greatest interest in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) due to its immunogenicity, as evidenced by the presence of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and elevated PD-L1 expression relative to other subtypes. TNBC incidence is equally distributed across the age spectrum, affecting 10% to 15% of women in all age groups. Here we report that increased immune dysfunction with age limits ICB efficacy in aged TNBC-bearing mice. The tumor microenvironment in both aged mice and patients with TNBC shows decreased IFN signaling and antigen presentation, suggesting failed innate immune activation with age. Triggering innate immune priming with a STING agonist restored response to ICB in aged mice. Our data implicate age-related immune dysfunction as a mechanism of ICB resistance in mice and suggest potential prognostic utility of assessing IFN-related genes in patients with TNBC receiving ICB therapy. SIGNIFICANCE: These data demonstrate for the first time that age determines the T cell-inflamed phenotype in TNBC and affects response to ICB in mice. Evaluating IFN-related genes from tumor genomic data may aid identification of patients for whom combination therapy including an IFN pathway activator with ICB may be required.This article is highlighted in the In This Issue feature, p. 1143.

        "Association Between Childhood Behavioral Problems and Insomnia Symptoms in Adulthood. Importance: Life-course determinants of insomnia, particularly the long-term association of childhood behavioral problems with insomnia later in life, are unknown. As childhood behaviors are measurable and potentially modifiable, understanding their associations with insomnia symptoms may provide novel insights into early intervention strategies to reduce the burden. Objective: To investigate the association between behavioral problems at 5, 10, and 16 years of age and self-reported insomnia symptoms at 42 years of age. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study used data from the United Kingdom 1970 Birth Cohort Study, an ongoing large-scale follow-up study. Participants were followed up from birth (1970) to age 42 years (2012). Missing data were imputed via multiple imputation. Statistical analysis was performed from February 1 to July 15, 2019. Exposures: Behavior measured at 5, 10, and 16 years of age using the Rutter Behavioral Scale (RBS). Children's behavior was classified as normal (\u226480th percentile), moderate behavioral problems (>80th to \u226495th percentile), and severe behavioral problems (>95th percentile) based on their RBS score. Main Outcomes and Measures: Self-reported difficulties initiating or maintaining sleep (DIMS) were collected using a self-administered questionnaire at 42 years of age. Log-binomial logistic regression, adjusted for several potential confounders, was used to estimate the association of childhood behavioral problems with insomnia symptoms in adulthood. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to check robustness of the findings. Results: Participants were followed up from a baseline age of 5 years (n\u2009=\u20098050; 3854 boys and 4196 girls), 10 years (n\u2009=\u20099090; 4365 boys and 4725 girls), or 16 years (n\u2009=\u20097653; 3575 boys and 4078 girls) until age 42 years. There was a 39% higher risk of DIMS (odds ratio [OR], 1.39; 95% CI, 1.04-1.84; P\u2009=\u2009.06 for trend) for participants with severe behavioral problems at 5 years of age compared with those with a normal RBS score. The odds of DIMS plus not feeling rested on waking (DIMS plus) in participants with severe behavioral problems at 5 years of age were 29% higher (odds ratio, 1.29; 95% CI, 0.97-1.70; P\u2009=\u2009.14 for trend) than participants with a normal RBS score, although this result was not statistically significant. Moderate and severe behavioral problems at 16 years of age were positively associated with DIMS and DIMS plus (moderate: OR, 1.28; 95% CI, 1.07-1.52; severe: OR, 1.67; 95% CI, 1.22-2.30; P\u2009<\u2009.001 for trend) and DIMS plus (moderate: OR, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.11-1.56; severe: OR, 1.47; 95% CI, 1.09-1.98; P\u2009<\u2009.001 for trend). Externalizing behavioral problems at 5 and 10 years of age were positively associated with insomnia symptoms at 42 years of age. Conclusions and Relevance: This study is the first to show associations of early-life behavioral problems, particularly early- and middle-childhood externalizing problems, with insomnia symptoms in adulthood. These findings underline the importance of addressing insomnia from a life-course perspective and considering the benefits of early behavioral intervention to sleep health. ",
        "Antibiotics-Driven Gut Microbiome Perturbation Alters Immunity to Vaccines in Humans. Emerging evidence indicates a central role for the microbiome in immunity. However, causal evidence in humans is sparse. Here, we administered broad-spectrum antibiotics to healthy adults prior and subsequent to seasonal influenza vaccination. Despite a 10,000-fold reduction in gut bacterial load and long-lasting diminution in bacterial diversity, antibody responses were not significantly affected. However, in a second trial of subjects with low pre-existing antibody titers, there was significant impairment in H1N1-specific neutralization and binding IgG1 and IgA responses. In addition, in both studies antibiotics treatment resulted in (1) enhanced inflammatory signatures (including AP-1/NR4A expression), observed previously in the elderly, and increased dendritic cell activation; (2) divergent metabolic trajectories, with a 1,000-fold reduction in serum secondary bile acids, which was highly correlated with AP-1/NR4A signaling and inflammasome activation. Multi-omics integration revealed significant associations between bacterial species and metabolic phenotypes, highlighting a key role for the microbiome in modulating human immunity. ",
        "GABA in the suprachiasmatic nucleus refines circadian output rhythms in mice. In mammals, the circadian rhythms are regulated by the central clock located in the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), which is composed of heterogeneous neurons with various neurotransmitters. Among them an inhibitory neurotransmitter, \u03b3-Amino-Butyric-Acid (GABA), is expressed in almost all SCN neurons, however, its role in the circadian physiology is still unclear. Here, we show that the SCN of fetal mice lacking vesicular GABA transporter (VGAT-/-) or GABA synthesizing enzyme, glutamate decarboxylase (GAD65-/-/67-/-), shows burst firings associated with large Ca2+ spikes throughout 24\u2009hours, which spread over the entire SCN slice in synchrony. By contrast, circadian PER2 rhythms in VGAT-/- and GAD65-/-/67-/- SCN remain intact. SCN-specific VGAT deletion in adult mice dampens circadian behavior rhythm. These findings indicate that GABA in the fetal SCN is necessary for refinement of the circadian firing rhythm and, possibly, for stabilizing the output signals, but not for circadian integration of multiple cellular oscillations.

        "Synergistic effects of ADAMTS13 deficiency and complement activation in pathogenesis of thrombotic microangiopathy. Severe deficiency of plasma ADAMTS13 activity is the primary cause of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) whereas overwhelming activation of complement via an alternative pathway results in atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS), the prototypes of thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA). However, clinical and pathogenic distinctions between TTP and aHUS are often quite challenging. Clinical reports have suggested that complement activation may play a role in the development of TTP, which is caused by severe deficiency of plasma ADAMTS13 activity. However, the experimental evidence to support this hypothesis is still lacking. Here, we show that mice with either Adamts13.                         -/-.                      or a heterozygous mutation of complement factor H (cfh) at amino acid residue of 1206 (ie, cfh.                         W/R.                      ) alone remain asymptomatic despite the presence of occasional microvascular thrombi in various organ tissues. However, mice carrying both Adamts13.                         -/-.                      and cfh.                         W/R.                      exhibit thrombocytopenia, low haptoglobin, increased fragmentation of erythrocytes in peripheral blood smear, increased plasma levels of lactate dehydrogenase activity, blood urea nitrogen, and creatinine, as well as an increased mortality rate, consistent with the development of TMA. Moreover, mice with a homozygous mutation of cfh (ie, cfh.                         R/R.                      ) with or without Adamts13.                         -/-.                      developed severe TMA. The mortality rate in mice with Adamts13.                         -/-.                     cfh.                         R/R.                      was significantly higher than that in mice with cfh.                         R/R.                      alone. Histological and immunohistochemical analyses demonstrated the presence of disseminated platelet-rich thrombi in terminal arterioles and capillaries of major organ tissues in these mice that were either euthanized or died. Together, our results support a synergistic effect of severe ADAMTS13 deficiency and complement activation in pathogenesis of TMA in mice. ",
        "Opioid-Induced Hypogonadism in the United States. Objective: To examine the incidence of screening, diagnosis, and treatment of hypogonadism among men treated with opioids in the United States. Patients and Methods: Using one of the nation's largest commercial insurance databases, we identified 53,888 men aged 20 years or older who had 90 or more days of opioid prescriptions in a single 12-month period between January 1, 2010, and December 31, 2017, with no history of hypogonadism or testosterone therapy in the preceding 12 months. We matched this cohort to 53,888 men with 14 or fewer days of opioid prescriptions based on age, opioid initiation date, opioid indication, and comparable exclusion criteria. We assessed whether men, 14 or fewer days after initiation of opioid treatment, received a serum testosterone test, a diagnosis of hypogonadism, or a prescription for testosterone therapy. All men were followed up until they lost coverage from the commercial insurance plan, experienced one of the study outcomes, or the end of study (December 31, 2017). Results: In the multivariable analyses-adjusting for age, year of opioid initiation, region, comorbid disease, glucocorticoid use, and health care utilization-the 53,888 prolonged opioid users, in comparison with 53,888 short-term users, had an increased incidence of serum testosterone screening (5991 [17.15%; 95% CI, 16.70%-17.61%] vs 3514 [11.55%; 95% CI, 11.11%-12.01%] at 5 years; hazard ratio [HR], 1.46; 95% CI, 1.38-1.55), hypogonadism diagnosis (3125 [9.44%; 95% CI, 9.09%-9.80%] vs 1421 [4.85%; 95%\u00a0CI, 4.55%-5.16%; HR, 1.74; 95% CI, 1.60-1.90]), and receipt of testosterone therapy (1919 [5.76%; 95% CI, 5.49%-6.05%] vs 631 [2.21%; 95% CI, 2.04%-2.43%; HR, 2.41; 95% CI, 2.13-2.74]). Each of these findings persisted across multiple sensitivity analyses. Conclusion: Prolonged opioid exposure was associated with increased rates of screening, diagnosis, and treatment for opioid-induced hypogonadism, but these rates were much lower than expected based on previous serum-based studies.

        "Serum miR-204 is an early biomarker of type 1 diabetes-associated pancreatic beta-cell loss. Pancreatic beta-cell death is a major factor in the pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes (T1D), but straightforward methods to measure beta-cell loss in humans are lacking, underlining the need for novel biomarkers. Using studies in INS-1 cells, human islets, diabetic mice, and serum samples of subjects with T1D at different stages, we have identified serum miR-204 as an early biomarker of T1D-associated beta-cell loss in humans. MiR-204 is a highly enriched microRNA in human beta-cells, and we found that it is released from dying beta-cells and detectable in human serum. We further discovered that serum miR-204 was elevated in children and adults with T1D and in autoantibody-positive at-risk subjects but not in type 2 diabetes or other autoimmune diseases and was inversely correlated with remaining beta-cell function in recent-onset T1D. Thus, serum miR-204 may provide a much needed novel approach to assess early T1D-associated human beta-cell loss even before onset of overt disease. ",
        "Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome Is Associated With Elevated G-Protein Coupled Receptor Autoantibodies. Background The etiology of postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) is yet to be established. The disorder is often misdiagnosed as chronic anxiety or a panic disorder because the autonomic failure in these patients is not severe. A growing body of evidence suggests that POTS may be an autoimmune disorder. Antinuclear antibodies and elevations of ganglionic, adrenergic, and muscarinic acetylcholine receptor antibodies have all been reported. Methods and Results We collected detailed clinical symptoms of 55 patients diagnosed with POTS. We also evaluated serum levels of autoantibodies against 4 subtypes of G-protein coupled adrenergic receptors and 5 subtypes of G-protein coupled muscarinic acetylcholine receptors by ELISA. Our patients had a multitude of comorbidities, were predominantly young females, and reported viral-like symptoms preceding episodes of syncope. We detected a significant number of patients with elevated levels of autoantibodies against the adrenergic alpha 1 receptor (89%) and against the muscarinic acetylcholine M4 receptor (53%). Surprisingly, elevations of muscarinic receptor autoantibodies appeared to be dependent upon elevation of autoantibodies against the A1 adrenergic receptor! Four patients had elevations of G-protein coupled autoantibodies against all 9 receptor subtypes measured in our study. Five POTS patients had no elevation of any autoantibody; similarly, controls were also negative for autoantibody elevations. There was a weak correlation of clinical symptom severity with G-protein coupled autoantibodies. Conclusions Our observations provide further evidence that, in most cases, POTS patients have at least 1 elevated G-protein coupled adrenergic autoantibody and, in some instances, both adrenergic and muscarinic autoantibodies, supporting the hypothesis that POTS may be an autoimmune disorder.

        "Microglial UCP2 Mediates Inflammation and Obesity Induced by High-Fat Feeding. Microglia play a crucial role in immune responses, including inflammation. Diet-induced obesity (DIO) triggers microglia activation and hypothalamic inflammation as early as 3\u00a0days after high-fat diet (HFD) exposure, before changes in body weight occur. The intracellular mechanism(s) responsible for HFD-induced microglia activation is ill defined. Here, we show that in\u00a0vivo, HFD induced a rapid and transient increase in uncoupling protein 2 (Ucp2) mRNA expression together with changes in mitochondrial dynamics. Selective microglial deletion of Ucp2 prevented changes in mitochondrial dynamics and function, microglia activation, and hypothalamic inflammation. In association with these, male and female mice were protected from HFD-induced obesity, showing decreased feeding and increased energy expenditure that were associated with changes in the synaptic input organization and activation of the anorexigenic hypothalamic POMC neurons and astrogliosis. Together, our data point to a fuel-availability-driven mitochondrial mechanism as a major player of microglia activation in the central regulation of DIO. ",
        "Quantitative nuclear histomorphometric features are predictive of Oncotype DX risk categories in ductal carcinoma in situ: preliminary findings. BACKGROUND: Oncotype DX (ODx) is a 12-gene assay assessing the recurrence risk (high, intermediate, and low) of ductal carcinoma in situ (pre-invasive breast cancer), which guides clinicians regarding prescription of radiotherapy. However, ODx is expensive, time-consuming, and tissue-destructive. In addition, the actual prognostic meaning for the intermediate ODx risk category remains unclear. METHODS: In this work, we evaluated the ability of quantitative nuclear histomorphometric features extracted from hematoxylin and eosin-stained slide images of 62 ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) patients to distinguish between the corresponding ODx risk categories. The prognostic value of the identified image signature was further evaluated on an independent validation set of 30 DCIS patients in its ability to distinguish those DCIS patients who progressed to invasive carcinoma versus those who did not. Following nuclear segmentation and feature extraction, feature ranking strategies were employed to identify the most discriminating features between individual ODx risk categories. The selected features were then combined with machine learning classifiers to establish models to predict ODx risk categories. The model performance was evaluated using the average area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) using cross validation. In addition, an unsupervised clustering approach was also implemented to evaluate the ability of nuclear histomorphometric features to discriminate between the ODx risk categories. RESULTS: Features relating to spatial distribution, orientation disorder, and texture of nuclei were identified as most discriminating between the high ODx and the intermediate, low ODx risk categories. Additionally, the AUC of the most discriminating set of features for the different classification tasks was as follows: (1) high vs low ODx (0.68), (2) high vs. intermediate ODx (0.67), (3) intermediate vs. low ODx (0.57), (4) high and intermediate vs. low ODx (0.63), (5) high vs. low and intermediate ODx (0.66). Additionally, the unsupervised clustering resulted in intermediate ODx risk category patients being co-clustered with low ODx patients compared to high ODx. CONCLUSION: Our results appear to suggest that nuclear histomorphometric features can distinguish high from low and intermediate ODx risk category patients. Additionally, our findings suggest that histomorphometric features for intermediate ODx were more similar to low ODx compared to high ODx risk category. ",
        "Routing information flow by separate neural synchrony frequencies allows for \"functionally labeled lines\" in higher primate cortex. Efficient transfer of sensory information to higher (motor or associative) areas in primate visual cortical areas is crucial for transforming sensory input into behavioral actions. Dynamically increasing the level of coordination between single neurons has been suggested as an important contributor to this efficiency. We propose that differences between the functional coordination in different visual pathways might be used to unambiguously identify the source of input to the higher areas, ensuring a proper routing of the information flow. Here we determined the level of coordination between neurons in area MT in macaque visual cortex in a visual attention task via the strength of synchronization between the neurons' spike timing relative to the phase of oscillatory activities in local field potentials. In contrast to reports on the ventral visual pathway, we observed the synchrony of spikes only in the range of high gamma (180 to 220 Hz), rather than gamma (40 to 70 Hz) (as reported previously) to predict the animal's reaction speed. This supports a mechanistic role of the phase of high-gamma oscillatory activity in dynamically modulating the efficiency of neuronal information transfer. In addition, for inputs to higher cortical areas converging from the dorsal and ventral pathway, the distinct frequency bands of these inputs can be leveraged to preserve the identity of the input source. In this way source-specific oscillatory activity in primate cortex can serve to establish and maintain \"functionally labeled lines\" for dynamically adjusting cortical information transfer and multiplexing converging sensory signals.

        "Long-Lasting Rescue of Network and Cognitive Dysfunction in a Genetic Schizophrenia Model. Although sensitizing processes occur earlier, schizophrenia is diagnosed in young adulthood, which suggests that it might involve a pathological transition during late brain development in predisposed individuals. Parvalbumin (PV) interneuron alterations have been noticed, but their role in the disease is unclear. Here we demonstrate that adult LgDel+/- mice, a genetic model of schizophrenia, exhibit PV neuron hypo-recruitment and associated chronic PV neuron plasticity together with network and cognitive deficits. All these deficits can be permanently rescued by chemogenetic activation of PV neurons or D2R antagonist treatments, specifically in the ventral hippocampus (vH) or medial-prefrontal cortex during a late-adolescence-sensitive time window. PV neuron alterations were initially restricted to the hippocampal CA1/subiculum, where they became responsive to treatment in late adolescence. Therefore, progression to disease in schizophrenia-model mice can be prevented by treatments supporting vH-mPFC PV network function during a sensitive time window late in adolescence, suggesting therapeutic strategies to prevent the outbreak of schizophrenia.

        "Phase variation in Mycobacterium tuberculosis glpK produces transiently heritable drug tolerance. The length and complexity of tuberculosis (TB) therapy, as well as the propensity of Mycobacterium tuberculosis to develop drug resistance, are major barriers to global TB control efforts. M. tuberculosis is known to have the ability to enter into a drug-tolerant state, which may explain many of these impediments to TB treatment. We have identified a mechanism of genetically encoded but rapidly reversible drug tolerance in M. tuberculosis caused by transient frameshift mutations in a homopolymeric tract (HT) of 7 cytosines (7C) in the glpK gene. Inactivating frameshift mutations associated with the 7C HT in glpK produce small colonies that exhibit heritable multidrug increases in minimal inhibitory concentrations and decreases in drug-dependent killing; however, reversion back to a fully drug-susceptible large-colony phenotype occurs rapidly through the introduction of additional insertions or deletions in the same glpK HT region. These reversible frameshift mutations in the 7C HT of M. tuberculosis glpK occur in clinical isolates, accumulate in M. tuberculosis-infected mice with further accumulation during drug treatment, and exhibit a reversible transcriptional profile including induction of dosR and sigH and repression of kstR regulons, similar to that observed in other in vitro models of M. tuberculosis tolerance. These results suggest that GlpK phase variation may contribute to drug tolerance, treatment failure, and relapse in human TB. Drugs effective against phase-variant M. tuberculosis may hasten TB treatment and improve cure rates. ",
        "A Protracted Sensitive Period Regulates the Development of Cross-Modal Sound-Shape Associations in Humans. Humans preferentially match arbitrary words containing higher- and lower-frequency phonemes to angular and smooth shapes, respectively. Here, we investigated the role of visual experience in the development of audiovisual and audiohaptic sound-shape associations (SSAs) using a unique set of five groups: individuals who had suffered a transient period of congenital blindness through congenital bilateral dense cataracts before undergoing cataract-reversal surgeries (CC group), individuals with a history of developmental cataracts (DC group), individuals with congenital permanent blindness (CB group), individuals with late permanent blindness (LB group), and controls with typical sight (TS group). Whereas the TS and LB groups showed highly robust SSAs, the CB, CC, and DC groups did not-in any of the modality combinations tested. These results provide evidence for a protracted sensitive period during which aberrant vision prevents SSA acquisition. Moreover, the finding of a systematic SSA in the LB group demonstrates that representations acquired during the sensitive period are resilient to loss despite dramatically changed experience. ",
        "Progression of Meiosis Is Coordinated by the Level and Location of MAPK Activation Via OGR-2 in Caenorhabditis elegans. During meiosis, a series of evolutionarily conserved events allow for reductional chromosome division, which is required for sexual reproduction. Although individual meiotic processes have been extensively studied, we currently know far less about how meiosis is regulated and coordinated. In the Caenorhabditis elegans gonad, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling drives oogenesis while undergoing spatial activation and deactivation waves. However, it is currently unclear how MAPK activation is governed and how it facilitates the progression of oogenesis. Here, we show that the oocyte and germline-related 2 (ogr-2) gene affects proper progression of oogenesis. Complete deletion of ogr-2 results in delayed meiotic entry and late spatial onset of double-strand break repair. Elevated levels of apoptosis are observed in this mutant, independent of the meiotic canonical checkpoints; however, they are dependent on the MAPK terminal member MPK-1/ERK. MPK-1 activation is elevated in diplotene in ogr-2 mutants and its aberrant spatial activation correlates with stages where meiotic progression defects are evident. Deletion of ogr-2 significantly reduces the expression of lip-1, a phosphatase reported to repress MPK-1, which is consistent with OGR-2 localization at chromatin in germ cells. We suggest that OGR-2 modulates the expression of lip-1 to promote the timely progression of meiosis through MPK-1 spatial deactivation. ",

Diet-induced obesity (DIO) triggers microglia activation and hypothalamic inflammation as early as 3\u00a0days after high-fat diet (HFD) exposure, before changes in body weight occur. The intracellular mechanism(s) responsible for HFD-induced microglia activation is ill defined. Here, we show that in\u00a0vivo, HFD induced a rapid and transient increase in uncoupling protein 2 (Ucp2) mRNA expression together with changes in mitochondrial dynamics. Selective microglial deletion of Ucp2 prevented changes in mitochondrial dynamics and function, microglia activation, and hypothalamic inflammation. In association with these, male and female mice were protected from HFD-induced obesity, showing decreased feeding and increased energy expenditure that were associated with changes in the synaptic input organization and activation of the anorexigenic hypothalamic POMC neurons and astrogliosis. Together, our data point to a fuel-availability-driven mitochondrial mechanism as a major player of microglia activation in the central regulation of DIO. ",
        "Intestinal microbiota and colorectal cancer: changes in the intestinal microenvironment and their relation to the disease. Tools that predict the risk of colorectal cancer are important for early diagnosis, given the high mortality rate for this cancer. The composition of the intestinal microbiota is now considered to be a risk factor for the development of colorectal cancer. This discovery has motivated a growing number of studies to identify the micro-organisms responsible for the onset and/or progression of colorectal cancer. With this in mind, this review discusses the relationship between the composition of the intestinal microbiota and colorectal cancer risk. Prospective and case-control studies indicate that the intestinal microbiota of individuals with colorectal cancer usually contains a greater proportion of bacteria responsible for gastrointestinal tract inflammatory diseases, as well as bacteria that produce toxins and carcinogenic metabolites. In contrast, there tends to be a reduced presence of butyric acid-producing bacteria, probiotic bacteria and potentially probiotic bacteria. Despite these differences, the onset and development of colorectal cancer cannot be attributed to a specific micro-organism. Thus, studies focused on the formation of the intestinal microbiota and factors that modulate its composition are important for the development of approaches for colorectal cancer prevention. ",
        "Reductions in methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus,C. difficile infection and intensive care unit acquired bloodstream infection across the United Kingdom following implementation of a national infection control campaign. BACKGROUND: Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and C. difficile infection have reduced across the UK National Health Service in the decade following implementation of an infection control campaign. The national impact on hospital-acquired infections due to other organisms has not been documented. METHODS: Data on MRSA, C. difficile, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) and ICU-acquired bloodstream infection (UABSIs) were analysed from 1,189,142 patients from 2007 to 2016. Initial coverage was 139 ICUs increasing to 276 ICUs representing 100% of general, adult UK ICUs. RESULTS: ICU MRSA & C. difficile admissions & acquisitions per 1000 patients decreased between 2007 and 2012 (MRSA admissions 38.8 to 13.1; acquisitions 25.4 to 4.1;C. difficile admissions 10.6 to 4.2; acquisitions 11.1 to 3.5), whereas VRE admissions and acquisitions increased from 1.9 to 5.3 and 1.5 to 5.9, respectively. There were 13,114 UABSIs in 1.8% patients staying >48 hours. UABSIs fell from 7.3 (95% CI 6.9-7.6) to 1.6 (95% CI 1.5-1.7)/1000 bed days between 2007 and 2012. Adjusting for patient factors the IRR was 0.21 (95% CI 0.19-0.23, p<0.001) from 2007 to 2016. Reductions in UABSIs were seen for all main organisms excluding VRE with greatest reductions for MRSA (97%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (80%), S. aureus (77%) and Candida spp (71%) but lower reductions for E. coli (54%) and Klebsiella (42%). CONCLUSION: Large decreases in ICU-acquired infections occurred across the UK ICU network between 2007 and 2012 linked with the first few years of the national infection control campaign, but rates have been static since. Further reductions will likely require a new intervention framework. ",
        "Diabetes and Diabetes Care among Nonobese Japanese-Americans: Findings from a Population-Based Study. Objectives: The objectives of this study are as follows: (1) to determine the prevalence of diabetes among nonobese Japanese-Americans and to determine the adjusted odds of diabetes among nonobese Japanese-Americans compared to non-Hispanic Whites (NHWs); (2) to identify the risk factors associated with having diabetes in a large sample of nonobese Japanese-Americans; and (3) to determine the prevalence and adjusted odds of diabetes management behaviors among nonobese Japanese-Americans with diabetes in comparison to NHWs with diabetes. Methods: The combined 2007-2016 waves of the adult California Health Interview Survey (CHIS) were used to analyze a nonobese (BMI<30) sample of 2,295 Japanese-Americans and 119,651 NHWs. Chi-square and logistic regression analyses were performed using Stata. Results: The findings of this representative community study of nonobese Californians indicate that the prevalence of diabetes among Japanese-American respondents was higher than their NHW counterparts (8.0% versus 4.5%). Prevalence increased markedly with age; one-quarter of nonobese Japanese Americans aged 80 and older had diabetes. Conclusions: The prevalence of diabetes among nonobese Japanese-Americans is significantly higher than that among NHWs. There is an urgent need to develop appropriate intervention and prevention approaches with lifestyle modification specifically targeted towards nonobese Japanese-Americans. ",
        "Liquid versus tissue biopsy for detecting acquired resistance and tumor heterogeneity in gastrointestinal cancers. During cancer therapy, tumor heterogeneity can drive the evolution of multiple tumor subclones harboring unique resistance mechanisms in an individual patient1-3. Previous case reports and small case series have suggested that liquid biopsy (specifically, cell-free DNA (cfDNA)) may better capture the heterogeneity of acquired resistance4-8. However, the effectiveness of cfDNA versus standard single-lesion tumor biopsies has not been directly compared in larger-scale prospective cohorts of patients following progression on targeted therapy. Here, in a prospective cohort of 42 patients with molecularly defined gastrointestinal cancers and acquired resistance to targeted therapy, direct comparison of postprogression cfDNA versus tumor biopsy revealed that cfDNA more frequently identified clinically relevant resistance alterations and multiple resistance mechanisms, detecting resistance alterations not found in the matched tumor biopsy in 78% of cases. Whole-exome sequencing of serial cfDNA, tumor biopsies and rapid autopsy specimens elucidated substantial geographic and evolutionary differences across lesions. Our data suggest that acquired resistance is frequently characterized by profound tumor heterogeneity, and that the emergence of multiple resistance alterations in an individual patient may represent the 'rule' rather than the 'exception'. These findings have profound therapeutic implications and highlight the potential advantages of cfDNA over tissue biopsy in the setting of acquired resistance. ",
        "HDAC9 is implicated in atherosclerotic aortic calcification and affects vascular smooth muscle cell phenotype. Aortic calcification is an important independent predictor of future cardiovascular events. We performed a genome-wide association meta-analysis to determine SNPs associated with the extent of abdominal aortic calcification (n\u2009=\u20099,417) or descending thoracic aortic calcification (n\u2009=\u20098,422). Two genetic loci, HDAC9 and RAP1GAP, were associated with abdominal aortic calcification at a genome-wide level (P\u2009<\u20095.0\u2009\u00d7\u200910-8). No SNPs were associated with thoracic aortic calcification at the genome-wide threshold. Increased expression of HDAC9 in human aortic smooth muscle cells promoted calcification and reduced contractility, while inhibition of HDAC9 in human aortic smooth muscle cells inhibited calcification and enhanced cell contractility. In matrix Gla protein-deficient mice, a model of human vascular calcification, mice lacking HDAC9 had a 40% reduction in aortic calcification and improved survival. This translational genomic study identifies the first genetic risk locus associated with calcification of the abdominal aorta and describes a previously unknown role for HDAC9 in the development of vascular calcification.

        "The efficacy and safety of nutrient supplements in the treatment of mental disorders: a meta-review of meta-analyses of randomized\u00a0controlled trials. The role of nutrition in mental health is becoming increasingly acknowledged. Along with dietary intake, nutrition can also be obtained from\u00a0\"nutrient supplements\", such as polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, amino acids and pre/probiotic supplements. Recently, a large number of meta-analyses have emerged examining nutrient supplements in the treatment of mental disorders. To produce a meta-review of this top-tier evidence, we identified, synthesized and appraised all meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) reporting on the efficacy and safety of nutrient supplements in common and severe mental disorders. Our systematic search identified 33 meta-analyses of placebo-controlled RCTs, with primary analyses including outcome data from 10,951 individuals. The strongest evidence was found for PUFAs (particularly as eicosapentaenoic acid) as an adjunctive treatment for depression. More nascent evidence suggested that PUFAs may also be beneficial for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, whereas there was no evidence for schizophrenia. Folate-based supplements were widely researched as adjunctive treatments for depression and schizophrenia, with positive effects from RCTs of high-dose methylfolate in major depressive disorder. There was emergent evidence for N-acetylcysteine as a useful adjunctive treatment in mood disorders and schizophrenia. All nutrient supplements had good safety profiles, with no evidence of serious adverse effects or contraindications with psychiatric medications. In conclusion, clinicians should be informed of the nutrient supplements with established efficacy for certain conditions (such as eicosapentaenoic acid in depression), but also made aware of those currently lacking evidentiary support. Future research should aim to determine which individuals may benefit most from evidence-based supplements, to further elucidate the underlying mechanisms. ",
        "Coxsackievirus B Persistence Modifies the Proteome and the Secretome of Pancreatic Ductal Cells. The group B Coxsackieviruses (CVB), belonging to the Enterovirus genus, can establish persistent infections in human cells. These persistent infections have been linked to chronic diseases including type\u00a01 diabetes. Still, the outcomes of persistent CVB infections in human pancreas are largely unknown. We established persistent CVB infections in a human pancreatic ductal-like cell line PANC-1 using two distinct CVB1 strains and profiled infection-induced changes in cellular protein expression and secretion using mass spectrometry-based proteomics. Persistent infections, showing characteristics of carrier-state persistence, were associated with a broad spectrum of changes, including changes in mitochondrial network morphology and energy metabolism and in the regulated secretory pathway. Interestingly, the expression of antiviral immune response proteins, and also several other proteins, differed clearly between the two persistent infections. Our results provide extensive information about the protein-level changes induced by persistent CVB infection and the potential virus-associated variability in the outcomes of these infections. ",
        "Barcoded DNA nanostructures for the multiplexed profiling of subcellular protein distribution. Massively parallel DNA sequencing is established, yet high-throughput protein profiling remains challenging. Here, we report a barcoding approach that leverages the combinatorial sequence content and the configurational programmability of DNA nanostructures for high-throughput multiplexed profiling of the subcellular expression and distribution of proteins in whole cells. The barcodes are formed by in situ hybridization of tetrahedral DNA nanostructures and short DNA sequences conjugated with protein-targeting antibodies, and by nanostructure-assisted ligation (either enzymatic or chemical) of the nanostructures and exogenous DNA sequences bound to nanoparticles of different sizes (which cause these localization sequences to differentially distribute across subcellular compartments). Compared with linear DNA barcoding, the nanostructured barcodes enhance the signal by more than 100-fold. By implementing the barcoding approach on a microfluidic device for the analysis of rare patient samples, we show that molecular subtypes of breast cancer can be accurately classified and that subcellular spatial markers of disease aggressiveness can be identified.

        "Incidence of mild cognitive impairment in World Trade Center responders: Long-term consequences of re-experiencing the events on 9/11/2001. Objective: This study examined whether World Trade Center (WTC) exposures and chronic posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) were associated with incidence of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in a longitudinal analysis of a prospective cohort study of WTC responders. Methods: Incidence of MCI was assessed in a clinical sample of WTC responders (N\u00a0=\u00a01800) who were cognitively intact at baseline assessment. Crude incidence rates were calculated and compared to population estimates using standardized incidence ratios. Multivariable analyses used Cox proportional-hazards regression. Results: Responders were 53.1\u00a0years old (SD\u00a0=\u00a07.9) at baseline. Among eligible cognitively intact responders, 255 (14.2%) developed MCI at follow-up. Incidence of MCI was higher than expected based on expectations from prior published research. Incidence was higher among those with increased PTSD symptom severity, and prolonged exposure was a risk factor in apolipoprotein-\u03b54 carriers. Conclusions: PTSD and prolonged WTC exposures were associated with increased incidence of MCI in WTC responders, results that may portend future high rates of dementia in WTC-exposed responders. ",
        "Primary care physicians' perceptions of barriers and facilitators to management of chronic kidney disease: A mixed methods study. BACKGROUND: Given the high prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD), primary care physicians (PCPs) frequently manage early stage CKD. Nonetheless, there are challenges in providing optimal CKD care in the primary care setting. This study sought to understand PCPs' perceptions of barriers and facilitators to the optimal management of CKD. STUDY DESIGN: Mixed methods study. SETTINGS AND PARTICIPANTS: Community-based PCPs in four US cities: Baltimore, MD; St. Louis, MO; Raleigh, NC and San Francisco, CA. METHODOLOGY: We used a self-administered questionnaire and conducted 4 focus groups of PCPs (n = 8 PCPs/focus group) in each city to identify key barriers and facilitators to management of patients with CKD in primary care. ANALYTIC APPROACH: We conducted descriptive analyses of the survey data. Major themes were identified from audio-recorded interviews that were transcribed and coded by the research team. RESULTS: Of 32 participating PCPs, 31 (97%) had been in practice for >10 years, and 29 (91%) practiced in a non-academic setting. PCPs identified multiple barriers to managing CKD in primary care including at the level of the patient (e.g., low awareness of CKD, poor adherence to treatment recommendations), the provider (e.g., staying current with CKD guidelines), and the health care system (e.g., inflexible electronic medical record, limited time and resources). PCPs desired electronic prompts and lab decision support, concise guidelines, and healthcare financing reform to improve CKD care. CONCLUSIONS: PCPs face substantial but modifiable barriers in providing care to patients with CKD. Interventions that address these barriers and promote facilitative tools may improve PCPs' effectiveness and capacity to care for patients with CKD. ",
        "IFITM3 protects the heart during influenza virus infection. Influenza virus can disseminate from the lungs to the heart in severe infections and can induce cardiac pathology, but this has been difficult to study due to a lack of small animal models. In humans, polymorphisms in the gene encoding the antiviral restriction factor IFN-induced transmembrane protein 3 (IFITM3) are associated with susceptibility to severe influenza, but whether IFITM3 deficiencies contribute to cardiac dysfunction during infection is unclear. We show that IFITM3 deficiency in a new knockout (KO) mouse model increases weight loss and mortality following influenza virus infections. We investigated this enhanced pathogenesis with the A/PR/8/34 (H1N1) (PR8) influenza virus strain, which is lethal in KO mice even at low doses, and observed increased replication of virus in the lungs, spleens, and hearts of KO mice compared with wild-type (WT) mice. Infected IFITM3 KO mice developed aberrant cardiac electrical activity, including decreased heart rate and irregular, arrhythmic RR (interbeat) intervals, whereas WT mice exhibited a mild decrease in heart rate without irregular RR intervals. Cardiac electrical dysfunction in PR8-infected KO mice was accompanied by increased activation of fibrotic pathways and fibrotic lesions in the heart. Infection with a sublethal dose of a less virulent influenza virus strain (A/WSN/33 [H1N1]) resulted in a milder cardiac electrical dysfunction in KO mice that subsided as the mice recovered. Our findings reveal an essential role for IFITM3 in limiting influenza virus replication and pathogenesis in heart tissue and establish IFITM3 KO mice as a powerful model for studying mild and severe influenza virus-induced cardiac dysfunction.

        "Noninvasive Detection of Clinically Significant Prostate Cancer Using Circulating Tumor Cells. PURPOSE: Prostate specific antigen testing results in unnecessary biopsy and over diagnosis with consequent overtreatment. Tissue biopsy is an invasive procedure associated with significant morbidity. More accurate noninvasive or minimally invasive diagnostic approaches should be developed to avoid unnecessary prostate biopsy and over diagnosis. We investigated the potential of using circulating tumor cell analysis in cancer diagnosis, particularly to predict clinically significant prostate cancer in prebiopsy cases. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We enrolled 155 treatment na\u00efve patients with prostate cancer and 98 before biopsy for circulating tumor cell enumeration. RNA was extracted from circulating tumor cells of 184 patients for gene expression analysis. The Kruskal-Wallis and Spearman rank tests, multivariate logistic regression and the random forest method were applied to assess the association of circulating tumor cells with aggressive prostate cancer. RESULTS: Of patients with localized prostate cancer 54% were scored as having positive circulating tumor cells, which was associated with a higher Gleason score (p=0.0003), risk group (p <0.0001) and clinically significant prostate cancer (p <0.0001). In the prebiopsy group a positive circulating tumor cell score combined with prostate specific antigen predicted clinically significant prostate cancer (AUC 0.869). A 12-gene panel prognostic for clinically significant prostate cancer was also identified. When combining the prostate specific antigen level, the circulating tumor cell score and the 12-gene panel, the AUC of clinically significant prostate cancer prediction was 0.927. Adding those data to cases with available multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging data significantly increased prediction accuracy (AUC 0.936 vs 0.629). CONCLUSIONS: Circulating tumor cell analysis has the potential to significantly improve patient stratification by prostate specific antigen and/or multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging for biopsy and treatment.

        "Contextual Factors Associated With County-Level Suicide Rates in the United States, 1999 to 2016. Importance: Understanding geographic and community-level factors associated with suicide can inform targeted suicide prevention efforts. Objectives: To estimate suicide rates and trajectories, assess associated county-level contextual factors, and explore variation across the rural-urban continuum. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cross-sectional study included all individuals aged 25 to 64 years who died by suicide from January 1, 1999, to December 31, 2016, in the United States. Spatial analysis was used to map excess risk of suicide, and longitudinal random-effects models using negative binomial regression tested associations of contextual variables with suicide rates as well as interactions among county-level contextual variables. Data analyses were conducted between January 2019 and July 2019. Exposure: County of residence. Main Outcomes and Measures: Three-year county suicide rates during an 18-year period stratified by rural-urban location. Results: Between 1999 and 2016, 453\u202f577 individuals aged 25 to 64 years died by suicide in the United States. Decedents were primarily male (349\u202f082 [77.0%]) with 101\u202f312 (22.3%) aged 25 to 34 years, 120\u202f157 (26.5%) aged 35 to 44 years, 136\u202f377 (30.1%) aged 45 to 54 years, and 95\u202f771 (21.1%) aged 55 to 64 years. Suicide rates were higher and increased more rapidly in rural than in large metropolitan counties. The highest deprivation quartile was associated with higher suicide rates compared with the lowest deprivation quartile, especially in rural areas, although this association declined during the period studied (rural, 1999-2001: incidence rate ratio [IRR], 1.438; 95% CI, 1.319-1.568; P\u2009<\u2009.001; large metropolitan, 1999-2001: 1.208; 95% CI, 1.149-1.270; P\u2009<\u2009.001; rural, 2014-2016: IRR, 1.121; 95% CI, 1.032-1.219; P\u2009=\u2009.01; large metropolitan, 2014-2016: IRR, 0.942; 95% CI, 0.887-1.001; P\u2009=\u2009.06). The presence of more gun shops was associated with an increase in county-level suicide rates in all county types except the most rural (rural: IRR, 1.001; 95% CI, 0.999-1.004; P\u2009=\u2009.40; micropolitan: IRR, 1.005; 95% CI, 1.002-1.007; P\u2009<\u2009.001; small metropolitan: IRR, 1.010; 95% CI, 1.006-1.014; P\u2009<\u2009.001; large metropolitan: IRR, 1.012; 95% CI, 1.006-1.018; P\u2009<\u2009.001). High social capital was associated with lower suicide rates than low social capital (IRR, 0.917; 95% CI, 0.891-0.943; P\u2009<\u2009.001). High social fragmentation, an increasing percentage of the population without health insurance, and an increasing percentage of veterans in a county were associated with higher suicide rates (high social fragmentation: IRR, 1.077; 95% CI, 1.050-1.103; P\u2009<\u2009.001; percentage of population without health insurance: IRR, 1.005; 95% CI, 1.004-1.006; P\u2009<\u2009.001; percentage of veterans: IRR, 1.025; 95% CI, 1.021-1.028; P\u2009<\u2009.001). Conclusions and Relevance: This study found that suicide rates have increased across the nation and most rapidly in rural counties, which may be more sensitive to the impact of social deprivation than more metropolitan counties. Improving social connectedness, civic opportunities, and health insurance coverage as well as limiting access to lethal means have the potential to reduce suicide rates across the rural-urban continuum.

        "The flight response impairs cytoprotective mechanisms by activating the insulin pathway. An animal's stress response requires different adaptive strategies depending on the nature and duration of the stressor. Whereas acute stressors, such as predation, induce a rapid and energy-demanding fight-or-flight response, long-term environmental stressors induce the gradual and long-lasting activation of highly conserved cytoprotective processes1-3. In animals across the evolutionary spectrum, continued activation of the fight-or-flight response weakens the animal's resistance to environmental challenges4,5. However, the molecular and cellular mechanisms that regulate the trade-off between the flight response and long-term stressors are poorly understood. Here we show that repeated induction of the flight response in Caenorhabditis elegans shortens lifespan and inhibits conserved cytoprotective mechanisms. The flight response activates neurons that release tyramine, an invertebrate analogue of adrenaline and noradrenaline. Tyramine stimulates the insulin-IGF-1 signalling (IIS) pathway and precludes the induction of stress response genes by activating an adrenergic-like receptor in the intestine. By contrast, long-term environmental stressors, such as heat or oxidative stress, reduce tyramine release and thereby allow the induction of cytoprotective genes. These findings demonstrate that a neural stress hormone supplies a state-dependent neural switch between acute flight and long-term environmental stress responses and provides mechanistic insights into how the flight response impairs cellular defence systems and accelerates ageing.

        "An intergenerational investigation of the associations between parental marijuana use trajectories and child functioning. Diverse patterns of life-course marijuana use may have differential health impacts for the children of users. Data are drawn from an intergenerational study of 426 families that included a parent, their oldest biological child, and (where appropriate) another caregiver who were interviewed 10 times from 2002 to 2018; the current study used data from 380 families in waves 6-10. Analyses linked parent marijuana use trajectories estimated in a previous publication (Epstein et al., 2015) to child marijuana, alcohol, and nicotine use; promarijuana norms; internalizing; externalizing; attention problems; and grades using multilevel modeling among children ages 6 to 21. Four trajectories had been found in the previous study: nonuser, chronic, adolescent-limited, and late-onset. Results indicate that children of parents in the groups that initiated marijuana use in adolescence (chronic and adolescent-limited) were most likely to use substances. Children of parents in the late-onset group, where parents initiated use in young adulthood, were not at increased risk for substance use but were more likely to have attention problems and lower grades. Results held when parent current marijuana use was added to the models. Implications of this work highlight the importance of considering both current use and use history in intergenerational transmission of marijuana use, and the need to address parent use history in family based prevention. Prevention of adolescent marijuana use remains a priority. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved). ",
        "The effect of minority status and social context on the development of depression and anxiety: a longitudinal study of Puerto Rican descent youth. Few longitudinal studies have explored to date whether minority status in disadvantaged neighborhoods conveys risk for negative mental health outcomes, and the mechanisms possibly leading to such risk. We investigated how minority status influences four developmental mental health outcomes in an ethnically homogeneous sample of Puerto Rican youth. We tested models of risk for major depressive disorder (MDD) and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), depressive and anxiety symptoms (DAS), and psychological distress, as Puerto Rican youth (aged 5-13 years) transitioned to early adulthood (15-29 years) in two sites, one where they grew up as a majority (the island of Puerto Rico), and another where they were part of a minority group (South Bronx, New York). At baseline, a stratified sample of 2,491 Puerto Rican youth participated from the two sites. After baseline assessment (Wave 1), each youth participant and one caregiver were assessed annually for two years, for a total of three time points (Waves 1-3). From April 2013 to August 2017, participants were contacted for a Wave 4 interview, and a total of 2,004 young people aged 15 to 29 years participated in the assessment (response rate adjusted for eligibility = 82.8%). Using a quasi-experimental design, we assessed impacts of minority status on MDD, GAD, DAS and psychological distress. Via mediation analyses, we explored potential mechanisms underlying the observed relationships. Data from 1,863 Puerto Rican youth (after exclusion of those with MDD or GAD during Waves 1-3) indicated links between minority status and higher rates of lifetime and past-year GAD, DAS and past 30-day psychological distress at Wave 4, and a marginal trend for MDD, even after adjustments. Childhood social support and peer relationships partially explained the differences, as did intercultural conflict, neighborhood discrimination, and unfair treatment in young adulthood. The experience of growing up as a minority, as defined by context, seemingly elevates psychiatric risks, with differences in social relationships and increased social stress as mediators of this relationship. Our findings suggest that interventions at the neighborhood context rather than at the individual level might be important levers to reduce risks for the development of mood disorders in minority youth.

        "Effects of multiple cycles of weight loss and regain on the body weight regulatory system in rats. We studied the effects of multiple cycles of weight loss and regain on the defended body weight in rats. Thirty-six male Wistar rats were divided into three weight-matched groups: weight cyclers (n = 18), ad libitum-fed controls (n = 9), and maturity controls (n = 9). Cyclers underwent four rounds of 20% weight loss from 50% caloric restriction, each cycle followed by recovery to stable plateau weight on ad libitum feeding. Controls ate ad libitum. Maturity controls ate ad libitum and then weight cycled the final two rounds to evaluate the effect of age in later cycles. Cyclers' postdiet plateau weight became progressively lower than that of controls. With each weight loss, ghrelin increased, while insulin and leptin decreased; the magnitude of these changes did not differ across cycles. After four rounds, cyclers' weight (504\u2009\u00b1\u20097 vs. 540\u2009\u00b1\u200922 g; P < 0.05) and percent body fat (11.7 vs. 15.2%; P < 0.05) were lower than in controls. After a 4-mo follow-up period of ad libitum feeding, cyclers maintained a lower total fat-pad mass versus controls (8.6\u2009\u00b1\u20090.5 vs. 15.9\u2009\u00b1\u20093.6 g; P < 0.01) and a lower glucose area-under-the-curve on oral glucose tolerance tests (P < 0.05). Repeated weight-loss cycles exerted positive effects, durably lowering defended levels of body adiposity and improving glucose tolerance. ",
        "Deconvolution of transcriptional networks identifies TCF4 as a master regulator in schizophrenia. Applying tissue-specific deconvolution of transcriptional networks to identify their master regulators (MRs) in neuropsychiatric disorders has been largely unexplored. Here, using two schizophrenia (SCZ) case-control RNA-seq datasets, one on postmortem dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and another on cultured olfactory neuroepithelium, we deconvolved the transcriptional networks and identified TCF4 as a top candidate MR that may be dysregulated in SCZ. We validated TCF4 as a MR through enrichment analysis of TCF4-binding sites in induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived neurons and in neuroblastoma cells. We further validated the predicted TCF4 targets by knocking down TCF4 in hiPSC-derived neural progenitor cells (NPCs) and glutamatergic neurons (Glut_Ns). The perturbed TCF4 gene network in NPCs was more enriched for pathways involved in neuronal activity and SCZ-associated risk genes, compared to Glut_Ns. Our results suggest that TCF4 may serve as a MR of a gene network dysregulated in SCZ at early stages of neurodevelopment. ",

Cues in the environment can elicit complex emotional states, and thereby maladaptive behavior, as a function of their ascribed value. Here we capture individual variation in the propensity to attribute motivational value to reward-cues using the sign-tracker/goal-tracker animal model. Goal-trackers attribute predictive value to reward-cues, and sign-trackers attribute both predictive and incentive value. Using chemogenetics and microdialysis, we show that, in sign-trackers, stimulation of the neuronal pathway from the prelimbic cortex (PrL) to the paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus (PVT) decreases the incentive value of a reward-cue. In contrast, in goal-trackers, inhibition of the PrL-PVT pathway increases both the incentive value and dopamine levels in the nucleus accumbens shell. The PrL-PVT pathway, therefore, exerts top-down control over the dopamine-dependent process of incentive salience attribution. These results highlight PrL-PVT pathway as a potential target for treating psychopathologies associated with the attribution of excessive incentive value to reward-cues, including addiction. ",
        "TRPV6 and Cav1.3 Mediate Distal Small Intestine Calcium Absorption Before Weaning. BACKGROUND & AIMS: Intestinal Ca2+ absorption early in life is vital to achieving optimal bone mineralization. The molecular details of intestinal Ca2+ absorption have been defined in adults after peak bone mass is obtained, but they are largely unexplored during development. We sought to delineate the molecular details of transcellular Ca2+ absorption during this critical period. METHODS: Expression of small intestinal and renal calcium transport genes was assessed by using quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Net calcium flux across small intestinal segments was measured in Ussing chambers, including after pharmacologic inhibition or genetic manipulation of TRPV6 or Cav1.3 calcium channels. Femurs were analyzed by using micro-computed tomography and histology. RESULTS: Net TRPV6-mediated Ca2+ flux across the duodenum was absent in pre-weaned (P14) mice but present after weaning. In contrast, we found significant transcellular Ca2+ absorption in the jejunum at 2 weeks but not 2 months of age. Net jejunal Ca2+ absorption observed at P14 was not present in either Trpv6 mutant (D541A) mice or Cav1.3 knockout mice. We observed significant nifedipine-sensitive transcellular absorption across the ileum at P14 but not 2 months. Cav1.3 knockout pups exhibited delayed bone mineral accrual, compensatory nifedipine-insensitive Ca2+ absorption in the ileum, and increased expression of renal Ca2+ reabsorption mediators at P14. Moreover, weaning pups at 2 weeks reduced jejunal and ileal Cav1.3 expression. CONCLUSIONS: We have detailed novel pathways contributing to transcellular Ca2+ transport across the distal small intestine of mice during development, highlighting the complexity of\u00a0the multiple mechanisms involved in achieving a positive Ca2+ balance early in life.

        "Restoration of Olfactory Memory in Drosophila Overexpressing Human Alzheimer's Disease Associated Tau by Manipulation of L-Type Ca2+ Channels. The cellular underpinnings of memory deficits in Alzheimer's disease (AD) are poorly understood. We utilized the tractable neural circuits sub-serving memory in Drosophila to investigate the role of impaired Ca2+ handling in memory deficits caused by expression of human 0N4R isoform of tau which is associated with AD. Expression of tau in mushroom body neuropils, or a subset of mushroom body output neurons, led to impaired memory. By using the Ca2+ reporter GCaMP6f, we observed changes in Ca2+ signaling when tau was expressed in these neurons, an effect that could be blocked by the L-type Ca2+ channel antagonist nimodipine or reversed by RNAi knock-down of the L-type channel gene. The L-type Ca2+ channel itself is required for memory formation, however, RNAi knock-down of the L-type Ca2+ channel in neurons overexpressing human tau resulted in flies whose memory is restored to levels equivalent to wild-type. Expression data suggest that Drosophila L-type Ca2+ channel mRNA levels are increased upon tau expression in neurons, thus contributing to the effects observed on memory and intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis. Together, our Ca2+ imaging and memory experiments suggest that expression of the 0N4R isoform of human tau increases the number of L-type Ca2+ channels in the membrane resulting in changes in neuronal excitability that can be ameliorated by RNAi knockdown or pharmacological blockade of L-type Ca2+ channels. This highlights a role for L-type Ca2+ channels in tauopathy and their potential as a therapeutic target for AD. ",
        "Oral Fluoroquinolones and Risk\u00a0of\u00a0Mitral\u00a0and Aortic Regurgitation. BACKGROUND: Recent studies have linked fluoroquinolones (FQs) to cardiac adverse events, including aortic dissection and aneurysm. To date, whether FQs can increase the risk of aortic or mitral regurgitation has not been studied. OBJECTIVES: This disproportionality analysis and case-control study examined whether FQs increase the risk of aortic and mitral regurgitation. METHODS: Data from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's adverse reporting system database was used to undertake a disproportionality analysis, and a random sample of 9,053,240 patients from the U.S. PharMetrics Plus database (IQVIA) was used for the matched nested case-control study. Current FQ exposure implied an active prescription at the index date or 30\u00a0days prior to the event date. Recent FQ exposure was defined as FQ use within days 31 to 60 and past within days 61 to 365 prior to the event date. Rate ratios (RRs) were compared to users of amoxicillin and azithromycin. Conditional logistic regression was used to compute RRs adjusting for confounders. RESULTS: The reported odds ratio for the disproportionality analysis was 1.45 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.20 to 1.77). A total of 12,505 cases and 125,020 control subjects were identified in the case-control study. The adjusted RRs for current users of FQ compared with amoxicillin and azithromycin users were 2.40 (95%\u00a0CI: 1.82 to 3.16) and 1.75 (95%\u00a0CI: 1.34 to 2.29), respectively. The adjusted RRs for recent and past FQ users when compared with amoxicillin were 1.47 (95%\u00a0CI: 1.03 to 2.09) and 1.06 (95%\u00a0CI: 0.91 to 1.21), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: These results show that the risk of aortic and mitral regurgitation is highest with current use followed by recent use. No risk was observed with past use of FQs. Future studies are necessary to confirm or refute these associations. ",
        "Clinical EEG slowing correlates with delirium severity and predicts poor clinical outcomes. OBJECTIVE: To determine which findings on routine clinical EEGs correlate with delirium severity across various presentations and to determine whether EEG findings independently predict important clinical outcomes. METHODS: We prospectively studied a cohort of nonintubated inpatients undergoing EEG for evaluation of altered mental status. Patients were assessed for delirium within 1 hour of EEG with the 3-Minute Diagnostic Interview for Confusion Assessment Method (3D-CAM) and 3D-CAM severity score. EEGs were interpreted clinically by neurophysiologists, and reports were reviewed to identify features such as theta or delta slowing and triphasic waves. Generalized linear models were used to quantify associations among EEG findings, delirium, and clinical outcomes, including length of stay, Glasgow Outcome Scale scores, and mortality. RESULTS: We evaluated 200 patients (median age 60 years, IQR 48.5-72 years); 121 (60.5%) met delirium criteria. The EEG finding most strongly associated with delirium presence was a composite of generalized theta or delta slowing (odds ratio 10.3, 95% confidence interval 5.3-20.1). The prevalence of slowing correlated not only with overall delirium severity (R2 = 0.907) but also with the severity of each feature assessed by CAM-based delirium algorithms. Slowing was common in delirium even with normal arousal. EEG slowing was associated with longer hospitalizations, worse functional outcomes, and increased mortality, even after adjustment for delirium presence or severity. CONCLUSIONS: Generalized slowing on routine clinical EEG strongly correlates with delirium and may be a valuable biomarker for delirium severity. In addition, generalized EEG slowing should trigger elevated concern for the prognosis of patients with altered mental status. ",
        "Surfen-mediated blockade of extratumoral chondroitin sulfate glycosaminoglycans inhibits glioblastoma invasion. Invasive spread of glioblastoma (GBM) is linked to changes in chondroitin sulfate (CS) proteoglycan (CSPG)-associated sulfated glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) that are selectively up-regulated in the tumor microenvironment (TME). We hypothesized that inhibiting CS-GAG signaling in the TME would stem GBM invasion. Rat F98 GBM cells demonstrated enhanced preferential cell invasion into oversulfated 3-dimensional composite of CS-A and CS-E [4- and 4,6-sulfated CS-GAG (COMP)] matrices compared with monosulfated (4-sulfated) and unsulfated hyaluronic acid matrices in microfluidics-based choice assays, which is likely influenced by differential GAG receptor binding specificities. Both F98 and human patient-derived glioma stem cells (GSCs) demonstrated a high degree of colocalization of the GSC marker CD133 and CSPGs. The small molecule sulfated GAG antagonist bis-2-methyl-4-amino-quinolyl-6-carbamide (surfen) reduced invasion and focal adhesions in F98 cells encapsulated in COMP matrices and blocked CD133 and antichondroitin sulfate antibody (CS-56) detection of respective antigens in F98 cells and human GSCs. Surfen-treated F98 cells down-regulated CSPG-binding receptor transcripts and protein, as well as total and activated ERK and protein kinase B. Lastly, rats induced with frontal lobe tumors and treated with a single intratumoral dose of surfen demonstrated reduced tumor burden and spread compared with untreated controls. These results present a first demonstration of surfen as an inhibitor of sulfated GAG signaling to stem GBM invasion.-Logun, M. T., Wynens, K.

        "The Impact of Plastic Surgery Training on Family Planning and Prenatal Health. BACKGROUND: Plastic surgery trainees who wish to start a family face challenges. This is the first study to collect data directly from residents and fellows to understand issues surrounding childbearing and to propose solutions. METHODS: Following institutional review board approval, an anonymous survey was distributed to all current plastic surgery residents and fellows in the United States. Data regarding demographics, obstetrical complications, parental leave, breastfeeding, and use of assisted reproductive technology were collected. RESULTS: The survey was completed by 307 trainees, for a resident response rate of 27.0 percent. Mean age of the respondents was 31.7 \u00b1 3.8 years, 58.6 percent were married, and 35.3 percent reported at least one pregnancy for themselves or for their partner. Both male (67.4 percent) and female (76.5 percent) respondents intentionally postponed having children because of career. Women were significantly more likely to report negative stigma attached to pregnancy (70.4 percent versus 51.1 percent; p = 0.003) and plan to delay childbearing until after training. Fifty-six percent of female trainees reported an obstetrical complication. Assisted reproductive technology was used by 19.6 percent of trainees. Mean maternity leave was 5.5 weeks, with 44.4 percent taking less than 6 weeks. Mean paternity leave was 1.2 weeks. Sixty-two percent of women and 51.4 percent of men reported dissatisfaction with leave. Sixty-one percent of female trainees breastfed for 6 months and 19.5 percent continued for 12 months. Lactation facilities were available near operating rooms for 29.4 percent of respondents. CONCLUSIONS: Plastic surgery training may negatively impact fertility, obstetrical health, and breastfeeding practices. The data presented in this article provide the groundwork for identifying areas of concern and potential solutions. ",
        "\"It Wasn't Just One Thing\": A Qualitative Study of Newly Homeless Emergency Department Patients. OBJECTIVES: Emergency departments (EDs) frequently care for patients who are homeless or unstably housed. One promising approach taken by the homeless services system is to provide interventions that attempt to prevent homelessness before it occurs. Experts have suggested that health care settings may be ideal locations to identify and intervene with patients at risk for homelessness, yet little is known even about the basic characteristics of patients who might benefit from such interventions. METHODS: We conducted in-depth, one-on-one qualitative interviews with ED patients who had become homeless within the past 6 months. Using a semistructured interview guide, we asked patients about their pathways into homelessness and what might have prevented them from becoming homeless. Interviews were digitally recorded and professionally transcribed. Transcripts were coded line by line by multiple investigators who then met as a group to discuss and refine codes in an iterative fashion. RESULTS: Interviews were completed with 31 patients. Mean interview length was 42 minutes. Four main themes emerged: 1) unique stories yet common social and health contributors to homelessness, 2) personal agency versus larger structural forces, 3) limitations in help from family or friends, and 4) homelessness was not expected. CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate gaps in current homeless prevention services and can help inform future interventions for unstably housed and homeless ED patients. More immediately, the findings provide rich, unique context to the lives of a vulnerable patient population commonly seen in EDs. ",
        "Emergence of dominant toxigenic M1T1 Streptococcus pyogenes clone during increased scarlet fever activity in England: a population-based molecular epidemiological study. BACKGROUND: Since 2014, England has seen increased scarlet fever activity unprecedented in modern times. In 2016, England's scarlet fever seasonal rise coincided with an unexpected elevation in invasive Streptococcus pyogenes infections. We describe the molecular epidemiological investigation of these events. METHODS: We analysed changes in S pyogenes emm genotypes, and notifications of scarlet fever and invasive disease in 2014-16 using regional (northwest London) and national (England and Wales) data. Genomes of 135 non-invasive and 552 invasive emm1 isolates from 2009-16 were analysed and compared with 2800 global emm1 sequences. Transcript and protein expression of streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin A (SpeA; also known as scarlet fever or erythrogenic toxin A) in sequenced, non-invasive emm1 isolates was quantified by real-time PCR and western blot analyses. FINDINGS: Coincident with national increases in scarlet fever and invasive disease notifications, emm1 S pyogenes upper respiratory tract isolates increased significantly in northwest London in the March to May period, from five (5%) of 96 isolates in 2014, to 28 (19%) of 147 isolates in 2015 (p=0\u00b70021 vs 2014 values), to 47 (33%) of 144 in 2016 (p=0\u00b70080 vs 2015 values). Similarly, invasive emm1 isolates collected nationally in the same period increased from 183 (31%) of 587 in 2015 to 267 (42%) of 637 in 2016 (p<0\u00b70001). Sequences of emm1 isolates from 2009-16 showed emergence of a new emm1 lineage (designated M1UK)-with overlap of pharyngitis, scarlet fever, and invasive M1UK strains-which could be genotypically distinguished from pandemic emm1 isolates (M1global) by 27 single-nucleotide polymorphisms. Median SpeA protein concentration in supernatant was nine-times higher among M1UK isolates (190\u00b72 ng/mL [IQR 168\u00b79-200\u00b74]; n=10) than M1global isolates (20\u00b79 ng/mL [0\u00b70-27\u00b73]; n=10; p<0\u00b70001). M1UK expanded nationally to represent 252 (84%) of all 299 emm1 genomes in 2016. Phylogenetic analysis of published datasets identified single M1UK isolates in Denmark and the USA. INTERPRETATION: A dominant new emm1 S pyogenes lineage characterised by increased SpeA production has emerged during increased S pyogenes activity in England. The expanded reservoir of M1UK and recognised invasive potential of emm1 S pyogenes provide plausible explanation for the increased incidence of invasive disease, and rationale for global surveillance.

        "Predictors of longer-term development of expressive language in two independent longitudinal cohorts of language-delayed preschoolers with Autism Spectrum Disorder. BACKGROUND: Studies estimate that 30% of individuals with autism are minimally verbal. Understanding what factors predict longer-term expressive development in children with language delays is critical to inform identification and treatment of those at-risk for persistent language impairments. The present study examined predictors of expressive language development in language-delayed preschoolers followed through later school-age and young adulthood. METHODS: Children using single words or less on the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS) at approximately 3\u00a0years old were drawn from the Early Diagnosis (EDX) and Pathways in ASD longitudinal cohorts. Age-3 predictors of Age-19 ADOS language level were identified using Classification and Regression Trees (CART) in the EDX sample. Linear mixed models examined the effects of CART-identified predictors on Vineland expressive communication (VExp) trajectories from Age-3 to Age-19. The same linear mixed models were examined in the Pathways sample, identifying predictors of VExp from ages 3 to 10.5\u00a0years. RESULTS: Significantly delayed fine motor skills (T-score\u00a0<\u00a020) was the strongest CART predictor of Age-19 language. In the linear mixed models, time, Age-3 fine motor skills and initiation of joint attention (IJA) predicted VExp trajectories in the EDX sample, even when controlling for Age-3 visual receptive abilities. In the Pathways sample, time and Age-3 fine motor skills were significant predictors of VExp trajectories; IJA and cognitive skills were not significant predictors. CONCLUSIONS: Marked deficits in fine motor skills may be a salient proxy marker for identifying language-delayed children with ASD who are at risk for persistent language impairments. This finding adds to the literature demonstrating a relation between motor and language development in ASD. Investigating individual skill areas (e.g., fine motor and nonverbal problem-solving skills), rather than broader indices of developmental level (e.g., nonverbal IQ) may provide important cues to understanding longer-term language outcomes that can be targeted in early intervention.

        "A novel P300 inhibitor reverses DUX4-mediated global histone H3 hyperacetylation, target gene expression, and cell death. Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) results from mutations causing overexpression of the transcription factor, DUX4, which interacts with the histone acetyltransferases, EP300 and CBP. We describe the activity of a new spirocyclic EP300/CBP inhibitor, iP300w, which inhibits the cytotoxicity of the DUX4 protein and reverses the overexpression of most DUX4 target genes, in engineered cell lines and FSHD myoblasts, as well as in an FSHD animal model. In evaluating the effect of iP300w on global histone H3 acetylation, we discovered that DUX4 overexpression leads to a dramatic global increase in the total amount of acetylated histone H3. This unexpected effect requires the C-terminus of DUX4, is conserved with mouse Dux, and may facilitate zygotic genome activation. This global increase in histone H3 acetylation is reversed by iP300w, highlighting the central role of EP300 and CBP in the transcriptional mechanism underlying DUX4 cytotoxicity and the translational potential of blocking this interaction.

        "Neural Correlates of Music Listening and Recall in the Human Brain. Previous neuroimaging studies have identified various brain regions that are activated by music listening or recall. However, little is known about how these brain regions represent the time course and temporal features of music during listening and recall. Here we analyzed neural activity in different brain regions associated with music listening and recall using electrocorticography recordings obtained from 10 epilepsy patients of both genders implanted with subdural electrodes. Electrocorticography signals were recorded while subjects were listening to familiar instrumental music or recalling the same music pieces by imagery. During the onset phase (0-500 ms), music listening initiated cortical activity in high-gamma band in the temporal lobe and supramarginal gyrus, followed by the precentral gyrus and the inferior frontal gyrus. In contrast, during music recall, the high-gamma band activity first appeared in the inferior frontal gyrus and precentral gyrus, and then spread to the temporal lobe, showing a reversed temporal sequential order. During the sustained phase (after 500 ms), delta band and high-gamma band responses in the supramarginal gyrus, temporal and frontal lobes dynamically tracked the intensity envelope of the music during listening or recall with distinct temporal delays. During music listening, the neural tracking by the frontal lobe lagged behind that of the temporal lobe; whereas during music recall, the neural tracking by the frontal lobe preceded that of the temporal lobe. These findings demonstrate bottom-up and top-down processes in the cerebral cortex during music listening and recall and provide important insights into music processing by the human brain.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Understanding how the brain analyzes, stores, and retrieves music remains one of the most challenging problems in neuroscience. By analyzing direct neural recordings obtained from the human brain, we observed dispersed and overlapping brain regions associated with music listening and recall. Music listening initiated cortical activity in high-gamma band starting from the temporal lobe and ending at the inferior frontal gyrus. A reversed temporal flow was observed in high-gamma response during music recall. Neural responses of frontal and temporal lobes dynamically tracked the intensity envelope of music that was presented or imagined during listening or recall. These findings demonstrate bottom-up and top-down processes in the cerebral cortex during music listening and recall. ",
        "Time trends in the incidence of diagnosed depression among people aged 5-25 years living in Finland 1995-2012. Background: Knowledge of time trends for depression is important for disease prevention and healthcare planning. Only a few studies have addressed these questions regarding the incidence and cumulative incidence of diagnosed depression from childhood to early adulthood and findings have been inconclusive. Aim: The aim of this national register-based Finnish study was to report the time trends of the age-specific and gender-specific incidence and cumulative incidence of diagnosed depression. Methods: The study sample included all 1,245,502 singletons born in Finland between 1 January 1987 and 31 December 2007 and still living in Finland at the end of 2012. The participants were divided into three cohorts by birth year: 1987-1993, 1994-2000 and 2001-2007. Depression diagnoses (ICD-9: 2961; ICD-10: F32, F33) given in 1995-2012 were available and identified from the Care Register for Health Care. Results: Ten percent of the females and five percent of the males were diagnosed with depression in specialized services by age 25\u00a0years. The cumulative incidence of depression by age 15\u00a0years rose from 1.8% (95% CI 1.8-1.9) to 2.9% (95% CI 2.8-3.0) in females and from 1.0% (95% CI 1.1-1.2) to 1.6% (95% CI 1.6-1.7) in males when the cohorts born 1987-1993 and 1994-2000 were compared. Conclusions: A larger proportion of young people in Finland are diagnosed with depression in specialized services than before. This can be due to better identification, more positive attitudes to mental health problems and increased availability of the services. ",
        "Patient non-attendance at urgent referral appointments for suspected cancer and its links to cancer diagnosis and one year mortality: A cohort study of patients referred on the Two Week Wait pathway. BACKGROUND: The 'Two Week Wait' policy aims to ensure patients with suspected cancer are seen within two weeks of referral. However, patient non-attendance can result in this target being missed. This study aimed to identify predictors of non-attendance; and analyse the relationship between attendance and outcomes including cancer diagnosis and early mortality. METHODS: A cohort study of 109,433 adults registered at 105 general practices, referred to a cancer centre within a large NHS hospital trust (April 2009 to December 2016) on the 'Two Week Wait' pathway. RESULTS: 5673 (5.2%) patients did not attend. Non-attendance was largely predicted by patient factors (younger and older age, male gender, greater deprivation, suspected cancer site, earlier year of referral, greater distance to the hospital) over practice factors (greater deprivation, lower Quality and Outcomes Framework score, lower cancer conversion rate, lower cancer detection rate). 10,360 (9.6%) patients were diagnosed with cancer within six months of referral (9.8% attending patients, 5.6% non-attending patients). Among these patients, 2029 (19.6%) died within 12 months of diagnosis: early mortality risk was 31.3% in non-attenders and 19.2% in attending patients. CONCLUSIONS: Non-attendance at urgent referral appointments for suspected cancer involves a minority of patients but happens in predictable groups. Cancer diagnosis was less likely in non-attending patients but these patients had worse early mortality outcomes than attending patients. The study findings have implications for cancer services and policy. ",
        "A Multicenter Randomized Trial to Evaluate a Chemical-first or Electrical-first Cardioversion Strategy for Patients With Uncomplicated Acute Atrial Fibrillation. BACKGROUND: Emergency department (ED) patients with uncomplicated atrial fibrillation (AF) of less than 48 hours may be safely managed with rhythm control. Although both chemical-first and electrical-first strategies have been advocated, there are no comparative effectiveness data to guide clinicians. METHODS: At six urban Canadian centers, ED patients ages 18 to 75 with uncomplicated symptomatic AF of less than 48 hours and CHADS2 score of 0 or 1 were randomized using concealed allocation in a 1:1 ratio to one of the following strategies: 1) chemical cardioversion with procainamide infusion, followed by electrical countershock if unsuccessful; or 2) electrical cardioversion, followed by procainamide infusion if unsuccessful. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients discharged within 4 hours of arrival. Secondary outcomes included ED length-of-stay (LOS); prespecified ED-based adverse events; and 30-day ED revisits, hospitalizations, strokes, deaths, and quality of life (QoL). RESULTS: Eighty-four patients were analyzed: 41 in the chemical-first group and 43 in the electrical-first group. Groups were balanced in terms of age, sex, vital signs, and CHADS2 scores. All patients were discharged home, with 83 (99%) in sinus rhythm. In the chemical-first group, 13 of 41 patients (32%) were discharged within 4 hours compared to 29 of 43 patients (67%) in the electrical-first group (p\u00a0=\u00a00.001). In the chemical-first group, the median ED LOS was 5.1 hours (interquartile range [IQR]\u00a0= 3.5 to 5.9 hours) compared to 3.5 hours (IQR\u00a0= 2.4 to 4.6 hours) in the electrical-first group, for a median difference of 1.2 hours (95% confidence interval\u00a0= 0.4 to 2.0 hours, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). No patients experienced stroke or death. All other outcomes, including adverse events, ED revisits, and QoL, were similar. CONCLUSION: In uncomplicated ED AF patients managed with rhythm control, chemical-first and electrical-first strategies both appear to be successful and well tolerated; however, an electrical-first strategy results in a significantly shorter ED LOS.

        "Habitual tea drinking modulates brain efficiency: evidence from brain connectivity evaluation. The majority of tea studies have relied on neuropsychological measures, and much fewer on neuroimaging measures, especially for interregional connections. To date, there has been no exploration of the effect of tea on system-level brain networks. We recruited healthy older participants to two groups according to their history of tea drinking frequency and investigated both functional and structural networks to reveal the role of tea drinking on brain organization. The results showed that tea drinking gave rise to the more efficient structural organization, but had no significant beneficial effect on the global functional organization. The suppression of hemispheric asymmetry in the structural connectivity network was observed as a result of tea drinking. We did not observe any significant effects of tea drinking on the hemispheric asymmetry of the functional connectivity network. In addition, functional connectivity strength within the default mode network (DMN) was greater for the tea-drinking group, and coexistence of increasing and decreasing connective strengths was observed in the structural connectivity of the DMN. Our study offers the first evidence of the positive contribution of tea drinking to brain structure and suggests a protective effect on age-related decline in brain organisation. ",
        "The association between symptom onset characteristics and prehospital delay in women and men with acute coronary syndrome. BACKGROUND: A decision to delay seeking treatment for symptoms of acute coronary syndrome increases the risk of serious complications, disability, and death. AIMS: The purpose of this study was to determine if there was an association between gradual vs abrupt symptom onset and prehospital delay for patients with acute coronary syndrome and to examine the relationship between activities at symptom onset and gradual vs abrupt symptom onset. METHODS: This was a secondary analysis of a large prospective multi-center study. Altogether, 474 patients presenting to the emergency department with symptoms of acute coronary syndrome were included in the study. Symptom characteristics, activity at symptom onset, and prehospital delay were measured with the ACS Patient Questionnaire. RESULTS: Median prehospital delay time was four hours. Being uninsured (\u03b2=0.120, p=0.031) and having a gradual onset of symptoms (\u03b2=0.138, p=0.003) were associated with longer delay. A diagnosis of ST-elevation myocardial infarction (\u03b2=-0.205, p=0.001) and arrival by ambulance (\u03b2=-0.317, p<0.001) were associated with shorter delay. Delay times were shorter for patients who experienced an abrupt vs gradual symptom onset (2.57 h vs 8 h, p<0.001). Among men with an abrupt onset of symptoms and a ST-elevation myocardial infarction diagnosis, 54% reported that symptoms were triggered by exertion (p=0.046). CONCLUSION: Patients should be counselled that a gradual onset of symptoms for potential acute coronary syndrome is an emergency and that they should call 911. Men with ischemic heart disease or with multiple risk factors should be cautioned that symptom onset following exertion may represent acute coronary syndrome. ",
        "Traumatic microbleeds suggest vascular injury and predict disability in traumatic brain injury. Traumatic microbleeds are small foci of hypointensity seen on T2*-weighted MRI in patients following head trauma that have previously been considered a marker of axonal injury. The linear appearance and location of some traumatic microbleeds suggests a vascular origin. The aims of this study were to: (i) identify and characterize traumatic microbleeds in patients with acute traumatic brain injury; (ii) determine whether appearance of traumatic microbleeds predict clinical outcome; and (iii) describe the pathology underlying traumatic microbleeds in an index patient. Patients presenting to the emergency department following acute head trauma who received a head CT were enrolled within 48 h of injury and received a research MRI. Disability was defined using Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended \u22646 at follow-up. All magnetic resonance images were interpreted prospectively and were used for subsequent analysis of traumatic microbleeds. Lesions on T2* MRI were stratified based on 'linear' streak-like or 'punctate' petechial-appearing traumatic microbleeds. The brain of an enrolled subject imaged acutely was procured following death for evaluation of traumatic microbleeds using MRI targeted pathology methods. Of the 439 patients enrolled over 78 months, 31% (134/439) had evidence of punctate and/or linear traumatic microbleeds on MRI. Severity of injury, mechanism of injury, and CT findings were associated with traumatic microbleeds on MRI. The presence of traumatic microbleeds was an independent predictor of disability (P < 0.05; odds ratio = 2.5). No differences were found between patients with punctate versus linear appearing microbleeds. Post-mortem imaging and histology revealed traumatic microbleed co-localization with iron-laden macrophages, predominately seen in perivascular space. Evidence of axonal injury was not observed in co-localized histopathological sections. Traumatic microbleeds were prevalent in the population studied and predictive of worse outcome. The source of traumatic microbleed signal on MRI appeared to be iron-laden macrophages in the perivascular space tracking a network of injured vessels. While axonal injury in association with traumatic microbleeds cannot be excluded, recognizing traumatic microbleeds as a form of traumatic vascular injury may aid in identifying patients who could benefit from new therapies targeting the injured vasculature and secondary injury to parenchyma.

        "Genomic prediction of depression risk and resilience under stress. Advancing ability to predict who is likely to develop depression holds great potential in reducing the disease burden. Here, we use the predictable and large increase in depression with physician training stress to identify predictors of depression. Applying the major depressive disorder polygenic risk score (MDD-PRS) derived from the most recent Psychiatric Genomics Consortium-UK Biobank-23andMe genome-wide association study to 5,227 training physicians, we found that MDD-PRS predicted depression under training stress (\u03b2\u2009=\u20090.095, P\u2009=\u20094.7\u2009\u00d7\u200910-16) and that MDD-PRS was more strongly associated with depression under stress than at baseline (MDD-PRS\u2009\u00d7\u2009stress interaction \u03b2\u2009=\u20090.036, P\u2009=\u20090.005). Further, known risk factors accounted for substantially less of the association between MDD-PRS and depression when under stress than at baseline, suggesting that MDD-PRS adds unique predictive power in depression prediction. Finally, we found that low MDD-PRS may have particular use in identifying individuals with high resilience. Together, these findings suggest that MDD-PRS holds promise in furthering our ability to predict vulnerability and resilience under stress. ",
        "Bridging the Clinical Gap for DNA-Based Antibody Therapy Through Translational Studies in Sheep. Clinical translation of DNA-based administration of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) is uncertain due to lack of large animal data. To bridge the clinical gap, we evaluated a panel of novel plasmid DNA (pDNA)-encoded mAbs in 40-70\u2009kg sheep with a clinical intramuscular electroporation protocol. Injection of 4.8\u2009mg of pDNA, encoding ovine anti-human CEA mAb (OVAC), led to peak plasma mAb titers of 300\u2009ng/mL. OVAC remained detectable for 3 months and was boosted by a second pOVAC administration. Hyaluronidase muscle pretreatment increased OVAC concentrations up to 10-fold. These higher plasma titers, however, led to anti-drug antibodies (ADAs) toward the OVAC variable regions, resulting in loss of mAb detection and of adequate redosing. Transient immune suppression avoided ADA formation, with OVAC peaking at 3.5\u2009\u03bcg/mL and remaining detectable for 11 months after pOVAC injection. DNA-based delivery of ovine anti-human EGFR mAb (OVAE), identical to OVAC except for the variable regions, preceded by hyaluronidase, allowed for at least three consecutive administrations in an immune-competent sheep, without ADA response. When tripling the pOVAE dose to 15\u2009mg, transient ADAs of limited impact were observed; plasma OVAE peaked at 2.6\u2009\u03bcg/mL and was detected up to 7 months. DNA-based anti-HER2 trastuzumab in sheep gave no detectable mAb concentrations despite previous validation in mice, highlighting the limitations of relying on small-rodent data only. In conclusion, our results highlight the potential and caveats of clinical DNA-based antibody therapy, can expedite preclinical and clinical development, and benefit the field of gene transfer as a whole.

        "Bacterial co-culture with cell signaling translator and growth controller modules for autonomously regulated culture composition. Synthetic biology and metabolic engineering have expanded the possibilities for engineered cell-based systems. The addition of non-native biosynthetic and regulatory components can, however, overburden the reprogrammed cells. In order\u00a0to avoid metabolic overload, an emerging area of focus is on engineering consortia, wherein cell subpopulations work together to carry out a desired function. This strategy requires regulation of the cell populations. Here, we design a synthetic co-culture controller consisting of cell-based signal translator and growth-controller modules that, when implemented, provide for autonomous regulation of the consortia composition. The system co-opts the orthogonal autoinducer AI-1 and AI-2 cell-cell signaling mechanisms of bacterial quorum sensing (QS) to enable cross-talk between strains and a QS signal-controlled growth rate controller to modulate relative population densities. We further develop a simple mathematical model that enables cell and system design for autonomous closed-loop control of population trajectories. ",
        "Optimal policy for multi-alternative decisions. Everyday decisions frequently require choosing among multiple alternatives. Yet the optimal policy for such decisions is unknown. Here we derive the normative policy for general multi-alternative decisions. This strategy requires evidence accumulation to nonlinear, time-dependent bounds that trigger choices. A geometric symmetry in those boundaries allows the optimal strategy to be implemented by a simple neural circuit involving normalization with fixed decision bounds and an urgency signal. The model captures several key features of the response of decision-making neurons as well as the increase in reaction time as a function of the number of alternatives, known as Hick's law. In addition, we show that in the presence of divisive normalization and internal variability, our model can account for several so-called 'irrational' behaviors, such as the similarity effect as well as the violation of both the independence of irrelevant alternatives principle and the regularity principle.

        "Specialized Somatosensory-Motor Integration Functions in Musicians. Somatosensory signals play roles in the fine control of dexterous movements through a somatosensory-motor integration mechanism. While skilled individuals are typically characterized by fine-tuned somatosensory functions and dexterous motor skills, it remains unknown whether and in what manner their bridging mechanism, the tactile-motor and proprioceptive-motor integration functions, plastically changes through extensive sensorimotor experiences. Here, we addressed this issue by comparing physiological indices of these functions between pianists and nonmusicians. Both tactile and proprioceptive stimuli to the right index finger inhibited corticospinal excitability measured by a transcranial magnetic stimulation method. However, the tactile and proprioceptive stimuli exerted weaker and stronger inhibitory effects, respectively, on corticospinal excitability in pianists than in nonmusicians. The results of the electroencephalogram measurements revealed no significant group difference in the amplitude of cortical responses to the somatosensory stimuli around the motor and somatosensory cortices, suggesting that the group difference in the inhibitory effects reflects neuroplastic adaptation of the somatosensory-motor integration functions in pianists. Penalized regression analyses further revealed an association between these integration functions and motor performance in the pianists, suggesting that extensive piano practice reorganizes somatosensory-motor integration functions so as to enable fine control of dexterous finger movements during piano performances.

        "Transcatheter aortic valve replacements alter circulating serum factors to mediate myofibroblast deactivation. The transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) procedure has emerged as a minimally invasive treatment for patients with aortic valve stenosis (AVS). However, alterations in serum factor composition and biological activity after TAVR remain unknown. Here, we quantified the systemic inflammatory effects of the TAVR procedure and hypothesized that alterations in serum factor composition would modulate valve and cardiac fibrosis. Serum samples were obtained from patients with AVS immediately before their TAVR procedure (pre-TAVR) and about 1 month afterward (post-TAVR). Aptamer-based proteomic profiling revealed alterations in post-TAVR serum composition, and ontological analysis identified inflammatory macrophage factors implicated in myofibroblast activation and deactivation. Hydrogel biomaterials used as valve matrix mimics demonstrated that post-TAVR serum reduced myofibroblast activation of valvular interstitial cells relative to pre-TAVR serum from the same patient. Transcriptomics and curated network analysis revealed a shift in myofibroblast phenotype from pre-TAVR to post-TAVR and identified p38 MAPK signaling as one pathway involved in pre-TAVR-mediated myofibroblast activation. Post-TAVR serum deactivated valve and cardiac myofibroblasts initially exposed to pre-TAVR serum to a quiescent fibroblast phenotype. Our in vitro deactivation data correlated with patient disease severity measured via echocardiography and multimorbidity scores, and correlations were dependent on hydrogel stiffness. Sex differences in cellular responses to male and female sera were also observed and may corroborate clinical observations regarding sex-specific TAVR outcomes. Together, alterations in serum composition after TAVR may lead to an antifibrotic fibroblast phenotype, which suggests earlier interventions may be beneficial for patients with advanced AVS to prevent further disease progression.

        "CRISPR-Edited Stem Cells in a Patient with HIV and Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia. The safety of CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats)-based genome editing in the context of human gene therapy is largely unknown. CCR5 is a reasonable but not absolutely protective target for a cure of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection, because CCR5-null blood cells are largely resistant to HIV-1 entry. We transplanted CRISPR-edited CCR5-ablated hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) into a patient with HIV-1 infection and acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The acute lymphoblastic leukemia was in complete remission with full donor chimerism, and donor cells carrying the ablated CCR5 persisted for more than 19 months without gene editing-related adverse events. The percentage of CD4+ cells with CCR5 ablation increased by a small degree during a period of antiretroviral-therapy interruption. Although we achieved successful transplantation and long-term engraftment of CRISPR-edited HSPCs, the percentage of CCR5 disruption in lymphocytes was only approximately 5%, which indicates the need for further research into this approach.

        "The EYA3 tyrosine phosphatase activity promotes pulmonary vascular remodeling in pulmonary arterial hypertension. In pulmonary hypertension vascular remodeling leads to narrowing of distal pulmonary arterioles and increased pulmonary vascular resistance. Vascular remodeling is promoted by the survival and proliferation of pulmonary arterial vascular cells in a DNA-damaging, hostile microenvironment. Here we report that levels of Eyes Absent 3 (EYA3) are elevated in pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells from patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension and that EYA3 tyrosine phosphatase activity promotes the survival of these cells under DNA-damaging conditions. Transgenic mice harboring an inactivating mutation in the EYA3 tyrosine phosphatase domain are significantly protected from vascular remodeling. Pharmacological inhibition of the EYA3 tyrosine phosphatase activity substantially reverses vascular remodeling in a rat model of angio-obliterative pulmonary hypertension. Together these observations establish EYA3 as a disease-modifying target whose function in the pathophysiology of pulmonary arterial hypertension can be targeted by available inhibitors. ",
        "DDX3X acts as a live-or-die checkpoint in stressed cells by regulating NLRP3 inflammasome. The cellular stress response has a vital role in regulating homeostasis by modulating cell survival and death. Stress granules are cytoplasmic compartments that enable cells to survive various stressors. Defects in the assembly and disassembly of stress granules are linked to neurodegenerative diseases, aberrant\u00a0antiviral responses and cancer1-5. Inflammasomes are multi-protein heteromeric complexes that sense molecular patterns that are associated with damage or intracellular pathogens, and assemble into cytosolic compartments known as ASC specks to facilitate the activation of caspase-1. Activation of inflammasomes induces the secretion of interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2 and IL-18 and drives cell fate towards pyroptosis-a form of programmed inflammatory cell death that has major roles in health and disease6-12. Although both stress granules and inflammasomes can be triggered by the sensing of cellular stress, they drive contrasting cell-fate decisions. The crosstalk between stress granules and inflammasomes and how this informs cell fate has not been well-studied. Here we show that the induction of stress granules specifically inhibits NLRP3 inflammasome activation, ASC speck formation and pyroptosis. The stress granule protein DDX3X interacts with NLRP3 to drive inflammasome activation. Assembly of stress granules leads to the sequestration of DDX3X, and thereby the inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Stress granules and the NLRP3 inflammasome compete for DDX3X molecules to coordinate the activation of innate responses and subsequent cell-fate decisions under stress conditions. Induction of stress granules or loss of DDX3X in the myeloid compartment leads to a decrease in the production of inflammasome-dependent cytokines in vivo. Our findings suggest that macrophages use the availability of DDX3X to interpret stress signals and choose between pro-survival stress granules and pyroptotic ASC specks. Together, our data demonstrate the role of DDX3X in driving NLRP3 inflammasome and stress granule assembly, and suggest a rheostat-like mechanistic paradigm for regulating live-or-die cell-fate decisions under stress conditions.

        "CYP2C19 and STAT6 Variants Influence the Outcome of Proton Pump Inhibitor Therapy in Pediatric Eosinophilic Esophagitis. OBJECTIVE: Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are an effective treatment for eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE); however, only 30% to 60% of patients respond. Common genetic variants in CYP2C19 and STAT6 associate with PPI plasma concentration and magnitude of inflammatory response, respectively. Our objective was to determine if genetic variation in the genes for CYP2C19 and STAT6 influence differentiation between PPI responsive esophageal eosinophilia versus PPI nonresponsive EoE (PPI-REE, PPI-nonresponsive EoE). METHODS: Genomic DNA was isolated from 92 esophageal tissue biopsies collected from participants of a prospective clinical trial of high-dose PPI therapy for esophageal eosinophilia in children. RESULTS: Of the 92 patients examined, 57 (62%) were PPI-REE and 35 (38%) were PPI-nonresponsive EoE. Forty-six of the 92 patients were further characterized by pH probe monitoring; there was no association between reflux index and carriage of CYP2C1917 (P = 0.35). In children who received a PPI dose between \u22651.54 and \u22642.05\u200amg/kg/day, binary logistic regression modeling showed that carriage of CYP2C1917 associated with PPI-nonresponsive EoE (odds ratio (OR) [95% confidence interval (CI)] = 7.71 [1.21, 49.11], P = 0.031). Carriage of STAT6 allelic variant rs1059513 predicts PPI-REE (OR [95% CI] = 6.16 [1.44, 26.4], P = 0.028), whereas carriage of STAT6 rs324011 synergizes with CYP2C1917 to predict PPI-nonresponsive EoE (rs324011 OR [95% CI] = 5.56 [1.33, 20.72], P\u200a=\u200a0.022; CYP2C1917 OR [95% CI]\u200a=\u200a8.19[1.42, 50.57], P = 0.023). CONCLUSIONS: Common variants in CYP2C19 and STAT6 associate with a PPI-nonresponsive EoE outcome of PPI therapy for esophageal eosinophilia suggesting that response rates may be improved by adopting a genotype-guided approach to PPI dosing.

        "Distinct Mechanisms for Visual and Motor-Related Astrocyte Responses in Mouse Visual Cortex. Astrocytes are a major cell type in the mammalian nervous system, are in close proximity to neurons, and show rich Ca2+ activity thought to mediate cellular outputs. Astrocytes show activity linked to sensory [1, 2] and motor [3, 4] events, reflecting local neural activity and brain-wide neuromodulatory inputs. Sensory responses are highly variable [5-10], which may reflect interactions between distinct input types [6, 7, 9]. However, the diversity of inputs generating astrocyte activity, particularly during sensory stimulation and behavior, is not fully understood [11, 12]. Using a combination of Ca2+ imaging, a treadmill assay, and visual stimulation, we examined the properties of astrocyte activity in mouse visual cortex associated with motor or sensory events. Consistent with previous work, motor activity activated astrocytes across the cortex with little specificity, reflecting a diffuse neuromodulatory mechanism. In contrast, moving visual stimuli generated specific activity patterns that reflected the stimulus' trajectory within the visual field, precisely as one would predict if astrocytes reported local neural activity. Visual responses depended strongly on behavioral state, with astrocytes showing high amplitude Ca2+ transients during locomotion and little activity during stillness. Furthermore, the amplitudes of visual responses were highly correlated with pupil size, suggesting a role of arousal. Interestingly, while\u00a0depletion of cortical noradrenaline abolished locomotor responses, visual responses were only reduced in amplitude and their spatiotemporal organization remained intact, suggesting two distinct types of inputs underlie visual responses. We conclude that cortical astrocytes integrate local sensory information and behavioral state, suggesting a role in information processing. ",
        "IL-36\u03b3 Is a Key Regulator of Neutrophil Infiltration in the Vaginal Microenvironment and Limits Neuroinvasion in Genital HSV-2 Infection. HSV-2 is a neurotropic virus that causes a persistent, lifelong infection that increases risk for other sexually transmitted infections. The vaginal epithelium is the first line of defense against HSV-2 and coordinates the immune response through the secretion of immune mediators, including the proinflammatory cytokine IL-36\u03b3. Previously, we showed that IL-36\u03b3 treatment promoted transient polymorphonuclear cell infiltration to the vaginal cavity and protected against lethal HSV-2 challenge. In this report, we reveal that IL-36\u03b3 specifically induces transient neutrophil infiltration but does not impact monocyte and macrophage recruitment. Using IL-36\u03b3-/- mice in a lethal HSV-2 challenge model, we show that neutrophil counts are significantly reduced at 1 and 2 d postinfection and that KC-mediated mature neutrophil recruitment is impaired in IL-36\u03b3-/- mice. Additionally, IL-36\u03b3-/- mice develop genital disease more rapidly, have significantly reduced survival time, and exhibit an increased incidence of hind limb paralysis that is linked to productive HSV-2 infection in the brain stem. IL-36\u03b3-/- mice also exhibit a significant delay in clearance of the virus from the vaginal epithelium and a more rapid spread of HSV-2 to the spinal cord, bladder, and colon. We further show that the decreased survival time and increased virus spread observed in IL-36\u03b3-/- mice are not neutrophil-dependent, suggesting that IL-36\u03b3 may function to limit HSV-2 spread in the nervous system. Ultimately, we demonstrate that IL-36\u03b3 is a key regulator of neutrophil recruitment in the vaginal microenvironment and may function to limit HSV-2 neuroinvasion. ",
        "Salmonella persisters promote the spread of antibiotic resistance plasmids in the gut. The emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria through mutations or the acquisition of genetic material such as resistance plasmids represents a major public health issue1,2. Persisters are subpopulations of bacteria that survive antibiotics by reversibly adapting their physiology3-10, and can promote the emergence of antibiotic-resistant mutants11. We investigated whether persisters can also promote the spread of resistance plasmids. In contrast to mutations, the transfer of resistance plasmids requires the co-occurrence of both a donor and a recipient bacterial strain. For our experiments, we chose the facultative intracellular entero-pathogen Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (S.\u00a0Typhimurium) and Escherichia coli, a common member of the microbiota12. S.\u00a0Typhimurium forms persisters that survive antibiotic therapy in several host tissues. Here we show that tissue-associated S.\u00a0Typhimurium persisters represent long-lived reservoirs of plasmid donors or recipients. The formation of reservoirs of S.\u00a0Typhimurium persisters requires Salmonella pathogenicity island (SPI)-1 and/or SPI-2 in gut-associated tissues, or SPI-2 at systemic sites. The re-seeding of these persister bacteria into the gut lumen enables the co-occurrence of donors with gut-resident recipients, and thereby favours plasmid transfer between various strains of Enterobacteriaceae. We observe up to 99% transconjugants within two to three days of re-seeding. Mathematical modelling shows that rare re-seeding events may suffice for a high frequency of conjugation. Vaccination reduces the formation of reservoirs of persisters after oral infection with S.\u00a0Typhimurium, as well as subsequent plasmid transfer. We conclude that-even without selection for plasmid-encoded resistance genes-small reservoirs of pathogen persisters can foster the spread of promiscuous resistance plasmids in the gut. ",
        "Longitudinal Relationship Between Time-Out and Child Emotional and Behavioral Functioning. OBJECTIVE: Time-out is a widely used child discipline strategy and one of the only strategies currently recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics. Despite its widespread use and significant evidence to support its effectiveness in decreasing problem behavior, time-out is often suggested to be harmful or ineffective by the popular media and select professional organizations. Empirical evidence regarding possible side effects of time-out is limited. The present study examined the relationship between reported use of time-out and child emotional and behavioral functioning and parent-child relationships using longitudinal, archival data. METHODS: The study used archival, longitudinal data from the Early Head Start Research and Evaluation study. This study tracked families with children in Early Head Start at 3 different time points as follows: baseline (aged 0-3 years), pre-kindergarten, and fifth grade. Parent interviews, including questions on the use of time-out, were conducted when the children were 36 months old. Indicators of child emotional and behavioral health were measured at 36 months, pre-K, and fifth grade. Statistical analyses were completed to assess for potential side effects of time-out on child behavioral and emotional functioning and parent-child relationships. RESULTS: Analyses for all outcome variables suggest no significant difference for children whose parents reported using time-out versus those who did not. CONCLUSION: Parental reported use of time-out was not associated with long-term negative outcomes. Further research in this area is necessary to continue to address the multitude of concerns related to time-out that are presented by the media. ",
        "Co-occurrence of Violence-Related Risk and Protective Behaviors and Adult Support Among Male Youth in Urban Neighborhoods. Importance: Male youth in lower-resource neighborhoods bear a disproportionate burden of violence involvement, but little is known about clusters of specific violence-related behaviors to inform cross-cutting interventions that address multiple forms of violence. Objective: To examine associations between adult support and patterns of violence and risk or protective behavior co-occurrence among male youths in urban neighborhoods. Design, Setting, and Participants: Cross-sectional analysis of baseline and end-of-program data from a recently completed cluster-randomized sexual violence prevention trial across 20 lower-resource neighborhoods. Participants were male youths, aged 13 to 19 years, enrolled at youth-serving community agencies in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, from July 27, 2015, to June 5, 2017. Data were analyzed from July 1, 2018, to February 28, 2019. Exposures: Social support and natural mentoring, as defined by validated survey measures. Main Outcomes and Measures: Validated survey measures (youth violence, bullying, sexual and dating violence, history of exposure to violence and related adversities, substance use, school engagement, and future orientation) were assessed for detailed co-occurrence patterns using hierarchical clustering, dendrograms, and heatmaps across prespecified domains. Wilcoxon rank sum tests and logistic regression models examined associations between adult support and violence involvement. Results: Among 866 participants, the mean (SD) age was 15.5 (1.6) years and 632 participants (77.5%) identified as African American. All 866 participants completed baseline surveys and 577 completed end-of-program surveys. Seven clusters of risk and protective behaviors emerged: (1) school engagement; (2) career and future aspirations; (3) substance use and bullying exposure; (4) exposure to violence and related adversities, sexual violence exposure, peer delinquency, and gang involvement; (5) sexual violence, youth violence, and bullying perpetration; (6) dating abuse perpetration; and (7) physical or sexual partner violence perpetration. The strongest association cluster occurred among sexual violence perpetration behaviors. Youth with high social support engaged in significantly fewer of the 40 prespecified risk behaviors (high social support median [interquartile range], 8 [5-12] behaviors vs low social support median [interquartile range], 10 [6-14] behaviors; mean difference, 1.64 behaviors; 95% CI, 0.63-2.64 behaviors; P\u2009=\u2009.004). High social support and natural mentoring were both inversely associated with gang involvement (social support: odds ratio [OR], 0.39; 95% CI, 0.22-0.71; and natural mentoring: OR, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.25-0.76) and sexual violence exposure (social support: OR, 0.39; 95% CI, 0.24-0.64; and natural mentoring: OR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.39-0.98). Conclusions and Relevance: These findings suggest that co-occurrence of risk and protective behaviors differ significantly among youth with vs without adult support. Violence prevention interventions designed to leverage adult support should address broader co-occurrence patterns. ",
        "B cells sustain inflammation and predict response to immune checkpoint blockade in human melanoma. Tumor associated inflammation predicts response to immune checkpoint blockade in human melanoma. Current theories on regulation of inflammation center on anti-tumor T cell responses. Here we show that tumor associated B cells are vital to melanoma associated inflammation. Human B cells express pro- and anti-inflammatory factors and differentiate into plasmablast-like cells when exposed to autologous melanoma secretomes in vitro. This plasmablast-like phenotype can be reconciled in human melanomas where plasmablast-like cells also express T cell-recruiting chemokines CCL3, CCL4, CCL5. Depletion of B cells in melanoma patients by anti-CD20 immunotherapy decreases tumor associated inflammation and CD8+ T cell numbers. Plasmablast-like cells also increase PD-1+ T cell activation through anti-PD-1 blockade in vitro and their frequency in pretherapy melanomas predicts response and survival to immune checkpoint blockade. Tumor associated B cells therefore orchestrate and sustain melanoma inflammation and may represent a predictor for survival and response to immune checkpoint blockade therapy. ",

        "Distinct initiating events underpin the immune and metabolic heterogeneity of KRAS-mutant lung adenocarcinoma. The KRAS oncoprotein, a critical driver in 33% of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), has remained an elusive clinical target due to its perceived undruggable nature. The identification of dependencies borne through common co-occurring mutations are sought to more effectively target KRAS-mutant lung cancer. Approximately 20% of KRAS-mutant LUAD carry loss-of-function mutations in KEAP1, a negative regulator of the antioxidant response transcription factor NFE2L2/NRF2. We demonstrate that Keap1-deficient KrasG12D lung tumors arise from a bronchiolar cell-of-origin, lacking pro-tumorigenic macrophages observed in tumors originating from alveolar cells. Keap1 loss activates the pentose phosphate pathway, inhibition of which, using 6-AN, abrogated\u00a0tumor growth. These studies highlight alternative therapeutic approaches to specifically target this unique subset of KRAS-mutant LUAD cancers. ",
        "Targeting of dermal myofibroblasts through death receptor 5 arrests fibrosis in mouse models of scleroderma. Scleroderma is an autoimmune rheumatic disorder accompanied by severe fibrosis in skin and other internal organs. During scleroderma progression, resident fibroblasts undergo activation and convert to \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) expressing myofibroblasts (MFBs) with increased capacity to synthesize collagens and fibrogenic components. Accordingly, MFBs are a major therapeutic target for fibrosis in scleroderma and treatment with blocking MFBs could produce anti-fibrotic effects. TLY012 is an engineered human TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) which induces selective apoptosis in transformed cells expressing its cognate death receptors (DRs). Here we report that TLY012 selectively blocks activation of dermal fibroblasts and induces DR-mediated apoptosis in \u03b1-SMA+\u00a0MFBs through upregulated DR5 during its activation. In vivo, TLY012 reverses established skin fibrosis to near-normal skin architecture in mouse models of scleroderma. Thus, the TRAIL pathway plays a critical role in tissue remodeling and targeting upregulated DR5 in \u03b1-SMA+ MFBs is a viable therapy for fibrosis in scleroderma. ",
        "Leucine-Histidine Dipeptide Attenuates Microglial Activation and Emotional Disturbances Induced by Brain Inflammation and Repeated Social Defeat Stress. The number of patients with mental illnesses is rapidly increasing, and daily lifestyle is closely associated with the development of symptoms. It is suggested that inflammatory molecules derived from microglia play crucial roles for the pathophysiology of depression. In the present study, we discovered that leucine-histidine (LH) dipeptide suppressed activation of primary microglia. The effects of LH dipeptide orally administered were measured using tail suspension test (TST) in mice injected with lipopolysaccharide and social interaction test in mice received social defeat stress. LH dipeptide reduced pro-inflammatory cytokines upon stimulation in microglia. Orally administered LH dipeptide was delivered to the brain and suppressed the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the brain and concomitant depression-like behavior in the TST. Moreover, oral administration of LH dipeptide suppressed the induction of depression- and anxiety-like behaviors induced by repeated social defeat stress. These results indicate that LH dipeptide suppressed the activation of microglia and ameliorated depression-associated emotional disturbances. Further, we found that LH dipeptide was abundant in various fermented products. Together with previous epidemiological reports that daily intake of these fermented foods is negatively associated with the incidence of psychiatric diseases, our findings suggest that food rich in LH dipeptide may improve mental health.

        "Phylogenetic and functional characterisation of the Haemophilus influenzae multidrug efflux pump AcrB. Multidrug resistance in Gram-negative bacteria can arise by the over-expression of multidrug efflux pumps, which can extrude a wide range of antibiotics. Here we describe the ancestral Haemophilus influenzae efflux pump AcrB (AcrB-Hi). We performed a phylogenetic analysis of hundreds of RND-type transporters. We found that AcrB-Hi is a relatively ancient efflux pump, which nonetheless can export the same range of antibiotics as its evolved colleague from Escherichia coli. AcrB-Hi was not inhibited by the efflux pump inhibitor ABI-PP, and could export bile salts weakly. This points to an environmental adaptation of RND transporters. We also explain the sensitivity of H. influenzae cells to \u03b2-lactams and novobiocin by the outer membrane porin OmpP2. This porin counterbalances the AcrB-Hi efflux by leaking the drugs back into the cells. We hypothesise that multidrug recognition by RND-type pumps is not an evolutionarily acquired ability, and has been present since ancient promiscuous transporters. ",
        "Menopausal Status and Physical Activity Are Independently Associated With Cardiovascular Risk Factors of Healthy Middle-Aged Women: Cross-Sectional and Longitudinal Evidence. Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the primary cause of mortality in women in developed countries. CVD risk rises with age, yet for women there is a rapid increase in CVD risk that occurs after the onset of menopause. This observation suggests the presence of factors in the middle-aged women that accelerate the progression of CVD independent of chronological aging. Leisure time physical activity (LTPA) is a well-established protective factor against CVD. However, its role in attenuating atherogenic lipid profile changes and CVD risk in post-menopausal women has not been well-established. The present study is part of the Estrogenic Regulation of Muscle Apoptosis (ERMA) study, a population-based cohort study in which middle-aged Caucasian women (47-55) were classified into pre-menopausal, peri-menopausal, and post-menopausal groups based on follicle stimulating hormone levels and bleeding patterns. Comprehensive questionnaires, laboratory visits, anthropometric measurements, and physical activity monitoring by accelerometers were used to characterize the menopausal groups and serum lipid profiles were analyzed to quantify CV (cardiovascular) risk factors. Based on our findings, LTPA may attenuate menopause-associated atherogenic changes in the serum CV risk factors of healthy middle-aged women. However, LTPA does not seem to entirely offset the lipid profile changes associated with the menopausal transition. ",

Strains within some species, including Y. enterocolitica, also vary in their pathogenic properties. Phenotypic identification of Yersinia species is time-consuming, labour-intensive and may lead to incorrect identifications. Here, we developed a method to automatically identify and subtype all Yersinia isolates from their genomic sequence. A phylogenetic analysis of Yersinia isolates based on a core subset of 500 shared genes clearly demarcated all existing Yersinia species and uncovered novel, yet undefined Yersinia taxa. An automated taxonomic assignment procedure was developed using species-specific thresholds based on core-genome multilocus sequence typing (cgMLST). The performance of this method was assessed on 1843 isolates prospectively collected by the French National Surveillance System and analysed in parallel using phenotypic reference methods, leading to nearly complete (1814; 98.4 %) agreement at species and infra-specific (biotype and serotype) levels. For 29 isolates, incorrect phenotypic assignments resulted from atypical biochemical characteristics or lack of phenotypic resolution. To provide an identification tool, a database of cgMLST profiles and reference taxonomic information has been made publicly accessible (https://bigsdb.pasteur.fr/yersinia). Genomic sequencing-based identification and subtyping of any Yersinia is a powerful and reliable novel approach to define the pathogenic potential of isolates of this medically important genus. ",
        "Spatial analysis of thickness changes in ten retinal layers of Alzheimer's disease patients based on optical coherence tomography. The retina is an attractive source of biomarkers since it shares many features with the brain. Thickness differences in 10 retinal layers between 19 patients with mild Alzheimer's disease (AD) and a control group of 24 volunteers were investigated. Retinal layers were automatically segmented and their thickness at each scanned point was measured, corrected for tilt and spatially normalized. When the mean thickness of entire layers was compared between patients and controls, only the outer segment layer of patients showed statistically significant thinning. However, when the layers were compared point-by point, patients showed statistically significant thinning in irregular regions of total retina and nerve fiber, ganglion cell, inner plexiform, inner nuclear and outer segment layers. Our method, based on random field theory, provides a precise delimitation of regions where total retina and each of its layers show a statistically significant thinning in AD patients. All layers, except inner nuclear and outer segments, showed thickened regions. New analytic methods have shown that thinned regions are interspersed with thickened ones in all layers, except inner nuclear and outer segments. Across different layers we found a statistically significant trend of the thinned regions to overlap and of the thickened ones to avoid overlapping. ",
        "Machine-Learning Prediction of Tumor Antigen Immunogenicity in the Selection of Therapeutic Epitopes. Current tumor neoantigen calling algorithms primarily rely on epitope/major histocompatibility complex (MHC) binding affinity predictions to rank and select for potential epitope targets. These algorithms do not predict for epitope immunogenicity using approaches modeled from tumor-specific antigen data. Here, we describe peptide-intrinsic biochemical features associated with neoantigen and minor histocompatibility mismatch antigen immunogenicity and present a gradient boosting algorithm for predicting tumor antigen immunogenicity. This algorithm was validated in two murine tumor models and demonstrated the capacity to select for therapeutically active antigens. Immune correlates of neoantigen immunogenicity were studied in a pan-cancer data set from The Cancer Genome Atlas and demonstrated an association between expression of immunogenic neoantigens and immunity in colon and lung adenocarcinomas. Lastly, we present evidence for expression of an out-of-frame neoantigen that was capable of driving antitumor cytotoxic T-cell responses. With the growing clinical importance of tumor vaccine therapies, our approach may allow for better selection of therapeutically relevant tumor-specific antigens, including nonclassic out-of-frame antigens capable of driving antitumor immunity.

        "Nuclear Glycogenolysis Modulates Histone Acetylation in Human Non-Small Cell Lung Cancers. Nuclear glycogen was first documented in the early 1940s, but its role in cellular physiology remained elusive. In this study, we utilized pure nuclei preparations and stable isotope tracers to define the origin and metabolic fate of nuclear glycogen. Herein, we describe a key function for nuclear glycogen in epigenetic regulation through compartmentalized pyruvate production and histone acetylation. This pathway is altered in human non-small cell lung cancers, as surgical specimens accumulate glycogen in the nucleus. We demonstrate that the decreased abundance of malin, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, impaired nuclear glycogenolysis by preventing the nuclear translocation of glycogen phosphorylase and causing nuclear glycogen accumulation. Re-introduction of malin in lung cancer cells restored nuclear glycogenolysis, increased histone acetylation, and decreased growth of cancer cells transplanted into mice. This study uncovers a previously unknown role for glycogen metabolism in the nucleus and elucidates another mechanism by which cellular metabolites control epigenetic regulation. ",
        "Working Memory Development and Motor Vehicle Crashes in Young Drivers. Importance: Adolescent drivers have the highest rate of motor vehicle crashes, and among equally novice drivers, crash risk is inversely age graded. Working memory (WM), crucial to driving hazard awareness, is also age graded, with ongoing development into late adolescence. Variability in WM capacity and growth trajectory positions WM as a candidate crash risk factor for study, clinical screening, and possible preventative intervention. Objective: To test the association between crashes and differential WM development. Design, Setting, and Participants: This prospective cohort study used data from a longitudinal cohort of 118 community youth in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Working memory and other risk factors were measured annually from age 11 to 13 years (prelicensure, in 2005) to 14 to 16 years (in 2009), and again at 18 to 20 years (in 2013). In 2015, a follow-up survey of driving experience identified 84 participants who had started driving. Latent growth curve modeling was used to examine the association between variability in the baseline (intercept) and developmental trajectory (slope) of WM and the crash outcome. Main Outcomes and Measures: Self-reported crashes were the primary outcome. Variability in the relative growth of WM development along with traits and behaviors associated with risky driving were assessed. Results: Of 84 participants (39 [46%] male; mean [SD] age, 20.46 [1.09] years), 25 (29.8%) reported they had been involved in at least 1 crash. Controlling for other crash risk factors, the model indicated that variation in the linear slope of WM growth was inversely associated with reporting a crash (b\u2009=\u2009-6.41; SE\u2009=\u20092.64; P\u2009=\u2009.02). Crashes were also associated with reckless driving behavior (b\u2009=\u20090.40; SE\u2009=\u20090.18; P\u2009=\u2009.03). Variation in the intercept of WM was not associated with crashes (b\u2009=\u2009-0.245; SE\u2009=\u20090.67; P\u2009=\u2009.72). Conclusions and Relevance: The results suggest that a relatively slower WM growth trajectory is associated with young driver crashes. Routine assessment of WM across adolescence may help to identify at-risk teen drivers and opportunities for providing adaptive interventions (eg, driving aids or training) that can address limitations in WM-related skills that are critical for safe driving.

        "Baseline human gut microbiota profile in healthy people and standard reporting template. A comprehensive knowledge of the types and ratios of microbes that inhabit the healthy human gut is necessary before any kind of pre-clinical or clinical study can be performed that attempts to alter the microbiome to treat a condition or improve therapy outcome. To address this need we present an innovative scalable comprehensive analysis workflow, a healthy human reference microbiome list and abundance profile (GutFeelingKB), and a novel Fecal Biome Population Report (FecalBiome) with clinical applicability. GutFeelingKB provides a list of 157 organisms (8 phyla, 18 classes, 23 orders, 38 families, 59 genera and 109 species) that forms the baseline biome and therefore can be used as healthy controls for studies related to dysbiosis. This list can be expanded to 863 organisms if closely related proteomes are considered. The incorporation of microbiome science into routine clinical practice necessitates a standard report for comparison of an individual's microbiome to the growing knowledgebase of \"normal\" microbiome data. The FecalBiome and the underlying technology of GutFeelingKB address this need. The knowledgebase can be useful to regulatory agencies for the assessment of fecal transplant and other microbiome products, as it contains a list of organisms from healthy individuals. In addition to the list of organisms and their abundances, this study also generated a collection of assembled contiguous sequences (contigs) of metagenomics dark matter. In this study, metagenomic dark matter represents sequences that cannot be mapped to any known sequence but can be assembled into contigs of 10,000 nucleotides or higher. These sequences can be used to create primers to study potential novel organisms. All data is freely available from https://hive.biochemistry.gwu.edu/gfkb and NCBI's Short Read Archive. ",
        "Mechanisms of reactivation of latent tuberculosis infection due to SIV coinfection. HIV is a major driver of tuberculosis (TB) reactivation. Depletion of CD4+ T cells is assumed to be the basis behind TB reactivation in individuals with latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) coinfected with HIV. Nonhuman primates (NHPs) coinfected with a mutant simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV\u0394GY) that does not cause depletion of tissue CD4+ T cells during infection failed to reactivate TB. To investigate the contribution of CD4+ T cell depletion relative to other mechanisms of SIV-induced reactivation of LTBI, we used CD4R1 antibody to deplete CD4+ T cells in animals with LTBI without lentiviral infection. The mere depletion of CD4+ T cells during LTBI was insufficient in generating reactivation of LTBI. Instead, direct cytopathic effects of SIV resulting in chronic immune activation, along with the altered effector T cell phenotypes and dysregulated T cell homeostasis, were likely mediators of reactivation of LTBI. These results revealed important implications for TB control in HIV-coinfected individuals. ",
        "Exploring use of unsupervised clustering to associate signaling profiles of GPCR ligands to clinical response. Signaling diversity of G protein-coupled (GPCR) ligands provides novel opportunities to develop more effective, better-tolerated therapeutics. Taking advantage of these opportunities requires identifying which effectors should be specifically activated or avoided so as to promote desired clinical responses and avoid side effects. However, identifying signaling profiles that support desired clinical outcomes remains challenging. This study describes signaling diversity of mu opioid receptor (MOR) ligands in terms of logistic and operational parameters for ten different in vitro readouts. It then uses unsupervised clustering of curve parameters to: classify MOR ligands according to similarities in type and magnitude of response, associate resulting ligand categories with frequency of undesired events reported to the pharmacovigilance program of the Food and Drug Administration and associate signals to side effects. The ability of the classification method to associate specific in vitro signaling profiles to clinically relevant responses was corroborated using \u03b22-adrenergic receptor ligands. ",
        "Microvesicle-Mediated Delivery of Minicircle DNA Results in Effective Gene-Directed Enzyme Prodrug Cancer Therapy. An emerging approach for cancer treatment employs the use of extracellular vesicles, specifically exosomes and microvesicles, as delivery vehicles. We previously demonstrated that microvesicles can functionally deliver plasmid DNA to cells and showed that plasmid size and sequence, in part, determine the delivery efficiency. In this study, delivery vehicles comprised of microvesicles loaded with engineered minicircle (MC) DNA that encodes prodrug converting enzymes developed as a cancer therapy in mammary carcinoma models. We demonstrated that MCs can be loaded into shed microvesicles with greater efficiency than their parental plasmid counterparts and that microvesicle-mediated MC delivery led to significantly higher and more prolonged transgene expression in recipient cells than microvesicles loaded with the parental plasmid. Microvesicles loaded with MCs encoding a thymidine kinase (TK)/nitroreductase (NTR) fusion protein produced prolonged TK-NTR expression in mammary carcinoma cells. In vivo delivery of TK-NTR and administration of prodrugs led to the effective killing of both targeted cells and surrounding tumor cells via TK-NTR-mediated conversion of codelivered prodrugs into active cytotoxic agents. In vivo evaluation of the bystander effect in mouse models demonstrated that for effective therapy, at least 1% of tumor cells need to be delivered with TK-NTR-encoding MCs. These results suggest that MC delivery via microvesicles can mediate gene transfer to an extent that enables effective prodrug conversion and tumor cell death such that it comprises a promising approach to cancer therapy.

        "Energetic costs regulated by cell mechanics and confinement are predictive of migration path during decision-making. Cell migration during the invasion-metastasis cascade requires cancer cells to navigate a spatially complex microenvironment that presents directional choices to migrating cells. Here, we investigate cellular energetics during migration decision-making in confined spaces. Theoretical and experimental data show that energetic costs for migration through confined spaces are mediated by a balance between cell and matrix compliance as well as the degree of spatial confinement to direct decision-making. Energetic costs, driven by the cellular work needed to generate force for matrix displacement, increase with increasing cell stiffness, matrix stiffness, and degree of spatial confinement, limiting migration. By assessing energetic costs between possible migration paths, we can predict the probability of migration choice. Our findings indicate that motility in confined spaces imposes high energetic demands on migrating cells, and cells migrate in the direction of least confinement to minimize energetic costs. Therefore, therapeutically targeting metabolism may limit cancer cell migration and metastasis. ",
        "\u03b1-Tocopherol preserves cardiac function by reducing oxidative stress and inflammation in ischemia/reperfusion injury. OBJECTIVE: Myocardial infarction (MI) is a leading cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide and new treatment strategies are highly sought-after. Paradoxically, reperfusion of the ischemic myocardium, as achieved with early percutaneous intervention, results in substantial damage to the heart (ischemia/reperfusion injury) caused by cell death due to aggravated inflammatory and oxidative stress responses. Chronic therapy with vitamin E is not effective in reducing the cardiovascular event rate, presumably through failing to reduce atherosclerotic plaque instability. Notably, acute treatment with vitamin E in patients suffering a MI has not been systematically investigated. METHODS AND RESULTS: We applied alpha-tocopherol (\u03b1-TOH), the strongest anti-oxidant form of vitamin E, in murine cardiac ischemia/reperfusion injury induced by ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery for 60\u202fmin. \u03b1-TOH significantly reduced infarct size, restored cardiac function as measured by ejection fraction, fractional shortening, cardiac output, and stroke volume, and prevented pathological changes as assessed by state-of-the-art strain and strain-rate analysis. Cardioprotective mechanisms identified, include a decreased infiltration of neutrophils into cardiac tissue and a systemic anti-inflammatory shift from Ly6Chigh to Ly6Clow monocytes. Furthermore, we found a reduction in myeloperoxidase expression and activity, as well as a decrease in reactive oxygen species and the lipid peroxidation markers phosphatidylcholine (PC) (16:0)-9-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid (HODE) and PC(16:0)-13-HODE) within the infarcted tissue. CONCLUSION: Overall, \u03b1-TOH inhibits ischemia/reperfusion injury-induced oxidative and inflammatory responses, and ultimately preserves cardiac function. Therefore, our study provides a strong incentive to test vitamin E as an acute therapy in patients suffering a MI. ",
        "Elastase 3B mutation links to familial pancreatitis with diabetes and pancreatic adenocarcinoma. While improvements in genetic analysis have greatly enhanced our understanding of the mechanisms behind pancreatitis, it continues to afflict many families for whom the hereditary factors remain unknown. Recent evaluation of a patient with a strong family history of pancreatitis sparked us to reexamine a large kindred originally reported over 50 years ago with an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern of chronic pancreatitis, diabetes and pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Whole exome sequencing analysis identified a rare missense mutation in the gene encoding pancreas-specific protease Elastase 3B (CELA3B) that cosegregates with disease. Studies of the mutant protein in vitro, in cell lines and in CRISPR-Cas9 engineered mice indicate that this mutation causes translational upregulation of CELA3B, which upon secretion and activation by trypsin leads to uncontrolled proteolysis and recurrent pancreatitis. Although lesions in several other pancreatitic proteases have been previously linked to hereditary pancreatitis, this is the first known instance of a mutation in CELA3B and a defect in translational control contributing to this disease.

        "The Neuropeptide Galanin Is Required for Homeostatic Rebound Sleep following Increased Neuronal Activity. Sleep pressure increases during wake and dissipates during sleep, but the molecules and neurons that measure homeostatic sleep pressure remain poorly understood. We present a pharmacological assay in larval zebrafish that generates short-term increases in wakefulness followed by sustained rebound sleep after washout. The intensity of global neuronal activity during drug-induced wakefulness predicted the amount of subsequent rebound sleep. Whole-brain mapping with the neuronal activity marker phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (pERK) identified preoptic Galanin (Galn)-expressing neurons as selectively active during rebound sleep, and the relative induction of galn transcripts was predictive of total rebound sleep time. Galn is required for sleep homeostasis, as galn mutants almost completely lacked rebound sleep following both pharmacologically induced neuronal activity and physical sleep deprivation. These results suggest that Galn plays a key role in responding to sleep pressure signals derived from neuronal activity and functions as an output arm of the vertebrate sleep homeostat. ",

        "Longitudinal Changes in Measures of Body Fat and Diet Among Adult Tsimane' Forager-Horticulturalists of Bolivia, 2002-2010. OBJECTIVE: This study examined changes in body fat and diet among Tsimane' forager-horticulturalists and assessed how dietary shifts relate to increases in adiposity between 2002 and 2010. METHODS: Longitudinal anthropometric and household-level dietary recall data from 365 men and 339 women aged \u226520\u00a0years in the Tsimane' Amazonian Panel Study were used. Multilevel mixed-effects models estimated how BMI, body fat percentage, waist circumference, skinfolds, and fat-free mass relate to household consumption of crops, hunted or fished foods, domesticated animal products, cooking oil, and refined grains and sugar. RESULTS: Women's prevalence of overweight and obesity increased from 22.6% and 2.4% in 2002 to 28.8% and 8.9% in 2010, respectively, and BMI increased by 0.60%\u2009\u00b1\u20090.12% per year (P\u2009<\u20090.001). Increases in fat-free mass accounted for some of this observed weight gain among women. Men's prevalence of overweight and obesity increased from 16.2% and 0.7% to 25.0% and 2.2%, respectively, and BMI increased by 0.22%\u2009\u00b1\u20090.09% per year (P\u2009=\u20090.009). Household use of cooking oil increased and was positively associated with female BMI. Consumption of domesticated animal products did not change significantly but was positively associated with female BMI and male waist circumference. CONCLUSIONS: Even small increases in energy-dense market-based foods can contribute to adiposity gains among a moderately active, subsistence-based population. ",
        "Machine Learning to Predict the Risk of Incident Heart Failure Hospitalization Among Patients With Diabetes: The WATCH-DM Risk Score. OBJECTIVE: To develop and validate a novel, machine learning-derived model to predict the risk of heart failure (HF) among patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Using data from 8,756 patients free at baseline of HF, with <10% missing data, and enrolled in the Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD) trial, we used random survival forest (RSF) methods, a nonparametric decision tree machine learning approach, to identify predictors of incident HF. The RSF model was externally validated in a cohort of individuals with T2DM using the Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial (ALLHAT). RESULTS: Over a median follow-up of 4.9 years, 319 patients (3.6%) developed incident HF. The RSF models demonstrated better discrimination than the best performing Cox-based method (C-index 0.77 [95% CI 0.75-0.80] vs. 0.73 [0.70-0.76] respectively) and had acceptable calibration (Hosmer-Lemeshow statistic \u03c72 = 9.63, P = 0.29) in the internal validation data set. From the identified predictors, an integer-based risk score for 5-year HF incidence was created: the WATCH-DM (Weight [BMI], Age, hyperTension, Creatinine, HDL-C, Diabetes control [fasting plasma glucose], QRS Duration, MI, and CABG) risk score. Each 1-unit increment in the risk score was associated with a 24% higher relative risk of HF within 5 years. The cumulative 5-year incidence of HF increased in a graded fashion from 1.1% in quintile 1 (WATCH-DM score \u22647) to 17.4% in quintile 5 (WATCH-DM score \u226514). In the external validation cohort, the RSF-based risk prediction model and the WATCH-DM risk score performed well with good discrimination (C-index = 0.74 and 0.70, respectively), acceptable calibration (P \u22650.20 for both), and broad risk stratification (5-year HF risk range from 2.5 to 18.7% across quintiles 1-5). CONCLUSIONS: We developed and validated a novel, machine learning-derived risk score that integrates readily available clinical, laboratory, and electrocardiographic variables to predict the risk of HF among outpatients with T2DM.

        "A cell topography-based mechanism for ligand discrimination by the T cell receptor. The T cell receptor (TCR) initiates the elimination of pathogens and tumors by T cells. To avoid damage to the host, the receptor must be capable of discriminating between wild-type and mutated self and nonself peptide ligands presented by host cells. Exactly how the TCR does this is unknown. In resting T cells, the TCR is largely unphosphorylated due to the dominance of phosphatases over the kinases expressed at the cell surface. However, when agonist peptides are presented to the TCR by major histocompatibility complex proteins expressed by antigen-presenting cells (APCs), very fast receptor triggering, i.e., TCR phosphorylation, occurs. Recent work suggests that this depends on the local exclusion of the phosphatases from regions of contact of the T cells with the APCs. Here, we developed and tested a quantitative treatment of receptor triggering reliant only on TCR dwell time in phosphatase-depleted cell contacts constrained in area by cell topography. Using the model and experimentally derived parameters, we found that ligand discrimination likely depends crucially on individual contacts being \u223c200 nm in radius, matching the dimensions of the surface protrusions used by T cells to interrogate their targets. The model not only correctly predicted the relative signaling potencies of known agonists and nonagonists but also achieved this in the absence of kinetic proofreading. Our work provides a simple, quantitative, and predictive molecular framework for understanding why TCR triggering is so selective and fast and reveals that, for some receptors, cell topography likely influences signaling outcomes.

        "Highly selective detection of methanol over ethanol by a handheld gas sensor. Methanol poisoning causes blindness, organ failure or even death when recognized too late. Currently, there is no methanol detector for quick diagnosis by breath analysis or for screening of laced beverages. Typically, chemical sensors cannot distinguish methanol from the much higher ethanol background. Here, we present an inexpensive and handheld sensor for highly selective methanol detection. It consists of a separation column (Tenax) separating methanol from interferants like ethanol, acetone or hydrogen, as in gas chromatography, and a chemoresistive gas sensor (Pd-doped SnO2 nanoparticles) to quantify the methanol concentration. This way, methanol is measured within 2\u2009min from 1 to 1000 ppm without interference of much higher ethanol levels (up to 62,000 ppm). As a proof-of-concept, we reliably measure methanol concentrations in spiked breath samples and liquor. This could enable the realization of highly selective sensors in emerging applications such as breath analysis or air quality monitoring. ",
        "Touchpoints - Opportunities to predict and prevent opioid overdose: A cohort study. BACKGROUND: Medical care, public health, and criminal justice systems encounters could serve as touchpoints to identify and intervene with individuals at high-risk of opioid overdose death. The relative risk of opioid overdose death and proportion of deaths that could be averted at such touchpoints are unknown. METHODS: We used 8 individually linked data sets from Massachusetts government agencies to perform a retrospective cohort study of Massachusetts residents ages 11 and older. For each month in 2014, we identified past 12-month exposure to 4 opioid prescription touchpoints (high dosage, benzodiazepine co-prescribing, multiple prescribers, or multiple pharmacies) and 4 critical encounter touchpoints (opioid detoxification, nonfatal opioid overdose, injection-related infection, and release from incarceration). The outcome was opioid overdose death. We calculated Standardized Mortality Ratios (SMRs) and Population Attributable Fractions (PAFs) associated with touchpoint exposure. RESULTS: The cohort consisted of 6,717,390 person-years of follow-up with 1315 opioid overdose deaths. We identified past 12-month exposure to any touchpoint in 2.7% of person-months and for 51.8% of opioid overdose deaths. Opioid overdose SMRs were 12.6 (95% CI: 11.1, 14.1) for opioid prescription and 68.4 (95% CI: 62.4, 74.5) for critical encounter touchpoints. Fatal opioid overdose PAFs were 0.19 (95% CI: 0.17, 0.21) for opioid prescription and 0.37 (95% CI: 0.34, 0.39) for critical encounter touchpoints. CONCLUSIONS: Using public health data, we found eight candidate touchpoints were associated with increased risk of fatal opioid overdose, and collectively identified more than half of opioid overdose decedents. These touchpoints are potential targets for development of overdose prevention interventions. ",
        "Four nights of sleep restriction suppress the postprandial lipemic response and decrease satiety. Chronic sleep restriction, or inadequate sleep, is associated with increased risk of cardiometabolic disease. Laboratory studies demonstrate that sleep restriction causes impaired whole-body insulin sensitivity and glucose disposal. Evidence suggests that inadequate sleep also impairs adipose tissue insulin sensitivity and the NEFA rebound during intravenous glucose tolerance tests, yet no studies have examined the effects of sleep restriction on high-fat meal lipemia. We assessed the effect of 5 h time in bed (TIB) per night for four consecutive nights on postprandial lipemia following a standardized high-fat dinner (HFD). Furthermore, we assessed whether one night of recovery sleep (10 h TIB) was sufficient to restore postprandial metabolism to baseline. We found that postprandial triglyceride (TG) area under the curve was suppressed by sleep restriction (P = 0.01), but returned to baseline values following one night of recovery. Sleep restriction decreased NEFAs throughout the HFD (P = 0.02) and NEFAs remained suppressed in the recovery condition (P = 0.04). Sleep restriction also decreased participant-reported fullness or satiety (P = 0.03), and decreased postprandial interleukin-6 (P < 0.01). Our findings indicate that four nights of 5 h TIB per night impair postprandial lipemia and that one night of recovery sleep may be adequate for recovery of TG metabolism, but not for markers of adipocyte function.

        "Microbial Metabolism Modulates Antibiotic Susceptibility within the Murine Gut Microbiome. Although antibiotics disturb the structure of the gut microbiota, factors that modulate these perturbations are poorly understood. Bacterial metabolism is an important regulator of susceptibility in\u00a0vitro and likely plays a large role within the host. We applied a metagenomic and metatranscriptomic approach to link antibiotic-induced taxonomic and transcriptional responses within the murine microbiome. We found that antibiotics significantly alter the expression of key metabolic pathways at the whole-community and single-species levels. Notably, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, which blooms in response to amoxicillin, upregulated polysaccharide utilization. In\u00a0vitro, we found that the sensitivity of this bacterium to amoxicillin was elevated by glucose and reduced by polysaccharides. Accordingly, we observed that dietary composition affected the abundance and expansion of B. thetaiotaomicron, as well as the extent of microbiome disruption with amoxicillin. Our work indicates that the metabolic environment of the microbiome plays a role in the response of this community to antibiotics. ",
        "Superiority of Out-of-Office Blood Pressure for Predicting Hypertensive Heart Disease in Non-Hispanic Black Adults. Black Americans suffer disproportionately from hypertension and hypertensive heart disease. Out-of-office blood pressure (BP) is more predictive for cardiovascular complications than clinic BP; however, the relative abilities of clinic and out-of-office BP to predict left ventricular hypertrophy in black and white adults have not been established. Thus, we aimed to compare associations of out-of-office and clinic BP measurement with left ventricular hypertrophy by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging among non-Hispanic black and white adults. In this cross-sectional study, 1262 black and 927 white participants of the Dallas Heart Study ages 30 to 64 years underwent assessment of standardized clinic and out-of-office (research staff-obtained) BP and left ventricular mass index. In multivariable-adjusted analyses of treated and untreated participants, out-of-office BP was a stronger determinant of left ventricular hypertrophy than clinic BP (odds ratio per 10 mm\u2009Hg, 1.48; 95% CI, 1.34-1.64 for out-of-office systolic BP and 1.15 [1.04-1.28] for clinic systolic BP; 1.71 [1.43-2.05] for out-of-office diastolic BP, and 1.03 [0.86-1.24] for clinic diastolic BP). Non-Hispanic black race/ethnicity, treatment status, and lower left ventricular ejection fraction were also independent determinants of hypertrophy. Among treated Blacks, the differential association between out-of-office and clinic BP with hypertrophy was more pronounced than in treated white or untreated participants. In conclusion, protocol-driven supervised out-of-office BP monitoring provides important information that cannot be gleaned from clinic BP assessment alone. Our results underscore the importance of hypertension management programs outside the medical office to prevent hypertensive heart disease, especially in high-risk black adults.

        "Gene-Based Approaches to Inherited Neurometabolic Diseases. In the last decade, the gene therapy (GT) field experienced a renaissance, thanks to crucial understandings and innovations in vector design, stem cell manipulation, conditioning protocols, and cell/vector delivery. These efforts were successfully coupled with unprecedented clinical results of the trials employing the newly developed technology and with the novel establishment of academic-industrial partnerships. A renewed and strengthened interest is rising in the development of gene-based approaches for inherited neurometabolic disorders with severe neurological involvement. Inherited metabolic disorders are monogenetic diseases caused by enzymatic or structural deficiencies affecting the lysosomal or peroxisomal metabolic activity. The metabolic defect can primarily affect the central nervous system, leading to neuronal death, microglial activation, inflammatory demyelination, and axonal degeneration. This review provides an overview of the GT strategies currently under clinical investigation for neurometabolic lysosomal and peroxisomal storage diseases, such as adrenoleukodystrophy and metachromatic leukodystrophy, as well as novel emerging indications such as mucopolysaccharidoses, gangliosidoses, and neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses, with a comprehensive elucidation of the main features and mechanisms at the basis of a successful GT approach for these devastating diseases.

        "Adult bone marrow progenitors become decidual cells and contribute to embryo implantation and pregnancy. Decidua is a transient uterine tissue shared by mammals with hemochorial placenta and is essential for pregnancy. The decidua is infiltrated by many immune cells promoting pregnancy. Adult bone marrow (BM)-derived cells (BMDCs) differentiate into rare populations of nonhematopoietic endometrial cells in the uterus. However, whether adult BMDCs become nonhematopoietic decidual cells and contribute functionally to pregnancy is unknown. Here, we show that pregnancy mobilizes mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) to the circulation and that pregnancy induces considerable adult BMDCs recruitment to decidua, where some differentiate into nonhematopoietic prolactin-expressing decidual cells. To explore the functional importance of nonhematopoietic BMDCs to pregnancy, we used Homeobox a11 (Hoxa11)-deficient mice, having endometrial stromal-specific defects precluding decidualization and successful pregnancy. Hoxa11 expression in BM is restricted to nonhematopoietic cells. BM transplant (BMT) from wild-type (WT) to Hoxa11-/- mice results in stromal expansion, gland formation, and marked decidualization otherwise absent in Hoxa11-/- mice. Moreover, in Hoxa11+/- mice, which have increased pregnancy losses, BMT from WT donors leads to normalized uterine expression of numerous decidualization-related genes and rescue of pregnancy loss. Collectively, these findings reveal that adult BMDCs have a previously unrecognized nonhematopoietic physiologic contribution to decidual stroma, thereby playing important roles in decidualization and pregnancy.

        "A contractile injection system stimulates tubeworm metamorphosis by translocating a proteinaceous effector. The swimming larvae of many marine animals identify a location on the sea floor to undergo metamorphosis based on the presence of specific bacteria. Although this microbe-animal interaction is critical for the life cycles of diverse marine animals, what types of biochemical cues from bacteria that induce metamorphosis has been a mystery. Metamorphosis of larvae of the tubeworm Hydroides elegans is induced by arrays of phage tail-like contractile injection systems, which are released by the bacterium Pseudoalteromonas luteoviolacea. Here we identify the novel effector protein Mif1. By cryo-electron tomography imaging and functional assays, we observe Mif1 as cargo inside the tube lumen of the contractile injection system and show that the mif1 gene is required for inducing metamorphosis. Purified Mif1 is sufficient for triggering metamorphosis when electroporated into tubeworm larvae. Our results indicate that the delivery of protein effectors by contractile injection systems may orchestrate microbe-animal interactions in diverse contexts. ",
        "Genomically informed small-molecule drugs overcome resistance to a sustained-release formulation of an engineered death receptor agonist in patient-derived tumor models. Extrinsic pathway agonists have failed repeatedly in the clinic for three core reasons: Inefficient ligand-induced receptor multimerization, poor pharmacokinetic properties, and tumor intrinsic resistance. Here, we address these factors by (i) using a highly potent death receptor agonist (DRA), (ii) developing an injectable depot for sustained DRA delivery, and (iii) leveraging a CRISPR-Cas9 knockout screen in DRA-resistant colorectal cancer (CRC) cells to identify functional drivers of resistance. Pharmacological blockade of XIAP and BCL-XL by targeted small-molecule drugs strongly enhanced the antitumor activity of DRA in CRC cell lines. Recombinant fusion of the DRA to a thermally responsive elastin-like polypeptide (ELP) creates a gel-like depot upon subcutaneous injection that abolishes tumors in DRA-sensitive Colo205 mouse xenografts. Combination of ELPdepot-DRA with BCL-XL and/or XIAP inhibitors led to tumor growth inhibition and extended survival in DRA-resistant patient-derived xenografts. This strategy provides a precision medicine approach to overcome similar challenges with other protein-based cancer therapies. ",
        "Relearning functional and symmetric walking after stroke using a wearable device: a feasibility study. BACKGROUND: Gait impairment is a common consequence of stroke and typically involves a hemiparetic or asymmetric walking pattern. Asymmetric gait patterns are correlated with decreased gait velocity and efficiency as well as increased susceptibility to serious falls and injuries. RESEARCH QUESTION: This paper presents an innovative device worn on a foot for gait rehabilitation post stroke. The device generates a backward motion to the foot, which is designed to exaggerate the existing step length asymmetry while walking over ground. We hypothesize this motion will decrease gait asymmetry and improve functional walking in individuals with chronic stroke. METHODS: Six participants with chronic stroke, more than one year post stroke, received four weeks of gait training with three sessions per week. Each session included 30 min of walking over ground using the wearable device. Gait symmetry and functional walking were assessed before and after training. RESULTS: All participants improved step length symmetry, and four participants improved double limb support symmetry. All participants improved on all three functional outcomes (gait velocity, Timed Up and Go Test, and 6-Minute Walk Test), and five participants improved beyond the minimal detectable change or meaningful change in at least one functional outcome. CONCLUSION: The results indicate that the presented device may help improve stroke patients' walking ability and warrant further study. A gait training approach using this new device may enable and expand long-term continuous gait rehabilitation outside the clinic following stroke. TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT02185404.

        "Tumor exosome-based nanoparticles are efficient drug carriers for chemotherapy. Developing biomimetic nanoparticles without loss of the integrity of proteins remains a major challenge in cancer chemotherapy. Here, we develop a biocompatible tumor-cell-exocytosed exosome-biomimetic porous silicon nanoparticles (PSiNPs) as drug carrier for targeted cancer chemotherapy. Exosome-sheathed doxorubicin-loaded PSiNPs (DOX@E-PSiNPs), generated by exocytosis of the endocytosed DOX-loaded PSiNPs from tumor cells, exhibit enhanced tumor accumulation, extravasation from blood vessels and penetration into deep tumor parenchyma following intravenous administration. In addition, DOX@E-PSiNPs, regardless of their origin, possess significant cellular uptake and cytotoxicity in both bulk cancer cells and cancer stem cells (CSCs). These properties endow DOX@E-PSiNPs with great in vivo enrichment in total tumor cells and side population cells with features of CSCs, resulting in anticancer activity and CSCs reduction in subcutaneous, orthotopic and metastatic tumor models. These results provide a proof-of-concept for the use of exosome-biomimetic nanoparticles exocytosed from tumor cells as a promising drug carrier for efficient cancer chemotherapy. ",
        "Mechanical fatigue of human red blood cells. Fatigue arising from cyclic straining is a key factor in the degradation of properties of engineered materials and structures. Fatigue can also induce damage and fracture in natural biomaterials, such as bone, and in synthetic biomaterials used in implant devices. However, the mechanisms by which mechanical fatigue leads to deterioration of physical properties and contributes to the onset and progression of pathological states in biological cells have hitherto not been systematically explored. Here we present a general method that employs amplitude-modulated electrodeformation and microfluidics for characterizing mechanical fatigue in single biological cells. This method is capable of subjecting cells to static loads for prolonged periods of time or to large numbers of controlled mechanical fatigue cycles. We apply the method to measure the systematic changes in morphological and biomechanical characteristics of healthy human red blood cells (RBCs) and their membrane mechanical properties. Under constant amplitude cyclic tensile deformation, RBCs progressively lose their ability to stretch with increasing fatigue cycles. Our results further indicate that loss of deformability of RBCs during cyclic deformation is much faster than that under static deformation at the same maximum load over the same accumulated loading time. Such fatigue-induced deformability loss is more pronounced at higher amplitudes of cyclic deformation. These results uniquely establish the important role of mechanical fatigue in influencing physical properties of biological cells. They further provide insights into the accumulated membrane damage during blood circulation, paving the way for further investigations of the eventual failure of RBCs causing hemolysis in various hemolytic pathologies.

        "Depletion of Caveolin-1 in Type 2 Diabetes Model Induces Alzheimer's Disease Pathology Precursors. Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a risk factor for the development of late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the mechanism underlying the development of late-onset AD is largely unknown. Here we show that levels of the endothelial-enriched protein caveolin-1 (Cav-1) are reduced in the brains of T2DM patients compared with healthy aging, and inversely correlated with levels of \u03b2-amyloid (A\u03b2). Depletion of Cav-1 is recapitulated in the brains of db/db (Leprdb ) diabetic mice and corresponds with recognition memory deficits as well as the upregulation of amyloid precursor protein (APP), BACE-1, a trending increase in \u03b2-amyloid A\u03b242/40 ratio and hyperphosphorylated tau (p-tau) species. Importantly, we show that restoration of Cav-1 levels in the brains of male db/db mice using adenovirus overexpressing Cav-1 (AAV-Cav-1) rescues learning and memory deficits and reduces pathology (i.e., APP, BACE-1 and p-tau levels). Knocking down Cav-1 using shRNA in HEK cells expressing the familial AD-linked APPswe mutant variant upregulates APP, APP carboxyl terminal fragments, and A\u03b2 levels. In turn, rescue of Cav-1 levels restores APP metabolism. Together, these results suggest that Cav-1 regulates APP metabolism, and that depletion of Cav-1 in T2DM promotes the amyloidogenic processing of APP and hyperphosphorylation of tau. This may suggest that depletion of Cav-1 in T2DM underlies, at least in part, the development of AD and imply that restoration of Cav-1 may be a therapeutic target for diabetic-associated sporadic AD.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT More than 95% of the Alzheimer's patients have the sporadic late-onset form (LOAD). The cause for late-onset Alzheimer's disease is unknown. Patients with Type 2 diabetes mellitus have considerably higher incidence of cognitive decline and AD compared with the general population, suggesting a common mechanism. Here we show that the expression of caveolin-1 (Cav-1) is reduced in the brain in Type 2 diabetes mellitus. In turn, reduced Cav-1 levels induce AD-associated neuropathology and learning and memory deficits. Restoration of Cav-1 levels rescues these deficits. This study unravels signals underlying LOAD and suggests that restoration of Cav-1 may be an effective therapeutic target. ",
        "Informal genomic surveillance of regional distribution of Salmonella Typhi genotypes and antimicrobial resistance via returning travellers. Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi (S. Typhi) is the causative agent of typhoid fever, a systemic human infection with a burden exceeding 20 million cases each year that occurs disproportionately among children in low and middle income countries. Antimicrobial therapy is the mainstay for treatment, but resistance to multiple agents is common. Here we report genotypes and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) determinants detected from routine whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of 533 S. Typhi isolates referred to Public Health England between April 2014 and March 2017, 488 (92%) of which had accompanying patient travel information obtained via an enhanced surveillance questionnaire. The majority of cases involved S. Typhi 4.3.1 (H58) linked with travel to South Asia (59%). Travel to East and West Africa were associated with genotypes 4.3.1 and 3.3.1, respectively. Point mutations in the quinolone resistance determining region (QRDR), associated with reduced susceptibility to fluoroquinolones, were very common (85% of all cases) but the frequency varied significantly by region of travel: 95% in South Asia, 43% in East Africa, 27% in West Africa. QRDR triple mutants, resistant to ciprofloxacin, were restricted to 4.3.1 lineage II and associated with travel to India, accounting for 23% of cases reporting travel to the country. Overall 24% of isolates were MDR, however the frequency varied significantly by region and country of travel: 27% in West Africa, 52% in East Africa, 55% in Pakistan, 24% in Bangladesh, 3% in India. MDR determinants were plasmid-borne (IncHI1 PST2 plasmids) in S. Typhi 3.1.1 linked to West Africa, but in all other regions MDR was chromosomally integrated in 4.3.1 lineage I. We propose that routine WGS data from travel-associated cases in industrialised countries could serve as informal sentinel AMR genomic surveillance data for countries where WGS is not available or routinely performed.

        "Melancholy or mahjong? Diversity, frequency, type, and rural-urban divide of social participation and depression in middle- and old-aged Chinese: A fixed-effects analysis. The potential benefit of social participation (SP) to one's mental health has been widely acknowledged. Nevertheless, the specific type and amount of SP that is associated with improved depressive symptoms in middle- and old-aged Chinese awaits further investigation. This study aimed to understand the patterns of depression and SP by comparing urban vs rural China, and according to which, measure the associations between changes in SP and that in depressive symptoms. A total of 10,988 community residents aged 45 years and above were selected from wave 1 (2011), wave 2 (2013), and wave 4 (2015) of the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS), a nationally representative survey. The fixed-effects analysis was used to explore the association between the changes in diversity, frequency, and type of SP and the changes in depressive symptoms. The results indicated that rural respondents suffered from a significantly higher risk of depression and took less SP than their urban counterparts. Transitioning from no SP to 1 or more types of SP or to a once a week or higher frequency was associated with a decline in depressive symptoms. For urban respondents, playing mah-jong or cards and joining sports or social clubs predicted a decline in depressive symptoms. For rural residents, interacting with friends regularly was associated with fewer depressive symptoms. In conclusion, more diverse and higher frequency of SP was associated with better mental health, while the social significance of SP varied across different types of SP and between rural and urban areas.

        "Social Isolation in Adolescence Disrupts Cortical Development and Goal-Dependent Decision-Making in Adulthood, Despite Social Reintegration. The social environment influences neurodevelopment. Investigations using rodents to study this phenomenon commonly isolate subjects, then assess neurobehavioral consequences while animals are still isolated. This approach precludes one from dissociating the effects of on-going versus prior isolation, hindering our complete understanding of the consequences of social experience during particular developmental periods. Here, we socially isolated adolescent mice from postnatal day (P)31 to P60, then re-housed them into social groups. We tested their ability to select actions based on expected outcomes using multiple reinforcer devaluation and instrumental contingency degradation techniques. Social isolation in adolescence (but not adulthood) weakened instrumental response updating, causing mice to defer to habit-like behaviors. Habit biases were associated with glucocorticoid insufficiency in adolescence, oligodendrocyte marker loss throughout cortico-striatal regions, and dendritic spine and synaptic marker excess in the adult orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). Artificial, chemogenetic stimulation of the ventrolateral OFC in typical, healthy mice recapitulated response biases following isolation, causing habit-like behaviors. Meanwhile, correcting dendritic architecture by inhibiting the cytoskeletal regulatory protein ROCK remedied instrumental response updating defects in socially isolated mice. Our findings suggest that adolescence is a critical period during which social experience optimizes one's ability to seek and attain goals later in life. Age-typical dendritic spine elimination appears to be an essential factor, and in its absence, organisms may defer to habit-based behaviors. ",
        "MANET 3.0: Hierarchy and modularity in evolving metabolic networks. Enzyme recruitment is a fundamental evolutionary driver of modern metabolism. We see evidence of recruitment at work in the metabolic Molecular Ancestry Networks (MANET) database, an online resource that integrates data from KEGG, SCOP and structural phylogenomic reconstruction. The database, which was introduced in 2006, traces the deep history of the structural domains of enzymes in metabolic pathways. Here we release version 3.0 of MANET, which updates data from KEGG and SCOP, links enzyme and PDB information with PDBsum, and traces evolutionary information of domains defined at fold family level of SCOP classification in metabolic subnetwork diagrams. Compared to SCOP folds used in the previous versions, fold families are cohesive units of functional similarity that are highly conserved at sequence level and offer a 10-fold increase of data entries. We surveyed enzymatic, functional and catalytic site distributions among superkingdoms showing that ancient enzymatic innovations followed a biphasic temporal pattern of diversification typical of module innovation. We grouped enzymatic activities of MANET into a hierarchical system of subnetworks and mesonetworks matching KEGG classification. The evolutionary growth of these modules of metabolic activity was studied using bipartite networks and their one-mode projections at enzyme, subnetwork and mesonetwork levels of organization. Evolving metabolic networks revealed patterns of enzyme sharing that transcended mesonetwork boundaries and supported the patchwork model of metabolic evolution. We also explored the scale-freeness, randomness and small-world properties of evolving networks as possible organizing principles of network growth and diversification. The network structure shows an increase in hierarchical modularity and scale-free behavior as metabolic networks unfold in evolutionary time. Remarkably, this evolutionary constraint on structure was stronger at lower levels of metabolic organization. Evolving metabolic structure reveals a 'principle of granularity', an evolutionary increase of the cohesiveness of lower-level parts of a hierarchical system.

        "Sociodemographic, Clinical, and Therapeutic Aspects of Penitentiary Psychiatric Consultation: Toward Integration Into the General Mental Health Services. The characteristics of mental disorders, as well as deficiencies in their treatment, must be properly defined. This was a prospective, longitudinal, observational study, in which all men referred to a penitentiary psychiatric consultation of three penitentiary centers in Spain were invited to participate. Those who consented to participation (1328) were interviewed at the baseline timepoint and at intervals for up to 3\u00a0years. The presence of mental disorders was high: 68.2% had a cluster B personality disorder, 14% had an affective and/or anxiety disorders, 13% had schizophrenia, and over 80% had a dual disorder. Polypharmacy was the norm. Moreover, the health care received in prison did not match that provided in the community in terms of quantity and quality. These results should help to facilitate the design of mental healthcare provision for prisoners, focusing on both the most frequent patient profiles and equality of care. ",
        "\u03b2-Methylamino-L-alanine substitution of serine in SOD1 suggests a direct role in ALS etiology. Exposure to the environmental toxin \u03b2-methylamino-L-alanine (BMAA) is linked to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), but its disease-promoting mechanism remains unknown. We propose that incorporation of BMAA into the ALS-linked protein Cu,Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD1) upon translation promotes protein misfolding and aggregation, which has been linked to ALS onset and progression. Using molecular simulation and predictive energetic computation, we demonstrate that substituting any serine with BMAA in SOD1 results in structural destabilization and aberrant dynamics, promoting neurotoxic SOD1 aggregation. We propose that translational incorporation of BMAA into SOD1 is directly responsible for its toxicity in neurodegeneration, and BMAA modification of SOD1 may serve as a biomarker of ALS. ",
        "Composition and structure of synaptic ectosomes exporting antigen receptor linked to functional CD40 ligand from helper T cells. Planar supported lipid bilayers (PSLB) presenting T cell receptor (TCR) ligands and ICAM-1 induce budding of extracellular microvesicles enriched in functional TCR, defined here as synaptic ectosomes (SE), from helper T cells. SE bind peptide-MHC directly exporting TCR into the synaptic cleft, but incorporation of other effectors is unknown. Here, we utilized bead supported lipid bilayers (BSLB) to capture SE from single immunological synapses (IS), determined SE composition by immunofluorescence flow cytometry and enriched SE for proteomic analysis by particle sorting. We demonstrate selective enrichment of CD40L and ICOS in SE in response to addition of CD40 and ICOSL, respectively, to SLB presenting TCR ligands and ICAM-1. SE are enriched in tetraspanins, BST-2, TCR signaling and ESCRT proteins. Super-resolution microscopy demonstrated that CD40L is present in microclusters within CD81 defined SE that are spatially segregated from TCR/ICOS/BST-2. CD40L+ SE retain the capacity to induce dendritic cell maturation and cytokine production. ",
        "Microbiome composition shapes rapid genomic adaptation of Drosophila melanogaster. Population genomic data has revealed patterns of genetic variation associated with adaptation in many taxa. Yet understanding the adaptive process that drives such patterns is challenging; it requires disentangling the ecological agents of selection, determining the relevant timescales over which evolution occurs, and elucidating the genetic architecture of adaptation. Doing so for the adaptation of hosts to their microbiome is of particular interest with growing recognition of the importance and complexity of host-microbe interactions. Here, we track the pace and genomic architecture of adaptation to an experimental microbiome manipulation in replicate populations of Drosophila melanogaster in field mesocosms. Shifts in microbiome composition altered population dynamics and led to divergence between treatments in allele frequencies, with regions showing strong divergence found on all chromosomes. Moreover, at divergent loci previously associated with adaptation across natural populations, we found that the more common allele in fly populations experimentally enriched for a certain microbial group was also more common in natural populations with high relative abundance of that microbial group. These results suggest that microbiomes may be an agent of selection that shapes the pattern and process of adaptation and, more broadly, that variation in a single ecological factor within a complex environment can drive rapid, polygenic adaptation over short timescales.

        "The Effect of an Iron Supplement on Lycopene Metabolism and Absorption During Digestion in Healthy Humans. SCOPE: To investigate the formation and absorption of lycopene (LYC) metabolites in the human upper gastrointestinal lumen, in the absence and presence of iron. METHODS: Healthy males (n = 7) consumed test meals that deliver \u224822\u00a0mg LYC + \u22480.3\u00a0mg apo-lycopenals from oleoresin without (-FeSO4 ) and with ferrous sulfate (160\u00a0mg, +FeSO4 ). Subjects were intubated with a naso-gastric/naso-duodenal tube. Digesta, blood plasma, and the triglyceride-rich lipoprotein (TRL) fractions of plasma were analyzed using LC-MS/MS, to measure LYC and apo-lycopenoids. RESULTS: Digesta LYC concentrations increased with time (p = 1.2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010-7 ), decrease with time\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0iron (p = 1.1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010-5 ), and remain \u2248200\u00d7 higher than apo-lycopenals/lycopenone. Digesta apo-8'-, -10'-, -12'-, -14'-, -15-lycopenal, and apo-13-lycopenone concentrations increased with time (p <\u00a00.01), apo-12'-, -14'-, -15-lycopenal, apo-13-lycopenone increase with iron (p <\u00a00.05), and time\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0iron decrease apo-8'-, -10'-, -12'-, -14'-, -15-lycopenal, apo-13-lycopenone concentrations (p <\u00a00.01). A 1.9-fold decrease in LYC TRL area-under-the-time-concentration-curve is observed after the test meal +FeSO4 versus the test meal -FeSO4 (p = 0.02). Apo-lycopenals were detected in later TRL fractions, and no apo-lycopenols or apo-lycopenoic acids were observed in any samples. CONCLUSIONS: FeSO4 reduces LYC absorption. Apo-lycopenals appear to be absorbed from foods, and not made in significant quantities during digestion. ",
        "Delayed M50/M100 evoked response component latency in minimally verbal/nonverbal children who have autism spectrum disorder. Abnormal auditory neuromagnetic M50 and M100 responses, reflecting primary/secondary auditory cortex processing, have been reported in children who have autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Some studies have reported an association between delays in these responses and language impairment. However, as most prior research has focused on verbal individuals with ASD without cognitive impairment, rather little is known about neural activity during auditory processing in minimally verbal or nonverbal children who have ASD (ASD-MVNV)-children with little or no speech and often significant cognitive impairment. To understand the neurophysiological mechanisms underlying auditory processing in ASD-MVNV children, magnetoencephalography (MEG) measured M50 and M100 responses arising from left and right superior temporal gyri during tone stimuli in three cohorts: (1) MVNV children who have ASD (ASD-MVNV), (2) verbal children who have ASD and no intellectual disability (ASD-V), and (3) typically developing (TD) children. One hundred and five participants (8-12\u2009years) were included in the final analyses (ASD-MVNV: n\u2009=\u200916, 9.85\u2009\u00b1\u20091.32\u2009years; ASD-V: n\u2009=\u200955, 10.64\u2009\u00b1\u20091.31\u2009years; TD: n\u2009=\u200934, 10.18\u2009\u00b1\u20091.36\u2009years). ASD-MVNV children showed significantly delayed M50 and M100 latencies compared to TD. These delays tended to be greater than the corresponding delays in verbal children with ASD. Across cohorts, delayed latencies were associated with language and communication skills, assessed by the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale Communication Domain. Findings suggest that auditory cortex neural activity measures could be dimensional objective indices of language impairment in ASD for either diagnostic (e.g., via threshold or cutoff) or prognostic (considering the continuous variable) use.

        "Cannabidiol attenuates seizures and EEG abnormalities in Angelman syndrome model mice. Angelman syndrome (AS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by intellectual disability, lack of speech, ataxia, EEG abnormalities, and epilepsy. Seizures in individuals with AS are common, debilitating, and often drug resistant. Thus, there is an unmet need for better treatment options. Cannabidiol (CBD), a major phytocannabinoid constituent of cannabis, has shown antiseizure activity and behavioral benefits in preclinical and clinical studies for some disorders associated with epilepsy, suggesting that the same could be true for AS. Here, we show that acute CBD (100 mg/kg) treatment attenuated hyperthermia- and acoustically induced seizures in a mouse model of AS. However, neither acute CBD nor a 2-week-long course of CBD administered immediately after a kindling protocol could halt the proepileptogenic plasticity observed in AS model mice. CBD had a dose-dependent sedative effect but did not have an impact on motor performance. CBD abrogated the enhanced intracortical local field potential power, including the delta and theta rhythms observed in AS model mice, indicating that CBD administration could also help normalize the EEG deficits observed in individuals with AS. We believe our results provide critical preclinical evidence supporting CBD treatment of seizures and alleviation of EEG abnormalities in AS and will thus help guide the rational development of CBD as a treatment for AS.

        "Targeting Mechanoresponsive Proteins in Pancreatic Cancer: 4-Hydroxyacetophenone Blocks Dissemination and Invasion by Activating MYH14. Metastasis is complex, involving multiple genetic, epigenetic, biochemical, and physical changes in the cancer cell and its microenvironment. Cells with metastatic potential are often characterized by altered cellular contractility and deformability, lending them the flexibility to disseminate and navigate through different microenvironments. We demonstrate that mechanoresponsiveness is a hallmark of pancreatic cancer cells. Key mechanoresponsive proteins, those that accumulate in response to mechanical stress, specifically nonmuscle myosin IIA (MYH9) and IIC (MYH14), \u03b1-actinin 4, and filamin B, were highly expressed in pancreatic cancer as compared with healthy ductal epithelia. Their less responsive sister paralogs-myosin IIB (MYH10), \u03b1-actinin 1, and filamin A-had lower expression differential or disappeared with cancer progression. We demonstrate that proteins whose cellular contributions are often overlooked because of their low abundance can have profound impact on cell architecture, behavior, and mechanics. Here, the low abundant protein MYH14 promoted metastatic behavior and could be exploited with 4-hydroxyacetophenone (4-HAP), which increased MYH14 assembly, stiffening cells. As a result, 4-HAP decreased dissemination, induced cortical actin belts in spheroids, and slowed retrograde actin flow. 4-HAP also reduced liver metastases in human pancreatic cancer-bearing nude mice. Thus, increasing MYH14 assembly overwhelms the ability of cells to polarize and invade, suggesting targeting the mechanoresponsive proteins of the actin cytoskeleton as a new strategy to improve the survival of patients with pancreatic cancer. SIGNIFICANCE: This study demonstrates that mechanoresponsive proteins become upregulated with pancreatic cancer progression and that this system of proteins can be pharmacologically targeted to inhibit the metastatic potential of pancreatic cancer cells.

        "Transgenic Aedes aegypti Mosquitoes Transfer Genes into a Natural Population. In an attempt to control the mosquito-borne diseases yellow fever, dengue, chikungunya, and Zika fevers, a strain of transgenically modified Aedes aegypti mosquitoes containing a dominant lethal gene has been developed by a commercial company, Oxitec Ltd. If lethality is complete, releasing this strain should only reduce population size and not affect the genetics of the target populations. Approximately 450 thousand males of this strain were released each week for 27 months in Jacobina, Bahia, Brazil. We genotyped the release strain and the target Jacobina population before releases began for >21,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Genetic sampling from the target population six, 12, and 27-30 months after releases commenced provides clear evidence that portions of the transgenic strain genome have been incorporated into the target population. Evidently, rare viable hybrid offspring between the release strain and the Jacobina population are sufficiently robust to be able to reproduce in nature. The release strain was developed using a strain originally from Cuba, then outcrossed to a Mexican population. Thus, Jacobina Ae. aegypti are now a mix of three populations. It is unclear how this may affect disease transmission or affect other efforts to control these dangerous vectors. These results highlight the importance of having in place a genetic monitoring program during such releases to detect un-anticipated outcomes. ",
        "Human gestational N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor autoantibodies impair neonatal murine brain function. OBJECTIVE: Maternal autoantibodies are a risk factor for impaired brain development in offspring. Antibodies (ABs) against the NR1 (GluN1) subunit of the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) are among the most frequently diagnosed anti-neuronal surface ABs, yet little is known about effects on fetal development during pregnancy. METHODS: We established a murine model of in utero exposure to human recombinant NR1 and isotype-matched nonreactive control ABs. Pregnant C57BL/6J mice were intraperitoneally injected on embryonic days 13 and 17 each with 240\u03bcg of human monoclonal ABs. Offspring were investigated for acute and chronic effects on NMDAR function, brain development, and behavior. RESULTS: Transferred NR1 ABs enriched in the fetus and bound to synaptic structures in the fetal brain. Density of NMDAR was considerably reduced (up to -49.2%) and electrophysiological properties were altered, reflected by decreased amplitudes of spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents in young neonates (-34.4%). NR1 AB-treated animals displayed increased early postnatal mortality (+27.2%), impaired neurodevelopmental reflexes, altered blood pH, and reduced bodyweight. During adolescence and adulthood, animals showed hyperactivity (+27.8% median activity over 14 days), lower anxiety, and impaired sensorimotor gating. NR1 ABs caused long-lasting neuropathological effects also in aged mice (10 months), such as reduced volumes of cerebellum, midbrain, and brainstem. INTERPRETATION: The data collectively support a model in which asymptomatic mothers can harbor low-level pathogenic human NR1 ABs that are diaplacentally transferred, causing neurotoxic effects on neonatal development. Thus, AB-mediated network changes may represent a potentially treatable neurodevelopmental congenital brain disorder contributing to lifelong neuropsychiatric morbidity in affected children.

        "A mechanistic examination of salting out in protein-polymer membrane interactions. Developing a mechanistic understanding of protein dynamics and conformational changes at polymer interfaces is critical for a range of processes including industrial protein separations. Salting out is one example of a procedure that is ubiquitous in protein separations yet is optimized empirically because there is no mechanistic description of the underlying interactions that would allow predictive modeling. Here, we investigate peak narrowing in a model transferrin-nylon system under salting out conditions using a combination of single-molecule tracking and ensemble separations. Distinct surface transport modes and protein conformational changes at the negatively charged nylon interface are quantified as a function of salt concentration. Single-molecule kinetics relate macroscale improvements in chromatographic peak broadening with microscale distributions of surface interaction mechanisms such as continuous-time random walks and simple adsorption-desorption. Monte Carlo simulations underpinned by the stochastic theory of chromatography are performed using kinetic data extracted from single-molecule observations. Simulations agree with experiment, revealing a decrease in peak broadening as the salt concentration increases. The results suggest that chemical modifications to membranes that decrease the probability of surface random walks could reduce peak broadening in full-scale protein separations. More broadly, this work represents a proof of concept for combining single-molecule experiments and a mechanistic theory to improve costly and time-consuming empirical methods of optimization. ",
        "Father support is protective against the negative effects of perceived discrimination on CRP among sexual minorities but not heterosexuals. BACKGROUND: Exposure to sexual orientation-related discrimination among sexual minorities may lead to elevated levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) as compared to their heterosexual counterparts. However, little is known about factors that may buffer the association between discrimination and CRP among sexual minorities versus heterosexuals. The current study examined if the association between discrimination, sexual orientation, and CRP differed across levels of social support from one's father/father-figure or mother/mother-figure between sexual minorities and heterosexuals. METHODS: Data came from Wave IV of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health). The sample sizes for father support and mother support was 3167 and 3575, respectively. Participants ranged in age from 24 to 33 years. Stratified linear regression models examined if father and mother support moderated the association between discrimination and CRP among sexual minorities and heterosexuals. RESULTS: Father support significantly moderated the association between discrimination and CRP among sexual minorities but not heterosexuals. Sexual minorities with higher father support and who experienced discrimination had lower CRP as compared to those with lower father support and who experienced discrimination. Mother support did not moderate the association between discrimination and CRP among either sexual minorities or heterosexuals. CONCLUSION: Father support may mitigate the negative effects of stress from discrimination on CRP among sexual minorities. Future research should further examine the potential differential role that father support may play in reducing cardiovascular risk among sexual minorities versus heterosexuals who experience discrimination.

        "The long arm of childhood experiences on longevity: Testing midlife vulnerability and resilience pathways. Adverse early experiences have been associated with higher mortality risk, but evidence varies by type of experiences, and relatively little is known about the role of favorable early experiences on health in later life. This study evaluated the independent contributions to longevity of favorable and unfavorable early experiences, including psychosocial stressors, childhood socioeconomic status (SES), and close relationships. We also examined 4 midlife psychosocial factors as vulnerability and resilience pathways potentially mediating these associations. The sample included 1,042 men from the VA Normative Aging Study. Early experiences were assessed retrospectively in 1961-1970 and 1995. Midlife psychosocial factors were measured in 1985-1991 and included stressful life events (SLEs), negative affect, life satisfaction, and optimism. Mortality was assessed through 2016. In multiple mediator structural equation models, which account for the overlap among pathways, higher number of SLEs in midlife mediated the association of having more childhood psychosocial stressors to reduced longevity, supporting stress continuity as a vulnerability pathway. Higher optimism in midlife also mediated the association of higher childhood SES to greater longevity. In single mediator models, higher life satisfaction in midlife transmitted the benefits of higher childhood SES and presence of close relationships onto longevity. Higher optimism also mediated the association of fewer childhood psychosocial stressors to longevity. However, these indirect effects were attenuated when accounting for shared variance among mediators, suggesting overlapping pathways. Findings offer novel evidence on unique and shared pathways linking specific dimensions of early experiences to longevity. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved). ",
        "Fortification of bakery and corn masa-based foods in Mexico and dietary intake of folic acid and folate in Mexican national survey data. BACKGROUND: In Mexico, wheat and corn flour fortification with folic acid (FA) was implemented in 2001 and mandated in 2008, but without direct enforcement. Current Mexican nutrient-content tables do not account for FA contained in bakery bread and corn masa-based foods, which are dietary staples in Mexico. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to examine the impact of FA fortification of dietary staples on the proportion of the population consuming below the Estimated Average Requirement (EAR) for folate or above the Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL) for FA. METHODS: We measured FA and folate content in dietary staples (bakery bread and tortillas) using microbial assays and MS, and we recalculated FA intake from 24-h recall dietary intake data collected in the 2012 Mexican National Health and Nutrition Survey (Encuesta Nacional de Salud y Nutrici\u00f3n) utilizing estimates from our food measurements, using nutrient concentrations from tortillas to approximate nutrient content of other corn masa-derived foods. The revised FA intake estimates were used to examine population-level intake of FA and dietary folate equivalent (DFE) accounting for geographic differences in FA content with statistical models. RESULTS: FA content in dietary staples was variable, whereas use of FA-fortified flour in corn masa tortillas increased with population size in place of residence. Accounting for dietary staples' FA fortification increased population estimates for FA and DFE intake, resulting in a lower proportion with intake below the EAR and a higher proportion with intake above the UL. Despite accounting for FA-fortified staple foods, 9-33% of women of childbearing age still have intake below the EAR, whereas up to 12% of younger children have intake above the UL. CONCLUSIONS: Unregulated FA fortification of dietary staples leads to unpredictable total folate intake without adequately impacting the intended target. Our findings suggest that monitoring, evaluation, and enforcement of mandatory fortification policies are needed. Without these, alternate strategies may be needed in order to reach women of childbearing age while avoiding overexposing children. ",
        "Prevalence of Screening for Food Insecurity, Housing Instability, Utility Needs, Transportation Needs, and Interpersonal Violence by US Physician Practices and Hospitals. Importance: Social needs, including food, housing, utilities, transportation, and experience with interpersonal violence, are linked to health outcomes. Identifying patients with unmet social needs is a necessary first step to addressing these needs, yet little is known about the prevalence of screening. Objective: To characterize screening for social needs by physician practices and hospitals. Design, Setting, and Participants: Cross-sectional survey analyses of responses by physician practices and hospitals to the 2017-2018 National Survey of Healthcare Organizations and Systems. Responses were collected from survey participants from June 16, 2017, to August 17, 2018. Exposures: Organizational characteristics, including participation in delivery and payment reform. Main Outcomes and Measures: Self-report of screening patients for food insecurity, housing instability, utility needs, transportation needs, and experience with interpersonal violence. Results: Among 4976 physician practices, 2333 responded, a response rate of 46.9%. Among hospitals, 757 of 1628 (46.5%) responded. After eliminating responses because of ineligibility, 2190 physician practices and 739 hospitals remained. Screening for all 5 social needs was reported by 24.4% (95% CI, 20.0%-28.7%) of hospitals and 15.6% (95% CI, 13.4%-17.9%) of practices, whereas 33.3% (95% CI, 30.5%-36.2%) of practices and 8.0% (95% CI, 5.8%-11.0%) of hospitals reported no screening. Screening for interpersonal violence was most common (practices: 56.4%; 95% CI, 53.3%-2 59.4%; hospitals: 75.0%; 95% CI, 70.1%-79.3%), and screening for utility needs was least common (practices: 23.1%; 95% CI, 20.6%-26.0%; hospitals: 35.5%; 95% CI, 30.0%-41.0%) among both hospitals and practices. Among practices, federally qualified health centers (yes: 29.7%; 95% CI, 21.5%-37.8% vs no: 9.4%; 95% CI, 7.2%-11.6%; P\u2009<\u2009.001), bundled payment participants (yes: 21.4%; 95% CI, 17.1%-25.8% vs no: 10.7%; 95% CI, 7.9%-13.4%; P\u2009<\u2009.001), primary care improvement models (yes: 19.6%; 95% CI, 16.5%-22.6% vs no: 9.6%; 95% CI, 6.0%-13.1%; P\u2009<\u2009.001), and Medicaid accountable care organizations (yes: 21.8%; 95% CI, 17.4%-26.2% vs no: 11.2%; 95% CI, 8.6%-13.7%; P\u2009<\u2009.001) had higher rates of screening for all needs. Practices in Medicaid expansion states (yes: 17.7%; 95% CI, 14.8%-20.7% vs no: 11.4%; 95% CI, 8.1%-14.6%; P\u2009=\u2009.007) and those with more Medicaid revenue (highest tertile: 17.1%; 95% CI, 11.4%-22.7% vs lowest tertile: 9.0%; 95% CI, 6.1%-11.8%; P\u2009=\u2009.02) were more likely to screen. Academic medical centers were more likely than other hospitals to screen (49.5%; 95% CI, 34.6%-64.4% vs 23.0%; 95% CI, 18.5%-27.5%; P\u2009<\u2009.001). Conclusions and Relevance: This study's findings suggest that few US physician practices and hospitals screen patients for all 5 key social needs associated with health outcomes. Practices that serve disadvantaged patients report higher screening rates. The role of physicians and hospitals in meeting patients' social needs is likely to increase as more take on accountability for cost under payment reform. Physicians and hospitals may need additional resources to screen for or address patients' social needs. ",
        "Self-organizing neuruloids model developmental aspects of Huntington's disease in the ectodermal compartment. Harnessing the potential of human embryonic stem cells to mimic normal and aberrant development with standardized models is a pressing challenge. Here we use micropattern technology to recapitulate early human neurulation in large numbers of nearly identical structures called neuruloids. Dual-SMAD inhibition followed by bone morphogenic protein 4 stimulation induced self-organization of neuruloids harboring neural progenitors, neural crest, sensory placode and epidermis. Single-cell transcriptomics unveiled the precise identities and timing of fate specification. Investigation of the molecular mechanism of neuruloid self-organization revealed a pulse of pSMAD1 at the edge that induced epidermis, whose juxtaposition to central neural fates specifies neural crest and placodes, modulated by fibroblast growth factor and Wnt. Neuruloids provide a unique opportunity to study the developmental aspects of human diseases. Using isogenic Huntington's disease human embryonic stem cells and deep neural network analysis, we show how specific phenotypic signatures arise in our model of early human development as a consequence of mutant huntingtin protein, outlining an approach for phenotypic drug screening.

        "Acoustic diffusion constant of cortical bone: Numerical simulation study of the effect of pore size and pore density on multiple scattering. While osteoporosis assessment has long focused on the characterization of trabecular bone, the cortical bone micro-structure also provides relevant information on bone strength. This numerical study takes advantage of ultrasound multiple scattering in cortical bone to investigate the effect of pore size and pore density on the acoustic diffusion constant. Finite-difference time-domain simulations were conducted in cortical microstructures that were derived from acoustic microscopy images of human proximal femur cross sections and modified by controlling the density (Ct.Po.Dn) \u2208[5-25]\u2009pore/mm2 and size (Ct.Po.Dm) \u2208[30-100]\u2009\u03bcm of the pores. Gaussian pulses were transmitted through the medium and the backscattered signals were recorded to obtain the backscattered intensity. The incoherent contribution of the backscattered intensity was extracted to give access to the diffusion constant D. At 8\u2009MHz, significant differences in the diffusion constant were observed in media with different porous micro-architectures. The diffusion constant was monotonously influenced by either pore diameter or pore density. An increase in pore size and pore density resulted in a decrease in the diffusion constant (D\u2009=285.9Ct.Po.Dm-1.49,\u2009R2=0.989\u2009,\u2009p=4.96\u00d710-5,RMSE=0.06;\u2009D=6.91Ct.Po.Dn-1.01,\u2009R2=0.94,\u2009p=2.8\u00d710-3\u2009,\u2009RMSE=0.09), suggesting the potential of the proposed technique for the characterization of the cortical microarchitecture.

        "MAP7 Prevents Axonal Branch Retraction by Creating a Stable Microtubule Boundary to Rescue Polymerization. Complex neural circuits are built from axonal branches that allow each neuron to connect with multiple targets. During development, maturation of nascent branches depends on stabilization of newly assembled or transported microtubules, which are thought to be regulated by microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs). However, because many known MAPs inhibit branch formation, it is not clear which MAP is responsible for regulating microtubule stability during branch development. Here, we show that MAP7, a less-well understood MAP that is localized to branch junctions, provides a key molecular mechanism to regulate microtubule stability during branch formation. In developing rodent sensory neurons of mixed sex, MAP7 is required for branch maturation mainly by preventing branch retraction. This function is mediated by the ability of MAP7 to control microtubule stability, as microtubules are more stable at branch junctions where MAP7 is localized. Consistently, nascent branches depleted of MAP7 have decreased stable microtubules but increased dynamic microtubules. Moreover, MAP7 binds to the acetylated and stable region of individual microtubules and avoids the dynamic plus end, thereby creating a boundary that prevents microtubule depolymerization and rescues microtubule polymerization. This unique binding property, which is not observed for other MAPs, can prevent branch retraction caused by laser-induced severing or nocodazole-induced microtubule depolymerization. Together, our study identifies a novel molecular mechanism mediated by MAP7 to regulate microtubule stability and strengthen branches at different stages of axonal branch morphogenesis.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Development and maintenance of axonal branches rely on microtubule stability, but the underlying molecular mechanisms are not fully understood. Here, we show that MAP7, a unique protein that interacts with both microtubules and the motor protein kinesin-1, plays a key role at branch junctions. MAP7 stabilizes microtubules in nascent branches and prevents branch retraction during branch maturation or after laser-induced injury. MAP7 also binds to the acetylated region of microtubules to prevent depolymerization and rescue polymerization. This unique binding property supports a novel mechanism mediated by MAP7 to cooperate with other MAPs and control microtubule stability during axonal branch development. This mechanism could also impact microtubule regulation in branch regeneration after nerve injury. ",
        "High-Contrast, Low-Cost, 3-D Visualization of Skin Cancer Using Ultra-High-Resolution Millimeter-Wave Imaging. The goal of this paper is to develop a new skin imaging modality which addresses the current clinical need for a non-invasive imaging tool that images the skin over its depth with high resolutions while offering large histopathological-like contrasts between malignant and normal tissues. We demonstrate that by taking advantage of the intrinsic millimeter-wave dielectric contrasts between normal and malignant skin tissues, ultra-high-resolution millimeter-wave imaging (MMWI) can achieve 3-D, high-contrast images of the skin. In this paper, an imaging system with a record-wide bandwidth of 98 GHz is developed using the synthetic ultra-wideband millimeter-wave imaging approach, a new ultra-high-resolution imaging technique recently developed by the authors. The 21 non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) specimens are imaged and compared with histopathology for evaluation. A programmable measurement platform is designed to automatically scan the tissues across a rectangular aperture plane. Furthermore, a novel frequency-domain imaging algorithm is developed to process the recorded signals and generate an image of the cancerous tissue. The high correlations achieved between MMWI images and histological images allow for rapid and accurate delineation of NMSC tissues. The millimeter-wave reflectivity values are also found to be statistically significant higher for cancerous areas with respect to normal areas. Since MMWI does not require tissue processing or staining, it can be performed promptly, enabling diagnosis of tumors at an early stage as well as simplify the tumor removal surgery to a single-layer excision procedure.

        "Thermoresponsive Protein-Engineered Coiled-Coil Hydrogel for Sustained Small Molecule Release. Thermoresponsive hydrogels are used for an array of biomedical applications. Lower critical solution temperature-type hydrogels have been observed in nature and extensively studied in comparison to upper critical solution temperature (UCST)-type hydrogels. Of the limited protein-based UCST-type hydrogels reported, none have been composed of a single coiled-coil domain. Here, we describe a biosynthesized homopentameric coiled-coil protein capable of demonstrating a UCST. Microscopy and structural analysis reveal that the hydrogel is stabilized by molecular entanglement of protein nanofibers, creating a porous matrix capable of binding the small hydrophobic molecule, curcumin. Curcumin binding increases the \u03b1-helical structure, fiber entanglement, mechanical integrity, and thermostability, resulting in sustained drug release at physiological temperature. This work provides the first example of a thermoresponsive hydrogel comprised of a single coiled-coil protein domain that can be used as a vehicle for sustained release and, by demonstrating UCST-type behavior, shows promise in forging a relationship between coiled-coil protein-phase behavior and that of synthetic polymer systems.

        "Bat influenza viruses transmit among bats but are poorly adapted to non-bat species. Major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC-II) molecules of multiple species function as cell-entry receptors for the haemagglutinin-like H18 protein of the bat H18N11 influenza A virus, enabling tropism of the viruses in a potentially broad range of vertebrates. However, the function of the neuraminidase-like N11 protein is unknown because it is dispensable for viral infection or the release of H18-pseudotyped viruses. Here, we show that infection of mammalian cells with wild-type H18N11 leads to the emergence of mutant viruses that lack the N11 ectodomain and acquired mutations in H18. An infectious clone of one such mutant virus, designated rP11, appeared to be genetically stable in mice and replicated to higher titres in mice and cell culture compared with wild-type H18N11. In ferrets, rP11 antigen and RNA were detected at low levels in various tissues, including the tonsils, whereas the wild-type virus was not. In Neotropical Jamaican fruit bats, wild-type H18N11 was found in intestinal Peyer's patches and was shed to high concentrations in rectal samples, resulting in viral transmission to naive contact bats. Notably, rP11 also replicated efficiently in bats; however, only restored full-length N11 viruses were transmissible. Our findings suggest that wild-type H18N11 replicates poorly in mice and ferrets and that N11 is a determinant for viral transmission in bats. ",
        "Mechanics of pulmonary airways: Linking structure to function through constitutive modeling, biochemistry, and histology. Breathing involves fluid-solid interactions in the lung; however, the lack of experimental data inhibits combining the mechanics of air flow to airway deformation, challenging the understanding of how biomaterial constituents contribute to tissue response. As such, lung mechanics research is increasingly focused on exploring the relationship between structure and function. To address these needs, we characterize mechanical properties of porcine airways using uniaxial tensile experiments, accounting for bronchial orientation- and location- dependency. Structurally-reinforced constitutive models are developed to incorporate the role of collagen and elastin fibers embedded within the extrafibrillar matrix. The strain-energy function combines a matrix description (evaluating six models: compressible NeoHookean, unconstrained Ogden, uncoupled Mooney-Rivlin, incompressible Ogden, incompressible Demiray and incompressible NeoHookean), superimposed with non-linear fibers (evaluating two models: exponential and polynomial). The best constitutive formulation representative of all bronchial regions is determined based on curve-fit results to experimental data, accounting for uniqueness and sensitivity. Glycosaminoglycan and collagen composition, alongside tissue architecture, indicate fiber form to be primarily responsible for observed airway anisotropy and heterogeneous mechanical behavior. To the authors' best knowledge, this study is the first to formulate a structurally-motivated constitutive model, augmented with biochemical analysis and microstructural observations, to investigate the mechanical function of proximal and distal bronchi. Our systematic pulmonary tissue characterization provides a necessary foundation for understanding pulmonary mechanics; furthermore, these results enable clinical translation through simulations of airway obstruction in disease, fluid-structure interaction insights during breathing, and potentially, predictive capabilities for medical interventions. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: The advancement of pulmonary research relies on investigating the biomechanical response of the bronchial tree. Experiments demonstrating the non-linear, heterogeneous, and anisotropic material behavior of porcine airways are used to develop a structural constitutive model representative of proximal and distal bronchial behavior. Calibrated material parameters exhibit regional variation in biomaterial properties, initially hypothesized to originate from tissue constituents. Further exploration through biochemical and histological analysis indicates mechanical function is primarily governed by microstructural form. The results of this study can be directly used in finite element and fluid-structure interaction models to enable physiologically relevant and more accurate computational simulations aimed to help diagnose and monitor pulmonary disease.

        "Defined neuronal populations drive fatal phenotype in a mouse model of Leigh syndrome. Mitochondrial deficits in energy production cause untreatable and fatal pathologies known as mitochondrial disease (MD). Central nervous system affectation is critical in Leigh Syndrome (LS), a common MD presentation, leading to motor and respiratory deficits, seizures and premature death. However, only specific neuronal populations are affected. Furthermore, their molecular identity and their contribution to the disease remains unknown. Here, using a mouse model of LS lacking the mitochondrial complex I subunit Ndufs4, we dissect the critical role of genetically-defined neuronal populations in LS progression. Ndufs4 inactivation in Vglut2-expressing glutamatergic neurons leads to decreased neuronal firing, brainstem inflammation, motor and respiratory deficits, and early death. In contrast, Ndufs4 deletion in GABAergic neurons causes basal ganglia inflammation without motor or respiratory involvement, but accompanied by hypothermia and severe epileptic seizures preceding death. These results provide novel insight in the cell type-specific contribution to the pathology, dissecting the underlying cellular mechanisms of MD. ",
        "Blood Culture Results Before and After Antimicrobial Administration in Patients With Severe Manifestations of Sepsis: A Diagnostic Study. Background: Administering antimicrobial agents before obtaining blood cultures could potentially decrease time to treatment and improve outcomes, but it is unclear how this strategy affects diagnostic sensitivity. Objective: To determine the sensitivity of blood cultures obtained shortly after initiation of antimicrobial therapy in patients with severe manifestations of sepsis. Design: Patient-level, single-group, diagnostic study. (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01867905). Setting: 7 emergency departments in North America. Participants: Adults with severe manifestations of sepsis, including systolic blood pressure less than 90 mm Hg or a serum lactate level of 4 mmol/L or more. Intervention: Blood cultures were obtained before and within 120 minutes after initiation of antimicrobial treatment. Measurements: Sensitivity of blood cultures obtained after initiation of antimicrobial therapy. Results: Of 3164 participants screened, 325 were included in the study (mean age, 65.6 years; 62.8% men) and had repeated blood cultures drawn after initiation of antimicrobial therapy (median time, 70 minutes [interquartile range, 50 to 110 minutes]). Preantimicrobial blood cultures were positive for 1 or more microbial pathogens in 102 of 325 (31.4%) patients. Postantimicrobial blood cultures were positive for 1 or more microbial pathogens in 63 of 325 (19.4%) patients. The absolute difference in the proportion of positive blood cultures between pre- and postantimicrobial testing was 12.0% (95% CI, 5.4% to 18.6%; P < 0.001). Sensitivity of postantimicrobial culture was 52.9% (CI, 42.8% to 62.9%). When the results of other microbiological cultures were included, microbial pathogens were found in 69 of 102 (67.6% [CI, 57.7% to 76.6%]) patients. Limitation: Only a proportion of screened patients were recruited. Conclusion: Among patients with severe manifestations of sepsis, initiation of empirical antimicrobial therapy significantly reduces the sensitivity of blood cultures drawn shortly after treatment initiation.

        "Electronic Pill Bottles or Bidirectional Text Messaging to Improve Hypertension Medication Adherence (Way 2 Text): a Randomized Clinical Trial. BACKGROUND: Poor medication adherence contributes to inadequate control of hypertension. However, the value of adherence monitoring is unknown. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the impact of monitoring adherence with electronic pill bottles or bidirectional text messaging on improving hypertension control. DESIGN: Three-arm pragmatic randomized controlled trial. PATIENTS: One hundred forty-nine primary care patients aged 18-75 with hypertension and text messaging capabilities who were seen at least twice in the prior 12\u00a0months with at least two out-of-range blood pressure (BP) measurements, including the most recent visit. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomized in a 1:2:2 ratio to receive (1) usual care, (2) electronic pill bottles for medication adherence monitoring (pill bottle), and (3) bidirectional text messaging for medication adherence monitoring (bidirectional text). MAIN MEASURES: Change in systolic BP during the final 4-month visit compared with baseline. KEY RESULTS: At the 4-month follow-up visit, mean (SD) change values in systolic blood pressure were -\u20094.7 (23.4) mmHg in usual care, -\u20094.3 (21.5) mmHg in the pill bottle arm, and -\u20094.6 (19.8) mmHg in the text arm. There was no significant change in systolic blood pressure between control and the pill bottle arm (p\u2009=\u20090.94) or the text messaging arm (p\u2009=\u20091.00), and the two intervention arms did not differ from each other (p\u2009=\u20090.93). CONCLUSIONS: Despite good measured adherence, neither feedback with electronic pill bottles nor bidirectional text messaging about medication adherence improved blood pressure control. Adherence to prescribed medications was not improved enough to affect BP control or it was not the primary driver of poor control. TRIAL REGISTRATION: clinicaltrials.gov (NCT02778542). ",
        "miR-26 suppresses adipocyte progenitor differentiation and fat production by targeting Fbxl19. Fat storage in adult mammals is a highly regulated process that involves the mobilization of adipocyte progenitor cells (APCs) that differentiate to produce new adipocytes. Here we report a role for the broadly conserved miR-26 family of microRNAs (miR-26a-1, miR-26a-2, and miR-26b) as major regulators of APC differentiation and adipose tissue mass. Deletion of all miR-26-encoding loci in mice resulted in a dramatic expansion of adipose tissue in adult animals fed normal chow. Conversely, transgenic overexpression of miR-26a protected mice from high-fat diet-induced obesity. These effects were attributable to a cell-autonomous function of miR-26 as a potent inhibitor of APC differentiation. miR-26 blocks adipogenesis, at least in part, by repressing expression of Fbxl19, a conserved miR-26 target without a previously known role in adipocyte biology that encodes a component of SCF-type E3 ubiquitin ligase complexes. These findings have therefore revealed a novel pathway that plays a critical role in regulating adipose tissue formation in vivo and suggest new potential therapeutic targets for obesity and related disorders.

        "Production of adeno-associated virus vectors for in vitro and in vivo applications. Delivering and expressing a gene of interest in cells or living animals has become a pivotal technique in biomedical research and gene therapy. Among viral delivery systems, adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) are relatively safe and demonstrate high gene transfer efficiency, low immunogenicity, stable long-term expression, and selective tissue tropism. Combined with modern gene technologies, such as cell-specific promoters, the Cre/lox system, and genome editing, AAVs represent a practical, rapid, and economical alternative to conditional knockout and transgenic mouse models. However, major obstacles remain for widespread AAV utilization, such as impractical purification strategies and low viral quantities. Here, we report an improved protocol to produce serotype-independent purified AAVs economically. Using a helper-free AAV system, we purified AAVs from HEK293T cell lysates and medium by polyethylene glycol precipitation with subsequent aqueous two-phase partitioning. Furthermore, we then implemented an iodixanol gradient purification, which resulted in preparations with purities adequate for in vivo use. Of note, we achieved titers of 1010-1011 viral genome copies per \u00b5l with a typical production volume of up to 1\u2009ml while requiring five times less than the usual number of HEK293T cells used in standard protocols. For proof of concept, we verified in vivo transduction via Western blot, qPCR, luminescence, and immunohistochemistry. AAVs coding for glutaredoxin-1 (Glrx) shRNA successfully inhibited Glrx expression by ~66% in the liver and skeletal muscle. Our study provides an improved protocol for a more economical and efficient purified AAV preparation. ",
        "Circulating metabolites in progression to islet autoimmunity and type 1 diabetes. AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Metabolic dysregulation may precede the onset of type 1 diabetes. However, these metabolic disturbances and their specific role in disease initiation remain poorly understood. In this study, we examined whether children who progress to type 1 diabetes have a circulatory polar metabolite profile distinct from that of children who later progress to islet autoimmunity but not type 1 diabetes and a matched control group. METHODS: We analysed polar metabolites from 415 longitudinal plasma samples in a prospective cohort of children in three study groups: those who progressed to type 1 diabetes; those who seroconverted to one islet autoantibody but not to type 1 diabetes; and an antibody-negative control group. Metabolites were measured using two-dimensional GC high-speed time of flight MS. RESULTS: In early infancy, progression to type 1 diabetes was associated with downregulated amino acids, sugar derivatives and fatty acids, including catabolites of microbial origin, compared with the control group. Methionine remained persistently upregulated in those progressing to type 1 diabetes compared with the control group and those who seroconverted to one islet autoantibody. The appearance of islet autoantibodies was associated with decreased glutamic and aspartic acids. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Our findings suggest that children who progress to type 1 diabetes have a unique metabolic profile, which is, however, altered with the appearance of islet autoantibodies. Our findings may assist with early prediction of the disease. ",
        "Gene discovery and polygenic prediction from a genome-wide association study of educational attainment in 1.1 million individuals. Here we conducted a large-scale genetic association analysis of educational attainment in a sample of approximately 1.1\u2009million individuals and identify 1,271\u2009independent genome-wide-significant SNPs. For the SNPs taken together, we found evidence of heterogeneous effects across environments. The SNPs implicate genes involved in brain-development processes and neuron-to-neuron communication. In a separate analysis of the X chromosome, we identify 10\u2009independent genome-wide-significant SNPs and estimate a SNP heritability of around 0.3% in both men and women, consistent with partial dosage compensation. A joint (multi-phenotype) analysis of educational attainment and three related cognitive phenotypes generates polygenic scores that explain 11-13% of the variance in educational attainment and 7-10% of the variance in cognitive performance. This prediction accuracy substantially increases the utility of polygenic scores as tools in research. ",
        "A Systematic Review of Sexual Minority Women's Experiences of Health Care in the UK. Sexual minority women (SMW) experience worse health and disproportionate behavioural risks to health than heterosexual women. This mixed-methods systematic review evaluated recent studies on health experiences of UK SMW, published 2010-2018. Analysis was through narrative thematic description and synthesis. Identified were 23,103 citations, 26 studies included, of which 22 provided qualitative and nine quantitative results. SMW had worse health experiences that might impact negatively on access, service uptake and health outcomes. Findings highlighted significant barriers facing SMW, including heteronormative assumptions, perceptions and experiences of negative responses to coming out, ignorance and prejudice from healthcare professionals, and barriers to raising concerns or complaints. Little information was available about bisexual and trans women's issues. Findings highlighted the need for explicit and consistent education for healthcare professionals on SMW issues, and stronger application of non-discrimination policies in clinical settings. ",
        "Synaptic proximity enables NMDAR signalling to promote brain metastasis. Metastasis-the disseminated growth of tumours in distant organs-underlies cancer mortality. Breast-to-brain metastasis (B2BM) is a common and disruptive form of cancer and is prevalent in the aggressive basal-like subtype, but is also found at varying frequencies in all cancer subtypes. Previous studies revealed parameters of breast cancer metastasis to the brain, but its preference for this site remains an enigma. Here we show that B2BM cells co-opt a neuronal signalling pathway that was recently implicated in invasive tumour growth, involving activation by glutamate ligands of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs), which is key in model systems for metastatic colonization of the brain and is associated with poor prognosis. Whereas NMDAR activation is autocrine in some primary tumour types, human and mouse B2BM cells express receptors but secrete insufficient glutamate to induce signalling, which is instead achieved by the formation of pseudo-tripartite synapses between cancer cells and glutamatergic neurons, presenting a rationale for brain metastasis.

To be considered practice influential (PI), a trial must have been associated with guideline care through its inclusion in National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) clinical guidelines or US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) new drug approvals in favor of a recommended treatment. Data were analyzed from June 15, 2018, through March 29, 2019. Main Outcomes and Measures: Estimated overall rate of PI trials, as well as trends over time. The total federal investment supporting the set of trials was also determined. Results: In total, 182 trials consisting of 148\u202f028 patients were studied. Eighty-two studies (45.1%; 95% CI, 37.7%-52.6%) were PI, of which 70 (38.5%) influenced NCCN guidelines, 6 (3.3%) influenced FDA new drug approvals, and 6 (3.3%) influenced both. The number of PI trials was 47 of 65 (72.3%) among those with positive findings and 35 of 117 (29.9%) among those with negative findings. Thus, 35 of 82 PI trials (42.7%) were based on studies with negative findings, with nearly half of these studies (17 of 35\u2009[48.6%]) reaffirming standard of care compared with experimental therapy. The total federal investment spent in conducting the trials was $1.36 billion (2017 US dollars), a rate of $7.5 million per study or $16.6 million per PI trial. Conclusions and Relevance: Nearly half of all phase 3 trials by one of the NCTN's largest groups were associated with guideline care or new drug indications, including those with positive and negative findings. Compared with the costs of a new drug approval in pharmaceutical companies, typically estimated at more than $1 billion, the amount of federal funds invested to provide this valuable evidence was modest. These results suggest that the NCTN program contributes clinically meaningful, cost-efficient evidence to guide patient care. ",
        "Assessment of Accuracy of an Artificial Intelligence Algorithm to Detect Melanoma in Images of Skin Lesions. Importance: A high proportion of suspicious pigmented skin lesions referred for investigation are benign. Techniques to improve the accuracy of melanoma diagnoses throughout the patient pathway are needed to reduce the pressure on secondary care and pathology services. Objective: To determine the accuracy of an artificial intelligence algorithm in identifying melanoma in dermoscopic images of lesions taken with smartphone and digital single-lens reflex (DSLR) cameras. Design, Setting, and Participants: This prospective, multicenter, single-arm, masked diagnostic trial took place in dermatology and plastic surgery clinics in 7 UK hospitals. Dermoscopic images of suspicious and control skin lesions from 514 patients with at least 1 suspicious pigmented skin lesion scheduled for biopsy were captured on 3 different cameras. Data were collected from January 2017 to July 2018. Clinicians and the Deep Ensemble for Recognition of Malignancy, a deterministic artificial intelligence algorithm trained to identify melanoma in dermoscopic images of pigmented skin lesions using deep learning techniques, assessed the likelihood of melanoma. Initial data analysis was conducted in September 2018; further analysis was conducted from February 2019 to August 2019. Interventions: Clinician and algorithmic assessment of melanoma. Main Outcomes and Measures: Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), sensitivity, and specificity of the algorithmic and specialist assessment, determined using histopathology diagnosis as the criterion standard. Results: The study population of 514 patients included 279 women (55.7%) and 484 white patients (96.8%), with a mean (SD) age of 52.1 (18.6) years. A total of 1550 images of skin lesions were included in the analysis (551 [35.6%] biopsied lesions; 999 [64.4%] control lesions); 286 images (18.6%) were used to train the algorithm, and a further 849 (54.8%) images were missing or unsuitable for analysis. Of the biopsied lesions that were assessed by the algorithm and specialists, 125 (22.7%) were diagnosed as melanoma. Of these, 77 (16.7%) were used for the primary analysis. The algorithm achieved an AUROC of 90.1% (95% CI, 86.3%-94.0%) for biopsied lesions and 95.8% (95% CI, 94.1%-97.6%) for all lesions using iPhone 6s images; an AUROC of 85.8% (95% CI, 81.0%-90.7%) for biopsied lesions and 93.8% (95% CI, 91.4%-96.2%) for all lesions using Galaxy S6 images; and an AUROC of 86.9% (95% CI, 80.8%-93.0%) for biopsied lesions and 91.8% (95% CI, 87.5%-96.1%) for all lesions using DSLR camera images. At 100% sensitivity, the algorithm achieved a specificity of 64.8% with iPhone 6s images. Specialists achieved an AUROC of 77.8% (95% CI, 72.5%-81.9%) and a specificity of 69.9%. Conclusions and Relevance: In this study, the algorithm demonstrated an ability to identify melanoma from dermoscopic images of selected lesions with an accuracy similar to that of specialists. ",
        "Cortical and subcortical alterations associated with precision visuomotor behavior in individuals with autism spectrum disorder. In addition to core deficits in social-communication abilities and repetitive behaviors and interests, many patients with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) experience developmental comorbidities, including sensorimotor issues. Sensorimotor issues are common in ASD and associated with more severe clinical symptoms. Importantly, sensorimotor behaviors are precisely quantifiable and highly translational, offering promising targets for neurophysiological studies of ASD. We used functional MRI to identify brain regions associated with sensorimotor behavior using a visually guided precision gripping task in individuals with ASD (n = 20) and age-, IQ-, and handedness-matched controls (n = 18). During visuomotor behavior, individuals with ASD showed greater force variability than controls. The blood oxygen level-dependent signal for multiple cortical and subcortical regions was associated with force variability, including motor and premotor cortex, posterior parietal cortex, extrastriate cortex, putamen, and cerebellum. Activation in the right premotor cortex scaled with sensorimotor variability in controls but not in ASD. Individuals with ASD showed greater activation than controls in left putamen and left cerebellar lobule VIIb, and activation in these regions was associated with more severe clinically rated symptoms of ASD. Together, these results suggest that greater sensorimotor variability in ASD is associated with altered cortical-striatal processes supporting action selection and cortical-cerebellar circuits involved in feedback-guided reactive adjustments of motor output. Our findings also indicate that atypical organization of visuomotor cortical circuits may result in heightened reliance on subcortical circuits typically dedicated to motor skill acquisition. Overall, these results provide new evidence that sensorimotor alterations in ASD involve aberrant cortical and subcortical organization that may contribute to key clinical issues in patients.NEW & NOTEWORTHY This is the first known study to examine functional brain activation during precision visuomotor behavior in autism spectrum disorder (ASD). We replicate previous findings of elevated force variability in ASD and find these deficits are associated with atypical function of ventral premotor cortex, putamen, and posterolateral cerebellum, indicating cortical-striatal processes supporting action selection and cortical-cerebellar circuits involved in feedback-guided reactive adjustments of motor output may be key targets for understanding the neurobiology of ASD.

        "Lowering circulating apolipoprotein E levels improves aged bone fracture healing. Age is a well-established risk factor for impaired bone fracture healing. Here, we identify a role for apolipoprotein E (ApoE) in age-associated impairment of bone fracture healing and osteoblast differentiation, and we investigate the mechanism by which ApoE alters these processes. We identified that, in both humans and mice, circulating ApoE levels increase with age. We assessed bone healing in WT and ApoE-/- mice after performing tibial fracture surgery: bone deposition was higher within fracture calluses from ApoE-/- mice. In vitro recombinant ApoE (rApoE) treatment of differentiating osteoblasts decreased cellular differentiation and matrix mineralization. Moreover, this rApoE treatment decreased osteoblast glycolytic activity while increasing lipid uptake and fatty acid oxidation. Using parabiosis models, we determined that circulating ApoE plays a strong inhibitory role in bone repair. Using an adeno-associated virus-based siRNA system, we decreased circulating ApoE levels in 24-month-old mice and demonstrated that, as a result, fracture calluses from these aged mice displayed enhanced bone deposition and mechanical strength. Our results demonstrate that circulating ApoE as an aging factor inhibits bone fracture healing by altering osteoblast metabolism, thereby identifying ApoE as a new therapeutic target for improving bone repair in the elderly.

        "Autocrine activin A signalling in ovarian cancer cells regulates secretion of interleukin 6, autophagy, and cachexia. BACKGROUND: The majority of patients with advanced cancer develop cachexia, a weight loss syndrome that severely reduces quality of life and limits survival. Our understanding of the underlying mechanisms that cause the condition is limited, and there are currently no treatment options that can completely reverse cachexia. Several tumour-derived factors and inflammatory mediators have been suggested to contribute to weight loss in cachectic patients. However, inconsistencies between studies are recurrent. Activin A and interleukin 6 (IL-6) are among the best studied factors that seem to be important, and several studies support their individual role in cachexia development. METHODS: We investigated the interplay between activin A and IL-6 in the cachexia-inducing TOV21G cell line, both in culture and in tumours in mice. We previously found that the human TOV21G cells secrete IL-6 that induces autophagy in reporter cells and cachexia in mice. Using this established cachexia cell model, we targeted autocrine activin A by genetic, chemical, and biological approaches. The secretion of IL-6 from the cancer cells was determined in both culture and tumour-bearing mice by a species-specific ELISA. Autophagy reporter cells were used to monitor the culture medium for autophagy-inducing activities, and muscle mass changes were evaluated in tumour-bearing mice. RESULTS: We show that activin A acts in an autocrine manner to promote the synthesis and secretion of IL-6 from cancer cells. By inhibiting activin A signalling, the production of IL-6 from the cancer cells is reduced by 40-50% (up to 42% reduction on protein level, P = 0.0048, and 48% reduction on mRNA level, P = 0.0308). Significantly reduced IL-6 secretion (P < 0.05) from the cancer cells is consistently observed when using biological, chemical, and genetic approaches to interfere with the autocrine activin A loop. Inhibiting activin signalling also reduces the ability of the cancer cells to accelerate autophagy in non-cancerous cells (up to 43% reduced autophagy flux, P = 0.0006). Coherent to the in vitro data, the use of an anti-activin receptor 2 antibody in cachectic tumour-bearing mice reduces serum levels of cancer cell-derived IL-6 by 62% (from 417 to 159 pg/mL, P = 0.03), and, importantly, it reverses cachexia and counteracts loss of all measured muscle groups (P < 0.0005). CONCLUSIONS: Our data support a functional link between activin A and IL-6 signalling pathways and indicate that interference with activin A-induced IL-6 secretion from the tumour has therapeutic potential for cancer-induced cachexia.

        "Low-barrier hydrogen bonds in enzyme cooperativity. The underlying molecular mechanisms of cooperativity and allosteric regulation are well understood for many proteins, with haemoglobin and aspartate transcarbamoylase serving as prototypical examples1,2. The binding of effectors typically causes a structural transition of the protein that is propagated through signalling pathways to remote sites and involves marked changes on the tertiary and sometimes even the quaternary level1-5. However, the origin of these signals and the molecular mechanism of long-range signalling at an atomic level remain unclear5-8. The different spatial scales and timescales in signalling pathways render experimental observation challenging; in particular, the positions and movement of mobile protons cannot be visualized by current methods of structural analysis. Here we report the experimental observation of fluctuating low-barrier hydrogen bonds as switching elements in cooperativity pathways of multimeric enzymes. We have observed these low-barrier hydrogen bonds in ultra-high-resolution X-ray crystallographic structures of two multimeric enzymes, and have validated their assignment using computational calculations. Catalytic events at the active sites switch between low-barrier hydrogen bonds and ordinary hydrogen bonds in a circuit that consists of acidic side chains and water molecules, transmitting a signal through the collective repositioning of protons by behaving as an atomistic Newton's cradle. The resulting communication synchronizes catalysis in the oligomer. Our studies provide several lines of evidence and a working model for not only the existence of low-barrier hydrogen bonds in proteins, but also a connection to enzyme cooperativity. This finding suggests new principles of drug and enzyme design, in which sequences of residues can be purposefully included to enable long-range communication and thus the regulation of engineered biomolecules.

        "Physical and Functional Compartmentalization of Archaeal Chromosomes. The three-dimensional organization of chromosomes can have a profound impact on their replication and expression. The chromosomes of higher eukaryotes possess discrete compartments that are characterized by differing transcriptional activities. Contrastingly, most bacterial chromosomes have simpler organization with local domains, the boundaries of which are influenced by gene expression. Numerous studies have revealed that the higher-order architectures of bacterial and eukaryotic chromosomes are dependent on the actions of structural maintenance of chromosomes (SMC) superfamily protein complexes, in particular, the near-universal condensin complex. Intriguingly, however, many archaea, including members of the genus Sulfolobus do not encode canonical condensin. We describe chromosome conformation capture experiments on Sulfolobus species. These reveal the presence of distinct domains along Sulfolobus chromosomes that undergo discrete and specific higher-order interactions, thus defining two compartment types. We observe causal linkages between compartment identity, gene expression, and binding of a hitherto uncharacterized SMC superfamily protein that we term \"coalescin.\". ",
        "The PI(4)P phosphatase Sac2 controls insulin granule docking and release. Insulin granule biogenesis involves transport to, and stable docking at, the plasma membrane before priming and fusion. Defects in this pathway result in impaired insulin secretion and are a hallmark of type 2 diabetes. We now show that the phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate phosphatase Sac2 localizes to insulin granules in a substrate-dependent manner and that loss of Sac2 results in impaired insulin secretion. Sac2 operates upstream of granule docking, since loss of Sac2 prevented granule tethering to the plasma membrane and resulted in both reduced granule density and number of exocytic events. Sac2 levels correlated positively with the number of docked granules and exocytic events in clonal \u03b2 cells and with insulin secretion in human pancreatic islets, and Sac2 expression was reduced in islets from type 2 diabetic subjects. Taken together, we identified a phosphoinositide switch on the surface on insulin granules that is required for stable granule docking at the plasma membrane and impaired in human type 2 diabetes. ",
        "An African Salmonella Typhimurium ST313 sublineage with extensive drug-resistance and signatures of host adaptation. Bloodstream infections by Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium constitute a major health burden in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). These invasive non-typhoidal (iNTS) infections are dominated by isolates of the antibiotic resistance-associated sequence type (ST) 313. Here, we report emergence of ST313 sublineage II.1 in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Sublineage II.1 exhibits extensive drug resistance, involving a combination of multidrug resistance, extended spectrum \u03b2-lactamase production and azithromycin resistance. ST313 lineage II.1 isolates harbour an IncHI2 plasmid we name pSTm-ST313-II.1, with one\u00a0isolate also exhibiting decreased ciprofloxacin susceptibility. Whole genome sequencing reveals that ST313 II.1 isolates have accumulated genetic signatures potentially associated with altered pathogenicity and host adaptation, related to changes observed in biofilm formation and metabolic capacity. Sublineage II.1 emerged at the beginning of the 21st century and is involved in on-going outbreaks. Our data provide evidence of further evolution within the ST313 clade associated with iNTS in SSA.

        "Mate preference priorities in the East and West: A cross-cultural test of the mate preference priority model. OBJECTIVE: Mate choice involves trading-off several preferences. Research on this process tends to examine mate preference prioritization in homogenous samples using a small number of traits and thus provide little insight into whether prioritization patterns reflect a universal human nature. This study examined whether prioritization patterns, and their accompanying sex differences, are consistent across Eastern and Western cultures. METHOD: In the largest test of the mate preference priority model to date, we asked an international sample of participants (N\u00a0=\u00a02,477) to design an ideal long-term partner by allocating mate dollars to eight traits using three budgets. Unlike previous versions of the task, we included traits known to vary in importance by culture (e.g., religiosity and chastity). RESULTS: Under low budget conditions, Eastern and Western participants differed in their mate dollar allocation for almost every trait (average d\u00a0=\u00a00.42), indicating that culture influences prioritization. Despite these differences, traits fundamental for the reproductive success of each sex in the ancestral environment were prioritized by both Eastern and Western participants. CONCLUSION: The tendency to prioritize reproductively fundamental traits is present in both Eastern and Western cultures. The psychological mechanisms responsible for this process produce similar prioritization patterns despite cross-cultural variation. ",
        "Chronic Low Dose Oral Exposure to Microcystin-LR Exacerbates Hepatic Injury in a Murine Model of Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease. Microcystins are potent hepatotoxins that have become a global health concern in recent years. Their actions in at-risk populations with pre-existing liver disease is unknown. We tested the hypothesis that the No Observed Adverse Effect Level (NOAEL) of Microcystin-LR (MC-LR) established in healthy mice would cause exacerbation of hepatic injury in a murine model (Leprdb/J) of Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD). Ten-week-old male Leprdb/J mice were gavaged with 50 \u03bcg/kg, 100 \u03bcg/kg MC-LR or vehicle every 48 h for 4 weeks (n = 15-17 mice/group). Early mortality was observed in both the 50 \u03bcg/kg (1/17, 6%), and 100 \u03bcg/kg (3/17, 18%) MC-LR exposed mice. MC-LR exposure resulted in significant increases in circulating alkaline phosphatase levels, and histopathological markers of hepatic injury as well as significant upregulation of genes associated with hepatotoxicity, necrosis, nongenotoxic hepatocarcinogenicity and oxidative stress response. In addition, we observed exposure dependent changes in protein phosphorylation sites in pathways involved in inflammation, immune function, and response to oxidative stress. These results demonstrate that exposure to MC-LR at levels that are below the NOAEL established in healthy animals results in significant exacerbation of hepatic injury that is accompanied by genetic and phosphoproteomic dysregulation in key signaling pathways in the livers of NAFLD mice.

        "Decoupling of timescales reveals sparse convergent CPG network in the adult spinal cord. During the generation of rhythmic movements, most spinal neurons receive an oscillatory synaptic drive. The neuronal architecture underlying this drive is unknown, and the corresponding network size and sparseness have not yet been addressed. If the input originates from a small central pattern generator (CPG) with dense divergent connectivity, it will induce correlated input to all receiving neurons, while sparse convergent wiring will induce a weak correlation, if any. Here, we use pairwise recordings of spinal neurons to measure synaptic correlations and thus infer the wiring architecture qualitatively. A strong correlation on a slow timescale implies functional relatedness and a common source, which will also cause correlation on fast timescale due to shared synaptic connections. However, we consistently find marginal coupling between slow and fast correlations regardless of neuronal identity. This suggests either sparse convergent connectivity or a CPG network with recurrent inhibition that actively decorrelates common input. ",
        "Evolutionary stability of collateral sensitivity to antibiotics in the model pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Evolution is at the core of the impending antibiotic crisis. Sustainable therapy must thus account for the adaptive potential of pathogens. One option is to exploit evolutionary trade-offs, like collateral sensitivity, where evolved resistance to one antibiotic causes hypersensitivity to another one. To date, the evolutionary stability and thus clinical utility of this trade-off is unclear. We performed a critical experimental test on this key requirement, using evolution experiments with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and identified three main outcomes: (i) bacteria commonly failed to counter hypersensitivity and went extinct; (ii) hypersensitivity sometimes converted into multidrug resistance; and (iii) resistance gains frequently caused re-sensitization to the previous drug, thereby maintaining the trade-off. Drug order affected the evolutionary outcome, most likely due to variation in the effect size of collateral sensitivity, epistasis among adaptive mutations, and fitness costs. Our finding of robust genetic trade-offs and drug-order effects can guide design of evolution-informed antibiotic therapy. ",
        "Long-term immunity against yellow fever in children vaccinated during infancy: a longitudinal cohort study. BACKGROUND: A single dose of vaccine against yellow fever is routinely administered to infants aged 9-12 months under the Expanded Programme on Immunization, but the long-term outcome of vaccination in this age group is unknown. We aimed to evaluate the long-term persistence of neutralising antibodies to yellow fever virus following routine vaccination in infancy. METHODS: We did a longitudinal cohort study, using a microneutralisation assay to measure protective antibodies against yellow fever in Malian and Ghanaian children vaccinated around age 9 months and followed up for 4\u00b75 years (Mali), or 2\u00b73 and 6\u00b70 years (Ghana). Healthy children with available day-0 sera, a complete follow-up history, and no record of yellow fever revaccination were included; children seropositive for yellow fever at baseline were excluded. We standardised antibody concentrations with reference to the yellow fever WHO International Standard. FINDINGS: We included 587 Malian and 436 Ghanaian children vaccinated between June 5, 2009, and Dec 26, 2012. In the Malian group, 296 (50\u00b74%, 95% CI 46\u00b74-54\u00b75) were seropositive (antibody concentration \u22650\u00b75 IU/mL) 4\u00b75 years after vaccination. Among the Ghanaian children, 121 (27\u00b78%, 23\u00b75-32\u00b70) were seropositive after 2\u00b73 years. These results show a large decrease from the proportions of seropositive infants 28 days after vaccination, 96\u00b77% in Mali and 72\u00b77% in Ghana, reported by a previous study of both study populations. The number of seropositive children increased to 188 (43\u00b71%, 95% CI 38\u00b75-47\u00b78) in the Ghanaian group 6\u00b70 years after vaccination, but this result might be confounded by unrecorded revaccination or natural infection with wild yellow fever virus during a 2011-12 outbreak in northern Ghana. INTERPRETATION: Rapid waning of immunity during the early years after vaccination of 9-month-old infants argues for a revision of the single-dose recommendation for this target population in endemic countries. The short duration of immunity in many vaccinees suggests that booster vaccination is necessary to meet the 80% population immunity threshold for prevention of yellow fever outbreaks.

        "HIF-transcribed p53 chaperones HIF-1\u03b1. Chronic hypoxia is associated with a variety of physiological conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, ischemia/reperfusion injury, stroke, diabetic vasculopathy, epilepsy and cancer. At the molecular level, hypoxia manifests its effects via activation of HIF-dependent transcription. On the other hand, an important transcription factor p53, which controls a myriad of biological functions, is rendered transcriptionally inactive under hypoxic conditions. p53 and HIF-1\u03b1 are known to share a mysterious relationship and play an ambiguous role in the regulation of hypoxia-induced cellular changes. Here we demonstrate a novel pathway where HIF-1\u03b1 transcriptionally upregulates both WT and MT p53 by binding to five response elements in p53 promoter. In hypoxic cells, this HIF-1\u03b1-induced p53 is transcriptionally inefficient but is abundantly available for protein-protein interactions. Further, both WT and MT p53 proteins bind and chaperone HIF-1\u03b1 to stabilize its binding at its downstream DNA response elements. This p53-induced chaperoning of HIF-1\u03b1 increases synthesis of HIF-regulated genes and thus the efficiency of hypoxia-induced molecular changes. This basic biology finding has important implications not only in the design of anti-cancer strategies but also for other physiological conditions where hypoxia results in disease manifestation. ",

        "The Effect of Flavored E-cigarettes on Murine Allergic Airways Disease. Flavored e-cigarettes are preferred by the majority of users yet their potential toxicity is unknown. Therefore our aim was to determine the effect of selected flavored e-cigarettes, with or without nicotine, on allergic airways disease in mice. Balb/c mice were challenged with PBS or house dust mite (HDM) (Days 0, 7, 14-18) and exposed to room air or e-cigarette aerosol for 30\u2009min twice daily, 6 days/week from Days 0-18 (n\u2009=\u20098-12/group). Mice were exposed to Room Air, vehicle control (50%VG/%50PG), Black Licorice, Kola, Banana Pudding or Cinnacide without or with 12\u2009mg/mL nicotine. Mice were assessed at 72\u2009hours after the final HDM challenge. Compared to mice challenged with HDM and exposed to Room Air, nicotine-free Cinnacide reduced airway inflammation (p\u2009=\u20090.045) and increased peripheral airway hyperresponsiveness (p\u2009=\u20090.02), nicotine-free Banana Pudding increased soluble lung collagen (p\u2009=\u20090.049), with a trend towards increased airway inflammation with nicotine-free Black Licorice exposure (p\u2009=\u20090.089). In contrast, all e-cigarettes containing nicotine suppressed airway inflammation (p\u2009<\u20090.001 for all) but did not alter airway hyperresponsiveness or airway remodeling. Flavored e-cigarettes without nicotine had significant but heterogeneous effects on features of allergic airways disease. This suggests that some flavored e-cigarettes may alter asthma pathophysiology even when used without nicotine. ",
        "European hedgehogs (Erinaceus europaeus) as a natural reservoir of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus carrying mecC in Denmark. OBJECTIVES: A recent study from Sweden showed that European hedgehogs may constitute a reservoir for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), but this host-parasite relationship remains to be investigated in other countries. In this study, we therefore sought to: 1) determine the dissemination of MRSA in European hedgehogs throughout Denmark; 2) investigate determinants of MRSA carriage in hedgehogs; 3) determine the potential for zoonotic transmission of MRSA from hedgehogs to humans; and 4) characterise the detected MRSA on both a phenotypic and molecular level. METHODS: Nasal swabs were taken from 188 dead hedgehogs collected by volunteers throughout Denmark to determine the occurrence of MRSA. Additionally, 16 hedgehog rehabilitators were tested for potential zoonotic transmission of MRSA from hedgehogs to humans. The swabs were incubated in tryptic soy broth supplemented with 6.5% NaCl, followed by spread of 10 \u03bcl on Brilliance MRSA 2 agar. One presumptive MRSA colony from each plate was subcultured on 5% blood agar. All S. aureus subcultures were verified by a PCR assay detecting mecA, mecC, lukF-PV, scn, and spa, followed by spa typing. RESULTS: A total of 114 (61%) hedgehogs carried mecC-MRSA, whereas none carried mecA-MRSA. The detected mecC-MRSA belonged to two genetic lineages CC130 (spa-types: t528, t843, t1048, t3256, t3570, t6220, t17133) and CC1943 (spa-types: t978, t2345, t3391, t8835, t16868), 52% of which were spa-type t843 (CC130).The detection rate of mecC-MRSA in the hedgehogs was similar regardless of cause of death, sex, region and habitat type. None of the hedgehog rehabilitators carried MRSA. CONCLUSIONS: This nationwide study confirms a high occurrence of mecC-MRSA in hedgehogs, which could serve as a natural reservoir for this specific type of MRSA. Furthermore, our study did not find signs of zoonotic transmission of mecC-MRSA to hedgehog rehabilitators. ",
        "Molecular basis of dengue virus serotype 2 morphological switch from 29\u00b0C to 37\u00b0C. The ability of DENV2 to display different morphologies (hence different antigenic properties) complicates vaccine and therapeutics development. Previous studies showed most strains of laboratory adapted DENV2 particles changed from smooth to \"bumpy\" surfaced morphology when the temperature is switched from 29\u00b0C at 37\u00b0C. Here we identified five envelope (E) protein residues different between two alternative passage history DENV2 NGC strains exhibiting smooth or bumpy surface morphologies. Several mutations performed on the smooth DENV2 infectious clone destabilized the surface, as observed by cryoEM. Molecular dynamics simulations demonstrated how chemically subtle substitution at various positions destabilized dimeric interactions between E proteins. In contrast, three out of four DENV2 clinical isolates showed a smooth surface morphology at 37\u00b0C, and only at high fever temperature (40\u00b0C) did they become \"bumpy\". These results imply vaccines should contain particles representing both morphologies. For prophylactic and therapeutic treatments, this study also informs on which types of antibodies should be used at different stages of an infection, i.e., those that bind to monomeric E proteins on the bumpy surface or across multiple E proteins on the smooth surfaced virus.

        "The rough sound of salience enhances aversion through neural synchronisation. Being able to produce sounds that capture attention and elicit rapid reactions is the prime goal of communication. One strategy, exploited by alarm signals, consists in emitting fast but perceptible amplitude modulations in the roughness range (30-150\u2009Hz). Here, we investigate the perceptual and neural mechanisms underlying aversion to such temporally salient sounds. By measuring subjective aversion to repetitive acoustic transients, we identify a nonlinear pattern of aversion restricted to the roughness range. Using human intracranial recordings, we show that rough sounds do not merely affect local auditory processes but instead synchronise large-scale, supramodal, salience-related networks in a steady-state, sustained manner. Rough sounds synchronise activity throughout superior temporal regions, subcortical and cortical limbic areas, and the frontal cortex, a network classically involved in aversion processing. This pattern correlates with subjective aversion in all these regions, consistent with the hypothesis that roughness enhances auditory aversion through spreading of neural synchronisation. ",
        "Classification of Decompensated Heart Failure From Clinical and Home Ballistocardiography. OBJECTIVE: To improve home monitoring of heart failure patients so as to reduce emergency room visits and hospital readmissions. We aim to do this by analyzing the ballistocardiogram (BCG) to evaluate the clinical state of the patient. METHODS: 1) High quality BCG signals were collected at home from HF patients after discharge. 2) The BCG recordings were preprocessed to exclude outliers and artifacts. 3) Parameters of the BCG that contain information about the cardiovascular system were extracted. These features were used for the task of classification of the BCG recording based on the status of HF. RESULTS: The best AUC score for the task of classification obtained was 0.78 using slight variant of the leave one subject out validation method. CONCLUSION: This work demonstrates that high quality BCG signals can be collected in a home environment and used to detect the clinical state of HF patients. SIGNIFICANCE: In future work, a clinician/caregiver can be introduced into the system so that appropriate interventions can be performed based on the clinical state monitored at home. ",
        "Open data on industry payments to healthcare providers reveal potential hidden costs to the public. Healthcare industry players make payments to medical providers for non-research expenses. While these payments may pose conflicts of interest, their relationship with overall healthcare costs remains largely unknown. In this study, we linked Open Payments data on providers' industry payments with Medicare data on healthcare costs. We investigated 374,766 providers' industry payments and healthcare costs. We demonstrate that providers receiving higher amounts of industry payments tend to bill higher drug and medical costs. Specifically, we find that a 10% increase in industry payments is associated with 1.3% higher medical and 1.8% higher drug costs. For a typical provider, for example, a 10% or $25 increase in annual industry payments would be associated with approximately $1,100 higher medical costs and $100 higher drug costs. Furthermore, the association between payments and healthcare costs varies markedly across states and correlates with political leaning, being stronger in more conservative states. ",
        "The association between headache and low back pain: a systematic review. BACKGROUND: To systematically review studies quantifying the association between primary chronic headaches and persistent low back pain (LBP). MAIN TEXT: We searched five electronic databases. We included case-control, cross-sectional and cohort studies that included a headache and back pain free group, reporting on any association between persistent LBP and primary headache disorders. Methodological quality was assessed using Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Our primary outcome was the association between primary headache disorders and persistent LBP. Our secondary outcomes were any associations between severity of LBP and severity of headache, and the relationship between specific headache sub-types classified as per International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD) criteria and persistent LBP. We included 14 studies. The sizes of the studies ranged from 88 participants to a large international study with 404, 206 participants. Odds ratios for the association were between 1.55 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.13-2.11) and 8.00 (95% CI 5.3-12.1). Study heterogeneity meant statistical pooling was not possible. Only two studies presented data investigating persistent LBP and chronic headache disorders in accordance with ICDH criteria. CONCLUSIONS: We identified a positive association between persistent LBP and primary headache disorders. The quality of the review findings is limited by diversity of populations, study designs and uncertainly about headache and LBP definitions. TRIAL REGISTRATION: PROSPERO 2018 CRD42018086557 . ",
        "DNA methyltransferase inhibitors induce a BRCAness phenotype that sensitizes NSCLC to PARP inhibitor and ionizing radiation. A minority of cancers have breast cancer gene (BRCA) mutations that confer sensitivity to poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors (PARPis), but the role for PARPis in BRCA-proficient cancers is not well established. This suggests the need for novel combination therapies to expand the use of these drugs. Recent reports that low doses of DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (DNMTis) plus PARPis enhance PARPi efficacy in BRCA-proficient AML subtypes, breast, and ovarian cancer open up the possibility that this strategy may apply to other sporadic cancers. We identify a key mechanistic aspect of this combination therapy in nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC): that the DNMTi component creates a BRCAness phenotype through downregulating expression of key homologous recombination and nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) genes. Importantly, from a translational perspective, the above changes in DNA repair processes allow our combinatorial PARPi and DNMTi therapy to robustly sensitize NSCLC cells to ionizing radiation in vitro and in vivo. Our combinatorial approach introduces a biomarker strategy and a potential therapy paradigm for treating BRCA-proficient cancers like NSCLC. ",
        "Trend of antidepressants before, during, and after pregnancy across two decades-A population-based study. INTRODUCTION: Factors that influence antidepressant (AD) prescription and use during pregnancy are multiple including, in particular, the balance between the potential risk of untreated depression and the potential risk of AD treatment. Surveillance of temporal trends of AD use might identify areas requiring further research. We studied the use of ADs before, during, and after pregnancy using national data across two decades in Denmark. METHODS: We included 1,232,233 pregnancies leading to live birth in Denmark between 1 January 1997 and 31 December 2016. Information on redemption of AD prescriptions was obtained from the Danish National Prescription Register. RESULTS: We identified 29,504 (2.4%) pregnancies having at least one AD prescription (96,232 AD prescriptions) during pregnancy. The majority redeemed more than one prescription (69.7%) often for a single kind of AD (83.5%), and in 94% of the AD-exposed pregnancies, the estimated duration of treatment was 1\u00a0month or longer. Prescription of ADs during pregnancy increased steadily from 0.4% in 1997 to 4.6% in 2011, but decreased thereafter to 3.1% in 2016. The proportion of pregnancies with ADs in 2011 was 6.05-fold higher than that in 1997. The temporal trends in AD prescription in the years before and after pregnancy were similar to the trend during pregnancy. The decreasing use of ADs during pregnancy after 2011 was mainly driven by a decrease in the use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), especially citalopram, the main type of SSRIs used in Denmark. CONCLUSION: Prescription of ADs during pregnancy in Denmark increased steadily from 1997 to 2011 but decreased sharply thereafter. More research is needed to show whether the same trend exists in other populations, like women of reproductive age, men of reproductive age, and old people, and other countries. We also need to find explanation for the decreasing trend in recent years and potential risk for untreated depression. ",
        "Predicting Exercise With a Personality Facet: Planfulness and Goal Achievement. Establishing reliable predictors of health behavior is a goal of health psychology. A relevant insight from personality psychology is that facets can predict specific behaviors better than broad traits do. We hypothesized that we could predict physical activity with a facet of conscientiousness related to goal pursuit-planfulness. We measured the relationship between Planfulness Scale scores and physical activity in 282 individuals over a total of 20 weeks, using a piecewise latent growth curve model. We additionally tested whether planfulness uniquely relates to activity when compared with related constructs. Finally, ratings of participants' written goals were correlated with these personality traits and physical activity. We found that planfulness was positively associated with average visits to a recreational center, that planfulness explained unique variance in activity, and that planfulness correlated with the descriptiveness of written goals. We conclude that the Planfulness Scale is a valid measurement uniquely suited to predicting goal achievement. ",
        "Knockout model reveals the role of Nischarin in mammary gland development, breast tumorigenesis and response to metformin treatment. Previously, our lab discovered the protein Nischarin and uncovered its role in regulating cell migration and invasion via its interactions with several proteins. We subsequently described a role for Nischarin in breast cancer, in which it is frequently underexpressed. To characterize Nischarin's role in breast tumorigenesis and mammary gland development more completely, we deleted a critical region of the Nisch gene (exons 7-10) from the mouse genome and observed the effects. Mammary glands in mutant animals showed delayed terminal end bud formation but did not develop breast tumors spontaneously. Therefore, we interbred the animals with transgenic mice expressing the mouse mammary tumor virus-polyoma middle T-antigen (MMTV-PyMT) oncogene. The MMTV-PyMT mammary glands lacking Nischarin showed increased hyperplasia compared to wild-type animal tissues. Furthermore, we observed significantly increased tumor growth and metastasis in Nischarin mutant animals. Surprisingly, Nischarin deletion decreased activity of AMPK and subsequently its downstream effectors. Given this finding, we treated these animals with metformin, which enhances AMPK activity. Here, we show for the first time, metformin activates AMPK signaling and inhibits tumor growth of Nischarin lacking PyMT tumors suggesting a potential use for metformin as a cancer therapeutic, particularly in the case of Nischarin-deficient breast cancers.

        "Pre-diagnostic colonoscopies reduce cancer mortality - results from linked population-based data in South Australia. BACKGROUND: To investigate the association between pre-diagnostic colonoscopy and colorectal cancer mortality in South Australia. METHODS: Colonoscopy histories were obtained for colorectal cancer patients diagnosed in 2003-2013 using linked Medical Benefits Schedule (MBS) claims, hospital-inpatient and cancer-registry data. Colonoscopy histories included the year of colonoscopy, numbers of examinations, and the time from first colonoscopy to diagnosis. Histories of multiple exposures to colonoscopies, and exposures of greater than a year from initial colonoscopy to diagnosis, were regarded as indicators of screening or surveillance activity. Colonoscopies occurring within one year of diagnosis were regarded as more likely to be a response to cancer symptoms than those occurring >\u20091\u2009year before diagnosis. Associations between colonoscopy history and post-diagnostic survival were analysed using sub-hazard ratios (SHRs) from competing risk regression adjusted for socio-demographic and cancer characteristics. RESULTS: Having pre-diagnostic colonoscopy was associated with an unadjusted reduction in risk of colorectal cancer death of 17% (SHR: 0.83, 95% CI 0.78-0.89). After adjusting for time period and sociodemographic characteristics, the risk of colorectal cancer death reduced by 17% for one pre-diagnostic colonoscopy examination; 27% for two pre-diagnostic colonoscopy examinations; and 45% for three or more pre-diagnostic colonoscopy examinations. Those with a time of over one year from first colonoscopy in the study window to diagnosis, when compared with less than one year, had a 17% lower risk of colorectal cancer death in this adjusted analysis. These reductions were substantially reduced or eliminated when also adjusting for less advanced stage. CONCLUSIONS: Pre-diagnostic colonoscopy, and more so, multiple colonoscopies and first colonoscopy occurring over one year from initial colonoscopy to diagnosis, were associated with longer survival post diagnosis. This was largely explained by less advanced cancer stage at the time of diagnosis. ",
        "Studying nucleic\u00a0envelope and plasma membrane mechanics of eukaryotic cells using confocal reflectance interferometric microscopy. Mechanical stress on eukaryotic nucleus has been implicated in a diverse range of diseases including muscular dystrophy and cancer metastasis. Today, there are very few non-perturbative methods to quantify nuclear mechanical properties. Interferometric microscopy, also known as quantitative phase microscopy (QPM), is a powerful tool for studying red blood cell biomechanics. The existing QPM tools, however, have not been utilized to study biomechanics of complex eukaryotic cells either due to lack of depth sectioning, limited phase measurement sensitivity, or both. Here, we present depth-resolved confocal reflectance interferometric microscopy as the next generation QPM to study nuclear and plasma membrane biomechanics. The proposed system features multiple confocal scanning foci, affording 1.5 micron depth-resolution and millisecond frame rate. Furthermore, a near common-path interferometer enables quantifying nanometer-scale membrane fluctuations with better than 200 picometers sensitivity. Our results present accurate quantification of nucleic envelope and plasma membrane fluctuations in embryonic stem cells. ",
        "Photothermal incubation of red blood cells by laser for rapid pre-transfusion blood group typing. Safe blood transfusion requires compatibility testing of donor and recipient to prevent potentially fatal transfusion reactions. Detection of immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies requires incubation at 37\u2009\u00b0C, often for up to 15\u2009minutes. Current incubation technology predominantly relies on slow thermal-gradient dependent conduction. Here, we present rapid optical heating via laser, where targeted illumination of a blood-antibody sample in a diagnostic gel card is converted into heat, via photothermal absorption. Our laser-incubator heats the 75\u2009\u00b5L blood-antibody sample to 37\u2009\u00b0C in under 30\u2009seconds. We show that red blood cells act as photothermal agents under near-infrared laser incubation, triggering rapid antigen-antibody binding. We detect no significant damage to the cells or antibodies for laser incubations of up to fifteen minutes. We demonstrate laser-incubated immunohaematological testing to be both faster and more sensitive than current best practice - with clearly positive results seen from laser incubations of just 40\u2009seconds.

        "Novel 2-arylthiopropanoyl-CoA inhibitors of \u03b1-methylacyl-CoA racemase 1A (AMACR; P504S) as potential anti-prostate cancer agents. \u03b1-Methylacyl-CoA racemase (AMACR; P504S) catalyses an essential step in the degradation of branched-chain fatty acids and the activation of ibuprofen and related drugs. AMACR has gained much attention as a drug target and biomarker, since it is found at elevated levels in prostate cancer and several other cancers. Herein, we report the synthesis of 2-(phenylthio)propanoyl-CoA derivatives which provided potent AMACR inhibitory activity (IC50\u202f=\u202f22-100\u202fnM), as measured by the AMACR colorimetric activity assay. Inhibitor potency positively correlates with calculated logP, although 2-(3-benzyloxyphenylthio)propanoyl-CoA and 2-(4-(2-methylpropoxy)phenylthio)propanoyl-CoA were more potent than predicted by this parameter. Subsequently, carboxylic acid precursors were evaluated against androgen-dependent LnCaP prostate cancer cells and androgen-independent Du145 and PC3 prostate cancer cells using the MTS assay. All tested precursor acids showed inhibitory activity against LnCaP, Du145 and PC3 cells at 500\u202f\u00b5M, but lacked activity at 100\u202f\u00b5M. This is the first extensive structure-activity relationship study on the influence of side-chain interactions on the potency of novel rationally designed AMACR inhibitors. ",
        "Beyond cognitive dysfunction: Relevance of ecological validity of neuropsychological tests in multiple sclerosis. In neurological diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS), a neuropsychological assessment is often requested to assist clinicians in evaluating the role of cognition in a patient's level of everyday functioning. To be effective in this charge, it is assumed that performance on neuropsychological tests is related to how a person may function in everyday life, and the question is often asked: \"Are neuropsychological tests ecologically valid?\" In this review, we synthesize the literature that examines the use of neuropsychological tests to assess functioning across a variety of everyday functioning domains in MS (i.e. driving, employment, instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs)). However, we critically examine the usefulness of asking this broad question regarding ecological validity, given the psychometric and conceptual pitfalls it may yield. While many neuropsychological tests may be generally considered \"ecologically valid\" in MS, it is much more helpful to specify for whom, under what circumstances, and to what degree. ",
        "Comparing the reward value of cigarettes and food during tobacco abstinence and nonabstinence. BACKGROUND: Some addiction theories propose that nicotine dependence is characterized by an imbalance between motivation for cigarettes compared to non-drug rewards. This imbalance may become increasingly polarized during abstinence, which further potentiates smoking. The present study evaluated motivation for cigarettes and food during abstinence and nonabstinence in daily smokers. This study modified a previously validated cue-reactivity procedure to include food as a cue condition, thereby allowing the comparison of cigarettes to food and neutral cues. The Choice Behavior Under Cued Conditions (CBUCC) procedure, in which participants are presented with cues and spend money in order to gain immediate access to that cue, generates multiple variables to evaluate motivational factors and drug use behaviors including reward value, craving, seeking, choice time, and consumption. METHODS: Fifty daily cigarette smokers underwent two CBUCC sessions under overnight abstinent and nonabstinent conditions. RESULTS: As an index of reward value, participants spent more money to access cigarettes than food or water and more for food relative to water. Abstinence increased the reward value of cigarettes but did not significantly affect the reward value of food or water. Participants also demonstrated cue-specific craving for cigarettes and food, although overall cigarette craving was greater than food craving. CONCLUSIONS: This study indicated that motivation was greater for cigarettes than food. Abstinence increased motivation for cigarettes but had little impact on motivation for food. This suggests that heavy smokers do not reallocate motivational resources towards cigarettes during abstinence; rather, motivational processes for food remain constant from nonabstinent to abstinent sessions.

        "Circular RNA CircFndc3b modulates cardiac repair after myocardial infarction via FUS/VEGF-A axis. Circular RNAs are generated from many protein-coding genes, but their role in cardiovascular health and disease states remains unknown. Here we report identification of circRNA transcripts that are differentially expressed in post myocardial infarction (MI) mouse hearts including circFndc3b which is significantly down-regulated in the post-MI hearts. Notably, the human circFndc3b ortholog is also significantly down-regulated in cardiac tissues of ischemic cardiomyopathy patients. Overexpression of circFndc3b in cardiac endothelial cells increases vascular endothelial growth factor-A expression and enhances their angiogenic activity and reduces cardiomyocytes and endothelial cell apoptosis. Adeno-associated virus 9 -mediated cardiac overexpression of circFndc3b in post-MI hearts reduces cardiomyocyte apoptosis, enhances neovascularization and improves left ventricular functions. Mechanistically, circFndc3b interacts with the RNA binding protein Fused in Sarcoma to regulate VEGF expression and signaling. These findings highlight a physiological role for circRNAs in cardiac repair and indicate that modulation of circFndc3b expression may represent a potential strategy to promote cardiac function and remodeling after MI.

        "Neonatal CPAP for Respiratory Distress Across Malawi and Mortality. OBJECTIVES: Our aim in this observational study was to monitor continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) usage and outcomes in newborn wards at 26 government hospitals in Malawi after the introduction of CPAP as part of a quality-improvement initiative. CPAP was implemented in 3 phases from 2013 through 2015. METHODS: Survival to discharge was analyzed for neonates treated with nasal oxygen and/or CPAP with admission weights of 1 to 2.49 kg at 24 government hospitals with transfer rates <15%. This analysis includes neonates admitted with respiratory illness for 5.5 months before (621 neonates) and 15 months immediately after CPAP implementation (1836 neonates). A follow-up data analysis was completed for neonates treated with CPAP at all hospitals during an additional 11 months (194 neonates). RESULTS: On implementation of CPAP, survival to discharge improved for all neonates admitted with respiratory distress (48.6% vs 54.5%; P = .012) and for those diagnosed with respiratory distress syndrome (39.8% vs 48.3%; P = .042). There were no significant differences in outcomes for neonates treated with CPAP during the implementation and follow-up periods. Hypothermia on admission was pervasive and associated with poor outcomes. Neonates with normal mean temperatures during CPAP treatment experienced the highest survival rates (65.7% for all neonates treated with CPAP and 60.0% for those diagnosed with respiratory distress syndrome). CONCLUSIONS: A nurse-led CPAP service can improve outcomes for neonates in respiratory distress in low-resource settings. However, the results show that real-world improvements in survival may be limited without access to comprehensive newborn care, especially for small and sick infants. ",
        "Metastatic Conditioning of Myeloid Cells at a Subcutaneous Synthetic Niche Reflects Disease Progression and Predicts Therapeutic Outcomes. Monitoring metastatic events in distal tissues is challenged by their sporadic occurrence in obscure and inaccessible locations within these vital organs. A synthetic biomaterial scaffold can function as a synthetic metastatic niche to reveal the nature of these distal sites. These implanted scaffolds promote tissue ingrowth, which upon cancer initiation is transformed into a metastatic niche that captures aggressive circulating tumor cells. We hypothesized that immune cell phenotypes at synthetic niches reflect the immunosuppressive conditioning within a host that contributes to metastatic cell recruitment and can identify disease progression and response to therapy. We analyzed the expression of 632 immune-centric genes in tissue biopsied from implants at weekly intervals following inoculation. Specific immune populations within implants were then analyzed by single-cell RNA-seq. Dynamic gene expression profiles in innate cells, such as myeloid-derived suppressor cells, macrophages, and dendritic cells, suggest the development of an immunosuppressive microenvironment. These dynamics in immune phenotypes at implants was analogous to that in the diseased lung and had distinct dynamics compared with blood leukocytes. Following a therapeutic excision of the primary tumor, longitudinal tracking of immune phenotypes at the implant in individual mice showed an initial response to therapy, which over time differentiated recurrence versus survival. Collectively, the microenvironment at the synthetic niche acts as a sentinel by reflecting both progression and regression of disease. SIGNIFICANCE: Immune dynamics at biomaterial implants, functioning as a synthetic metastatic niche, provides unique information that correlates with disease progression.

Researchers can use this information to aid proposal development, create or refine a recruitment/retention protocol before implementation, and troubleshoot challenges during implementation. ",
        "Non-core Subunits of the PRC2 Complex Are Collectively Required for Its Target-Site Specificity. The Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) catalyzes H3K27 methylation across the genome, which impacts transcriptional regulation and is critical for establishment of cell identity. Because of its essential function during development and in cancer, understanding the delineation of genome-wide H3K27 methylation patterns has been the focus of intense investigation. PRC2 methylation activity is abundant and dispersed throughout the genome, but the highest activity is specifically directed to a subset of target sites that are stably occupied by the complex and highly enriched for H3K27me3. Here, we show, by systematically knocking out single and multiple non-core subunits of the PRC2 complex in mouse embryonic stem cells, that they each contribute to directing PRC2 activity to target sites. Furthermore, combined knockout of six non-core subunits reveals that, while dispensable for global H3K27 methylation levels, the non-core PRC2 subunits are collectively required for focusing H3K27me3 activity to specific sites in the genome.

        "Nilotinib, an approved leukemia drug, inhibits smoothened signaling in Hedgehog-dependent medulloblastoma. Dysregulation of the seven-transmembrane (7TM) receptor Smoothened (SMO) and other components of the Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway contributes to the development of cancers including basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and medulloblastoma (MB). However, SMO-specific antagonists produced mixed results in clinical trials, marked by limited efficacy and high rate of acquired resistance in tumors. Here we discovered that Nilotinib, an approved inhibitor of several kinases, possesses an anti-Hh activity, at clinically achievable concentrations, due to direct binding to SMO and inhibition of SMO signaling. Nilotinib was more efficacious than the SMO-specific antagonist Vismodegib in inhibiting growth of two Hh-dependent MB cell lines. It also reduced tumor growth in subcutaneous MB mouse xenograft model. These results indicate that in addition to its known activity against several tyrosine-kinase-mediated proliferative pathways, Nilotinib is a direct inhibitor of the Hh pathway. The newly discovered extension of Nilotinib's target profile holds promise for the treatment of Hh-dependent cancers. ",
        "Maternal and paternal depressive symptoms and children's emotional problems at the age of 2 and 5\u00a0years: a longitudinal study. BACKGROUND: Maternal and paternal depressive symptoms are related to children's emotional problems, but their combined effect remains unclear. Here, we constructed four parental longitudinal depressive symptom trajectory groups and studied their associations with children's emotional problems at the age of 2 and 5\u00a0years. METHODS: We did an assessment of maternal and paternal depressive symptoms (gestational week 32, as well as 3, 8 and 24 months postnatally) and children's emotional problems at ages two (N\u00a0=\u00a0939) and five (N\u00a0=\u00a0700) in the CHILD-SLEEP cohort. Three separate maternal and paternal depressive symptom trajectories based on latent profile analysis were combined to form four parental depressive symptom trajectory groups. We compared groups with a general linear model, with children's emotional (total, internalizing and externalizing) - problem scores serving as the dependent variables. RESULTS: At both ages, combined parental depressive symptom trajectories were associated with children's emotional problems: effect sizes were medium for total and small for other domains. According to post hoc comparisons, children whose mothers or both parents had persistent depressive symptoms had significantly more total, externalizing and internalizing problems than did children who had neither parent nor only the father showing depressive symptoms. A higher (and persistent) level of maternal depressive symptoms was related to a higher level of these children's emotional problems, a pattern not evident with paternal depressive symptoms. In all analyses, the interaction effect was nonsignificant between parental trajectories and child gender. CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest that an absence of depressive symptoms in their fathers cannot compensate for the adverse effects of maternal depressive symptoms upon their children. Moreover, paternal depressive symptoms alone do not lead to increased risk for emotional problems in these 2- and 5-year-old children. In contrast, even subclinical levels of maternal depressive symptoms in late pregnancy are associated with increased risk for their children's experiencing internalizing and externalizing emotional problems.

        "Synergistic effects of common schizophrenia risk variants. The mechanisms by which common risk variants of small effect interact to contribute to complex genetic disorders are unclear. Here, we apply a genetic approach, using isogenic human induced pluripotent stem cells, to evaluate the effects of schizophrenia (SZ)-associated common variants predicted to function as SZ expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs). By integrating CRISPR-mediated gene editing, activation and repression technologies to study one putative SZ eQTL (FURIN rs4702) and four top-ranked SZ eQTL genes (FURIN, SNAP91, TSNARE1 and CLCN3), our platform resolves pre- and postsynaptic neuronal deficits, recapitulates genotype-dependent gene expression differences and identifies convergence downstream of SZ eQTL gene perturbations. Our observations highlight the cell-type-specific effects of common variants and demonstrate a synergistic effect between SZ eQTL genes that converges on synaptic function. We propose that the links between rare and common variants implicated in psychiatric disease risk constitute a potentially generalizable phenomenon occurring more widely in complex genetic disorders.

        "Targeted photoredox catalysis in cancer cells. Hypoxic tumours are a major problem for cancer photodynamic therapy. Here, we show that photoredox catalysis can provide an oxygen-independent mechanism of action to combat this problem. We have designed a highly oxidative Ir(III) photocatalyst, [Ir(ttpy)(pq)Cl]PF6 ([1]PF6, where 'ttpy' represents 4'-(p-tolyl)-2,2':6',2''-terpyridine and 'pq' represents 3-phenylisoquinoline), which is phototoxic towards both normoxic and hypoxic cancer cells. Complex 1 photocatalytically oxidizes 1,4-dihydronicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH)-an important coenzyme in living cells-generating NAD\u2022 radicals with a high turnover frequency in biological media. Moreover, complex 1 and NADH synergistically photoreduce cytochrome c under hypoxia. Density functional theory calculations reveal \u03c0 stacking in adducts of complex 1 and NADH, facilitating photoinduced single-electron transfer. In cancer cells, complex 1 localizes in mitochondria and disrupts electron transport via NADH photocatalysis. On light irradiation, complex 1 induces NADH depletion, intracellular redox imbalance and immunogenic apoptotic cancer cell death. This photocatalytic redox imbalance strategy offers a new approach for efficient cancer phototherapy. ",
        "Rate and Prognosis of Brain Ischemia in Patients With Lower-Risk Transient or Persistent Minor Neurologic Events. Importance: Early treatment of patients with transient ischemic attack (TIA) reduces the risk of stroke. However, many patients present with symptoms that have an uncertain diagnosis. Patients with motor, speech, or prolonged symptoms are at the highest risk for recurrent stroke and the most likely to undergo comprehensive investigations. Lower-risk patients are much more likely to be cursorily investigated. Objective: To establish the frequency of acute infarct defined by diffusion restriction detected on diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan (DWI positive). Design, Setting, and Participants: The Diagnosis of Uncertain-Origin Benign Transient Neurological Symptoms (DOUBT) study was a prospective, observational, international, multicenter cohort study of 1028 patients with low-risk transient or minor symptoms referred to neurology within 8 days of symptom onset. Patients were enrolled between June 1, 2010, and October 31, 2016. Included patients were 40 years or older and had experienced nonmotor or nonspeech minor focal neurologic events of any duration or motor or speech symptoms of short duration (\u22645 minutes), with no previous stroke. Exposures: Patients underwent a detailed neurologic assessment prior to undergoing a brain MRI within 8 days of symptom onset. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was restricted diffusion on a brain MRI scan (acute stroke). Results: A total of 1028 patients (522 women and 506 men; mean [SD] age, 63.0 [11.6] years) were enrolled. A total of 139 patients (13.5%) had an acute stroke as defined by diffusion restriction detected on MRI scans (DWI positive). The final diagnosis was revised in 308 patients (30.0%) after undergoing brain MRI. There were 7 (0.7%) recurrent strokes at 1 year. A DWI-positive brain MRI scan was associated with an increased risk of recurrent stroke (relative risk, 6.4; 95% CI, 2.4-16.8) at 1 year. Absence of a DWI-positive lesion on a brain MRI scan had a 99.8% negative predictive value for recurrent stroke. Factors associated with MRI evidence of stroke in multivariable modeling were older age (odds ratio [OR], 1.02; 95% CI, 1.00-1.04), male sex (OR, 2.03; 95% CI, 1.39-2.96), motor or speech symptoms (OR, 2.12; 95% CI, 1.37-3.29), ongoing symptoms at assessment (OR, 1.97; 95% CI, 1.29-3.02), no prior identical symptomatic event (OR, 1.87; 95% CI, 1.12-3.11), and abnormal results of initial neurologic examination (OR, 1.71; 95% CI, 1.11-2.65). Conclusions and Relevance: This study suggested that patients with transient ischemic attack and symptoms traditionally considered low risk carry a substantive risk of acute stroke as defined by diffusion restriction (DWI positive) on a brain MRI scan. Early MRI is required to make a definitive diagnosis. ",
        "Restoring the activity of the antibiotic aztreonam using the polyphenol epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) against multidrug-resistant clinical isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Introduction. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an important Gram-negative pathogen that is intrinsically multidrug-resistant (MDR) and frequently associated with healthcare-associated outbreaks. With increasing resistance to antibiotics and with very few novel drugs under development, clinicians often use combinations to treat critically ill patients.Aim. The aim of this study was to evaluate the ability of epigallocatechin (EGCG) to restore the activity of aztreonam against clinical MDR strains of P. aeruginosa.Methodology. Checkerboard and time-kill kinetic assays were performed to assess synergy in vitro and the Galleria mellonella model of infection was used to test the efficacy of the combination in vivo. Accumulation assays were performed to gain insight into the mechanism of action.Results. The results demonstrate that synergy between aztreonam and EGCG exists [fractional inhibitory concentration indices (FICIs) 0.02-0.5], with the combination affording significantly (P=<0.05) enhanced bacterial killing, with a >3 log10 reduction in colony-forming units ml-1 at 24 h. EGCG was able to restore susceptibility to aztreonam to a level equal to or below the breakpoint set by the European Committee for Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing. In G. mellonella, the combination was superior to monotherapy, with increased larval survival observed (94 % vs \u226463 %). We also demonstrated the relatively low toxicity of EGCG to human keratinocytes and G. mellonella larvae. Accumulation assay data suggest that the mechanism of synergy may be due to EGCG increasing the uptake of aztreonam.Conclusion. EGCG was able to restore the activity of aztreonam against MDR P. aeruginosa. The data presented support further evaluation of the aztreonam-EGCG combination and highlight its potential for use in clinical medicine. ",
        "Core-Shell Nanofibrous Scaffolds for Repair of Meniscus Tears. Electrospinning is an attractive method of fabricating nanofibers that replicate the ultrastructure of the human meniscus. However, it is challenging to approximate the mechanical properties of meniscal tissue while maintaining the biocompatibility of collagen fibers. Our objective was to determine if functionalizing polylactic acid (PLA) nanofibers with collagen would enhance their biocompatibility. We therefore used coaxial electrospinning to generate core-shell nanofibers with a core of PLA for mechanical strength and a shell of collagen to enhance cell attachment and matrix synthesis. We characterized the nanostructure of the engineered scaffolds and measured the hydrophilic and mechanical properties. We assessed the performance of human meniscal cells seeded on coaxial electrospun scaffolds to produce meniscal tissue by gene expression and histology. Finally, we investigated whether these cell-seeded scaffolds could repair surgical tears created ex vivo in avascular meniscal explants. Histology, immunohistochemistry, and mechanical testing of ex vivo repair provided evidence of neotissue that was significantly better integrated with the native tissue than with the acellular coaxial electrospun scaffolds. Human meniscal cell-seeded coaxial electrospun scaffolds may have potential in enhancing repair of avascular meniscus tears. Impact Statement The success of any tissue-engineered meniscus graft relies on its ability to mimic native three-dimensional microstructure, support cell growth, produce tissue-specific matrix, and enhance graft integration into the repair site. Polylactic acid scaffolds possess the desired mechanical properties, whereas collagen scaffolds induce better cell attachment and enhanced tissue regeneration. We therefore fabricated nanofibrous scaffolds that combined the properties of two biomaterials. These novel coaxial scaffolds more closely emulated the structure, mechanical properties, and biochemical composition of native meniscal tissue. Our findings of meniscogenic tissue generation and integration in meniscus defects have the potential to be translated to clinical use. ",
        "Breast-Related Quality of Life in Young Reduction Mammaplasty Patients: A Long-Term Follow-Up Using the BREAST-Q. BACKGROUND: Reduction mammaplasty is the most effective means of improving symptoms of macromastia. Although studies have shown lasting benefits in adult patients, there is a paucity of data that explore this topic in young patients. In this study, the long-term satisfaction and well-being of young reduction mammaplasty patients was assessed. METHODS: A retrospective review was performed for all female patients younger than 25 years who underwent reduction mammaplasty performed by a single surgeon from 1980 to 2003. Demographic characteristics, comorbidities, surgical details, and length of follow-up were recorded. Participants completed the postoperative version of the BREAST-Q Reduction module. Responses were scored on a scale of 0 to 100. Scores were summarized with descriptive statistics and compared to normative values. RESULTS: Thirty-seven of 52 eligible participants completed the survey (response rate, 71.2 percent). Median age at surgery was 21 years (range, 12.4 to 24.6 years), and median follow-up was 21.4 years (range, 11.4 to 32.4 years). Overall, participants demonstrated high satisfaction and well-being. Mean Q-Scores for Satisfaction with Breasts and Sexual Well-being were significantly higher than normative values (p = 0.0012 and p < 0.0001, respectively), and were as follows: Satisfaction with Breasts, 66.6 \u00b1 16.5 (normative, 57 \u00b1 16); Psychosocial Well-being, 75.9 \u00b1 21.3 (normative, 68 \u00b1 1 9); Sexual Well-being, 72 \u00b1 18.2 (normative, 55 \u00b1 19); and Physical Well-being, 81.1 \u00b1 13.6 (normative, 76 \u00b1 11). CONCLUSIONS: Young reduction mammaplasty patients experience excellent breast-related quality of life decades after surgery. Compared with normative values, young reduction mammaplasty patients reported higher satisfaction with breasts and sexual well-being. Surgeons and third-party payers should be aware of these data and advocate for young patients to gain access to care. ",
        "Delta-S-Cys-Albumin: A Lab Test that Quantifies Cumulative Exposure of Archived Human Blood Plasma and Serum Samples to Thawed Conditions. Exposure of blood plasma/serum (P/S) to thawed conditions (> -30 \u00b0C) can produce biomolecular changes that skew measurements of biomarkers within archived patient samples, potentially rendering them unfit for molecular analysis. Because freeze-thaw histories are often poorly documented, objective methods for assessing molecular fitness before analysis are needed. We report a 10-\u03bcl, dilute-and-shoot, intact-protein mass spectrometric assay of albumin proteoforms called \"\u0394S-Cys-Albumin\" that quantifies cumulative exposure of archived P/S samples to thawed conditions. The relative abundance of S-cysteinylated (oxidized) albumin in P/S increases inexorably but to a maximum value under 100% when samples are exposed to temperatures > -30 \u00b0C. The difference in the relative abundance of S-cysteinylated albumin (S-Cys-Alb) before and after an intentional incubation period that drives this proteoform to its maximum level is denoted as \u0394S-Cys-Albumin. \u0394S-Cys-Albumin in fully expired samples is zero. The range (mean \u00b1 95% CI) observed for \u0394S-Cys-Albumin in fresh cardiac patient P/S (n = 97) was, for plasma 12-29% (20.9 \u00b1 0.75%) and for serum 10-24% (15.5 \u00b1 0.64%). The multireaction rate law that governs S-Cys-Alb formation in P/S was determined and shown to predict the rate of formation of S-Cys-Alb in plasma and serum samples-a step that enables back-calculation of the time at which unknown P/S specimens have been exposed to room temperature. A blind challenge demonstrated that \u0394S-Cys-Albumin can detect exposure of groups (n = 6 each) of P/S samples to 23 \u00b0C for 2 h, 4 \u00b0C for 16 h, or -20 \u00b0C for 24 h-and exposure of individual specimens for modestly increased times. An unplanned case study of nominally pristine serum samples collected under NIH-sponsorship demonstrated that empirical evidence is required to ensure accurate knowledge of archived P/S biospecimen storage history.

        "Onion and Garlic Intake and Breast Cancer, a Case-Control Study in Puerto Rico. Studies show an inverse association between onion and garlic intake and risk of cancers of the lung, prostate, and stomach. There is limited evidence on the association between onion and garlic intake and breast cancer. We assessed this association in a population-based, case-control study in Puerto Rico. Incident, primary breast cancer cases (n\u2009=\u2009314) were identified among women aged 30-79 from hospital and clinic records. Controls (n\u2009=\u2009346) were women with no history of cancer other than nonmelanoma skin cancer, residents of the same area. Dietary intake was estimated using a food frequency questionnaire. Total onion and garlic intake included sofrito (a popular garlic- and onion-based condiment) intake frequency. Unconditional logistic regression assessed the association between onion and garlic consumption and breast cancer adjusting for age, education, parity, family history, body mass index, age at menarche, total energy, and smoking. Inverse associations with breast cancer were observed for moderate (OR (odds ratio) = 0.59, 95% CI (confidence interval): 0.35, 1.01) and high consumption (OR = 0.51, 95% CI: 0.30, 0.87) compared to low consumption of onion and garlic (Ptrend = 0.02). Results were similar when stratified by menopausal status. Study results suggest that high onion and garlic consumption is protective against breast cancer in this population. ",
        "A perturbed gene network containing PI3K-AKT, RAS-ERK and WNT-\u03b2-catenin pathways in leukocytes is linked to ASD genetics and symptom severity. Hundreds of genes are implicated in autism spectrum disorder (ASD), but the mechanisms through which they contribute to ASD pathophysiology remain elusive. Here we analyzed leukocyte transcriptomics from 1- to 4-year-old male toddlers with ASD or typical development from the general population. We discovered a perturbed gene network that includes highly expressed genes during fetal brain development. This network is dysregulated in human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neuron models of ASD. High-confidence ASD risk genes emerge as upstream regulators of the network, and many risk genes may impact the network by modulating RAS-ERK, PI3K-AKT and WNT-\u03b2-catenin signaling pathways. We found that the degree of dysregulation in this network correlated with the severity of ASD symptoms in the toddlers. These results demonstrate how the heterogeneous genetics of ASD may dysregulate a core network to influence brain development at prenatal and very early postnatal ages and, thereby, the severity of later ASD symptoms.

        "Automatic choroidal segmentation in OCT images using supervised deep learning methods. The analysis of the choroid in the eye is crucial for our understanding of a range of ocular diseases and physiological processes. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging provides the ability to capture highly detailed cross-sectional images of the choroid yet only a very limited number of commercial OCT instruments provide methods for automatic segmentation of choroidal tissue. Manual annotation of the choroidal boundaries is often performed but this is impractical due to the lengthy time taken to analyse large volumes of images. Therefore, there is a pressing need for reliable and accurate methods to automatically segment choroidal tissue boundaries in OCT images. In this work, a variety of patch-based and fully-convolutional deep learning methods are proposed to accurately determine the location of the choroidal boundaries of interest. The effect of network architecture, patch-size and contrast enhancement methods was tested to better understand the optimal architecture and approach to maximize performance. The results are compared with manual boundary segmentation used as a ground-truth, as well as with a standard image analysis technique. Results of total retinal layer segmentation are also presented for comparison purposes. The findings presented here demonstrate the benefit of deep learning methods for segmentation of the chorio-retinal boundary analysis in OCT images. ",
        "Gut bacteria responding to dietary change encode sialidases that exhibit preference for red meat-associated carbohydrates. Dietary habits have been associated with alterations of the human gut resident microorganisms contributing to obesity, diabetes and cancer1. In Western diets, red meat is a frequently eaten food2, but long-term consumption has been associated with increased risk of disease3,4. Red meat is enriched in N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc) that cannot be synthesized by humans5. However, consumption can cause Neu5Gc incorporation into cell surface glycans6, especially in carcinomas4,7. As a consequence, an inflammatory response is triggered when Neu5Gc-containing glycans encounter circulating anti-Neu5Gc antibodies8,9. Although bacteria can use free sialic acids as a nutrient source10-12, it is currently unknown if gut microorganisms contribute to releasing Neu5Gc from food. We found that a Neu5Gc-rich diet induces changes in the gut microbiota, with Bacteroidales and Clostridiales responding the most. Genome assembling of mouse and human shotgun metagenomic sequencing identified bacterial sialidases with previously unobserved substrate preference for Neu5Gc-containing glycans. X-ray crystallography revealed key amino acids potentially contributing to substrate preference. Additionally, we verified that mouse and human sialidases were able to release Neu5Gc from red meat. The release of Neu5Gc from red meat using bacterial sialidases could reduce the risk of inflammatory diseases associated with red meat consumption, including colorectal cancer4 and atherosclerosis13.

        "Risk factors for head and neck cancer in the World Trade Center Health Program General Responder Cohort: results from a nested case-control study. OBJECTIVES: Head and neck cancers (HNCs) may be among the health consequences of involvement in the World Trade Center (WTC) response on and after 11 September 2001. We conducted a nested case-control study of WTC Health Program (WTCHP) general responders to examine the effects of WTC exposures and behavioural risk factors on HNC. METHODS: We enrolled 64 cases and 136 controls, matched on age, sex and race/ethnicity within risk sets. We assessed tobacco and alcohol use, sexual activity, and occupational exposures prior to, during and after WTC exposure until case diagnosis via questionnaire. We obtained WTC exposure information (duration (first to last day), total days and location of work) from the WTCHP General Responder Data Center. We assessed associations with HNC, and interaction among exposures, using conditional logistic regression. RESULTS: Responders in protective services versus other occupations had increased odds (OR: 2.51, 95% CI 1.09 to 5.82) of HNC. Among those in non-protective services occupations, arriving to the WTC effort on versus after 11 September 2001 was significantly associated with HNC (OR: 3.77, 95% CI 1.00 to 14.11). Duration of work was not significantly associated with HNC. Lifetime and post-WTC years of cigarette smoking and post-WTC number of sex partners were positively and significantly associated with HNC, while alcohol consumption was not. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest opportunities for HNC risk factor mitigation (eg, smoking cessation, human papillomavirus vaccination) and contribute to a risk factor profile which may assist WTCHP clinicians with identifying high-risk responders and improve detection and treatment outcomes in this population.

        "Monitoring the Formation of Amyloid Oligomers Using Photoluminescence Anisotropy. The formation of oligomeric soluble aggregates is related to the toxicity of amyloid peptides and proteins. In this manuscript, we report the use of a ruthenium polypyridyl complex ([Ru(bpy)2(dpqp)]2+) to track the formation of amyloid oligomers at different times using photoluminescence anisotropy. This technique is sensitive to the rotational correlation time of the molecule under study, which is consequently related to the size of the molecule. [Ru(bpy)2(dpqp)]2+ presents anisotropy values of zero when free in solution (due to its rapid rotation and long lifetime) but larger values as the size and concentration of amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) oligomers increase. Our assays show that A\u03b2 forms oligomers immediately after the assay is started, reaching a steady state at \u223c48 h. SDS-PAGE, DLS, and TEM were used to confirm and characterize the formation of oligomers. Our experiments show that the rate of formation for A\u03b2 oligomers is temperature dependent, with faster rates as the temperature of the assay is increased. The probe was also effective in monitoring the formation of \u03b1-synuclein oligomers at different times. ",
        "G-tract RNA removes Polycomb repressive complex 2 from genes. Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) maintains repression of cell-type-specific genes but also associates with genes ectopically in cancer. While it is currently unknown how PRC2 is removed from genes, such knowledge would be useful for the targeted reversal of deleterious PRC2 recruitment events. Here, we show that G-tract RNA specifically removes PRC2 from genes in human and mouse cells. PRC2 preferentially binds G tracts within nascent precursor mRNA (pre-mRNA), especially within predicted G-quadruplex structures. G-quadruplex RNA evicts the PRC2 catalytic core from the substrate nucleosome. In cells, PRC2 transfers from chromatin to pre-mRNA upon gene activation, and chromatin-associated G-tract RNA removes PRC2, leading to H3K27me3 depletion from genes. Targeting G-tract RNA to the tumor suppressor gene CDKN2A in malignant rhabdoid tumor cells reactivates the gene and induces senescence. These data support a model in which pre-mRNA evicts PRC2 during gene activation and provides the means to selectively remove PRC2 from specific genes. ",
        "Chromatin activity at GWAS loci identifies T cell states driving complex immune diseases. Immune-disease-associated variants are enriched in active chromatin regions of T cells and macrophages. However, whether these variants function in specific cell states is unknown. Here we stimulated T cells and macrophages in the presence of 13 cytokines and profiled active and open chromatin regions. T cell activation induced major chromatin remodeling, while the presence of cytokines fine-tuned the magnitude of changes. We developed a statistical method that accounts for subtle changes in the chromatin landscape to identify SNP enrichment across cell states. Our results point towards the role of immune-disease-associated variants in early rather than late activation of memory CD4+ T cells, with modest differences across cytokines. Furthermore, variants associated with inflammatory bowel disease are enriched in type 1 T helper (TH1) cells, whereas variants associated with Alzheimer's disease are enriched in different macrophage cell states. Our results represent an in-depth analysis of immune-disease-associated variants across a comprehensive panel of activation states of T cells and macrophages. ",
        "Injury Risk Associated With Sports Specialization and Activity Volume in Youth. Background: Sports specialization has become increasingly common among youth. Purpose/Hypothesis: To investigate the relative importance of specialization vs volume of activity in increasing risk of injury. Hypotheses were that specialization increases the risk of injury and that risk varies by sport. Study Design: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 2. Methods: A prospective analysis was conducted with data collected from 10,138 youth in the Growing Up Today Study-a prospective cohort study of youth throughout the United States-and their mothers. Activity was assessed via questionnaires in 1997, 1998, 1999, and 2001. Sports specialization was defined as engaging in a single sport in the fall, winter, and spring. Injury history was provided by participants' mothers via questionnaire in 2004. The outcome was incident stress fracture, tendinitis, chondromalacia patella, anterior cruciate ligament tear, or osteochondritis dissecans or osteochondral defect. Results: Females who engaged in sports specialization were at increased risk of injury (hazard ratio [HR], 1.31; 95% CI, 1.07-1.61), but risk varied by sport. Sports specialization was associated with greater volume of physical activity in both sexes (P < .0001). Total hours per week of vigorous activity was predictive of developing injury, regardless of what other variables were included in the statistical model (males: HR, 1.04; 95% CI, 1.02-1.06; females: HR, 1.06; 95% CI, 1.05-1.08). Among females, even those engaging in 3 to 3.9 hours per week less than their age were at a significantly increased risk of injury (HR, 1.93; 95% CI, 1.34-2.77). In males, there was no clear pattern of risk. Conclusion: Sports specialization is associated with a greater volume of vigorous sports activity and increased risk of injury. Parents, coaches, and medical providers need to be made aware of the volume threshold above which physical activity is excessive. ",
        "Association of Cord Plasma Biomarkers of In Utero Acetaminophen Exposure With Risk of Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder and Autism Spectrum Disorder in Childhood. Importance: Prior studies have raised concern about maternal acetaminophen use during pregnancy and increased risk of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in their children; however, most studies have relied on maternal self-report. Objective: To examine the prospective associations between cord plasma acetaminophen metabolites and physician-diagnosed ADHD, ASD, both ADHD and ASD, and developmental disabilities (DDs) in childhood. Design, Setting, and Participants: This prospective cohort study analyzed 996 mother-infant dyads, a subset of the Boston Birth Cohort, who were enrolled at birth and followed up prospectively at the Boston Medical Center from October 1, 1998, to June 30, 2018. Exposures: Three cord acetaminophen metabolites (unchanged acetaminophen, acetaminophen glucuronide, and 3-[N-acetyl-l-cystein-S-yl]-acetaminophen) were measured in archived cord plasma samples collected at birth. Main Outcomes and Measures: Physician-diagnosed ADHD, ASD, and other DDs as documented in the child's medical records. Results: Of 996 participants (mean [SD] age, 9.8 [3.9] years; 548 [55.0%] male), the final sample included 257 children (25.8%) with ADHD only, 66 (6.6%) with ASD only, 42 (4.2%) with both ADHD and ASD, 304 (30.5%) with other DDs, and 327 (32.8%) who were neurotypical. Unchanged acetaminophen levels were detectable in all cord plasma samples. Compared with being in the first tertile, being in the second and third tertiles of cord acetaminophen burden was associated with higher odds of ADHD diagnosis (odds ratio [OR] for second tertile, 2.26; 95% CI, 1.40-3.69; OR for third tertile, 2.86; 95% CI, 1.77-4.67) and ASD diagnosis (OR for second tertile, 2.14; 95% CI, 0.93-5.13; OR for third tertile, 3.62; 95% CI, 1.62-8.60). Sensitivity analyses and subgroup analyses found consistent associations between acetaminophen buden and ADHD and acetaminophen burden and ASD across strata of potential confounders, including maternal indication, substance use, preterm birth, and child age and sex, for which point estimates for the ORs vary from 2.3 to 3.5 for ADHD and 1.6 to 4.1 for ASD. Conclusions and Relevance: Cord biomarkers of fetal exposure to acetaminophen were associated with significantly increased risk of childhood ADHD and ASD in a dose-response fashion. Our findings support previous studies regarding the association between prenatal and perinatal acetaminophen exposure and childhood neurodevelopmental risk and warrant additional investigations. ",
        "Impact of the 2016 revision of US Pediatric Heart Allocation Policy on waitlist characteristics and outcomes. US Pediatric Heart Allocation Policy was recently revised, deprioritizing candidates with cardiomyopathy while maintaining status 1A eligibility for congenital heart disease (CHD) candidates on \"high-dose\" inotropes. We compared waitlist characteristics and mortality around this change. Status 1A listings decreased (70% to 56%, P\u00a0<\u00a0.001) and CHD representation increased among status 1A listings (48% vs 64%, P\u00a0<\u00a0.001). Waitlist mortality overall (subdistribution hazard ratio [SHR] 0.96, P\u00a0=\u00a0.63) and among status 1A candidates (SHR 1.16, P\u00a0=\u00a0.14) were unchanged. CHD waitlist mortality trended better (SHR 0.82, P\u00a0=\u00a0.06) but was unchanged for CHD candidates listed status 1A (SHR 0.92, P\u00a0=\u00a0.47). Status 1A listing exceptions increased 2- to 3-fold among hypertrophic and restrictive cardiomyopathy candidates and 13.5-fold among dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) candidates. Hypertrophic (SHR 6.25, P\u00a0=\u00a0.004) and restrictive (SHR 3.87, P\u00a0=\u00a0.03) cardiomyopathy candidates without status 1A exception had increased waitlist mortality, but those with DCM did not (SHR 1.26, P\u00a0=\u00a0.32). Ventricular assist device (VAD) use increased only among DCM candidates \u22651\u00a0years old (26% vs 38%, P\u00a0<\u00a0.001). Current allocation policy has increased CHD status 1A representation but has not improved their waitlist mortality. Excessive DCM status 1A listing exceptions and continued status 1A prioritization of children on stable VADs potentially diminish the intended benefits of policy revision. ",
        "Rate and Prognosis of Brain Ischemia in Patients With Lower-Risk Transient or Persistent Minor Neurologic Events. Importance: Early treatment of patients with transient ischemic attack (TIA) reduces the risk of stroke. However, many patients present with symptoms that have an uncertain diagnosis. Patients with motor, speech, or prolonged symptoms are at the highest risk for recurrent stroke and the most likely to undergo comprehensive investigations. Lower-risk patients are much more likely to be cursorily investigated. Objective: To establish the frequency of acute infarct defined by diffusion restriction detected on diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan (DWI positive). Design, Setting, and Participants: The Diagnosis of Uncertain-Origin Benign Transient Neurological Symptoms (DOUBT) study was a prospective, observational, international, multicenter cohort study of 1028 patients with low-risk transient or minor symptoms referred to neurology within 8 days of symptom onset. Patients were enrolled between June 1, 2010, and October 31, 2016. Included patients were 40 years or older and had experienced nonmotor or nonspeech minor focal neurologic events of any duration or motor or speech symptoms of short duration (\u22645 minutes), with no previous stroke. Exposures: Patients underwent a detailed neurologic assessment prior to undergoing a brain MRI within 8 days of symptom onset. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was restricted diffusion on a brain MRI scan (acute stroke). Results: A total of 1028 patients (522 women and 506 men; mean [SD] age, 63.0 [11.6] years) were enrolled. A total of 139 patients (13.5%) had an acute stroke as defined by diffusion restriction detected on MRI scans (DWI positive). The final diagnosis was revised in 308 patients (30.0%) after undergoing brain MRI. There were 7 (0.7%) recurrent strokes at 1 year. A DWI-positive brain MRI scan was associated with an increased risk of recurrent stroke (relative risk, 6.4; 95% CI, 2.4-16.8) at 1 year. Absence of a DWI-positive lesion on a brain MRI scan had a 99.8% negative predictive value for recurrent stroke. Factors associated with MRI evidence of stroke in multivariable modeling were older age (odds ratio [OR], 1.02; 95% CI, 1.00-1.04), male sex (OR, 2.03; 95% CI, 1.39-2.96), motor or speech symptoms (OR, 2.12; 95% CI, 1.37-3.29), ongoing symptoms at assessment (OR, 1.97; 95% CI, 1.29-3.02), no prior identical symptomatic event (OR, 1.87; 95% CI, 1.12-3.11), and abnormal results of initial neurologic examination (OR, 1.71; 95% CI, 1.11-2.65). Conclusions and Relevance: This study suggested that patients with transient ischemic attack and symptoms traditionally considered low risk carry a substantive risk of acute stroke as defined by diffusion restriction (DWI positive) on a brain MRI scan. Early MRI is required to make a definitive diagnosis. ",
        "Hypermethylation-associated downregulation of microRNA-4456 in hypersexual disorder with putative influence on oxytocin signalling: A DNA methylation analysis of miRNA genes. Hypersexual disorder (HD) was proposed as a diagnosis in the DSM-5 and the classification 'Compulsive Sexual Behavior Disorder' is now presented as an impulse-control disorder in ICD-11. HD incorporates several pathophysiological mechanisms; including impulsivity, compulsivity, sexual desire dysregulation and sexual addiction. No previous study investigated HD in a methylation analysis limited to microRNA (miRNA) associated CpG-sites. The genome wide methylation pattern was measured in whole blood from 60 subjects with HD and 33 healthy volunteers using the Illumina EPIC BeadChip. 8,852 miRNA associated CpG-sites were investigated in multiple linear regression analyses of methylation M-values to a binary independent variable of disease state (HD or healthy volunteer), adjusting for optimally determined covariates. Expression levels of candidate miRNAs were investigated in the same individuals for differential expression analysis. Candidate methylation loci were further studied for an association with alcohol dependence in an independent cohort of 107 subjects. Two CpG-sites were borderline significant in HD - cg18222192 (MIR708)(p < 10E-05,pFDR = 5.81E-02) and cg01299774 (MIR4456)(p < 10E-06, pFDR = 5.81E-02). MIR4456 was significantly lower expressed in HD in both univariate (p < 0.0001) and multivariate (p < 0.05) analyses. Cg01299774 methylation levels were inversely correlated with expression levels of MIR4456 (p < 0.01) and were also differentially methylated in alcohol dependence (p = 0.026). Gene target prediction and pathway analysis revealed that MIR4456 putatively targets genes preferentially expressed in brain and that are involved in major neuronal molecular mechanisms thought to be relevant for HD, e.g., the oxytocin signalling pathway. In summary, our study implicates a potential contribution of MIR4456 in the pathophysiology of HD by putatively influencing oxytocin signalling. ",
        "Correlation Transfer by Layer 5 Cortical Neurons Under Recreated Synaptic Inputs In Vitro. Correlated electrical activity in neurons is a prominent characteristic of cortical microcircuits. Despite a growing amount of evidence concerning both spike-count and subthreshold membrane potential pairwise correlations, little is known about how different types of cortical neurons convert correlated inputs into correlated outputs. We studied pyramidal neurons and two classes of GABAergic interneurons of layer 5 in neocortical brain slices obtained from rats of both sexes, and we stimulated them with biophysically realistic correlated inputs, generated using dynamic clamp. We found that the physiological differences between cell types manifested unique features in their capacity to transfer correlated inputs. We used linear response theory and computational modeling to gain clear insights into how cellular properties determine both the gain and timescale of correlation transfer, thus tying single-cell features with network interactions. Our results provide further ground for the functionally distinct roles played by various types of neuronal cells in the cortical microcircuit.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT No matter how we probe the brain, we find correlated neuronal activity over a variety of spatial and temporal scales. For the cerebral cortex, significant evidence has accumulated on trial-to-trial covariability in synaptic inputs activation, subthreshold membrane potential fluctuations, and output spike trains. Although we do not yet fully understand their origin and whether they are detrimental or beneficial for information processing, we believe that clarifying how correlations emerge is pivotal for understanding large-scale neuronal network dynamics and computation. Here, we report quantitative differences between excitatory and inhibitory cells, as they relay input correlations into output correlations. We explain this heterogeneity by simple biophysical models and provide the most experimentally validated test of a theory for the emergence of correlations. ",
        "Orally bioavailable glutamine antagonist prodrug JHU-083 penetrates mouse brain and suppresses the growth of MYC-driven medulloblastoma. A subset of poor-prognosis medulloblastoma has genomic amplification of MYC. MYC regulates glutamine metabolism in multiple cellular contexts. We modified the glutamine analog 6-diazo-5-oxo-l-norleucine (DON) to mask its carboxylate and amine functionalities, creating a prodrug termed JHU-083 with increased oral bioavailability. We hypothesized that this prodrug would kill MYC-expressing medulloblastoma. JHU-083 treatment caused decreased growth and increased apoptosis in human MYC-expressing medulloblastoma cell lines. We generated a mouse MYC-driven medulloblastoma model by transforming C57BL/6 mouse cerebellar stem and progenitor cells. When implanted into the brains of C57BL/6 mice, these cells formed large cell/anaplastic tumors that resembled aggressive medulloblastoma. A cell line derived from this model was sensitive to JHU-083 in vitro. Oral administration of JHU-038 led to the accumulation of micromolar concentrations of DON in the mouse brain. JHU-083 treatment significantly increased the survival of immune-competent animals bearing orthotopic tumors formed by the mouse cerebellar stem cell model as well as immune-deficient animals bearing orthotopic tumors formed by a human MYC-amplified medulloblastoma cell line.

L-Type Amino Acid Transporter 1 (LAT1/Lat1) is responsible for carrying large, neutral L-amino acids as well as several drugs and prodrugs across the blood-brain barrier (BBB). However, the BBB is not the only barrier that hinders drugs acting effectively within the brain; the brain parenchymal cell membranes represent a secondary barrier for the drugs with intracellular target sites. In this study, expression and function of Lat1 was quantified in mouse primary neuron, astrocyte and immortalized microglia (BV2) cultures. Moreover, ability of Lat1 to carry prodrugs inside these brain cells was evaluated. The results showed that Lat1 was localized at the similar level in all studied cells (3.07\u2009\u00b1\u20090.92-3.77\u2009\u00b1\u20090.91 fmol/\u00b5g protein). The transporter was also functional in all three cell types, astrocytes having the highest transport capacity and affinity for the LAT1/Lat1-substrate, [14C]-L-leucine, followed by neurons and microglia. The designed prodrugs (1-6) were able to utilize Lat1 for their cellular uptake and it was mainly much higher than the one of their parent drugs. Interestingly, improved cellular uptake was also achieved in cells representing Alzheimer's Disease phenotype. Therefore, improved delivery and intra-brain targeting of drugs can be attained by utilizing LAT1/Lat1 and prodrug approach. ",
        "Identification of the PTEN-ARID4B-PI3K pathway reveals the dependency on ARID4B by PTEN-deficient prostate cancer. PTEN is frequently mutated in prostate cancer. The tumor suppressor function of PTEN is attributed to its lipid phosphatase activity that counters PI3K action. Here, we report a PTEN-ARID4B-PI3K axis in which PTEN inhibits expression of ARID4B, while ARID4B is a transcriptional activator of the PI3K subunit genes PIK3CA and PIK3R2 that are crucial for activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway. Reciprocal binding of ARID4B and histone H1 to the PIK3CA and PIK3R2 promoters modulates chromatin condensation, suggesting a mechanism by which ARID4B activates these promoters. Functional analyses reveals that ARID4B is required for prostate tumorigenesis when PTEN is deficient. The biological significance is further substantiated by the existence of a PTEN/ARID4B/PIK3CA three-gene signature that improves the predictive power for prostate cancer recurrence in patients. In summary, we identify ARID4B as a master regulator in the PTEN-PI3K pathway, thus providing a potential therapeutic target for prostate cancer carrying PTEN mutations. ",
        "The frequency limit of outer hair cell motility measured in vivo. Outer hair cells (OHCs) in the mammalian ear exhibit electromotility, electrically driven somatic length changes that are thought to mechanically amplify sound-evoked vibrations. For this amplification to work, OHCs must respond to sounds on a cycle-by-cycle basis even at frequencies that exceed the low-pass corner frequency of their cell membranes. Using in vivo optical vibrometry we tested this theory by measuring sound-evoked motility in the 13-25 kHz region of the gerbil cochlea. OHC vibrations were strongly rectified, and motility exhibited first-order low-pass characteristics with corner frequencies around 3 kHz- more than 2.5 octaves below the frequencies the OHCs are expected to amplify. These observations lead us to suggest that the OHCs operate more like the envelope detectors in a classical gain-control scheme than like high-frequency sound amplifiers. These findings call for a fundamental reconsideration of the role of the OHCs in cochlear function and the causes of cochlear hearing loss. ",
        "Distinct genetic variation and heterogeneity of the Iranian population. Iran, despite its size, geographic location and past cultural influence, has largely been a blind spot for human population genetic studies. With only sparse genetic information on the Iranian population available, we pursued its genome-wide and geographic characterization based on 1021 samples from eleven ethnic groups. We show that Iranians, while close to neighboring populations, present distinct genetic variation consistent with long-standing genetic continuity, harbor high heterogeneity and different levels of consanguinity, fall apart into a cluster of similar groups and several admixed ones and have experienced numerous language adoption events in the past. Our findings render Iran an important source for human genetic variation in Western and Central Asia, will guide adequate study sampling and assist the interpretation of putative disease-implicated genetic variation. Given Iran's internal genetic heterogeneity, future studies will have to consider ethnic affiliations and possible admixture. ",
        "Prospective longitudinal study of tobacco company adaptation to standardised packaging in the UK: identifying circumventions and closing loopholes. OBJECTIVES: UK standardised packaging legislation was introduced alongside pack size and product descriptor restrictions of the European Union Tobacco Products Directive to end tobacco marketing and misinformation via the pack. This paper aims to assess compliance with the restrictions and identify attempts to continue to market tobacco products and perpetuate misperceptions of harm post legislation. DESIGN, SETTING AND INTERVENTION: A prospective study of the introduction of standardised packaging of tobacco products to the UK. PARTICIPANTS AND OUTCOMES: We analysed commercial sales data to assess whether the legally required changes in pack branding, size and name were implemented. To explore any adaptations to products and packaging we analysed sales data, monthly pack purchases of factory-made (FM) cigarettes and roll-your-own (RYO) tobacco, tobacco advertisements from retail trade magazines and articles on tobacco from commercial literature (retail trade, market analyst and tobacco company publications). RESULTS: One month after full implementation of the UK and European Union policies, 97% FM and 98% RYO was sold in compliant packaging. Nevertheless, tobacco companies made adaptations to tobacco products which enabled continued brand differentiation after the legislation came into force. For example, flavour names previously associated with low tar were systematically changed to colour names arguably facilitating continued misperceptions about the relative harms of products. Tobacco companies used the 1-year sell-through to their advantage by communicating brand name changes and providing financial incentives for retailers to buy large volumes of branded packs. In addition, tobacco companies continued to market their products to retailers and customers by innovating exemptions to the legislation, namely, filters, packaging edges, seals, multipack outers, RYO accessories, cigars and pipe tobacco. CONCLUSIONS: Tobacco companies adapted to packaging restrictions by innovating their tobacco products and marketing activities. These findings should enable policy makers globally to close loopholes and increase the potential efficacy of standardised packaging policies. ",
        "Avocatin B Protects Against Lipotoxicity and Improves Insulin Sensitivity in Diet-Induced Obesity. SCOPE: The effects of an avocado-derived fatty acid oxidation (FAO) inhibitor, avocatin B (AvoB), on glucose and lipid metabolism in models of diet-induced obesity (DIO) and in vitro models of lipotoxicity are evaluated. The safety of its oral consumption in humans is also determined. METHODS AND RESULTS: Mice are given high-fat diets (HFD) for 8 weeks. Thereafter, AvoB or vehicle is administered orally twice weekly for 5 weeks. AvoB inhibits FAO which led to improved glucose tolerance, glucose utilization, and insulin sensitivity. AvoB's effects on metabolism under lipotoxic conditions are evaluated in vitro in pancreatic \u03b2-islet cells and C2C12 myotubes. AvoB inhibits FAO and increases glucose oxidation, resulting in lowering of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species that improves insulin responsiveness in C2C12 myotubes and insulin secretion in INS-1 (832/13) cells, respectively. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial in healthy human participants is conducted to assess the safety of AvoB consumption (50 mg or 200 mg per day for 60 days). AvoB is well-tolerated and not associated with any dose-limiting toxicity. CONCLUSION: Therapeutic agents that are safe and effectively inhibit FAO and improve DIO-associated pathologies are currently not available. AvoB's mechanism of action and favorable safety profile highlight its nutritional and clinical importance. ",
        "Single-trial neural dynamics are dominated by richly varied movements. When experts are immersed in a task, do their brains prioritize task-related activity? Most efforts to understand neural activity during well-learned tasks focus on cognitive computations and task-related movements. We wondered whether task-performing animals explore a broader movement landscape and how this impacts neural activity. We characterized movements using video and other sensors and measured neural activity using widefield and two-photon imaging. Cortex-wide activity was dominated by movements, especially uninstructed movements not required for the task. Some uninstructed movements were aligned to trial events. Accounting for them revealed that neurons with similar trial-averaged activity often reflected utterly different combinations of cognitive and movement variables. Other movements occurred idiosyncratically, accounting for trial-by-trial fluctuations that are often considered 'noise'. This held true throughout task-learning and for extracellular Neuropixels recordings that included subcortical areas. Our observations argue that animals execute expert decisions while performing richly varied, uninstructed movements that profoundly shape neural activity. ",
        "Development of Hematopoietic Stem Cell-Engineered Invariant Natural Killer T Cell Therapy for Cancer. Invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells are potent immune cells for targeting cancer; however, their clinical application has been hindered by their low numbers in cancer patients. Here, we developed a proof-of-concept for hematopoietic stem cell-engineered iNKT (HSC-iNKT) cell therapy with the potential to provide therapeutic levels of iNKT cells for a patient's lifetime. Using a human HSC engrafted mouse model and a human iNKT TCR gene engineering approach, we demonstrated the efficient and long-term generation of HSC-iNKT cells in\u00a0vivo. These HSC-iNKT cells closely resembled endogenous human iNKT cells, could deploy multiple mechanisms to attack tumor cells, and effectively suppressed tumor growth in\u00a0vivo in multiple human tumor xenograft mouse models. Preclinical safety studies showed no toxicity or tumorigenicity of the HSC-iNKT cell therapy. Collectively, these results demonstrated the feasibility, safety, and cancer therapy potential of the proposed HSC-iNKT cell therapy and laid a foundation for future clinical development. ",
        "American Society for Bone and Mineral Research-Orthopaedic Research Society Joint Task Force Report on Cell-Based Therapies. Cell-based therapies, defined here as the delivery of cells in vivo to treat disease, have recently gained increasing public attention as a potentially promising approach to restore structure and function to musculoskeletal tissues. Although cell-based therapy has the potential to improve the treatment of disorders of the musculoskeletal system, there is also the possibility of misuse and misrepresentation of the efficacy of such treatments. The medical literature contains anecdotal reports and research studies, along with web-based marketing and patient testimonials supporting cell-based therapy. Both the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research (ASBMR) and the Orthopaedic Research Society (ORS) are committed to ensuring that the potential of cell-based therapies is realized through rigorous, reproducible, and clinically meaningful scientific discovery. The two organizations convened a multidisciplinary and international Task Force composed of physicians, surgeons, and scientists who are recognized experts in the development and use of cell-based therapies. The Task Force was charged with defining the state-of-the art in cell-based therapies and identifying the gaps in knowledge and methodologies that should guide the research agenda. The efforts of this Task Force are designed to provide researchers and clinicians with a better understanding of the current state of the science and research needed to advance the study and use of cell-based therapies for skeletal tissues. The design and implementation of rigorous, thorough protocols will be critical to leveraging these innovative treatments and optimizing clinical and functional patient outcomes. In addition to providing specific recommendations and ethical considerations for preclinical and clinical investigations, this report concludes with an outline to address knowledge gaps in how to determine the cell autonomous and nonautonomous effects of a donor population used for bone regeneration. \u00a9 2019 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.

        "A Protocol to Deliver Intensive Behavioral Therapy (IBT) for Obesity in Primary Care Settings: The MODEL-IBT Program. OBJECTIVE: The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) initiated coverage of intensive behavioral therapy (IBT) for obesity in 2011, providing beneficiaries 14 to 15 brief, individual counseling visits in 6 months. CMS offered general recommendations for delivering IBT but did not provide an evidence-based treatment protocol, which was the objective of the present research. METHODS: This review describes the evidence that CMS considered in developing its IBT benefit. It also examines weight losses produced by the intensive lifestyle intervention in the Diabetes Prevention Program\u00a0(DPP), as well an adapted version of the DPP delivered (for the first 6 months) on the visit schedule recommended by CMS. This new protocol, which was evaluated in a recent randomized trial, provided 14 visits in the first 24 weeks, with 7 additional monthly visits through week 52. RESULTS: As reported previously, the 50 participants with obesity assigned to the new IBT protocol lost a mean of 5.4% of their initial weight at week 24; 46% of participants lost\u2009\u2265\u20095% of their baseline weight. At 1 year, the mean loss was 6.1%, and 44% of participants lost\u2009\u2265\u20095%. CONCLUSIONS: With these generally favorable results, the IBT protocol is being posted online for practitioners and researchers to use. ",
        "N822K- or V560G-mutated KIT activation preferentially occurs in lipid rafts of the Golgi apparatus in leukemia cells. BACKGROUND: KIT tyrosine kinase is expressed in mast cells, interstitial cells of Cajal, and hematopoietic cells. Permanently active KIT mutations lead these host cells to tumorigenesis, and to such diseases as mast cell leukemia (MCL), gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST), and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Recently, we reported that in MCL, KIT with mutations (D816V, human; D814Y, mouse) traffics to endolysosomes (EL), where it can then initiate oncogenic signaling. On the other hand, KIT mutants including KITD814Y in GIST accumulate on the Golgi, and from there, activate downstream. KIT mutations, such as N822K, have been found in 30% of core binding factor-AML (CBF-AML) patients. However, how the mutants are tyrosine-phosphorylated and where they activate downstream molecules remain unknown. Moreover, it is unclear whether a KIT mutant other than KITD816V in MCL is able to signal on EL. METHODS: We used leukemia cell lines, such as Kasumi-1 (KITN822K, AML), SKNO-1 (KITN822K, AML), and HMC-1.1 (KITV560G, MCL), to explore how KIT transduces signals in these cells and to examine the signal platform for the mutants using immunofluorescence microscopy and inhibition of intracellular trafficking. RESULTS: In AML cell lines, KITN822K aberrantly localizes to EL. After biosynthesis, KIT traffics to the cell surface via the Golgi and immediately migrates to EL through endocytosis in a manner dependent on its kinase activity. However, results of phosphorylation imaging show that KIT is preferentially activated on the Golgi. Indeed, blockade of KITN822K migration to the Golgi with BFA/M-COPA inhibits the activation of KIT downstream molecules, such as AKT, ERK, and STAT5, indicating that KIT signaling occurs on the Golgi. Moreover, lipid rafts in the Golgi play a role in KIT signaling. Interestingly, KITV560G in HMC-1.1 migrates and activates downstream in a similar manner to KITN822K in Kasumi-1. CONCLUSIONS: In AML, KITN822K mislocalizes to EL. Our findings, however, suggest that the mutant transduces phosphorylation signals on lipid rafts of the Golgi in leukemia cells. Unexpectedly, the KITV560G signal platform in MCL is similar to that of KITN822K in AML. These observations provide new insights into the pathogenic role of KIT mutants as well as that of other mutant molecules. ",
        "Encapsulation, Visualization and Expression of Genes with Biomimetically Mineralized Zeolitic Imidazolate Framework-8 (ZIF-8). Recent work in biomolecule-metal-organic framework (MOF) composites has proven to be an effective strategy for the protection of proteins. However, for other biomacromolecules such as nucleic acids, the encapsulation into nano MOFs and the related characterizations are in their infancy. Herein, encapsulation of a complete gene-set in zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 (ZIF-8) MOFs and cellular expression of the gene delivered by the nano MOF composites are reported. Using a green fluorescent protein (GFP) plasmid (plGFP) as a proof-of-concept genetic macromolecule, successful transfection of mammalian cancer cells with plGFP for up to 4 days is shown. Cell transfection assays and soft X-ray cryo-tomography (cryo-SXT) demonstrate the feasibility of DNA@MOF biocomposites as intracellular gene delivery vehicles. Expression occurs over relatively prolonged time points where the cargo nucleic acid is released gradually in order to maintain sustained expression. ",
        "Disrupting Mitochondrial Pyruvate Uptake Directs Glutamine into the TCA Cycle away from Glutathione Synthesis and Impairs Hepatocellular Tumorigenesis. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a devastating cancer increasingly caused by non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Disrupting the liver Mitochondrial Pyruvate Carrier (MPC) in mice attenuates NAFLD. Thus, we considered whether liver MPC disruption also prevents HCC. Here, we use the N-nitrosodiethylamine plus carbon tetrachloride model of HCC development to test how liver-specific MPC knock out affects hepatocellular tumorigenesis. Our data show that liver MPC ablation markedly decreases tumorigenesis and that MPC-deficient tumors transcriptomically downregulate glutathione metabolism. We observe that MPC disruption and glutathione depletion in cultured hepatomas are synthetically lethal. Stable isotope tracing shows that hepatocyte MPC disruption reroutes glutamine from glutathione synthesis into the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. These results support a model where inducing metabolic competition for glutamine by MPC disruption impairs hepatocellular tumorigenesis by limiting glutathione synthesis. These findings raise the possibility that combining MPC disruption and glutathione stress may be therapeutically useful in HCC and additional cancers. ",
        "Activity in the dorsal ACC causes deterioration of sequential motor performance due to anxiety. Performance anxiety can profoundly affect motor performance, even in experts such as professional athletes and musicians. Previously, the neural mechanisms underlying anxiety-induced performance deterioration have predominantly been investigated for individual one-shot actions. Sports and music, however, are characterized by action sequences, where many individual actions are assembled to develop a performance. Here, utilizing a novel differential sequential motor learning paradigm, we first show that performance at the junctions between pre-learnt action sequences is particularly prone to anxiety. Next, utilizing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we reveal that performance deterioration at the junctions is parametrically correlated with activity in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC). Finally, we show that 1\u2009Hz repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation of the dACC attenuates the performance deterioration at the junctions. These results demonstrate causality between dACC activity and impairment of sequential motor performance due to anxiety, and suggest new intervention techniques against the deterioration. ",
        "Inherited genetic susceptibility to acute lymphoblastic leukemia in Down syndrome. Children with Down syndrome (DS) have a 20-fold increased risk of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and distinct somatic features, including CRLF2 rearrangement in \u223c50% of cases; however, the role of inherited genetic variation in DS-ALL susceptibility is unknown. We report the first genome-wide association study of DS-ALL, comprising a meta-analysis of 4 independent studies, with 542 DS-ALL cases and 1192 DS controls. We identified 4 susceptibility loci at genome-wide significance: rs58923657 near IKZF1 (odds ratio [OR], 2.02; Pmeta = 5.32 \u00d7 10-15), rs3731249 in CDKN2A (OR, 3.63; Pmeta = 3.91 \u00d7 10-10), rs7090445 in ARID5B (OR, 1.60; Pmeta = 8.44 \u00d7 10-9), and rs3781093 in GATA3 (OR, 1.73; Pmeta = 2.89 \u00d7 10-8). We performed DS-ALL vs non-DS ALL case-case analyses, comparing risk allele frequencies at these and other established susceptibility loci (BMI1, PIP4K2A, and CEBPE) and found significant association with DS status for CDKN2A (OR, 1.58; Pmeta = 4.1 \u00d7 10-4). This association was maintained in separate regression models, both adjusting for and stratifying on CRLF2 overexpression and other molecular subgroups, indicating an increased penetrance of CDKN2A risk alleles in children with DS. Finally, we investigated functional significance of the IKZF1 risk locus, and demonstrated mapping to a B-cell super-enhancer, and risk allele association with decreased enhancer activity and differential protein binding. IKZF1 knockdown resulted in significantly higher proliferation in DS than non-DS lymphoblastoid cell lines. Our findings demonstrate a higher penetrance of the CDKN2A risk locus in DS and serve as a basis for further biological insights into DS-ALL etiology. ",
        "Structure of Csx1-cOA4 complex reveals the basis of RNA decay in Type III-B CRISPR-Cas. Type III CRISPR-Cas multisubunit complexes cleave ssRNA and ssDNA. These activities promote the generation of cyclic oligoadenylate (cOA), which activates associated CRISPR-Cas RNases from the Csm/Csx families, triggering a massive RNA decay to provide immunity from genetic invaders. Here we present the structure of Sulfolobus islandicus (Sis) Csx1-cOA4 complex revealing the allosteric activation of its RNase activity. SisCsx1 is a hexamer built by a trimer of dimers. Each dimer forms a cOA4 binding site and a ssRNA catalytic pocket. cOA4 undergoes a conformational change upon binding in the second messenger binding site activating ssRNA degradation in the catalytic pockets. Activation is transmitted in an allosteric manner through an intermediate HTH domain, which joins the cOA4 and catalytic sites. The RNase functions in a sequential cooperative fashion, hydrolyzing phosphodiester bonds in 5'-C-C-3'. The degradation of cOA4 by Ring nucleases deactivates SisCsx1, suggesting that this enzyme could be employed in biotechnological applications. ",
        "Cannabinoids for the treatment of mental disorders and symptoms of mental disorders: a systematic review and meta-analysis. BACKGROUND: Medicinal cannabinoids, including medicinal cannabis and pharmaceutical cannabinoids and their synthetic derivatives, such as tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD), have been suggested to have a therapeutic role in certain mental disorders. We analysed the available evidence to ascertain the effectiveness and safety of all types of medicinal cannabinoids in treating symptoms of various mental disorders. METHODS: For this systematic review and meta-analysis we searched MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Clinical Trials, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews for studies published between Jan 1, 1980, and April 30, 2018. We also searched for unpublished or ongoing studies on ClinicalTrials.gov, the EU Clinical Trials Register, and the Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry. We considered all studies examining any type and formulation of a medicinal cannabinoid in adults (\u226518 years) for treating depression, anxiety, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), Tourette syndrome, post-traumatic stress disorder, or psychosis, either as the primary condition or secondary to other medical conditions. We placed no restrictions on language, publication status, or study type (ie, both experimental and observational study designs were included). Primary outcomes were remission from and changes in symptoms of these mental disorders. The safety of medicinal cannabinoids for these mental disorders was also examined. Evidence from randomised controlled trials was synthesised as odds ratios (ORs) for disorder remission, adverse events, and withdrawals and as standardised mean differences (SMDs) for change in symptoms, via random-effects meta-analyses. The quality of the evidence was assessed with the Cochrane risk of bias tool and Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. This study is registered with PROSPERO (CRD42017059372, CRD42017059373, CRD42017059376, CRD42017064996, and CRD42018102977). FINDINGS: 83 eligible studies (40 randomised controlled trials, n=3067) were included: 42 for depression (23 randomised controlled trials; n=2551), 31 for anxiety (17 randomised controlled trials; n=605), eight for Tourette syndrome (two randomised controlled trials; n=36), three for ADHD (one randomised controlled trial; n=30), 12 for post-traumatic stress disorder (one randomised controlled trial; n=10), and 11 for psychosis (six randomised controlled trials; n=281). Pharmaceutical THC (with or without CBD) improved anxiety symptoms among individuals with other medical conditions (primarily chronic non-cancer pain and multiple sclerosis; SMD -0\u00b725 [95% CI -0\u00b749 to -0\u00b701]; seven studies; n=252), although the evidence GRADE was very low. Pharmaceutical THC (with or without CBD) worsened negative symptoms of psychosis in a single study (SMD 0\u00b736 [95% CI 0\u00b710 to 0\u00b762]; n=24). Pharmaceutical THC (with or without CBD) did not significantly affect any other primary outcomes for the mental disorders examined but did increase the number of people who had adverse events (OR 1\u00b799 [95% CI 1\u00b720 to 3\u00b729]; ten studies; n=1495) and withdrawals due to adverse events (2\u00b778 [1\u00b759 to 4\u00b786]; 11 studies; n=1621) compared with placebo across all mental disorders examined. Few randomised controlled trials examined the role of pharmaceutical CBD or medicinal cannabis. INTERPRETATION: There is scarce evidence to suggest that cannabinoids improve depressive disorders and symptoms, anxiety disorders, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, Tourette syndrome, post-traumatic stress disorder, or psychosis. There is very low quality evidence that pharmaceutical THC (with or without CBD) leads to a small improvement in symptoms of anxiety among individuals with other medical conditions. There remains insufficient evidence to provide guidance on the use of cannabinoids for treating mental disorders within a regulatory framework. Further high-quality studies directly examining the effect of cannabinoids on treating mental disorders are needed.

        "The transferability of lipid loci across African, Asian and European cohorts. Most genome-wide association studies are based on samples of European descent. We assess whether the genetic determinants of blood lipids, a major cardiovascular risk factor, are shared across populations. Genetic correlations for lipids between European-ancestry and Asian cohorts are not significantly different from 1. A genetic risk score based on LDL-cholesterol-associated loci has consistent effects on serum levels in samples from the UK, Uganda and Greece (r\u2009=\u20090.23-0.28, p\u2009<\u20091.9\u2009\u00d7\u200910-14). Overall, there is evidence of reproducibility for ~75% of the major lipid loci from European discovery studies, except triglyceride loci in the Ugandan samples (10% of loci). Individual transferable loci are identified using trans-ethnic colocalization. Ten of fourteen loci not transferable to the Ugandan population have pleiotropic associations with BMI in Europeans; none of the transferable loci do. The non-transferable loci might affect lipids by modifying food intake in environments rich in certain nutrients, which suggests a potential role for gene-environment interactions. ",
        "Insulin-like growth factor 1 signaling in tenocytes is required for adult tendon growth. Tenocytes serve to synthesize and maintain collagen fibrils and other extracellular matrix proteins in tendon. Despite the high prevalence of tendon injury, the underlying biologic mechanisms of postnatal tendon growth and repair are not well understood. IGF1 plays an important role in the growth and remodeling of numerous tissues but less is known about IGF1 in tendon. We hypothesized that IGF1 signaling is required for proper tendon growth in response to mechanical loading through regulation of collagen synthesis and cell proliferation. To test this hypothesis, we conditionally deleted the IGF1 receptor (IGF1R) in scleraxis (Scx)-expressing tenocytes using a tamoxifen-inducible Cre-recombinase system and caused tendon growth in adult mice via mechanical overload of the plantaris tendon. Compared with control Scx-expressing IGF1R-positive (Scx:IGF1R+) mice, in which IGF1R is present in tenocytes, mice that lacked IGF1R in their tenocytes [Scx-expressing IGF1R-negative (Scx:IGF1R\u0394) mice] demonstrated reduced cell proliferation and smaller tendons in response to mechanical loading. Additionally, we identified that both the PI3K/protein kinase B and ERK pathways are activated downstream of IGF1 and interact in a coordinated manner to regulate cell proliferation and protein synthesis. These studies indicate that IGF1 signaling is required for proper postnatal tendon growth and support the potential use of IGF1 in the treatment of tendon disorders.-Disser, N. P., Sugg, K.

        "Discovery of Novel Sequences in 1,000 Swedish Genomes. Novel sequences (NSs), not present in the human reference genome, are abundant and remain largely unexplored. Here, we utilize de novo assembly to study NS in 1,000 Swedish individuals first sequenced as part of the SweGen project revealing a total of 46 Mb in 61,044 distinct contigs of sequences not present in GRCh38. The contigs were aligned to recently published catalogs of Icelandic and Pan-African NSs, as well as the chimpanzee genome, revealing a great diversity of shared sequences. Analyzing the positioning of NS across the chimpanzee genome, we find that 2,807 NS align confidently within 143 chimpanzee orthologs of human genes. Aligning the whole genome sequencing data to the chimpanzee genome, we discover ancestral NS common throughout the Swedish population. The NSs were searched for repeats and repeat elements: revealing a majority of repetitive sequence (56%), and enrichment of simple repeats (28%) and satellites (15%). Lastly, we align the unmappable reads of a subset of the thousand genomes data to our collection of NS, as well as the previously published Pan-African NS: revealing that both the Swedish and Pan-African NS are widespread, and that the Swedish NSs are largely a subset of the Pan-African NS. Overall, these results highlight the importance of creating a more diverse reference genome and illustrate that significant amounts of the NS may be of ancestral origin. ",
        "The molecular basis of chaperone-mediated interleukin 23 assembly control. The functionality of most secreted proteins depends on their assembly into a defined quaternary structure. Despite this, it remains unclear how cells discriminate unassembled proteins en route to the native state from misfolded ones that need to be degraded. Here we show how chaperones can regulate and control assembly of heterodimeric proteins, using interleukin 23 (IL-23) as a model. We find that the IL-23 \u03b1-subunit remains partially unstructured until assembly with its \u03b2-subunit occurs and identify a major site of incomplete folding. Incomplete folding is recognized by different chaperones along the secretory pathway, realizing reliable assembly control by sequential checkpoints. Structural optimization of the chaperone recognition site allows\u00a0it to bypass quality control checkpoints and provides a secretion-competent IL-23\u03b1 subunit, which can still form functional heterodimeric IL-23. Thus, locally-restricted incomplete folding within single-domain proteins can be used to regulate and control their assembly. ",
        "Region-specific regulation of stem cell-driven regeneration in tapeworms. Tapeworms grow at rates rivaling the fastest-growing metazoan tissues. To propagate they shed large parts of their body; to replace these lost tissues they regenerate proglottids (segments) as part of normal homeostasis. Their remarkable growth and regeneration are fueled by adult somatic stem cells that have yet to be characterized molecularly. Using the rat intestinal tapeworm, Hymenolepis diminuta, we find that regenerative potential is regionally limited to the neck, where head-dependent extrinsic signals create a permissive microenvironment for stem cell-driven regeneration. Using transcriptomic analyses and RNA interference, we characterize and functionally validate regulators of tapeworm growth and regeneration. We find no evidence that stem cells are restricted to the regeneration-competent neck. Instead, lethally irradiated tapeworms can be rescued when cells from either regeneration-competent or regeneration-incompetent regions are transplanted into the neck. Together, the head and neck tissues provide extrinsic cues that regulate stem cells, enabling region-specific regeneration in this parasite. ",
        "The circadian clock of CD8 T cells modulates their early response to vaccination and the rhythmicity of related signaling pathways. Circadian variations of various aspects of the immune system have been described. However, the circadian control of T cells has been relatively unexplored. Here, we investigated the role of circadian clocks in regulating CD8 T cell response to antigen presentation by dendritic cells (DCs). The in vivo CD8 T cell response following vaccination with DCs loaded with the OVA257-264 peptide antigen (DC-OVA) leads to a higher expansion of OVA-specific T cells in response to vaccination done in the middle of the day, compared to other time points. This rhythm was dampened when DCs deficient for the essential clock gene Bmal1 were used and abolished in mice with a CD8 T cell-specific Bmal1 deletion. Thus, we assessed the circadian transcriptome of CD8 T cells and found an enrichment in the daytime of genes and pathways involved in T cell activation. Based on this, we investigated early T cell activation events. Three days postvaccination, we found higher T cell activation markers and related signaling pathways (including IRF4, mTOR, and AKT) after a vaccination done during the middle of the day compared to the middle of the night. Finally, the functional impact of the stronger daytime response was shown by a more efficient response to a bacterial challenge at this time of day. Altogether, these results suggest that the clock of CD8 T cells modulates the response to vaccination by shaping the transcriptional program of these cells and making them more prone to strong and efficient activation and proliferation according to the time of day.

        "Apparent thinning of human visual cortex during childhood is associated with myelination. Human cortex appears to thin during childhood development. However, the underlying microstructural mechanisms are unknown. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), quantitative MRI (qMRI), and diffusion MRI (dMRI) in children and adults, we tested what quantitative changes occur to gray and white matter in ventral temporal cortex (VTC) from childhood to adulthood, and how these changes relate to cortical thinning. T1 relaxation time from qMRI and mean diffusivity (MD) from dMRI provide independent and complementary measurements of microstructural properties of gray and white matter tissue. In face- and character-selective regions in lateral VTC, T1 and MD decreased from age 5 to adulthood in mid and deep cortex, as well as in their adjacent white matter. T1 reduction also occurred longitudinally in children's brain regions. T1 and MD decreases 1) were consistent with tissue growth related to myelination, which we verified with adult histological myelin stains, and 2) were correlated with apparent cortical thinning. In contrast, in place-selective cortex in medial VTC, we found no development of T1 or MD after age 5, and thickness was related to cortical morphology. These findings suggest that lateral VTC likely becomes more myelinated from childhood to adulthood, affecting the contrast of MR images and, in turn, the apparent gray-white boundary. These findings are important because they suggest that VTC does not thin during childhood but instead gets more myelinated. Our data have broad ramifications for understanding both typical and atypical brain development using advanced in vivo quantitative measurements and clinical conditions implicating myelin. ",
        "Glomerular Immunodeposits of Patients with IgA Nephropathy Are Enriched for IgG Autoantibodies Specific for Galactose-Deficient IgA1. BACKGROUND: IgA nephropathy (IgAN) is the leading primary GN worldwide. The disease is thought to result from glomerular deposition of circulating immune complexes of IgG bound to galactose-deficient IgA1 (Gd-IgA1). However, routine immunofluorescence microscopy fails to detect IgG in many kidney biopsies from patients with IgAN and the specificity of IgG in immunodeposits has not been tested. METHODS: We used remnant frozen kidney-biopsy specimens from 34 patients with IgAN; 14 were IgG-positive and 20 were IgG-negative by routine immunofluorescence microscopy. Six patients with primary membranous nephropathy (MN) and eight with lupus nephritis (LN) served as controls. IgG in the kidney tissue was extracted and its amount determined by ELISA. IgG molecular integrity was assessed by SDS-PAGE immunoblotting. Antigenic specificity of extracted IgG was determined by ELISA using phospholipase A2 receptor (PLA2R) or Gd-IgA1 as antigen. In addition, ten other IgAN cases, six IgG-positive and four IgG-negative by routine immunofluorescence, were used for colocalization studies by confocal microscopy. RESULTS: IgG extracted from MN but not IgAN immunodeposits reacted with PLA2R. Conversely, IgG extracted from IgAN but not MN or LN immunodeposits reacted with Gd-IgA1. Even IgAN kidney-biopsy specimens without IgG by routine immunofluorescence microscopy had IgG specific for Gd-IgA1. Confocal microscopy confirmed the presence of IgG in the IgAN biopsies with colocalization of glomerular IgA and IgG. CONCLUSIONS: These results reveal for the first time that IgAN kidney biopsies, with or without IgG by routine immunofluorescence, contain Gd-IgA1-specific IgG autoantibodies. These findings support the importance of these autoantibodies in the pathogenesis of IgAN. ",
        "Hijacking the Heme Acquisition System of Pseudomonas aeruginosa for the Delivery of Phthalocyanine as an Antimicrobial. To survive in the iron-devoid environment of their host, pathogenic bacteria have devised multifarious cunning tactics such as evolving intricate heme transport systems to pirate extracellular heme. Yet, the potential of heme transport systems as antimicrobial targets has not been explored. Herein we developed a strategy to deliver antimicrobials by exploiting the extracellular heme acquisition system protein A (HasA) of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. We demonstrated that, analogous to heme uptake, HasA can specifically traffic an antimicrobial, gallium phthalocyanine (GaPc), into the intracellular space of P. aeruginosavia the interaction of HasA with its outer membrane receptor HasR. HasA enables water-insoluble GaPc to be mistakenly acquired by P. aeruginosa, permitting its sterilization (>99.99%) by irradiation with near-infrared (NIR) light, irrespective of antibiotic resistance. Our findings substantiate that bacterial heme uptake via protein-protein recognition is an attractive target for antimicrobials, enabling specific and effective sterilization. ",
        "Influence of Genotype and Hyperandrogenism on Sexual Function in Women With Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia. BACKGROUND: Depending on CYP21A2 genotype, congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency leads to biochemical alterations (including hyperandrogenism, hypocortisolism, and hypoaldosteronism) and a wide spectrum of phenotypic disease manifestation. The latter include life-threatening salt-wasting crises, prenatal virilization of genitalia in women (classic CAH [C-CAH]) as well as milder forms of the disease exclusively presenting with hirsutism, acne or reduced fertility (nonclassic CAH [NC-CAH]), and could influence sexual function and identity. AIM: The present study evaluated sexual function, gender identification, and partner preference in women with C-CAH and NC-CAH. METHODS: In a cross-sectional cohort analysis, 35 female patients with CAH were divided into 2 groups: C-CAH (salt-wasting/simple virilizing; n\u00a0= 17) and NC-CAH (n\u00a0= 18) according to genotype and phenotype. Sexual function and sexual distress were assessed using established questionnaires, including the Female Sexual Function Index. Phenotype (defined by signs of hyperandrogenism) was assessed clinically (Ferriman-Gallwey score) and with the ovulatory function index. CYP21A2 genotype was determined by Sanger sequencing and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification. Sexual function was also separately analyzed in the context of clinical signs of androgenization in women with (n\u00a0= 13) and without acne (n\u00a0= 22). OUTCOMES: The study outcomes were sexual function and sexual distress in relation to genotype, clinical signs of androgenization, and biochemical parameters. RESULTS: Women with NC-CAH had significantly lower orgasm scores, a trend toward lower sexual function with higher sexual distress, as well as biochemical evidence of hyperandrogenism (higher dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate and lower SHBG) and a trend toward more clinical signs of hyperandrogenism (hirsutism). Indicators of in utero and childhood androgen excess as well as the presence of acne in all patients were related to lower sexual function and higher sexual distress. Clinical signs of hyperandrogenism correlated well with cardiovascular and metabolic risk factors. CLINICAL TRANSLATION: Women with NC-CAH and women with clinical signs of hyperandrogenism demonstrated higher distress compared to women with C-CAH and women without clinical signs of hyperandrogenism, respectively, regarding different aspects of sexual function. CONCLUSIONS: These data underline the importance of early diagnosis and therapy initiation, especially in patients with NC-CAH. Schernthaner-Reiter MH, Baumgartner-Parzer S, Egarter HC, et\u00a0al.

        "Loading-Dependent Structural Model of Polymeric Micelles Encapsulating Curcumin by Solid-State NMR Spectroscopy. Detailed insight into the internal structure of drug-loaded polymeric micelles is scarce, but important for developing optimized delivery systems. We observed that an increase in the curcumin loading of triblock copolymers based on poly(2-oxazolines) and poly(2-oxazines) results in poorer dissolution properties. Using solid-state NMR spectroscopy and complementary tools we propose a loading-dependent structural model on the molecular level that provides an explanation for these pronounced differences. Changes in the chemical shifts and cross-peaks in 2D NMR experiments give evidence for the involvement of the hydrophobic polymer block in the curcumin coordination at low loadings, while at higher loadings an increase in the interaction with the hydrophilic polymer blocks is observed. The involvement of the hydrophilic compartment may be critical for ultrahigh-loaded polymer micelles and can help to rationalize specific polymer modifications to improve the performance of similar drug delivery systems.

        "Trends in Dietary Carbohydrate, Protein, and Fat Intake and Diet Quality Among US Adults, 1999-2016. Importance: Changes in the economy, nutrition policies, and food processing methods can affect dietary macronutrient intake and diet quality. It is essential to evaluate trends in dietary intake, food sources, and diet quality to inform policy makers. Objective: To investigate trends in dietary macronutrient intake, food sources, and diet quality among US adults. Design, Setting, and Participants: Serial cross-sectional analysis of the US nationally representative 24-hour dietary recall data from 9 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey cycles (1999-2016) among adults aged 20 years or older. Exposure: Survey cycle. Main Outcomes and Measures: Dietary intake of macronutrients and their subtypes, food sources, and the Healthy Eating Index 2015 (range, 0-100; higher scores indicate better diet quality; a minimal clinically important difference has not been defined). Results: There were 43\u202f996 respondents (weighted mean age, 46.9 years; 51.9% women). From 1999 to 2016, the estimated energy from total carbohydrates declined from 52.5% to 50.5% (difference, -2.02%; 95% CI, -2.41% to -1.63%), whereas that of total protein and total fat increased from 15.5% to 16.4% (difference, 0.82%; 95% CI, 0.67%-0.97%) and from 32.0% to 33.2% (difference, 1.20%; 95% CI, 0.84%-1.55%), respectively (all P\u2009<\u2009.001 for trend). Estimated energy from low-quality carbohydrates decreased by 3.25% (95% CI, 2.74%-3.75%; P\u2009<\u2009.001 for trend) from 45.1% to 41.8%. Increases were observed in estimated energy from high-quality carbohydrates (by 1.23% [95% CI, 0.84%-1.61%] from 7.42% to 8.65%), plant protein (by 0.38% [95% CI, 0.28%-0.49%] from 5.38% to 5.76%), saturated fatty acids (by 0.36% [95% CI, 0.20%-0.51%] from 11.5% to 11.9%), and polyunsaturated fatty acids (by 0.65% [95% CI, 0.56%-0.74%] from 7.58% to 8.23%) (all P\u2009<\u2009.001 for trend). The estimated overall Healthy Eating Index 2015 increased from 55.7 to 57.7 (difference, 2.01; 95% CI, 0.86-3.16; P\u2009<\u2009.001 for trend). Trends in high- and low-quality carbohydrates primarily reflected higher estimated energy from whole grains (0.65%) and reduced estimated energy from added sugars (-2.00%), respectively. Trends in plant protein were predominantly due to higher estimated intake of whole grains (0.12%) and nuts (0.09%). Conclusions and Relevance: From 1999 to 2016, US adults experienced a significant decrease in percentage of energy intake from low-quality carbohydrates and significant increases in percentage of energy intake from high-quality carbohydrates, plant protein, and polyunsaturated fat. Despite improvements in macronutrient composition and diet quality, continued high intake of low-quality carbohydrates and saturated fat remained. ",
        "Association of BCG Vaccination in Childhood With Subsequent Cancer Diagnoses: A 60-Year Follow-up of a Clinical Trial. Importance: The BCG vaccine is currently the only approved tuberculosis vaccine and is widely administered worldwide, usually during infancy. Previous studies found increased rates of lymphoma and leukemia in BCG-vaccinated populations. Objective: To determine whether BCG vaccination was associated with cancer rates in a secondary analysis of a BCG vaccine trial. Design, Setting, and Participants: Retrospective review (60-year follow-up) of a clinical trial in which participants were assigned to the vaccine group by systematic stratification by school district, age, and sex, then randomized by alternation. The original study was conducted at 9 sites in 5 US states between December 1935 and December 1998. Participants were 2963 American Indian and Alaska Native schoolchildren younger than 20 years with no evidence of previous tuberculosis infection. Statistical analysis was conducted between August 2018 and July 2019. Interventions: Single intradermal injection of either BCG vaccine or saline placebo. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was diagnosis of cancer after BCG vaccination. Data on participant interval health and risk factors, including smoking, tuberculosis infection, isoniazid use, and other basic demographic information, were also collected. Results: A total of 2963 participants, including 1540 in the BCG vaccine group and 1423 in the placebo group, remained after exclusions. Vaccination occurred at a median (interquartile range) age of 8 (5-11) years; 805 participants (52%) in the BCG group and 710 (50%) in the placebo group were female. At the time of follow-up, 97 participants (7%) in the placebo group and 106 participants (7%) in the BCG vaccine group could not be located; total mortality was 633 participants (44%) in the placebo group and 632 participants (41%) in the BCG group. The overall rate of cancer diagnosis was not significantly different in BCG vaccine vs placebo recipients (hazard ratio, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.66-1.02), including for lymphoma and leukemia. The rate of lung cancer was significantly lower in BCG vs placebo recipients (18.2 vs 45.4 cases per 100\u202f000 person-years; hazard ratio, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.20-0.74; P\u2009=\u2009.005), controlling for sex, region, alcohol overuse, smoking, and tuberculosis. Conclusions and Relevance: Childhood BCG vaccination was associated with a lower risk of lung cancer development in American Indian and Alaska Native populations. This finding has potentially important health implications given the high mortality rate associated with lung cancer and the availability of low-cost BCG vaccines. ",
        "Visualizing trypanosomes in a vertebrate host reveals novel swimming behaviours, adaptations and attachment mechanisms. Trypanosomes are important disease agents of humans, livestock and cold-blooded species, including fish. The cellular morphology of trypanosomes is central to their motility, adaptation to the host's environments and pathogenesis. However, visualizing the behaviour of trypanosomes resident in a live vertebrate host has remained unexplored. In this study, we describe an infection model of zebrafish (Danio rerio) with Trypanosoma carassii. By combining high spatio-temporal resolution microscopy with the transparency of live zebrafish, we describe in detail the swimming behaviour of trypanosomes in blood and tissues of a vertebrate host. Besides the conventional tumbling and directional swimming, T. carassii can change direction through a 'whip-like' motion or by swimming backward. Further, the posterior end can act as an anchoring site in vivo. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a vertebrate infection model that allows detailed imaging of trypanosome swimming behaviour in vivo in a natural host environment. ",
        "Exons 45-55 Skipping Using Mutation-Tailored Cocktails of Antisense Morpholinos in the DMD Gene. Mutations in the dystrophin (DMD) gene and consequent loss\u00a0of dystrophin cause Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). A promising therapy for DMD, single-exon skipping using antisense phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers (PMOs), currently confronts major issues in that an antisense drug induces the production of functionally undefined dystrophin and may not be similarly efficacious among patients with different mutations. Accordingly, the applicability of this approach is limited to out-of-frame mutations. Here, using an exon-skipping efficiency predictive tool, we designed three different PMO cocktail sets for exons 45-55 skipping aiming to produce a dystrophin variant with preserved functionality as seen in milder or asymptomatic individuals with an in-frame exons 45-55 deletion. Of them, the most effective set was composed of select PMOs that each efficiently skips an assigned exon in cell-based screening. These combinational PMOs fitted to different deletions of immortalized DMD patient muscle cells significantly induced exons 45-55 skipping with removing 3, 8, or 10 exons and dystrophin restoration as represented by western blotting. In\u00a0vivo skipping of the maximum 11 human DMD exons was confirmed in humanized mice. The finding indicates that our PMO set can be used to create mutation-tailored cocktails for exons 45-55 skipping and treat over 65% of DMD patients carrying out-of-frame or in-frame deletions. ",
        "Transcriptome stability profiling using 5'-bromouridine IP chase (BRIC-seq) identifies novel and functional microRNA targets in human melanoma cells. RNA half-life is closely related to its cellular physiological function, so stability determinants may have regulatory functions. Micro(mi)RNAs have primarily been studied with respect to post-transcriptional mRNA regulation and target degradation. Here we study the impact of the tumour suppressive melanoma miRNA miR-211 on transcriptome stability and phenotype in the non-pigmented melanoma cell line, A375. Using 5'-bromouridine IP chase (BRIC)-seq, transcriptome-wide RNA stability profiles revealed highly regulated genes and pathways important in this melanoma cell line. By combining BRIC-seq, RNA-seq and in silico predictions, we identified both existing and novel direct miR-211 targets. We validated DUSP3 as one such novel miR-211 target, which itself sustains colony formation and invasion in A375 cells via MAPK/PI3K signalling. miRNAs have the capacity to control RNA turnover as a gene expression mechanism, and RNA stability profiling is an excellent tool for interrogating functionally relevant gene regulatory pathways and miRNA targets when combined with other high-throughput and in silico approaches.

        "Healthy Dietary Patterns and Incidence of CKD: A Meta-Analysis of Cohort Studies. BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Whether a healthy dietary pattern may prevent the incidence of developing CKD is unknown. This study evaluated the associations between dietary patterns and the incidence of CKD in adults and children. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: This systematic review and meta-analysis identified potential studies through a systematic search of MEDLINE, Embase and references from eligible studies from database inception to February 2019. Eligible studies were prospective and retrospective cohort studies including adults and children without CKD, where the primary exposure was dietary patterns. To be eligible, studies had to report on the primary outcome, incidence of CKD (eGFR<60 ml/min per 1.73 m2). Two authors independently extracted data, assessed risk of bias and evidence certainty using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale and GRADE. RESULTS: Eighteen prospective cohort studies involving 630,108 adults (no children) with a mean follow-up of 10.4\u00b17.4 years were eligible for analysis. Included studies had an overall low risk of bias. The evidence certainty was moderate for CKD incidence and low for eGFR decline (percentage drop from baseline or reduced by at least 3 ml/min per 1.73 m2 per year) and incident albuminuria. Healthy dietary patterns typically encouraged higher intakes of vegetables, fruit, legumes, nuts, whole grains, fish and low-fat dairy, and lower intakes of red and processed meats, sodium, and sugar-sweetened beverages. A healthy dietary pattern was associated with a lower incidence of CKD (odds ratio [OR] 0.70 (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 0.60 to 0.82); I2=51%; eight studies), and incidence of albuminuria (OR 0.77, [95% CI, 0.59 to 0.99]; I2=37%); four studies). There appeared to be no significant association between healthy dietary patterns and eGFR decline (OR 0.70 [95% CI, 0.49 to 1.01], I2=49%; four studies). CONCLUSIONS: A healthy dietary pattern may prevent CKD and albuminuria. ",

        "Dual peroxisome-proliferator-activated-receptor-\u03b1/\u03b3 activation inhibits SIRT1-PGC1\u03b1 axis and causes cardiac dysfunction. Dual peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)\u03b1/\u03b3 agonists that were developed to target hyperlipidemia and hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes patients, caused cardiac dysfunction or other adverse effects. We studied the mechanisms that underlie the cardiotoxic effects of a dual PPAR\u03b1/\u03b3 agonist, tesaglitazar, in wild type and diabetic (leptin receptor deficient - db/db) mice. Mice treated with tesaglitazar-containing chow or high fat diet developed cardiac dysfunction despite lower plasma triglycerides and glucose levels. Expression of cardiac peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC1\u03b1), which promotes mitochondrial biogenesis, had the most profound reduction among various fatty acid metabolism genes. Furthermore, we observed increased acetylation of PGC1\u03b1, which suggests PGC1\u03b1 inhibition and lowered sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) expression. This change was associated with lower mitochondrial abundance. Combined pharmacological activation of PPAR\u03b1 and PPAR\u03b3 in C57BL/6 mice reproduced the reduction of PGC1\u03b1 expression and mitochondrial abundance. Resveratrol-mediated SIRT1 activation attenuated tesaglitazar-induced cardiac dysfunction and corrected myocardial mitochondrial respiration in C57BL/6 and diabetic mice but not in cardiomyocyte-specific Sirt1-/- mice. Our data shows that drugs, which activate both PPAR\u03b1 and PPAR\u03b3 lead to cardiac dysfunction associated with PGC1\u03b1 suppression and lower mitochondrial abundance likely due to competition between these two transcription factors.

        "Native American admixture recapitulates population-specific migration and settlement of the continental United States. European and African descendants settled the continental US during the 17th-19th centuries, coming into contact with established Native American populations. The resulting admixture among these groups yielded a significant reservoir of Native American ancestry in the modern US population. We analyzed the patterns of Native American admixture seen for the three largest genetic ancestry groups in the US population: African descendants, Western European descendants, and Spanish descendants. The three groups show distinct Native American ancestry profiles, which are indicative of their historical patterns of migration and settlement across the country. Native American ancestry in the modern African descendant population does not coincide with local geography, instead forming a single group with origins in the southeastern US, consistent with the Great Migration of the early 20th century. Western European descendants show Native American ancestry that tracks their geographic origins across the US, indicative of ongoing contact during westward expansion, and Native American ancestry can resolve Spanish descendant individuals into distinct local groups formed by more recent migration from Mexico and Puerto Rico. We found an anomalous pattern of Native American ancestry from the US southwest, which most likely corresponds to the Nuevomexicano descendants of early Spanish settlers to the region. We addressed a number of controversies surrounding this population, including the extent of Sephardic Jewish ancestry. Nuevomexicanos are less admixed than nearby Mexican-American individuals, with more European and less Native American and African ancestry, and while they do show demonstrable Sephardic Jewish ancestry, the fraction is no greater than seen for other New World Spanish descendant populations.

        "Early Single Sport Specialization in a High-Achieving US Athlete Population: Comparing National Collegiate Athletic Association Student-Athletes and Undergraduate Students. CONTEXT: Early single-sport specialization and the relative age effect are often cited as improving the chances of sport success. Both concepts suggest that genetics and the environment have little influence on sport success. OBJECTIVE: To compare National Collegiate Athletic Association Division I student-athletes (SAs) with their undergraduate nonathlete peers (NAs) in terms of birth month, age of sport initiation, and age of single-sport specialization. A family history of sport participation was examined as a potential marker for genetic and social influences. DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey. SETTING: Large urban university. PATIENTS OR OTHER PARTICIPANTS: A total of 273 Division I SAs (138 women, 135 men) and 155 NAs (78 women, 77 men) participated. The NAs had been involved in competitive youth sports before entering the university. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Participants were asked to complete a questionnaire that addressed the age of sport initiation, birth month, age of single-sport specialization, and parental and sibling sport achievement. MAIN RESULTS: Neither birth month nor the age of sport initiation differed between groups (age of sport initiation = 7.16 \u00b1 2.6 years for the SAs versus 7.71 \u00b1 3.5 for the NAs; P = .176). A larger proportion of SAs began participating before 10 years of age (80% versus 63%; P = .02). The parents of SAs were more likely to have participated in collegiate (32.4% versus 8.4%; P < .0001) and professional (10.9% versus 1.3%; P = .0005) sports. The SAs specialized in a single sport at an older age (15.38 \u00b1 2.7 years versus 14.30 \u00b1 2.6 years; P = .002). Both groups participated in multiple sports in childhood (SAs = 3.9 \u00b1 1.8 sports, NAs = 3.2 \u00b1 1.8 sports; P = .366). CONCLUSIONS: The Division I SAs did not specialize in a single sport at a younger age than the NAs. No evidence of a relative age effect was present. Importantly, higher levels of sport achievement among the parents and siblings of SAs suggest that genetic endowment and family or other environmental dynamics play a large role in athletic performance. Overall, the results are not consistent with deliberate practice theory and point toward an alternative model that includes not only sport-specific skill development but also genetic and social factors as key elements of long-term sport achievement.

        "Parkinson's Disease in Women and Men: What's the Difference?. Increasing evidence points to biological sex as an important factor in the development and phenotypical expression of Parkinson's disease (PD). Risk of developing PD is twice as high in men than women, but women have a higher mortality rate and faster progression of the disease. Moreover, motor and nonmotor symptoms, response to treatments and disease risk factors differ between women and men. Altogether, sex-related differences in PD support the idea that disease development might involve distinct pathogenic mechanisms (or the same mechanism but in a different way) in male and female patients. This review summarizes the most recent knowledge concerning differences between women and men in PD clinical features, risk factors, response to treatments and mechanisms underlying the disease pathophysiology. Unraveling how the pathology differently affect the two sexes might allow the development of tailored interventions and the design of innovative programs that meet the distinct needs of men and women, improving patient care.

        "Pediatric Psychiatric Emergency Department Utilization and Fine Particulate Matter: A Case-Crossover Study. BACKGROUND:. Acute exposure to ambient particulate matter <2.5\u03bcm in aerodynamic diameter (PM2.5) has been associated with adult psychiatric exacerbations but has not been studied in children. . OBJECTIVES:. Our objectives were to estimate the association between acute exposures to ambient PM2.5 and psychiatric emergency department (ED) utilization and to determine if it is modified by community deprivation. . METHODS:. We used a time-stratified case-crossover design to analyze all pediatric, psychiatric ED encounters at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center in Cincinnati, Ohio, from 2011 to 2015 (n=13,176). Conditional logistic regression models adjusted for temperature, humidity, and holiday effects were used to estimate the odds ratio (OR) for a psychiatric ED visit 0-3 d after ambient PM2.5 exposures, estimated at residential addresses using a spatiotemporal model. . RESULTS:. A 10-\u03bcg/m3 increase in PM2.5 was associated with a significant increase in any psychiatric ED utilization 1 [OR=1.07 (95% CI: 1.02, 1.12)] and 2 [OR=1.05 (95% CI: 1.00, 1.10)] d later. When stratified by visit reason, associations were significant for ED visits related to adjustment disorder {e.g., 1-d lag [OR=1.24 (95% CI: 1.02, 1.52)] and suicidality 1-d lag [OR=1.44 (95% CI: 1.03, 2.02)]}. There were significant differences according to community deprivation, with some lags showing stronger associations among children in high versus low deprivation areas for ED visits for anxiety {1-d lag [OR=1.39 (95% CI: 0.96, 2.01) vs. 0.85 (95% CI: 0.62, 1.17)] and suicidality same day [OR=1.98 (95% CI: 1.22, 3.23) vs. 0.93 (95% CI: 0.60, 1.45)]}. In contrast, for some lags, associations with ED visits for adjustment disorder were weaker for children in high-deprivation areas {1-d lag [OR=1.00 (95% CI: 0.76, 1.33) vs. 1.50 (95% CI: 1.16, 1.93)]}. . DISCUSSION:. These findings warrant additional research to confirm the associations in other populations. ",
        "Maturation of Brain Microstructure and Metabolism Associates with Increased Capacity for Self-Regulation during the Transition from Childhood to Adolescence. Children ages 9-12 years face increasing social and academic expectations that require mastery of their thoughts, emotions, and behavior. Little is known about the development of neural pathways integral to these improving capacities during the transition from childhood to adolescence. Among 234 healthy, inner-city male and female youth (species Homo sapiens) 9-12 years of age followed by the Columbia Center for Children's Environmental Health, we acquired diffusion tensor imaging, multiplanar chemical shift imaging, and cognitive measures requiring self-regulation. We found that increasing age was associated with increased fractional anisotropy and decreased apparent diffusion coefficient, most prominently in the frontal and cingulate cortices, striatum, thalamus, deep white matter, and cerebellum. Additionally, we found increasing age was associated with increased N-acetyl-l-aspartate (NAA) in the anterior cingulate and insular cortices, and decreased NAA in posterior cingulate and parietal cortices. Age-associated changes in microstructure and neurometabolite concentrations partially mediated age-related improvements in performance on executive function tests. Together, these findings suggest that maturation of key regions within cortico-striatal-thalamo-cortical circuits subserve the emergence of improved self-regulatory capacities during the transition from childhood to adolescence.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Few imaging studies of normal brain development have focused on a population of inner-city, racial/ethnic minority youth during the transition from childhood to adolescence, a period when self-regulatory capacities rapidly improve. We used DTI and MPCSI to provide unique windows into brain maturation during this developmental epoch, assessing its mediating influences on age-related improvement in performance on self-regulatory tasks. Our findings suggest that rapid maturation of cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical circuits, represented as progressive white-matter maturation (increasing FA and increasing NAA, Ch, Cr concentrations accompanying advancing age) in frontal regions and related subcortical projections and synaptic pruning (decreasing NAA, Ch, Cr, Glx) in posterior regions, support age-related improvements in executive functioning and self-regulatory capacities in youth 9-12 years of age.

        "Association Between Occupational Exposure to Pesticides and Cardiovascular Disease Incidence: The Kuakini Honolulu Heart Program. Background Previously, Kuakini Honolulu Heart Program researchers reported that occupational exposure to pesticides was significantly associated with total mortality. The current study examines occupational exposure to pesticides in relation to incident cardiovascular disease, defined as coronary heart disease or cerebrovascular accident. Methods and Results With the Occupational Safety Health Administration exposure scale used as an estimate of exposure, statistical analyses were performed on a cohort of 7557 Japanese-American men from the Kuakini Honolulu Heart Program. Hazard ratios for cardiovascular disease incidence were calculated for various levels of pesticide exposure using Cox proportional hazards models. In the first 10\u00a0years of follow-up, a positive association was observed between age-adjusted cardiovascular disease incidence and high levels of pesticide exposure (hazard ratio=1.46, 95% CI=1.10-1.95, P=0.009). This relationship remained significant after adjustment for other cardiovascular disease risk factors (hazard ratio=1.42, 95% CI=1.05-1.92, P=0.021). No significant association for coronary heart disease or cerebrovascular accident incidence with pesticide exposure was observed when examined separately, possibly due to a smaller number of events. Conclusions These findings suggest that occupational exposure to pesticides may play a role in the development of cardiovascular diseases. The results are novel, as the association between occupational exposure to pesticides and cardiovascular disease incidence has not been examined previously in this unique cohort. ",
        "A robust human norovirus replication model in zebrafish larvae. Human noroviruses (HuNoVs) are the most common cause of foodborne illness, with a societal cost of $60 billion and 219,000 deaths/year. The lack of robust small animal models has significantly hindered the understanding of norovirus biology and the development of effective therapeutics. Here we report that HuNoV GI and GII replicate to high titers in zebrafish (Danio rerio) larvae; replication peaks at day 2 post infection and is detectable for at least 6 days. The virus (HuNoV GII.4) could be passaged from larva to larva two consecutive times. HuNoV is detected in cells of the hematopoietic lineage and the intestine, supporting the notion of a dual tropism. Antiviral treatment reduces HuNoV replication by >2 log10, showing that this model is suited for antiviral studies. Zebrafish larvae constitute a simple and robust replication model that will largely facilitate studies of HuNoV biology and the development of antiviral strategies. ",
        "Is Film as a Research Tool the Future of Public Health? A Review of Study Designs, Opportunities, and Challenges. Among public health researchers, there is growing interest in film methods due to their ability to highlight subtleties in practices, capture emotions, engage hard-to-reach populations, and advocate for social change. Still, little is known about strengths and challenges associated with using film methods in public health. This review synthesizes peer-reviewed, public health research studies that apply film methods, and describes opportunities and challenges. Of the 3,431 identified articles, 20 met the inclusion criteria. Fifteen different film methods were found that offer numerous methodological strengths, including the ability to provide rich descriptions, capture emic perspectives, increase comfort in participation, empower participants, and be used for advocacy. Future studies may explore engaging participants throughout the entire research process and using visuals created in the study to communicate findings. Keeping in mind their challenges, film methods are long overdue in public health and provide unique opportunities to capture sensory data. ",
        "Single-cell profiling guided combinatorial immunotherapy for fast-evolving CDK4/6 inhibitor-resistant HER2-positive breast cancer. Acquired resistance to targeted cancer therapy is a significant clinical challenge. In parallel with clinical trials combining CDK4/6 inhibitors to treat HER2+\u00a0breast cancer, we sought to prospectively model tumor evolution in response to this regimen in vivo and identify a clinically actionable strategy to combat drug\u00a0resistance. Despite a promising initial response, acquired resistance emerges rapidly to the\u00a0combination of anti-HER2/neu antibody and CDK4/6 inhibitor Palbociclib. Using high-throughput single-cell profiling over the course of treatments, we reveal a distinct immunosuppressive immature myeloid cell (IMC) population to\u00a0infiltrate the resistant tumors. Guided by single-cell transcriptome analysis, we demonstrate that\u00a0combination of IMC-targeting tyrosine kinase inhibitor cabozantinib and immune checkpoint blockade enhances anti-tumor immunity, and overcomes the resistance. Furthermore, sequential combinatorial immunotherapy enables a sustained control of the fast-evolving CDK4/6 inhibitor-resistant tumors. Our study demonstrates a translational framework for treating rapidly evolving tumors through preclinical modeling and single-cell analyses. ",
        "Phylogenomic analysis of gastroenteritis-associated Clostridium perfringens in England and Wales over a 7-year period indicates distribution of clonal toxigenic strains in multiple outbreaks and extensive involvement of enterotoxin-encoding (CPE) plasmids. Clostridium perfringens is a major enteric pathogen known to cause gastroenteritis in human adults. Although major outbreak cases are frequently reported, only limited whole-genome sequencing (WGS) based studies have been performed to understand the genomic epidemiology and virulence gene content of outbreak-associated C. perfringens strains. We performed phylogenomic analysis on 109 C. perfringens isolates (human and food) obtained from disease cases in England and Wales between 2011 and 2017. Initial findings highlighted the enhanced discriminatory power of WGS in profiling outbreak C. perfringens strains, when compared to the current Public Health England referencing laboratory technique of fluorescent amplified fragment length polymorphism analysis. Further analysis identified that isogenic C. perfringens strains were associated with nine distinct care-home-associated outbreaks over the course of a 5-year interval, indicating a potential common source linked to these outbreaks or transmission over time and space. As expected, the enterotoxin cpe gene was encoded in all but 4 isolates (96.3 %; 105/109), with virulence plasmids encoding cpe (particularly pCPF5603 and pCPF4969 plasmids) extensively distributed (82.6 %; 90/109). Genes encoding accessory virulence factors, such as beta-2 toxin, were commonly detected (46.7 %; 51/109), and genes encoding phage proteins were also frequently identified. Overall, this large-scale genomic study of gastroenteritis-associated C. perfringens suggested that three major cpe-encoding (toxinotype F) genotypes underlie these outbreaks: strains carrying (1) pCPF5603 plasmid, (2) pCPF4969 plasmid and (3) chromosomal-cpe strains. Our findings substantially expanded our knowledge on type F C. perfringens involved in human-associated gastroenteritis, with further studies required to fully probe the dissemination and regional reservoirs of this enteric pathogen, which may help devise effective prevention strategies to reduce the food-poisoning disease burden in vulnerable patients, such as the elderly.

        "Mild replication stress causes chromosome mis-segregation via premature centriole disengagement. Replication stress, a hallmark of cancerous and pre-cancerous lesions, is linked to structural chromosomal aberrations. Recent studies demonstrated that it could also lead to numerical chromosomal instability (CIN). The mechanism, however, remains elusive. Here, we show that inducing replication stress in non-cancerous cells stabilizes spindle microtubules and favours premature centriole disengagement, causing transient multipolar spindles that lead to lagging chromosomes and micronuclei. Premature centriole disengagement depends on the G2 activity of the Cdk, Plk1 and ATR kinases, implying a DNA-damage induced deregulation of the centrosome cycle. Premature centriole disengagement also occurs spontaneously in some CIN+ cancer cell lines and can be suppressed by attenuating replication stress. Finally, we show that replication stress potentiates the effect of the chemotherapeutic agent taxol, by increasing the incidence of multipolar cell divisions. We postulate that replication stress in cancer cells induces numerical CIN via transient multipolar spindles caused by premature centriole disengagement. ",
        "Association of Expanded Medicaid Coverage With Health and Job-Related Outcomes Among Enrollees With Behavioral Health Disorders. OBJECTIVES: The study objective was to assess the impact of Medicaid expansion on health and employment outcomes among enrollees with and without a behavioral health disorder (either a mental or substance use disorder). METHODS: Between January and October 2016, the authors conducted a telephone survey of 4,090 enrollees in the Michigan Medicaid expansion program and identified 2,040 respondents (48.3%) with potential behavioral health diagnoses using claims-based diagnoses. RESULTS: Enrollees with behavioral health diagnoses were less likely than enrollees without behavioral health diagnoses to be employed but significantly more likely to report improvements in health and ability to do a better job at work. In adjusted analyses, both enrollees with behavioral health diagnoses and those without behavioral health diagnoses who reported improved health were more likely than enrollees without improved health to report that Medicaid expansion coverage helped them do a better job at work and made them better able to look for a job. Among enrollees with improved health, those with a behavioral health diagnosis were as likely as those without a behavioral health diagnosis to report improved ability to work and improved job seeking after Medicaid expansion. CONCLUSIONS: Coverage interruptions for enrollees with behavioral health diagnoses should be minimized to maintain favorable health and employment outcomes. ",
        "Neutrophil Recruitment to Noninvasive MRSA at the Stratum Corneum of Human Skin Mediates Transient Colonization. Staphylococcus aureus is a leading cause of skin and soft issue infection, but paradoxically, it also transiently, and often harmlessly, colonizes human skin. An obstacle to understanding this contradiction has been a shortage of in\u00a0vivo models reproducing the unique structure and immunology of human skin. In this work, we developed a humanized model to study how healthy adult human skin responds to colonizing methicillin-resistant S.\u00a0aureus (MRSA). We demonstrate the importance of the outer stratum corneum as the major site of bacterial colonization and how noninvasive MRSA adhesion to corneocytes induces a local inflammatory response in underlying skin layers. This signaling recruits neutrophils to the skin, where they control bacterial numbers, mediating transiency in colonization. This work highlights the spatiotemporal aspects of human skin colonization and demonstrates a subclinical inflammatory response to noninvasive MRSA that allows human skin to regulate the bacterial population at its outer surface.

        "Association of Treatment With Metformin vs Sulfonylurea With Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events Among Patients With Diabetes and Reduced Kidney Function. Importance: Before 2016, safety concerns limited metformin use in patients with kidney disease; however, the effectiveness of metformin on clinical outcomes in patients with reduced kidney function remains unknown. Objective: To compare major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) among patients with diabetes and reduced kidney function who continued treatment with metformin or a sulfonylurea. Design, Setting, and Participants: Retrospective cohort study of US veterans receiving care within the national Veterans Health Administration, with data supplemented by linkage to Medicare, Medicaid, and National Death Index data from 2001 through 2016. There were 174\u202f882 persistent new users of metformin and sulfonylureas who reached a reduced kidney function threshold (estimated glomerular filtration rate <60 mL/min/1.73 m2 or creatinine \u22651.4 mg/dL for women or \u22651.5 mg/dL for men). Patients were followed up from reduced kidney function threshold until MACE, treatment change, loss to follow-up, death, or study end (December 2016). Exposures: New users of metformin or sulfonylurea monotherapy who continued treatment with their glucose-lowering medication after reaching reduced kidney function. Main Outcomes and Measures: MACE included hospitalization for acute myocardial infarction, stroke, transient ischemic attack, or cardiovascular death. The analyses used propensity score weighting to compare the cause-specific hazard of MACE between treatments and estimate cumulative risk accounting for the competing risks of changing therapy or noncardiovascular death. Results: There were 67\u202f749 metformin and 28\u202f976 sulfonylurea persistent monotherapy users; the weighted cohort included 24\u202f679 metformin and 24\u202f799 sulfonylurea users (median age, 70 years [interquartile range {IQR}, 62.8-77.8]; 48\u202f497 men [98%]; and 40\u202f476 white individuals [82%], with median estimated glomerular filtration rate of 55.8 mL/min/1.73 m2 [IQR, 51.6-58.2] and hemoglobin A1c level of 6.6% [IQR, 6.1%-7.2%] at cohort entry). During follow-up (median, 1.0 year for metformin vs 1.2 years for sulfonylurea), there were 1048 MACE outcomes (23.0 per 1000 person-years) among metformin users and 1394 events (29.2 per 1000 person-years) among sulfonylurea users. The cause-specific adjusted hazard ratio of MACE for metformin was 0.80 (95% CI, 0.75-0.86) compared with sulfonylureas, yielding an adjusted rate difference of 5.8 (95% CI, 4.1-7.3) fewer events per 1000 person-years of metformin use compared with sulfonylurea use. Conclusions and Relevance: Among patients with diabetes and reduced kidney function persisting with monotherapy, treatment with metformin, compared with a sulfonylurea, was associated with a lower risk of MACE.

        "Plastic Teabags Release Billions of Microparticles and Nanoparticles into Tea. The increasing presence of micro- and nano-sized plastics in the environment and food chain is of growing concern. Although mindful consumers are promoting the reduction of single-use plastics, some manufacturers are creating new plastic packaging to replace traditional paper uses, such as plastic teabags. The objective of this study was to determine whether plastic teabags could release microplastics and/or nanoplastics during a typical steeping process. We show that steeping a single plastic teabag at brewing temperature (95 \u00b0C) releases approximately 11.6 billion microplastics and 3.1 billion nanoplastics into a single cup of the beverage. The composition of the released particles is matched to the original teabags (nylon and polyethylene terephthalate) using Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The levels of nylon and polyethylene terephthalate particles released from the teabag packaging are several orders of magnitude higher than plastic loads previously reported in other foods. An initial acute invertebrate toxicity assessment shows that exposure to only the particles released from the teabags caused dose-dependent behavioral and developmental effects. ",
        "Development of a comprehensive health-risk prediction tool for postmenopausal women. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to develop a web-based calculator that predicts the likelihood of experiencing multiple, competing outcomes prospectively over 5, 10, and 15 years. METHODS: Baseline demographic and medical data from a healthy and racially and ethnically diverse cohort of 161,808 postmenopausal women, aged 50 to 79 at study baseline, who participated in the Women's Health Initiative (WHI), were used to develop and evaluate a risk-prediction calculator designed to predict individual risk for morbidity and mortality outcomes. Women were enrolled from 40 sites arranged in four regions of the United States. The calculator predicts all-cause mortality, adjudicated outcomes of health events (ie, myocardial infarction [MI], stroke, and hip fracture), and disease (lung, breast, and colorectal cancer). A proportional subdistribution hazards regression model was used to develop the calculator in a training dataset using data from three regions. The calculator was evaluated using the C-statistic in a test dataset with data from the fourth region. RESULTS: The predictive validity of our calculator measured by the C-statistic in the test dataset for a first event at 5 and 15 years was as follows: MI 0.77, 0.61, stroke 0.77, 0.72, lung cancer 0.82, 0.79, breast cancer 0.60, 0.59, colorectal cancer 0.67, 0.60, hip fracture 0.79, 0.76, and death 0.74, 0.72. CONCLUSION: This study represents the first large-scale study to develop a risk prediction calculator that yields health risk prediction for several outcomes simultaneously. Development of this tool is a first step toward enabling women to prioritize interventions that may decrease these risks. : Video Summary:http://links.lww.com/MENO/A463. ",
        "Multi-omics analysis identifies mitochondrial pathways associated with anxiety-related behavior. Stressful life events are major environmental risk factors for anxiety disorders, although not all individuals exposed to stress develop clinical anxiety. The molecular mechanisms underlying the influence of environmental effects on anxiety are largely unknown. To identify biological pathways mediating stress-related anxiety and resilience to it, we used the chronic social defeat stress (CSDS) paradigm in male mice of two inbred strains, C57BL/6NCrl (B6) and DBA/2NCrl (D2), that differ in their susceptibility to stress. Using a multi-omics approach, we identified differential mRNA, miRNA and protein expression changes in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) and blood cells after chronic stress. Integrative gene set enrichment analysis revealed enrichment of mitochondrial-related genes in the BNST and blood of stressed mice. To translate these results to human anxiety, we investigated blood gene expression changes associated with exposure-induced panic attacks. Remarkably, we found reduced expression of mitochondrial-related genes in D2 stress-susceptible mice and in exposure-induced panic attacks in humans, but increased expression of these genes in B6 stress-susceptible mice. Moreover, stress-susceptible vs. stress-resilient B6 mice displayed more mitochondrial cross-sections in the post-synaptic compartment after CSDS. Our findings demonstrate mitochondrial-related alterations in gene expression as an evolutionarily conserved response in stress-related behaviors and validate the use of cross-species approaches in investigating the biological mechanisms underlying anxiety disorders.

        "Evaluation of immunologic and intestinal effects in rats administered an E 171-containing diet, a food grade titanium dioxide (TiO2). The toxicity of dietary E 171, a food grade titanium dioxide was evaluated. A recent study reported rats receiving E 171 in water developed inflammation and aberrant crypt foci (ACF) in the gastrointestinal tract. Here, rats received food containing E 171 (7 or 100 days). The 100-day study included feeding E 171 after dimethylhydrazine (DMH) or vehicle only pretreatment. Food consumption was similar between treatment groups with maximum total cumulative E 171 exposure being 2617\u202fmg/kg in 7 days and 29,400\u202fmg/kg in 100 days. No differences were observed due to E 171 in the percentage of dendritic, CD4+ T or Treg cells within Peyer's patches or the periphery, or in cytokine production in plasma, sections of jejunum, and colon in 7- or 100-day E 171 alone fed rats. Differences were observed for IL-17A in colon (400\u00a0ppm\u00a0E 171\u00a0+\u00a0DMH) and IL-12p70 in plasma (40\u00a0ppm\u00a0E 171\u00a0+\u00a0DMH). E 171 had no effect on histopathologic evaluations of small and large intestines, liver, spleen, lungs, or testes, and no effects on ACF, goblet cell numbers, or colonic gland length. Dietary E 171 administration (7- or 100-day), even at high doses, produced no effect on the immune parameters or tissue morphology. ",
        "The psychometric properties of a new oral health illness perception measure for adults aged 62 years and older. BACKGROUND: Based on the Common-Sense Model of Self-Regulation (CSM), a new integrated Illness Perception Questionnaire Revised for Dental Use in Older/Elder Adults (IPQ-RDE) was developed for single and multiple dental conditions. This study describes psychometric properties of the IPQ-RDE for adults 62 years and older. METHODS: Participants (n = 198) living in 16 subsidized housing facilities completed the IPQ-RDE and a questionnaire assessing their socio-demographics, frequency of dental visits, perceived condition of teeth/gums, depression, social support, and oral health quality of life (OHQOL). Participants received dental screening for presence/absence of teeth, coronal and root caries, and periodontitis. The 43-item IPQ-RDE was tested for internal (construct, discriminant) and external validity (concurrent, construct, discriminant, predictive) and reliability (internal consistency). RESULTS: Confirmatory factor analysis demonstrated that a ten-factor model in accordance with the CSM framework (identity, consequences, control, timeline, illness coherence, treatment burden, prioritization, causal relationship, activity restriction, emotional representations) had good construct validity based on significant factor loadings and acceptable model fit (RMSEA = 0.065, CFI = 0.902). Edentulous participants had significantly higher mean factor scores (inaccurate perception) for overall IPQ-RDE and four constructs indicating concurrent validity. Discriminant validity was suggested by non-relationship with external measures (education, dental visit frequency). Predictive validity was indicated by the negative correlation of most constructs with OHQOL suggesting that inaccurate perception was related to lower quality of life. Internal consistency of eight IPQ-RDE constructs was excellent (Cronbach's alpha > 0.73). CONCLUSIONS: The IPQ-RDE is a valid and reliable new measure for assessing older adult's perception of dental conditions. It can be an important tool for oral health behavioral research to restructure older adult's perception of dental conditions, and subsequently prevent tooth loss and improve oral health quality of life.

        "The Prevention of Infections in Older Adults: Oral Health. The oral cavity is exposed to the external environment and from a very young age is colonized by infectious agents. Under certain circumstances including poor oral hygiene, dry mouth, trauma, and the use of antibiotics, oral infections can occur. They can result in damage to the oral cavity including teeth and their support structures. Oral infections can also lead to the extension of infection into surrounding tissues and to systemic infections. Chronic oral infection is a recognized risk factor for heart disease. Older adults are at high risk for oral infections and associated complications. Tooth loss, for which infection is the most significant cause, leads to cosmetic changes and a decreased ability to masticate certain foods that can lead to malnutrition. Chronic oral infections and the manipulation of teeth and supporting structures can lead to the hematogenous spread of infection including the infection of artificial joints and endocardial implants. Good oral hygiene, the use of fluoride, regular dental care, and the appropriate use of antibiotics can all reduce oral infections and their associated complications.

        "Left ventricular dysfunction in potential heart donors and its influence on recipient outcomes. OBJECTIVES: New onset of left ventricular (LV) dysfunction in organ donors is frequent and considered as a contraindication for utilization of the heart. However, such dysfunction might be caused by sympathetic stress and could be transient (Takotsubo syndrome). In this study, we assessed the incidence, pattern, and predictors of LV dysfunction in potential heart donors and evaluated its influence on recipient outcomes. METHODS: Donor records of consecutive organ donors in western Sweden between 2006 and 2016 were reviewed. Recipients of transplanted donor hearts were identified in the Scandiatransplant database. RESULTS: Of 641 potential heart donors who underwent echocardiographic assessment, LV dysfunction (ejection fraction <50% and/or regional hypokinesia) was found in 155 donors (24%). Regional hypokinesia was seen in 113 donors of whom 46 had a Takotsubo-like circumferential hypokinetic pattern. Independent donor variables associated with LV dysfunction were a younger age, cardiac arrest as a contributing factor to death, need for inotropic support, and a shorter time from admission to declaration of brain death. A total of 338 (54%) donor hearts were transplanted, of which 45 (14%) had LV dysfunction. LV dysfunction was a major determinant of not transplanting the heart (P\u00a0<\u00a0.001).\u00a0After transplantation, LV function normalized in the recipients. Neither short-term outcomes nor the composite end point of death or retransplantation over time differed between recipients of donor hearts with versus without LV dysfunction (P\u00a0=\u00a0.587). CONCLUSIONS: LV dysfunction is common among potential heart donors. These\u00a0hearts were safely transplanted in this study. The use of these hearts might\u00a0significantly increase transplantation rates. ",
        "Tonic Suppression of the Mesolimbic Dopaminergic System by Enhanced Corticotropin-Releasing Factor Signaling Within the Bed Nucleus of the Stria Terminalis in Chronic Pain Model Rats. Although dysfunction of the mesolimbic dopaminergic system has been implicated in chronic pain, the underlying mechanisms remain to be elucidated. We hypothesized that increased inhibitory inputs to the neuronal pathway from the dorsolateral bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (dlBNST) to the ventral tegmental area (VTA) during chronic pain may induce tonic suppression of the mesolimbic dopaminergic system. To test this hypothesis, male Sprague Dawley rats were subjected to spinal nerve ligation to induce neuropathic pain and then spontaneous IPSCs (sIPSCs) were measured in this neuronal pathway. Whole-cell patch-clamp electrophysiology of brain slices containing the dlBNST revealed that the frequency of sIPSCs significantly increased in VTA-projecting dlBNST neurons 4 weeks after surgery. Next, the role of corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) signaling within the dlBNST in the increased sIPSCs was examined. CRF increased the frequency of sIPSCs in VTA-projecting dlBNST neurons in sham-operated controls, but not in chronic pain rats. By contrast, NBI27914, a CRF type 1 receptor antagonist, decreased the frequency of sIPSCs in VTA-projecting dlBNST neurons in the chronic pain rats, but not in the control animals. In addition, histological analyses revealed the increased expression of CRF mRNA in the dlBNST. Finally, bilateral injections of NBI27914 into the dlBNST of chronic pain rats activated mesolimbic dopaminergic neurons and induced conditioned place preference. Together, these results suggest that the mesolimbic dopaminergic system is tonically suppressed during chronic pain by enhanced CRF signaling within the dlBNST via increased inhibitory inputs to VTA-projecting dlBNST neurons.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT The comorbidity of chronic pain and depression has long been recognized. Although dysfunction of the mesolimbic dopaminergic system has been implicated in both chronic pain and depression, the underlying mechanisms remain to be elucidated. Here, we show that the inhibitory inputs to the neuronal pathway from the dorsolateral bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (dlBNST) to the ventral tegmental area increase during chronic pain. This neuroplastic change is mediated by enhanced corticotropin-releasing factor signaling within the dlBNST that leads to tonic suppression of the mesolimbic dopaminergic system, which may be involved in the depressive mood and anhedonia under the chronic pain condition.

        "Introduction of Tau Oligomers into Cortical Neurons Alters Action Potential Dynamics and Disrupts Synaptic Transmission and Plasticity. Tau is a highly soluble microtubule-associated protein that acts within neurons to modify microtubule stability. However, abnormally phosphorylated tau dissociates from microtubules to form oligomers and fibrils which associate in the somatodendritic compartment. Although tau can form neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), it is the soluble oligomers that appear to be the toxic species. There is, however, relatively little quantitative information on the concentration-dependent and time-dependent actions of soluble tau oligomers (oTau) on the electrophysiological and synaptic properties of neurons. Here, whole-cell patch clamp recording was used to introduce known concentrations of oligomeric full-length tau-441 into mouse hippocampal CA1 pyramidal and neocortical Layer V thick-tufted pyramidal cells. oTau increased input resistance, reduced action potential amplitude and slowed action potential rise and decay kinetics. oTau injected into presynaptic neurons induced the run-down of unitary EPSPs which was associated with increased short-term depression. In contrast, introduction of oTau into postsynaptic neurons had no effect on basal synaptic transmission, but markedly impaired the induction of long-term potentiation (LTP). Consistent with its effects on synaptic transmission and plasticity, oTau puncta could be observed in the soma, axon and in the distal dendrites of injected neurons. ",
        "Presenilin/\u03b3-secretase-dependent EphA3 processing mediates axon elongation through non-muscle myosin IIA. EphA/ephrin signaling regulates axon growth and guidance of neurons, but whether this process occurs also independently of ephrins is unclear. We show that presenilin-1 (PS1)/\u03b3-secretase is required for axon growth in the developing mouse brain. PS1/\u03b3-secretase mediates axon growth by inhibiting RhoA signaling and cleaving EphA3 independently of ligand to generate an intracellular domain (ICD) fragment that reverses axon defects in PS1/\u03b3-secretase- and EphA3-deficient hippocampal neurons. Proteomic analysis revealed that EphA3 ICD binds to non-muscle myosin IIA (NMIIA) and increases its phosphorylation (Ser1943), which promotes NMIIA filament disassembly and cytoskeleton rearrangement. PS1/\u03b3-secretase-deficient neurons show decreased phosphorylated NMIIA and NMIIA/actin colocalization. Moreover, pharmacological NMII inhibition reverses axon retraction in PS-deficient neurons suggesting that NMIIA mediates PS/EphA3-dependent axon elongation. In conclusion, PS/\u03b3-secretase-dependent EphA3 cleavage mediates axon growth by regulating filament assembly through RhoA signaling and NMIIA, suggesting opposite roles of EphA3 on inhibiting (ligand-dependent) and promoting (receptor processing) axon growth in developing neurons.

        "Genetic architecture of human plasma lipidome and its link to cardiovascular disease. Understanding genetic architecture of plasma lipidome could provide better insights into lipid metabolism and its link to cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). Here, we perform genome-wide association analyses of 141 lipid species (n\u2009=\u20092,181 individuals), followed by phenome-wide scans with 25 CVD related phenotypes (n\u2009=\u2009511,700 individuals). We identify 35 lipid-species-associated loci (P\u2009<5\u2009\u00d710-8), 10 of which associate with CVD risk including five new loci-COL5A1, GLTPD2, SPTLC3, MBOAT7 and GALNT16 (false discovery rate<0.05). We identify loci for lipid species that are shown to predict CVD e.g., SPTLC3 for CER(d18:1/24:1). We show that lipoprotein lipase (LPL) may more efficiently hydrolyze medium length triacylglycerides (TAGs) than others. Polyunsaturated lipids have highest heritability and genetic correlations, suggesting considerable genetic regulation at fatty acids levels. We find low genetic correlations between traditional lipids and lipid species. Our results show that lipidomic profiles capture information beyond traditional lipids and identify genetic variants modifying lipid levels and risk of CVD. ",
        "Possible role of L-form switching in recurrent urinary tract infection. Recurrent urinary tract infection (rUTI) is a major medical problem, especially in the elderly and infirm, but the nature of the reservoir of organisms responsible for survival and recolonisation after antibiotic treatment in humans is unclear. Here, we demonstrate the presence of cell-wall deficient (L-form) bacteria in fresh urine from 29 out of 30 older patients with rUTI. In urine, E. coli strains from patient samples readily transition from the walled state to L-form during challenge with a cell wall targeting antibiotic. Following antibiotic withdrawal, they then efficiently transition back to the walled state. E. coli switches between walled and L-form states in a zebrafish larva infection model. The results suggest that L-form switching is a physiologically relevant phenomenon that may contribute to the recurrence of infection in older patients with rUTI, and potentially other infections. ",
        "Differences In Nutritional And Physical Health Indicators Among Older African Americans, European Americans, And Hispanic Americans. Inadequate protein intake contributes to poor nutritional status, reduced muscle mass, strength and function, and increased mortality. Evaluating differences in protein intake and related health indicators among racial/ethnic groups enables the development of targeted interventions. This study's purpose was to determine differences in protein intake, nutritional status, and muscle strength/function among 273 older African, European, and Hispanic Americans. Protein intake, nutritional status, grip strength, timed-up-and-go (TUG), and chair stand assessments were conducted. Protein intake was significantly greater among Hispanic Americans (0.96\u2009g/kg body weight) followed by European Americans (0.83\u2009g/kg body weight), and African Americans (0.64\u2009g/kg body weight). Intakes by all groups were below recommendations. Low nutritional status, grip strength, chair rise, and TUG scores were observed in African Americans and European American females and were consistent with lower protein intakes. Results show significant differences among the groups and the need for interventions to improve diet and physical health. ",
        "Risk of prostate cancer for men fathering through assisted reproduction: nationwide population based register study. OBJECTIVE: To compare the risk and severity of prostate cancer between men achieving fatherhood by assisted reproduction and men conceiving naturally. DESIGN: National register based cohort study. SETTING: Sweden from January 1994 to December 2014. PARTICIPANTS: 1\u2009181\u2009490 children born alive in Sweden during 1994-2014 to the same number of fathers. Fathers were grouped according to fertility status by mode of conception: 20\u2009618 by in vitro fertilisation (IVF), 14\u2009882 by intra-cytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI), and 1\u2009145\u2009990 by natural conception. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Prostate cancer diagnosis, age of onset, and androgen deprivation therapy (serving as proxy for advanced or metastatic malignancy). RESULTS: Among men achieving fatherhood by IVF, by ICSI, and by non-assisted means, 77 (0.37%), 63 (0.42%), and 3244 (0.28%), respectively, were diagnosed as having prostate cancer. Mean age at onset was 55.9, 55.1, and 57.1 years, respectively. Men who became fathers through assisted reproduction had a statistically significantly increased risk of prostate cancer compared with men who conceived naturally (hazard ratio 1.64, 95% confidence interval 1.25 to 2.15, for ICSI; 1.33, 1.06 to 1.66, for IVF). They also had an increased risk of early onset disease (that is, diagnosis before age 55 years) (hazard ratio 1.86, 1.25 to 2.77, for ICSI; 1.51, 1.09 to 2.08, for IVF). Fathers who conceived through ICSI and developed prostate cancer received androgen deprivation therapy to at least the same extent as the reference group (odds ratio 1.91; P=0.07). CONCLUSIONS: Men who achieved fatherhood through assisted reproduction techniques, particularly through ICSI, are at increased risk for early onset prostate cancer and thus constitute a risk group in which testing and careful long term follow-up for prostate cancer may be beneficial.

        "Prescription Opioid Use in Patients With and Without Systemic Lupus Erythematosus - Michigan Lupus Epidemiology and Surveillance Program, 2014-2015. Rheumatic diseases are a leading cause of chronic, noncancer pain. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic autoimmune rheumatic disease characterized by periodic flares that can result in irreversible target organ damage, including end-stage renal disease. Both intermittent and chronic musculoskeletal pain, as well as fibromyalgia (considered a centralized pain disorder due to dysregulation of pain processing in the central nervous system), are common in SLE. Opioids are generally not indicated for long-term management of musculoskeletal pain or centralized pain (fibromyalgia) because of lack of efficacy, safety issues ranging from adverse medical effects to overdose, and risk for addiction (1,2). In this study of 462 patients with SLE from the population-based Michigan Lupus Epidemiology and Surveillance (MILES) Cohort and 192 frequency-matched persons without SLE, nearly one third (31%) of SLE patients were using prescription opioids during the study period (2014-2015), compared with 8% of persons without SLE (p<0.001). Among the SLE patients using opioids, 97 (68%) were using them for >1 year, and 31 (22%) were concomitantly on two or more opioid medications. Among SLE patients, those using the emergency department (ED) were approximately twice as likely to use prescription opioids (odds ratio [OR]\u00a0=\u00a02.1; 95% confidence interval [CI]\u00a0=\u00a01.3-3.6; p = 0.004). In SLE, the combined contributions of underlying disease and adverse effects of immunosuppressive and glucocorticoid therapies already put patients at higher risk for some known adverse effects attributed to long-term opioid use. Addressing the widespread and long-term use of opioid therapy in SLE will require strategies aimed at preventing opioid initiation, tapering and discontinuation of opioids among patients who are not achieving treatment goals of reduced pain and increased function, and consideration of nonopioid pain management strategies.
