        "A regional systems intervention for suicide prevention in the Netherlands\u00a0(SUPREMOCOL):\u00a0study protocol with a stepped wedge trial design. BACKGROUND: In the Netherlands, suicide rates showed a sharp incline and this pertains particularly to the province of Noord-Brabant, one of the southern provinces in the Netherlands. This calls for a regional suicide prevention effort. METHODS/DESIGN: Study protocol. A regional suicide prevention systems intervention is implemented and evaluated by a stepped wedge trial design in five specialist mental health institutions and their adherent chain partners. Our system intervention is called SUPREMOCOL, which stands for Suicide Prevention by Monitoring and Collaborative Care, and focuses on four pillars: 1) recognition of people at risk for suicide by the development and implementation of a monitoring system with decision aid, 2) swift access to specialist care of people at risk, 3) positioning nurse care managers for collaborative care case management, and 4) 12\u2009months telephone follow up. Eligible patients are persons attempting suicide or expressing suicidal ideation. Primary outcome is number of completed suicides, as reported by Statistics Netherlands and regional Public Health Institutes. Secondary outcome is number of attempted suicides, as reported by the regional ambulance transport and police. Suicidal ideation of persons registered in the monitoring system will, be assessed by the PHQ-9 and SIDAS questionnaires at baseline and 3, 6, 9 and 12\u2009months after registration, and used as exploratory process measure. The impact of the intervention will be evaluated by means of the RE-AIM dimensions reach, efficacy, adoption, implementation, and maintenance. Intervention integrity will be assessed and taken into account in the analysis. DISCUSSION: The present manuscript presents the design and development of the SUPREMOCOL study. The ultimate goal is to lower the completed suicides rate by 20%, compared to the control period and compared to other provinces in the Netherlands. Moreover, our goal is to provide specialist mental health institutions and chain partners with a sustainable and adoptable intervention for suicide prevention. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Netherlands Trial Register under registration number NL6935 (5 April 2018). This is the first version of the study protocol (September 2019). ",
        "ChiTaRS 5.0: the comprehensive database of chimeric transcripts matched with druggable fusions and 3D chromatin maps. Chimeric RNA transcripts are formed when exons from two genes fuse together, often due to chromosomal translocations, transcriptional errors or trans-splicing effect. While these chimeric RNAs produce functional proteins only in certain cases, they play a significant role in disease phenotyping and progression. ChiTaRS 5.0 (http://chitars.md.biu.ac.il/) is the latest and most comprehensive chimeric transcript repository, with 111\u00a0582 annotated entries from eight species, including 23\u00a0167 known human cancer breakpoints. The database includes unique information correlating chimeric breakpoints with 3D chromatin contact maps, generated from public datasets of chromosome conformation capture techniques (Hi-C). In this update, we have added curated information on druggable fusion targets matched with chimeric breakpoints, which are applicable to precision medicine in cancers. The introduction of a new section that lists chimeric RNAs in various cell-lines is another salient feature. Finally, using text-mining techniques, novel chimeras in Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, dyslexia and other diseases were collected in ChiTaRS. Thus, this improved version is an extensive catalogue of chimeras from multiple species. It extends our understanding of the evolution of chimeric transcripts in eukaryotes and contributes to the analysis of 3D genome conformational changes and the functional role of chimeras in the etiopathogenesis of cancers and other complex diseases.

        "Learned sensing: jointly optimized microscope hardware for accurate image classification. Since its invention, the microscope has been optimized for interpretation by a human observer. With the recent development of deep learning algorithms for automated image analysis, there is now a clear need to re-design the microscope's hardware for specific interpretation tasks. To increase the speed and accuracy of automated image classification, this work presents a method to co-optimize how a sample is illuminated in a microscope, along with a pipeline to automatically classify the resulting image, using a deep neural network. By adding a \"physical layer\" to a deep classification network, we are able to jointly optimize for specific illumination patterns that highlight the most important sample features for the particular learning task at hand, which may not be obvious under standard illumination. We demonstrate how our learned sensing approach for illumination design can automatically identify malaria-infected cells with up to 5-10% greater accuracy than standard and alternative microscope lighting designs. We show that this joint hardware-software design procedure generalizes to offer accurate diagnoses for two different blood smear types, and experimentally show how our new procedure can translate across different experimental setups while maintaining high accuracy.

        "Posttraumatic Stress Disorder and Incident Infections: A Nationwide Cohort Study. BACKGROUND: It is unknown whether posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is associated with incident infections. This study's objectives were to examine (1) the association between PTSD diagnosis and 28 types of infections and (2) the interaction between PTSD diagnosis and sex on the rate of infections. METHODS: The study population consisted of a longitudinal nationwide cohort of all residents of Denmark who received a PTSD diagnosis between 1995 and 2011, and an age- and sex-matched general population comparison cohort. We fit Cox proportional hazards regression models to examine associations between PTSD diagnosis and infections. To account for multiple estimation, we adjusted the hazard ratios (HRs) using semi-Bayes shrinkage. We calculated interaction contrasts to assess the presence of interaction between PTSD diagnosis and sex. RESULTS: After semi-Bayes shrinkage, the HR for any type of infection was 1.8 (95% confidence interval: 1.6, 2.0), adjusting for marital status, non-psychiatric comorbidity, and diagnoses of substance abuse, substance dependence, and depression. The association between PTSD diagnosis and some infections (e.g., urinary tract infections) were stronger among women, whereas other associations were stronger among men (e.g., skin infections). CONCLUSIONS: This study's findings suggest that PTSD diagnosis is a risk factor for numerous infection types and that the associations between PTSD diagnosis and infections are modified by sex. ",
        "Prenatal and Infancy Nurse Home Visiting Effects on Mothers: 18-Year Follow-up of a Randomized Trial. BACKGROUND: Prenatal and infancy home-visiting by nurses is promoted as a means of improving maternal life-course, but evidence of long-term effects is limited. We hypothesized that nurse-visitation would lead to long-term reductions in public-benefit costs, maternal substance abuse and depression, and that cost-savings would be greater for mothers with initially higher psychological resources. METHODS: We conducted an 18-year follow-up of 618 out of 742 low-income, primarily African-American mothers with no previous live births enrolled in an randomized clinical trial of prenatal and infancy home visiting by nurses.\u00a0We compared nurse-visited and control-group women for public-benefit costs, rates of substance abuse and depression, and examined possible mediators of intervention effects. RESULTS: Nurse-visited women, compared with controls, incurred $17\u2009310 less in public benefit costs (P = .03), an effect more pronounced for women with higher psychological resources ($28\u2009847, P = .01). These savings compare with program costs of $12\u2009578. There were no program effects on substance abuseor depression. Nurse-visited women were more likely to be married from child age 2 through 18 (19.2% vs 14.8%, P = .04), and those with higher psychological resources had 4.64 fewer cumulative years rearing subsequent children after the birth of the first child (P = .03). Pregnancy planning was a significant mediator of program effects on public benefit costs. CONCLUSIONS: Through child age 18, the program reduced public-benefit costs, an effect more pronounced for mothers with higher psychological resources and mediated by subsequent pregnancy planning. There were no effects on maternal substance abuse and depression. ",
        "Fine Particulate Air Pollution from Electricity Generation in the US: Health Impacts by Race, Income, and Geography. Electricity generation is a large contributor to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) air pollution. However, the demographic distribution of the resulting exposure is largely unknown. We estimate exposures to and health impacts of PM2.5 from electricity generation in the US, for each of the seven Regional Transmission Organizations (RTOs), for each US state, by income and by race. We find that average exposures are the highest for blacks, followed by non-Latino whites. Exposures for remaining groups (e.g., Asians, Native Americans, Latinos) are somewhat lower. Disparities by race/ethnicity are observed for each income category, indicating that the racial/ethnic differences hold even after accounting for differences in income. Levels of disparity differ by state and RTO. Exposures are higher for lower-income than for higher-income, but disparities are larger by race than by income. Geographically, we observe large differences between where electricity is generated and where people experience the resulting PM2.5 health consequences; some states are net exporters of health impacts, other are net importers. For 36 US states, most of the health impacts are attributable to emissions in other states. Most of the total impacts are attributable to coal rather than other fuels. ",
        "PACAP and Other Neuropeptide Targets Link Chronic Migraine and Opioid-induced Hyperalgesia in Mouse Models. Chronic use of opioids can produce opioid-induced hyperalgesia (OIH), and when used to treat migraine, these drugs can result in increased pain and headache chronicity. We hypothesized that overlapping mechanisms between OIH and chronic migraine occur through neuropeptide dysregulation. Using label-free, non-biased liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry to identify and measure changes in more than 1500 neuropeptides under these two conditions, we observed only 16 neuropeptides that were altered between the two conditions. The known pro-migraine molecule, calcitonin-gene related peptide, was among seven peptides associated with chronic migraine, with several pain-processing neuropeptides among the nine other peptides affected in OIH. Further, composite peptide complements Pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP), Vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) and Secretogranin (SCG) showed significant changes in both chronic migraine and OIH. In a follow-up pharmacological study, we confirmed the role of PACAP in models of these two disorders, validating the effectiveness of our peptidomic approach, and identifying PACAP as a mechanistic link between chronic migraine and OIH. Data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD013362. ",
        "Lack of resolution sensor drives age-related cardiometabolic and cardiorenal defects and impedes inflammation-resolution in heart failure. OBJECTIVE: Recently, we observed that the specialized proresolving mediator (SPM) entity resolvin D1 activates lipoxin A4/formyl peptide receptor 2 (ALX/FPR2), which facilitates cardiac healing and persistent inflammation is a hallmark of impaired cardiac repair in aging. Splenic leukocyte-directed SPMs are essential for the safe clearance of inflammation and cardiac repair after injury; however, the target of SPMs remains undefined in cardiac healing and repair. METHODS: To define the mechanistic basis of ALX/FPR2 as a resolvin D1 target, ALX/FPR2-null mice were examined extensively. The systolic-diastolic heart function was assessed using echocardiography, leukocytes were phenotyped using flow cytometry, and SPMs were quantitated using mass spectrometry. The presence of cardiorenal syndrome was validated using histology and renal markers. RESULTS: Lack of ALX/FPR2 led to the development of spontaneous obesity and diastolic dysfunction with reduced survival with aging. After cardiac injury, ALX/FPR2-/- mice showed lower expression of lipoxygenases (-5,\u00a0-12,\u00a0-15) and a reduction in SPMs in the infarcted left ventricle and spleen, indicating nonresolving inflammation. Reduced SPM levels in the infarcted heart and spleen are suggestive of impaired cross-talk between the injured heart and splenic leukocytes, which are required for the resolution of inflammation. In contrast, cyclooxygenases (-1 and\u00a0-2) were over amplified in the infarcted heart. Together, these results suggest interorgan signaling in which the spleen acts as both an SPM biosynthesizer and supplier in acute heart failure. ALX/FPR2 dysfunction magnified obesogenic cardiomyopathy and renal inflammation (\u2191NGAL, \u2191TNF-\u03b1, \u2191CCL2, \u2191IL-1\u03b2) with elevated plasma creatinine levels in aging mice. At the cellular level, ALX/FPR2-/- mice showed impairment of macrophage phagocytic function ex-vivo with expansion of neutrophils after myocardial infarction. CONCLUSIONS: Lack of ALX/FPR2 induced obesity, reduced the life span, amplified leukocyte dysfunction, and facilitated profound interorgan nonresolving inflammation. Our study shows the integrative and indispensable role of ALX/FPR2 in lipid metabolism, cardiac inflammation-resolution processes, obesogenic aging, and renal homeostasis. ",
        "Improving Automated Pediatric Bone Age Estimation Using Ensembles of Models from the 2017 RSNA Machine Learning Challenge. Purpose: To investigate improvements in performance for automatic bone age estimation that can be gained through model ensembling. Materials and Methods: A total of 48 submissions from the 2017 RSNA Pediatric Bone Age Machine Learning Challenge were used. Participants were provided with 12 611 pediatric hand radiographs with bone ages determined by a pediatric radiologist to develop models for bone age determination. The final results were determined using a test set of 200 radiographs labeled with the weighted average of six ratings. The mean pairwise model correlation and performance of all possible model combinations for ensembles of up to 10 models using the mean absolute deviation (MAD) were evaluated. A bootstrap analysis using the 200 test radiographs was conducted to estimate the true generalization MAD. Results: The estimated generalization MAD of a single model was 4.55 months. The best-performing ensemble consisted of four models with an MAD of 3.79 months. The mean pairwise correlation of models within this ensemble was 0.47. In comparison, the lowest achievable MAD by combining the highest-ranking models based on individual scores was 3.93 months using eight models with a mean pairwise model correlation of 0.67. Conclusion: Combining less-correlated, high-performing models resulted in better performance than naively combining the top-performing models. Machine learning competitions within radiology should be encouraged to spur development of heterogeneous models whose predictions can be combined to achieve optimal performance.\u00a9 RSNA, 2019 Supplemental material is available for this article.

        "Force perceptual bias caused by muscle activity in unimanual steering. This study sought to investigate whether force perceptual bias was affected by differences in posture while steering an automobile using a psychophysical experiment to examine the relationship with muscle activity. The human perceptual characteristics of weight and force are known to be nonlinear, and a perceptual bias can occur, that is, bias that causes a perception of something that is larger or smaller than the actual scale. This is considered to be caused by physical and/or psychological conditions. Sense of effort is believed to be one influential factor. It is known to correlate with muscle activity intensity, and bias may be caused by muscle activity changes. In the current study, we hypothesized that force perceptual bias would depend on posture due to the intensity of muscle activity changes caused by changing postures during steering operation. By investigating this hypothesis, we can clarify the relationship between sense of effort and muscle activity. To investigate this issue, we conducted a psychophysical experiment to confirm postural dependence, and estimated muscle activity using a three-dimensional musculoskeletal model simulation with postural and arm force data during the experiment. In addition, prediction of bias was conducted based on a simulation in the psychophysical experiment using these data. The results revealed that bias existed, as measured by differences in postures. Additionally, a significant moderate correlation was found between the predicted bias and the actual bias, indicating the existence of a relationship between muscle activity and bias. ",
        "The landscape of multiscale transcriptomic networks and key regulators in Parkinson's disease. Genetic and genomic studies have advanced our knowledge of inherited Parkinson's disease (PD), however, the etiology and pathophysiology of idiopathic PD remain unclear. Herein, we perform a meta-analysis of 8 PD postmortem brain transcriptome studies by employing a multiscale network biology approach to delineate the gene-gene regulatory structures in the substantia nigra and determine key regulators of the PD transcriptomic networks. We identify STMN2, which encodes a stathmin family protein and is down-regulated in PD brains, as a key regulator functionally connected to known PD risk genes. Our network analysis predicts a function of human STMN2 in synaptic trafficking, which is validated in Stmn2-knockdown mouse dopaminergic neurons. Stmn2 reduction in the mouse midbrain causes dopaminergic neuron degeneration, phosphorylated \u03b1-synuclein elevation, and locomotor deficits. Our integrative analysis not only begins to elucidate the global landscape of PD transcriptomic networks but also pinpoints potential key regulators of PD pathogenic pathways. ",
        "Associations Between Habitual School-Day Breakfast Consumption Frequency and Academic Performance in British Adolescents. Studies indicate that breakfast positively affects learning in children. The present study aimed to examine associations between habitual school-day breakfast consumption frequency and academic performance, as measured by the General Certificate of Secondary Education (GCSE). The GCSE is a national academic qualification obtained by most British children during secondary education. Adolescents aged 16-18 years (n = 294; females: 77.2%) completed a retrospective 7-day food diary to report breakfast intake and a questionnaire to report GCSE grades. Breakfast was defined as any food or drink containing \u22655% of total energy expenditure (TEE) consumed up to 10:00 a.m. on school days. Habitual weekly school-day breakfast consumption frequency was categorized as rare (0-1 school days), occasional (2-3 school days), or frequent (4-5 school days). GCSE grades were aggregated into point scores and linear regression models were applied. Participants' GCSE grades in Mathematics and English were analyzed using ordinal logistic regression. Adolescents who rarely consumed breakfast on school days had a significantly lower capped point score (\u03b2 = -0.13, p < 0.05) and mean point score (\u03b2 = -0.14, p < 0.05) compared with frequent consumers. Low/middle socio-economic status (SES) adolescents who rarely consumed breakfast were significantly less likely to achieve higher Mathematics grades compared to low/middle SES adolescents who frequently consumed breakfast [adjusted cumulative odds ratio (OR): 0.35 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.17-0.72]. This cross-sectional study demonstrates that habitual school-day breakfast consumption amongst adolescents is a significant correlate of GCSE attainment. The results offer promising associative evidence which warrants further exploration in well controlled studies. ",
        "Effects of sleep extension on sleep duration, sleepiness, and blood pressure in college students. OBJECTIVES: Sleep is a major lifestyle factor that may change dramatically when students begin college. Sleep duration has been shown to influence cardiometabolic health. We investigated the feasibility of sleep extension in college students to increase actigraphically measured sleep duration\u00a0and the association of sleep extension with daytime sleepiness and blood pressure. DESIGN: This was a within-participant experimental study. SETTING: The study setting was 14-day at-home study and 3 in-lab visits. PARTICIPANTS: The participants included in this study were healthy undergraduate students (n=53; mean age 20.5 \u00b1 1.1 years; 70% female). INTERVENTION: Participants maintained a habitual sleep schedule during week 1 and then were instructed to extend their sleep duration by at least 1 hour per night for week\u00a02. MEASUREMENTS: Sleep measures included wrist actigraphy and daytime sleepiness assessed by the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) and by daily diary. Cardiovascular measures included blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR). ESS, BP and HR were measured during lab visits on days 7 and 14. Multilevel modeling was used to test the effects of extension on sleep duration, daytime sleepiness, BP and HR. RESULTS: Participants increased sleep duration during week 2 by 43.0 \u00b1 6.2 standard error minutes per night, compared with week 1 (p<.001). Furthermore, 41 of 53 participants (77%) increased their sleep duration by >15 minutes per night (p<.001). Participants reported less daytime sleepiness on weekly ESS (p<.05) and daily log ratings (p<.001) after sleep extension; and systolic BP was significantly reduced by 7.0 \u00b1 3.0 mmHg (p<.05). CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that substantive sleep extension is feasible in college students and can positively impact their sleep and cardiovascular health. ",
        "Parents know best: Caregiver perspectives on eating disorder recovery. OBJECTIVE: This study used mixed methods to evaluate caregiver perspectives on recovery from an eating disorder. METHOD: Caregivers (N = 387) completed an online survey about their child's weight history, treatment history, illness trajectory, and recovery. RESULTS: Children were predominantly females with adolescent onset anorexia nervosa and currently 18.4\u2009years old on average. Qualitative analysis of caregivers' open-ended definitions of recovery revealed seven distinct recovery domains, including (a) weight (45%); (b) body image, eating disorder cognitions, and related emotions (54%); (c) eating behavior (71%); (d) independence and responsibility in eating disorder management (28%); (e) physical health (21%); (f) psychological well-being (31%); and (g) life worth living (27%). Most (72%) reported that their child had achieved partial or full recovery at some point in their lifetime. Only 20% reported that their child had ever achieved full recovery, but 93% of those had sustained recovery over time (i.e., no relapses since achieving recovery). Physical recovery occurred on average 2.7\u2009years after eating disorder onset, followed shortly by social and emotional recovery (2.9\u2009years), and finally behavioral (3.4\u2009years) and cognitive (3.9\u2009years) recovery, which occurred at weights 6-7 pounds higher than those at which physical recovery was achieved. DISCUSSION: Findings suggest that caregivers hold a multifaceted view of recovery that includes not only weight restoration and symptom reduction, but also full engagement in social and occupational activities, establishment of a meaningful life, cognitive flexibility, and emotional well-being. These data support clinical observations that physical and behavioral recovery precede cognitive recovery. ",
        "Peripheral inflammatory markers and clinical correlations in patients with frontotemporal lobar degeneration with and without the C9orf72 repeat expansion. In this study, our aim was to evaluate potential peripheral inflammatory changes in frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) patients carrying or not the C9orf72 repeat expansion. To this end, levels of several inflammatory markers (MCP-1, RANTES, IL-10, IL-17A, IL-12p, IFN-\u03b3, IL-1\u03b2, IL-8, and hs-CRP) and blood cells counts in plasma and/or serum of FTLD patients (N\u2009=\u200998) with or without the C9orf72 repeat expansion were analyzed. In addition, we evaluated whether the analyzed peripheral inflammatory markers correlated with disease progression or distinct clinical phenotypes under the heterogenous FTLD spectrum. Elevated levels of pro-inflammatory RANTES or MCP-1 and decreased levels of anti-inflammatory IL-10 were found to associate with Parkinsonism and a more rapid disease progression, indicated by longitudinal measurements of either MMSE or ADCS-ADL decline. These findings were observed in the total cohort in general, whereas the C9orf72 repeat expansion carriers showed only slight differences in IL-10 and hemoglobin levels compared to non-carriers. Furthermore, these C9orf72 repeat expansion-associated differences were observed mostly in male subjects. The females in general showed elevated levels of several pro-inflammatory markers compared to males regardless of the C9orf72 genotype. Our study suggests that pro-inflammatory changes observed in the early symptomatic phase of FTLD are associated with distinct clinical profiles and a more rapid disease progression, and that the C9orf72 repeat expansion and gender may also affect the inflammatory profile in FTLD.

        "Appalachian Status Is a Negative Predictor of Breast Reconstruction Following Breast Cancer Resection. BACKGROUND: Health care disparities in Appalachia are well documented. However, no previous studies have examined possible differences in the utilization of breast reconstruction (BR) in Appalachia. This study aims to determine if a disparity in BR utilization exists in women from Appalachia Kentucky. METHODS: A retrospective, population-based cohort study was conducted from January 1, 2006, to December 31, 2015. The Kentucky Cancer Registry was queried to identify population-level data for female patients diagnosed with breast cancer and treated with mastectomy. A multivariate logistic regression model controlling for patient, disease, and treatment characteristics was constructed to predict the likelihood of BR. RESULTS: Bivariate testing showed differences (P < 0.0001) in BR utilization between Appalachian and non-Appalachian women in Kentucky (15.0% and 26.3%, respectively). Multivariate analysis showed that women from Appalachia (odds ratio, 0.54; confidence interval (95), 0.48-0.61; P < 0.0001) were less likely to undergo BR than non-Appalachian women. Interestingly, the rate of BR increased over time in both Appalachian (r = 0.115; P < 0.0001) and non-Appalachian women (r = 0.148; P < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Despite the benefits of BR, women from Appalachia undergo BR at lower rates and are less likely to receive BR than non-Appalachian Kentuckians. Although the rates of BR increased over time in both populations, access to comprehensive breast cancer care remains a challenge for women from Kentucky's Appalachian region. ",
        "Antiepileptic Drugs and Suicide: Role of Prior Suicidal Behavior and Parental Psychiatric Disorder. OBJECTIVE: To examine whether prior suicidal behavior and familial predisposition to psychiatric disorders modify the association between antiepileptic drug use and completed suicide. METHODS: Using the Danish National Prescription Register, we identified all incident users of antiepileptic drugs aged 15\u2009years or older in Denmark between July 1997 and December 2015. We carried out a nested case-control study and defined exposure to antiepileptic drugs at the index date (ie, time of suicide). Conditional logistic regressions were used to estimate mortality rate ratios (MRRs) of suicide in current versus previous users of antiepileptic drugs. We also analyzed suicide risk associated with the 9 most commonly used antiepileptic drugs. RESULTS: We identified 1,759 individuals completing suicide. Current versus previous use of any antiepileptic drug was associated with an increased risk of suicide (MRR = 1.26, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.13-1.40). This excess risk was observed in individuals with a history of suicidal behavior (MRR = 1.28, 95% CI = 1.07-1.54) and in those without (MRR = 1.26, 95% CI = 1.11-1.43), and in individuals with a familial predisposition to psychiatric disorders (MRR = 1.48, 95% CI = 1.18-1.87) and in those without (MRR = 1.21, 95% CI = 1.07-1.35). INTERPRETATION: Use of antiepileptic drugs was associated with an increased risk of suicide. The findings do not support that the risk of suicide following treatment with antiepileptic drugs identified in randomized trials is explained by prior suicidality or familial predisposition to psychiatric disorders. The additional risk of suicide associated with use of antiepileptic drugs was generally low and should be balanced against benefits of treatment. ANN NEUROL 2019;86:951-961. ",
        "Stroke among cancer patients. We identify cancer patients at highest risk of fatal stroke. This is a population-based study using nationally representative data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program, 1992-2015. Among 7,529,481 cancer patients, 80,513 died of fatal stroke (with 262,461 person-years at risk); the rate of fatal stroke was 21.64 per 100,000-person years, and the standardized mortality ratio (SMR) of fatal stroke was 2.17 (95% CI, 2.15, 2.19). Patients with cancer of the prostate, breast, and colorectum contribute to the plurality of cancer patients dying of fatal stroke. Brain and gastrointestinal cancer patients had the highest SMRs (>2-5) through the follow up period. Among those diagnosed at\u2009<40 years of age, the plurality of strokes occurs in patients treated for brain tumors and lymphomas; if\u2009>40, from cancers of the prostate, breast, and colorectum. For almost all cancers survivors, the risk of stroke increases with time. ",
        "Transcriptional dysregulation by a nucleus-localized aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase associated with Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy. Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) is a length-dependent peripheral neuropathy. The aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases constitute the largest protein family implicated in CMT. Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases are predominantly cytoplasmic, but are also present in the nucleus. Here we show that a nuclear function of tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase (TyrRS) is implicated in a Drosophila model of CMT. CMT-causing mutations in TyrRS induce unique conformational changes, which confer capacity for aberrant interactions with transcriptional regulators in the nucleus, leading to transcription factor E2F1 hyperactivation. Using neuronal tissues, we reveal a broad transcriptional regulation network associated with wild-type TyrRS expression, which is disturbed when a CMT-mutant is expressed. Pharmacological inhibition of TyrRS nuclear entry with embelin reduces, whereas genetic nuclear exclusion of mutant TyrRS prevents hallmark phenotypes of CMT in the Drosophila model. These data highlight that this translation factor may contribute to transcriptional regulation in neurons, and suggest a therapeutic strategy for CMT. ",
        "Circular ecDNA promotes accessible chromatin and high oncogene expression. Oncogenes are commonly amplified on particles of extrachromosomal DNA (ecDNA) in cancer1,2, but our understanding of the structure of ecDNA and its effect on gene regulation is limited. Here, by integrating ultrastructural imaging, long-range optical mapping and computational analysis of whole-genome sequencing, we demonstrate the structure of circular ecDNA. Pan-cancer analyses reveal that oncogenes encoded on ecDNA are among the most highly expressed genes in the transcriptome of the tumours, linking increased copy number with high transcription levels. Quantitative assessment of the chromatin state reveals that although ecDNA is packaged into chromatin with intact domain structure, it lacks higher-order compaction that is typical of chromosomes and displays significantly enhanced chromatin accessibility. Furthermore, ecDNA is shown to have a significantly greater number of ultra-long-range interactions with active chromatin, which provides insight into how the structure of circular ecDNA affects oncogene function, and connects ecDNA biology with modern cancer genomics and epigenetics.

        "Vaccination with Glycan-Modified HIV NFL Envelope Trimer-Liposomes Elicits Broadly Neutralizing Antibodies to Multiple Sites of Vulnerability. The elicitation of broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) against the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein (Env) trimer remains a major vaccine challenge. Most cross-conserved protein determinants are occluded by self-N-glycan shielding, limiting B cell recognition of the underlying polypeptide surface. The exceptions to the contiguous glycan shield include the conserved receptor CD4 binding site (CD4bs) and glycoprotein (gp)41 elements proximal to the furin cleavage site. Accordingly, we performed heterologous trimer-liposome prime:boosting in rabbits to drive B cells specific for cross-conserved sites. To preferentially expose the CD4bs to B cells, we eliminated proximal N-glycans while maintaining the native-like state of the cleavage-independent NFL trimers, followed by gradual N-glycan restoration coupled with heterologous boosting. This approach successfully elicited CD4bs-directed, cross-neutralizing Abs, including one targeting a unique glycan-protein epitope and a bNAb (87% breadth) directed to the gp120:gp41 interface, both resolved by high-resolution cryoelectron microscopy. This study provides proof-of-principle immunogenicity toward eliciting bNAbs by vaccination. ",
        "A Time Motion Study Evaluating the Impact of Geographic Cohorting of Hospitalists. BACKGROUND: Geographic cohorting (GCh) localizes hospitalists to a unit. Our objective was to compare the GCh and non-GCh workday. METHODS: In an academic, Midwestern hospital we observed hospitalists in GCh and non-GCh teams. Time in patient rooms was considered direct care; other locations were considered 'indirect' care. Geotracking identified time spent in each location and was obtained for 17 hospitalists. It was supplemented by in-person observation of four GCh and four non-GCh hospitalists for a workday each. Multilevel modeling was used to analyze associations between direct and indirect care time and team and workday characteristics. RESULTS: Geotracking yielded 10,522 direct care episodes. GCh was associated with longer durations of patient visits while increasing patient loads were associated with shorter visits. GCh, increasing patient loads, and increasing numbers of units visited were associated with increased indirect care time. In-person observations yielded 3,032 minutes of data. GCh hospitalists were observed spending 56% of the day in computer interactions vs non-GCh hospitalists (39%; P < .005). The percentage of time spent multitasking was 18% for GCh and 14% for non-GCh hospitalists (P > .05). Interruptions were pervasive, but the highest interruption rate of once every eight minutes in the afternoon was noted in the GCh group. CONCLUSION: GCh may have the potential to increase patient-hospitalist interactions but these gains may be attenuated if patient loads and the structure of cohorting are suboptimal. The hospitalist workday is cognitively intense. The interruptions noted may increase the time taken for time-intensive tasks like electronic medical record interactions. ",
        "Effect of Frailty on Outcome after Traumatic Spinal Cord Injury. Frailty negatively affects outcome in elective spine surgery populations. This study sought to determine the effect of frailty on patient outcome after traumatic spinal cord injury (tSCI). Patients with tSCI were identified from our prospectively collected database from 2004 to 2016. We examined effect of patient age, admission Total Motor Score (TMS), and Modified Frailty Index (mFI) on adverse events (AEs), acute length of stay (LOS), in-hospital mortality, and discharge destination (home vs. other). Subgroup analysis (for three age groups: <60, 61-75, and 76+ years), and multi-variable analysis was performed to investigate the impact of age, TMS, and mFI on outcome. For the 634 patients, the mean age was 50.3 years, 77% were male, and falls were the main cause of injury (46.5%). On bivariate analysis, mFI, age at injury, and TMS were predictors of AEs, acute LOS, and in-hospital mortality. After statistical adjustment, mFI was a predictor of LOS (p\u2009=\u20090.0375), but not of AEs (p\u2009=\u20090.1428) or in-hospital mortality (p\u2009=\u20090.1245). In patients <60 years of age, mFI predicted number of AEs, acute LOS, and in-hospital mortality. In those aged 61-75, TMS predicted AEs, LOS, and mortality. In those 76+ years of age, mFI no longer predicted outcome. Age, mFI, and TMS on admission are important determinants of outcome in patients with tSCI. mFI predicts outcomes in those <75 years of age only. The inter-relationship of advanced age and decreased physiological reserve is complex in acute tSCI, warranting further study. Identifying frailty in younger patients with tSCI may be useful for peri-operative optimization, risk stratification, and patient counseling. ",
        "Lung CD4+ resident memory T cells remodel epithelial responses to accelerate neutrophil recruitment during pneumonia. Previous pneumococcal experience establishes lung-resident IL-17A-producing CD4+ memory TRM cells that accelerate neutrophil recruitment against heterotypic pneumococci. Herein, we unravel a novel crosstalk between CD4+ TRM cells and lung epithelial cells underlying this protective immunity. Depletion of CD4+ cells in pneumococcus-experienced mice diminished CXCL5 (but not CXCL1 or CXCL2) and downstream neutrophil accumulation in the lungs. Epithelial cells from experienced lungs exhibited elevated mRNA for CXCL5 but not other epithelial products such as GM-CSF or CCL20, suggesting a skewing by CD4+ TRM cells. Genome-wide expression analyses revealed a significant remodeling of the epithelial transcriptome of infected lungs due to infection history, ~80% of which was CD4+ cell-dependent. The CD4+ TRM cell product IL-17A stabilized CXCL5 but not GM-CSF or CCL20 mRNA in cultured lung epithelial cells, implicating posttranscriptional regulation as a mechanism for altered epithelial responses. These results suggest that epithelial cells in experienced lungs are effectively different, owing to their communication with TRM cells. Our study highlights the role of tissue-resident adaptive immune cells in fine-tuning epithelial functions to hasten innate immune responses and optimize defense in experienced lungs, a concept that may apply broadly to mucosal immunology.

        "Induction of labour at 41 weeks versus expectant management and induction of labour at 42 weeks (SWEdish Post-term Induction Study, SWEPIS): multicentre, open label, randomised, superiority trial. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate if induction of labour at 41 weeks improves perinatal and maternal outcomes in women with a low risk pregnancy compared with expectant management and induction of labour at 42 weeks. DESIGN: Multicentre, open label, randomised controlled superiority trial. SETTING: 14 hospitals in Sweden, 2016-18. PARTICIPANTS: 2760 women with a low risk uncomplicated singleton pregnancy randomised (1:1) by the Swedish Pregnancy Register. 1381 women were assigned to the induction group and 1379 were assigned to the expectant management group. INTERVENTIONS: Induction of labour at 41 weeks and expectant management and induction of labour at 42 weeks. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was a composite perinatal outcome including one or more of stillbirth, neonatal mortality, Apgar score less than 7 at five minutes, pH less than 7.00 or metabolic acidosis (pH <7.05 and base deficit >12 mmol/L) in the umbilical artery, hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy, intracranial haemorrhage, convulsions, meconium aspiration syndrome, mechanical ventilation within 72 hours, or obstetric brachial plexus injury. Primary analysis was by intention to treat. RESULTS: The study was stopped early owing to a significantly higher rate of perinatal mortality in the expectant management group. The composite primary perinatal outcome did not differ between the groups: 2.4% (33/1381) in the induction group and 2.2% (31/1379) in the expectant management group (relative risk 1.06, 95% confidence interval 0.65 to 1.73; P=0.90). No perinatal deaths occurred in the induction group but six (five stillbirths and one early neonatal death) occurred in the expectant management group (P=0.03). The proportion of caesarean delivery, instrumental vaginal delivery, or any major maternal morbidity did not differ between the groups. CONCLUSIONS: This study comparing induction of labour at 41 weeks with expectant management and induction at 42 weeks does not show any significant difference in the primary composite adverse perinatal outcome. However, a reduction of the secondary outcome perinatal mortality is observed without increasing adverse maternal outcomes. Although these results should be interpreted cautiously, induction of labour ought to be offered to women no later than at 41 weeks and could be one (of few) interventions that reduces the rate of stillbirths.

        "Conservative Interventions Reduce Fear in Individuals With Chronic Low Back Pain: A Systematic Review. OBJECTIVE: To systematically review and critically appraise the effectiveness of conservative and surgical interventions to reduce fear in studies of people with chronic low back pain, based on the analysis of randomized controlled trials for which fear was a primary or secondary outcome. DATA SOURCES: Electronic databases PubMed, CINAHL, PsycINFO, PEDro, and CENTRAL, as well as manual searches and grey literature were searched from inception until May\u00a02019. STUDY SELECTION: Randomized controlled trials analyzing the effectiveness of conservative and surgical interventions to reduce fear were included. DATA EXTRACTION: Two reviewers independently conducted the search strategy, study selection, data extraction, risk of bias assessment, and quality of the evidence judgment. DATA SYNTHESIS: Sixty-one studies (n=7201) were included. A large number of fear-related search terms were used but only 3 fear constructs (kinesiophobia, fear-avoidance beliefs, fear of falling) were measured in the included studies. Multidisciplinary and psychological interventions as well as exercise reduced kinesiophobia. Fear-avoidance beliefs were reduced by the aforementioned interventions, manual therapy, and electrotherapy. A multidisciplinary intervention reduced the fear of falling. There was moderate evidence of multidisciplinary interventions and exercise to reduce kinesiophobia. There was moderate evidence of manual therapy and electrotherapy to reduce fear-avoidance beliefs. CONCLUSIONS: The present systematic review highlights the potential effectiveness of conservative interventions to reduce kinesiophobia and fear-avoidance beliefs in individuals with chronic low back pain. This information can help health professionals to reduce fear when treating patients with this condition. ",
        "Sensorimotor experience remaps visual input to a heading-direction network. In the Drosophila brain, 'compass' neurons track the orientation of the body and head (the fly's heading)\u00a0during navigation\u00a01,2. In the absence of visual cues, the compass neuron network estimates heading by integrating self-movement signals over time3,4. When a visual cue is present, the estimate of the network is more accurate1,3. Visual inputs to compass neurons are thought to originate from inhibitory neurons called R neurons (also known as ring neurons); the receptive fields of R neurons tile visual space5. The axon of each R neuron overlaps with the dendrites of every compass neuron6, raising the question of how visual cues are integrated into the compass. Here, using in vivo whole-cell recordings, we show that a visual cue can evoke synaptic inhibition in compass neurons and that R neurons mediate this inhibition. Each compass neuron is inhibited only by specific visual cue positions, indicating that many potential connections from R neurons onto compass neurons are actually weak or silent. We also show that the pattern of visually evoked inhibition can reorganize over minutes as the fly explores an altered virtual-reality environment. Using ensemble calcium imaging, we demonstrate that this reorganization causes persistent changes in the compass coordinate frame. Taken together, our data suggest a model in which correlated pre- and postsynaptic activity triggers associative long-term synaptic depression of visually evoked inhibition in compass neurons. Our findings provide evidence for the theoretical proposal that associative plasticity of sensory inputs, when combined with attractor dynamics, can reconcile self-movement information with changing external cues to generate a coherent sense of direction7-12.

        "teen Mental Health First Aid as a school-based intervention for improving peer support of adolescents at risk of suicide: Outcomes from a cluster randomised crossover trial. OBJECTIVES: The aims of this study were to assess evidence for a novel, universal mental health literacy programme in the school setting (teen Mental Health First Aid) as an intervention to improve peer support towards adolescents at risk of suicide and to examine whether participation in a school-based programme dealing with suicide was distressing to participants. METHOD: In a cluster randomised crossover trial, Australian high school students aged 15-17\u2009years (N\u2009=\u20091605, 44.74% female, Mage\u2009=\u200915.87) received either teen Mental Health First Aid or a matched control physical first aid course. Data were collected before, immediately after and 12\u2009months after training through online surveys assessing correct recognition of suicidality and intentions to help a fictional peer (John) who was depicted as experiencing depressive symptoms and suicidal thoughts in a vignette. Students were also asked whether any information in the training or surveys was found distressing and completed a validated measure of psychological distress (the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale). RESULTS: Students receiving teen Mental Health First Aid training were much more likely to report an increase from pre- to post-training in recognition of suicidality (OR = 1.97, 95% CI = [1.14, 3.39], p\u2009=\u20090.02) and appropriate first aid intentions towards a peer at risk of suicide than students receiving physical first aid (OR = 35.40, 95% CI = [19.86, 63.14], p\u2009<\u20090.001). Twelve months after training, most effects were still significant. Although a greater proportion of teen Mental Health First Aid participants self-reported feeling briefly distressed after the training, there was no evidence of greater distress at 12\u2009months on the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale. CONCLUSION: teen Mental Health First Aid is effective in increasing recognition of and intentions to assist a suicidal peer. Although the open discussion of mental health first aid for a suicidal peer was distressing for some students, results suggest this was transient and not associated with harm. Future studies are required to ascertain whether these increases are indeed associated with better provision of support and prevention of youth suicide. ",
        "PGRMC2 is an intracellular haem chaperone critical for adipocyte function. Haem is an essential prosthetic group of numerous proteins and a central signalling molecule in many physiologic processes1,2. The chemical reactivity of haem means that a network of intracellular chaperone proteins is required to avert the cytotoxic effects of free haem, but the constituents of such trafficking pathways are unknown3,4. Haem synthesis is completed in mitochondria, with ferrochelatase adding iron to protoporphyrin IX. How this vital but highly reactive metabolite is delivered from mitochondria to haemoproteins throughout the cell remains poorly defined3,4. Here we show that progesterone receptor membrane component 2 (PGRMC2) is required for delivery of labile, or signalling haem, to the nucleus. Deletion of PGMRC2 in brown fat, which has a high demand for haem, reduced labile haem in the nucleus and increased stability of the haem-responsive transcriptional repressors Rev-Erb\u03b1 and BACH1. Ensuing alterations in gene expression caused severe mitochondrial defects that rendered adipose-specific PGRMC2-null mice unable to activate adaptive thermogenesis and prone to greater metabolic deterioration when fed a high-fat diet. By contrast, obese-diabetic mice treated with a small-molecule PGRMC2 activator showed substantial improvement of diabetic features. These studies uncover a role for PGRMC2 in intracellular haem transport, reveal the influence of adipose tissue haem dynamics on physiology and suggest that modulation of PGRMC2 may revert obesity-linked defects in adipocytes.

        "Missense variants in TAF1 and developmental phenotypes: challenges of determining pathogenicity. We recently described a new neurodevelopmental syndrome (TAF1/MRXS33 intellectual disability syndrome) (MIM# 300966) caused by pathogenic variants involving the X-linked gene TAF1, which participates in RNA polymerase II transcription. The initial study reported eleven families, and the syndrome was defined as presenting early in life with hypotonia, facial dysmorphia, and developmental delay that evolved into intellectual disability (ID) and/or autism spectrum disorder (ASD). We have now identified an additional 27 families through a genotype-first approach. Familial segregation analysis, clinical phenotyping, and bioinformatics were capitalized on to assess potential variant pathogenicity, and molecular modelling was performed for those variants falling within structurally characterized domains of TAF1. A novel phenotypic clustering approach was also applied, in which the phenotypes of affected individuals were classified using 51 standardized Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) terms. Phenotypes associated with TAF1 variants show considerable pleiotropy and clinical variability, but prominent among previously unreported effects were brain morphological abnormalities, seizures, hearing loss, and heart malformations. Our allelic series broadens the phenotypic spectrum of TAF1/MRXS33 intellectual disability syndrome and the range of TAF1 molecular defects in humans. It also illustrates the challenges for determining the pathogenicity of inherited missense variants, particularly for genes mapping to chromosome X. This article is protected by copyright.

        "Site-specific phosphorylation and caspase cleavage of GFAP are new markers of Alexander disease severity. Alexander disease (AxD) is a fatal neurodegenerative disorder caused by mutations in glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), which supports the structural integrity of astrocytes. Over 70 GFAP missense mutations cause AxD, but the mechanism linking different mutations to disease-relevant phenotypes remains unknown. We used AxD patient brain tissue and induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived astrocytes to investigate the hypothesis that AxD-causing mutations perturb key post-translational modifications (PTMs) on GFAP. Our findings reveal selective phosphorylation of GFAP-Ser13 in patients who died young, independently of the mutation they carried. AxD iPSC-astrocytes accumulated pSer13-GFAP in cytoplasmic aggregates within deep nuclear invaginations, resembling the hallmark Rosenthal fibers observed in vivo. Ser13 phosphorylation facilitated GFAP aggregation and was associated with increased GFAP proteolysis by caspase-6. Furthermore, caspase-6 was selectively expressed in young AxD patients, and correlated with the presence of cleaved GFAP. We reveal a novel PTM signature linking different GFAP mutations in infantile AxD. ",
        "T6SS and ExoA of flesh-eating Aeromonas hydrophila in peritonitis and necrotizing fasciitis during mono- and polymicrobial infections. An earlier report described a human case of necrotizing fasciitis (NF) caused by mixed infection with 4 Aeromonas hydrophila strains (NF1-NF4). While the NF2, NF3, and NF4 strains were clonal and possessed exotoxin A (ExoA), the NF1 strain was determined to be phylogenetically distinct, harboring a unique type 6 secretion system (T6SS) effector (TseC). During NF1 and NF2 mixed infection, only NF1 disseminated, while NF2 was rapidly killed by a contact-dependent mechanism and macrophage phagocytosis, as was demonstrated by using in vitro models. To confirm these findings, we developed 2 NF1 mutants (NF1\u0394tseC and NF1\u0394vasK); vasK encodes an essential T6SS structural component. NF1 VasK and TseC were proven to be involved in contact-dependent killing of NF2 in vitro, as well as in its elimination at the intramuscular injection site in vivo during mixed infection, with overall reduced mouse mortality. ExoA was shown to have an important role in NF by both NF1-exoA (with cis exoA) and NF2 during monomicrobial infection. However, the contribution of ExoA was more important for NF2 than NF1 in the murine peritonitis model. The NF2\u2206exoA mutant did not significantly alter animal mortality or NF1 dissemination during mixed infection in the NF model, suggesting that the ExoA activity was significant at the injection site. Immunization of mice to ExoA protected animals from NF2 monomicrobial challenge, but not from polymicrobial infection because of NF2 clearance. This study clarified the roles of T6SS and ExoA in pathogenesis caused by A. hydrophila NF strains in both mouse peritonitis and NF models in monomicrobial and polymicrobial infections. ",
        "Effects of hyperoxia on alveolar and pulmonary vascular development in germ-free mice. Airway microbial dysbiosis is associated with subsequent bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) development in very preterm infants. However, the relationship of airway microbiome in normal pulmonary development has not been defined. To better understand the role of the airway microbiome, we compared normal and abnormal alveolar and pulmonary vascular development in mice with or without a microbiome. We hypothesized that the lungs of germ-free (GF) mice would have an exaggerated phenotypic response to hyperoxia compared with non-germ-free (NGF) mice. With the use of a novel gnotobiotic hyperoxia chamber, GF and NGF mice were exposed to either normoxia or hyperoxia. Alveolar morphometry, pulmonary mechanics, echocardiograms, inflammatory markers, and measures of pulmonary hypertension were studied. GF and NGF mice in normoxia showed no difference, whereas GF mice in hyperoxia showed protected lung structure and mechanics and decreased markers of inflammation compared with NGF mice. We speculate that an increase in abundance of pathogenic bacteria in NGF mice may play a role in BPD pathogenesis by regulating the proinflammatory signaling and neutrophilic inflammation in lungs. Manipulation of the airway microbiome may be a potential therapeutic intervention in BPD and other lung diseases. ",
        "Pharmacological Activation of Pyruvate Kinase M2 Inhibits CD4+ T Cell Pathogenicity and Suppresses Autoimmunity. Pyruvate kinase (PK) catalyzes the conversion of phosphoenolpyruvate to pyruvate during glycolysis. The PK isoform PKM2 has additional roles in regulation of gene transcription and protein phosphorylation. PKM2 has been shown to control macrophage metabolic remodeling in inflammation, but its role in T\u00a0cell biology is poorly understood. Here, we report PKM2 upregulation, phosphorylation, and nuclear accumulation in murine and human CD4+ T\u00a0cells following activation in\u00a0vitro. Treatment of T\u00a0cells with TEPP-46, an allosteric activator that induces PKM2 tetramerization and blocks its nuclear translocation, strongly reduces their activation, proliferation, and cytokine production by inhibiting essential signaling pathways and thus preventing the engagement of glycolysis. TEPP-46 limits the development of both T helper 17 (Th17) and Th1 cells in\u00a0vitro and ameliorates experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in\u00a0vivo. Overall, our results suggest that pharmacological targeting of PKM2 may represent a valuable therapeutic approach in T\u00a0cell-mediated inflammation and autoimmunity. ",
        "Race disparity in blood sphingolipidomics associated with lupus cardiovascular comorbidity. Systemic lupus erythematous (SLE) is a chronic multi-organ autoimmune disease. Genetic and environmental factors contribute to disease onset and severity. Sphingolipids are signaling molecules involved in regulating cell functions and have been associated with multiple genetic disease processes. African-Americans are more likely to suffer from SLE morbidity than Whites. The Medical University of South Carolina has banked plasma samples from a well-characterized lupus cohort that includes African-Americans and Whites. This study examined the influence of race on plasma sphingolipid profiles in SLE patients and association of sphingolipid levels with comorbid atherosclerosis and SLE disease activity. Mass spectrometry revealed that healthy African-Americans had higher sphingomyelin levels and lower lactosylcermide levels compared to healthy Whites. SLE patients, irrespective of race, had higher levels of ceramides, and sphingoid bases (sphingosine and dihydrosphingosine) and their phosphates compared to healthy subjects. Compared to African-American controls, African-American SLE patients had higher levels of ceramides, hexosylceramides, sphingosine and dihydrosphingosine 1-phosphate. Compared to White controls, White SLE patients exhibited higher levels of sphingoid bases and their phosphates, but lower ratios of C16:0 ceramide/sphingosine 1-phosphate and C24:1 ceramide/sphingosine 1-phosphate. White SLE patients with atherosclerosis exhibited lower levels of sphingoid bases compared to White SLE patients without atherosclerosis. In contrast, African-American SLE patients with atherosclerosis had higher levels of sphingoid bases and sphingomyelins compared to African-American SLE patients without atherosclerosis. Compared to White SLE patients with atherosclerosis, African-American SLE patients with atherosclerosis had higher levels of select sphingolipids. Plasma levels of sphingosine, C16:0 ceramide/sphingosine 1-phosphate ratio and C24:1 ceramide/sphingosine 1-phosphate ratio significantly correlated with SLEDAI in the African-American but not White SLE patients. The C16:0 ceramide/sphingosine 1-phosphate ratio in SLE patients, and levels of C18:1 and C26:1 lactosylcermides, C20:0 hexosylceramide, and sphingoid bases in SLE patients with atherosclerosis could be dependent on race. Further ethnic studies in SLE cohorts are necessary to verify use of sphingolipidomics as complementary diagnostic tool. ",
        "Statin Use Is Associated with Lower Risk of PTEN-Null and Lethal Prostate Cancer. PURPOSE: Statins are associated with lower risk of aggressive prostate cancer, but lethal prostate cancer is understudied and contributing mechanisms are unclear. We prospectively examined statins and lethal prostate cancer risk in the Health Professionals Follow-up Study (HPFS), tested associations with molecular subtypes, and integrated gene expression profiling to identify putative mechanisms. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Our study included 44,126 men cancer-free in 1990, followed for prostate cancer incidence through 2014, with statin use recorded on biennial questionnaires. We used multivariable Cox regression to examine associations between statins and prostate cancer risk overall, by measures of clinically significant disease, and by ERG and PTEN status. In an exploratory analysis, age-adjusted gene set enrichment analysis identified statin-associated pathways enriched in tumor and adjacent normal prostate tissue. RESULTS: During 24 years of follow-up, 6,305 prostate cancers were diagnosed and 801 (13%) were lethal (metastatic at diagnosis or metastatic/fatal during follow-up). Relative to never/past use, current statin use was inversely associated with risk of lethal prostate cancer [HR, 0.76; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.60-0.96] but not overall disease. We found a strong inverse association for risk of PTEN-null cancers (HR, 0.40; 95% CI, 0.19-0.87) but not PTEN-intact cancers (HR, 1.18; 95% CI, 0.95-1.48; P heterogeneity = 0.01). Associations did not differ by ERG. Inflammation and immune pathways were enriched in normal prostate tissue of statin ever (n = 10) versus never users (n = 103). CONCLUSIONS: Molecular tumor classification identified PTEN and inflammation/immune activation as potential mechanisms linking statins with lower lethal prostate cancer risk. These findings support a potential causal association and could inform selection of relevant biomarkers for statin clinical trials. ",
        "Global impact of somatic structural variation on the DNA methylome of human cancers. BACKGROUND: Genomic rearrangements exert a heavy influence on the molecular landscape of cancer. New analytical approaches integrating somatic structural variants (SSVs) with altered gene features represent a framework by which we can assign global significance to a core set of genes, analogous to established methods that identify genes non-randomly targeted by somatic mutation or copy number alteration. While recent studies have defined broad patterns of association involving gene transcription and nearby SSV breakpoints, global alterations in DNA methylation in the context of SSVs remain largely unexplored. RESULTS: By data integration of whole genome sequencing, RNA sequencing, and DNA methylation arrays from more than 1400 human cancers, we identify hundreds of genes and associated CpG islands (CGIs) for which the nearby presence of a somatic structural variant (SSV) breakpoint is recurrently associated with altered expression or DNA methylation, respectively, independently of copy number alterations. CGIs with SSV-associated increased methylation are predominantly promoter-associated, while CGIs with SSV-associated decreased methylation are enriched for gene body CGIs. Rearrangement of genomic regions normally having higher or lower methylation is often involved in SSV-associated CGI methylation alterations. Across cancers, the overall structural variation burden is associated with a global decrease in methylation, increased expression in methyltransferase genes and DNA damage response genes, and decreased immune cell infiltration. CONCLUSION: Genomic rearrangement appears to have a major role in shaping the cancer DNA methylome, to be considered alongside commonly accepted mechanisms including histone modifications and disruption of DNA methyltransferases.

        "Athletic Trainer Services in the Secondary School Setting: The Athletic Training Locations and Services Project. CONTEXT: Previous research from a sample of US secondary schools (n = 10\u200a553) indicated that 67% of schools had access to an athletic trainer (AT; 35% full time [FT], 30% part time [PT], and 2% per diem). However, the population-based statistic in all secondary schools with athletic programs (n = approximately 20\u200a000) is yet to be determined. OBJECTIVE: To determine the level of AT services and employment status in US secondary schools with athletics by National Athletic Trainers' Association district. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: Public and private secondary schools with athletics. PATIENTS OR OTHER PARTICIPANTS: Data from all 20\u200a272 US public and private secondary schools were obtained. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Data were collected from September 2015 to April 2018 by phone or e-mail communication with school administrators or ATs and by online surveys of secondary school ATs. Employment categories were school district, school district with teaching, medical or university facility, and independent contractor. Data are presented as total number and percentage of ATs. Descriptive statistics were calculated for FT, PT, and no AT services data for public, private, public + private, and employment type by state and by National Athletic Trainers' Association district. RESULTS: Of the 20\u200a272 secondary schools, 66% (n = 13\u200a473) had access to AT services, while 34% (n = 6799) had no access. Of those schools with AT services, 53% (n = 7119) received FT services, while 47% (n = 6354) received PT services. Public schools (n = 16\u200a076) received 37%, 32%, and 31%, whereas private schools (n = 4196) received 27%, 28%, and 45%, for FT, PT, and no AT services, respectively. Most of the Athletic Training Locations and Services Survey participants (n = 6754, 57%) were employed by a medical or university facility, followed by a school district, school district with teaching, and independent contractor. Combined, 38% of AT employment was via the school district. CONCLUSIONS: The percentages of US schools with AT access and FT and PT services were similar to those noted in previous research. One-third of secondary schools had no access to AT services. The majority of AT employment was via medical or university facilities. These data depict the largest and most updated representation of AT services in secondary schools. ",
        "Purity Independent Subtyping of Tumors (PurIST), A Clinically Robust, Single-sample Classifier for Tumor Subtyping in Pancreatic Cancer. PURPOSE: Molecular subtyping for pancreatic cancer has made substantial progress in recent years, facilitating the optimization of existing therapeutic approaches to improve clinical outcomes in pancreatic cancer. With advances in treatment combinations and choices, it is becoming increasingly important to determine ways to place patients on the best therapies upfront. Although various molecular subtyping systems for pancreatic cancer have been proposed, consensus regarding proposed subtypes, as well as their relative clinical utility, remains largely unknown and presents a natural barrier to wider clinical adoption. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We assess three major subtype classification schemas in the context of results from two clinical trials and by meta-analysis of publicly available expression data to assess statistical criteria of subtype robustness and overall clinical relevance. We then developed a single-sample classifier (SSC) using penalized logistic regression based on the most robust and replicable schema. RESULTS: We demonstrate that a tumor-intrinsic two-subtype schema is most robust, replicable, and clinically relevant. We developed Purity Independent Subtyping of Tumors (PurIST), a SSC with robust and highly replicable performance on a wide range of platforms and sample types. We show that PurIST subtypes have meaningful associations with patient prognosis and have significant implications for treatment response to FOLIFIRNOX. CONCLUSIONS: The flexibility and utility of PurIST on low-input samples such as tumor biopsies allows it to be used at the time of diagnosis to facilitate the choice of effective therapies for patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and should be considered in the context of future clinical trials.

        "Assessment of Ultra-Short Heart Variability Indices Derived by Smartphone Accelerometers for Stress Detection. Body acceleration due to heartbeat-induced reaction forces can be measured as mobile phone accelerometer (m-ACC) signals. Our aim was to test the feasibility of using m-ACC to detect changes induced by stress by ultra-short heart rate variability (USV) indices (standard deviation of normal-to-normal interval-SDNN and root mean square of successive differences-RMSSD). Sixteen healthy volunteers were recruited; m-ACC was recorded while in supine position, during spontaneous breathing at rest conditions (REST) and during one minute of mental stress (MS) induced by arithmetic serial subtraction task, simultaneous with conventional electrocardiogram (ECG). Beat occurrences were extracted from both ECG and m-ACC and used to compute USV indices using 60, 30 and 10s durations, both for REST and MS. A feasibility of 93.8% in the beat-to-beat m-ACC heart rate series extraction was reached. In both ECG and m-ACC series, compared to REST, in MS the mean beat duration was reduced by 15% and RMSSD decreased by 38%. These results show that short term recordings (up to 10 s) of cardiac activity using smartphone's accelerometers are able to capture the decrease in parasympathetic tone, in agreement with the induced stimulus.

        "Alzheimer Disease Pathology-Associated Polymorphism in a Complex Variable Number of Tandem Repeat Region Within the MUC6 Gene, Near the AP2A2 Gene. We found evidence of late-onset Alzheimer disease (LOAD)-associated genetic polymorphism within an exon of Mucin 6 (MUC6) and immediately downstream from another gene: Adaptor Related Protein Complex 2 Subunit Alpha 2 (AP2A2). PCR analyses on genomic DNA samples confirmed that the size of the MUC6 variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) region was highly polymorphic. In a cohort of autopsied subjects with quantitative digital pathology data (n\u2009=\u2009119), the size of the polymorphic region was associated with the severity of pTau pathology in neocortex. In a separate replication cohort of autopsied subjects (n\u2009=\u2009173), more pTau pathology was again observed in subjects with longer VNTR regions (p\u2009=\u20090.031). Unlike MUC6, AP2A2 is highly expressed in human brain. AP2A2 expression was lower in a subset analysis of brain samples from persons with longer versus shorter VNTR regions (p\u2009=\u20090.014 normalizing with AP2B1 expression). Double-label immunofluorescence studies showed that AP2A2 protein often colocalized with neurofibrillary tangles in LOAD but was not colocalized with pTau proteinopathy in progressive supranuclear palsy, or with TDP-43 proteinopathy. In summary, polymorphism in a repeat-rich region near AP2A2 was associated with neocortical pTau proteinopathy (because of the unique repeats, prior genome-wide association studies were probably unable to detect this association), and AP2A2 was often colocalized with neurofibrillary tangles in LOAD.

How neural circuits develop in the human brain has remained almost impossible to study at the neuronal level. Here, we investigate human cortical neuron development, plasticity, and function using a mouse/human chimera model in which xenotransplanted human cortical pyramidal neurons integrate as single cells into the mouse cortex. Combined neuronal tracing, electrophysiology, and in\u00a0vivo structural and functional imaging of the transplanted cells reveal a coordinated developmental roadmap recapitulating key milestones of human cortical neuron development. The human neurons display a prolonged developmental timeline, indicating the neuron-intrinsic retention of juvenile properties as an important component of human brain neoteny. Following maturation, human neurons in the visual cortex display tuned, decorrelated responses to visual stimuli, like mouse neurons, demonstrating their capacity for physiological synaptic integration in host cortical circuits. These findings provide new insights into human neuronal development and open novel avenues for the study of human neuronal function and disease. VIDEO ABSTRACT. ",
        "Macrophage-associated wound healing contributes to African green monkey SIV pathogenesis control. Natural hosts of simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) avoid AIDS despite lifelong infection. Here, we examined how this outcome is achieved by comparing a natural SIV host, African green monkey (AGM) to an AIDS susceptible species, rhesus macaque (RM). To asses gene expression profiles from acutely SIV infected AGMs and RMs, we developed a systems biology approach termed Conserved Gene Signature Analysis (CGSA), which compared RNA sequencing data from rectal AGM and RM tissues to various other species. We found that AGMs rapidly activate, and then maintain, evolutionarily\u00a0conserved regenerative wound healing mechanisms in mucosal tissue. The wound healing protein fibronectin shows distinct tissue distribution and abundance kinetics in AGMs. Furthermore, AGM monocytes exhibit an embryonic development and repair/regeneration signature featuring TGF-\u03b2 and concomitant reduced expression of inflammatory genes compared to RMs. This regenerative wound healing process likely preserves mucosal integrity and prevents inflammatory insults that underlie immune exhaustion in RMs. ",
        "Effectiveness of Breast-Conserving Surgery and 3-Dimensional Conformal Partial Breast Reirradiation for Recurrence of Breast Cancer in the Ipsilateral Breast: The NRG Oncology/RTOG 1014 Phase 2 Clinical Trial. Importance: Mastectomy is standard for recurrence of breast cancer after breast conservation therapy with whole breast irradiation. The emergence of partial breast irradiation led to consideration of its application for reirradiation after a second lumpectomy for treatment of recurrence of breast cancer in the ipsilateral breast. Objectives: To assess the effectiveness and adverse effects of partial breast reirradiation after a second lumpectomy and whether the treatment is an acceptable alternative to mastectomy. Design, Setting, and Participants: The NRG Oncology/Radiation Therapy Oncology Group 1014 trial is a phase 2, single-arm, prospective clinical trial of 3-dimensional, conformal, external beam partial breast reirradiation after a second lumpectomy for recurrence of breast cancer in the ipsilateral breast after previous whole breast irradiation. The study opened on June 4, 2010, and closed June 18, 2013. Median follow-up was 5.5 years. This analysis used all data received at NRG Oncology through November 18, 2018. Eligible patients experienced a recurrence of breast tumor that was less than 3 cm and unifocal in the ipsilateral breast more than 1 year after breast-conserving therapy with whole breast irradiation and who had undergone excision with negative margins. Interventions: Adjuvant partial breast reirradiation, 1.5 Gy twice daily for 30 treatments during 15 days (45 Gy), using a 3-dimensional conformal technique. Main Outcomes and Measures: The main outcomes of the present study were the predefined secondary study objectives of recurrence of breast cancer in the ipsilateral breast, late adverse events (>1 year after treatment), mastectomy incidence, distant metastasis-free survival, overall survival, and circulating tumor cell incidence. Results: A total of 65 women were enrolled, with 58 evaluable for analysis (mean [SD] age, 65.12 [9.95] years; 48 [83%] white). Of the recurrences of breast cancer in the ipsilateral breast, 23 (40%) were noninvasive and 35 (60%) were invasive. In all 58 patients, 53 (91%) had tumors 2 cm or smaller. All tumors were clinically node negative. A total of 44 patients (76%) tested positive for estrogen receptor, 33 (57%) for progesterone receptor, and 10 (17%) for ERBB2 (formerly HER2 or HER2/neu) overexpression. Four patients had breast cancer recurrence, with a 5-year cumulative incidence of 5% (95% CI, 1%-13%). Seven patients underwent ipsilateral mastectomies for a 5-year cumulative incidence of 10% (95% CI, 4%-20%). Both distant metastasis-free survival and overall survival rates were 95% (95% CI, 85%-98%). Four patients (7%) had grade 3 and none had grade 4 or higher late treatment adverse events. Conclusions and Relevance: For patients experiencing recurrence of breast cancer in the ipsilateral breast after lumpectomy and whole breast irradiation, a second breast conservation was achievable in 90%, with a low risk of re-recurrence of cancer in the ipsilateral breast using adjuvant partial breast reirradiation. This finding suggests that this treatment approach is an effective alternative to mastectomy. ",
        "Comparison of different human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine types and dose schedules for prevention of HPV-related disease in females and males. BACKGROUND: Uptake of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine remains low in many countries, although the bivalent and quadrivalent HPV vaccines given as a three-dose schedule are effective in the prevention of precancerous lesions of the cervix in women. Simpler immunisation schedules, such as those with fewer doses, might reduce barriers to vaccination, as may programmes that include males. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the efficacy, immunogenicity, and harms of different dose schedules and different types of HPV vaccines in females and males. SEARCH METHODS: We conducted electronic searches on 27 September 2018 in Ovid MEDLINE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (in the Cochrane Library), and Ovid Embase. We also searched the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and ClinicalTrials.gov (both 27 September 2018), vaccine manufacturer websites, and checked reference lists from an index of HPV studies and other relevant systematic reviews. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with no language restriction. We considered studies if they enrolled HIV-negative males or females aged 9 to 26 years, or HIV-positive males or females of any age. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used methods recommended by Cochrane. We use the term 'control' to refer to comparator products containing an adjuvant or active vaccine and 'placebo' to refer to products that contain no adjuvant or active vaccine. Most primary outcomes in this review were clinical outcomes. However, for comparisons comparing dose schedules, the included RCTs were designed to measure antibody responses (i.e. immunogenicity) as the primary outcome, rather than clinical outcomes, since it is unethical to collect cervical samples from girls under 16 years of age. We analysed immunogenicity outcomes (i.e. geometric mean titres) with ratios of means, clinical outcomes (e.g. cancer and intraepithelial neoplasia) with risk ratios or rate ratios and, for serious adverse events and deaths, we calculated odds ratios. We rated the certainty of evidence with GRADE. MAIN RESULTS: We included 20 RCTs with 31,940 participants. The length of follow-up in the included studies ranged from seven months to five years. Two doses versus three doses of HPV vaccine in 9- to 15-year-old females Antibody responses after two-dose and three-dose HPV vaccine schedules were similar after up to five years of follow-up (4 RCTs, moderate- to high-certainty evidence). No RCTs collected clinical outcome data. Evidence about serious adverse events in studies comparing dose schedules was of very low-certainty owing to imprecision and indirectness (three doses 35/1159; two doses 36/1158; 4 RCTs). One death was reported in the three-dose group (1/898) and none in the two-dose group (0/899) (low-certainty evidence). Interval between doses of HPV vaccine in 9- to 14-year-old females and males Antibody responses were stronger with a longer interval (6 or 12 months) between the first two doses of HPV vaccine than a shorter interval (2 or 6 months) at up to three years of follow-up (4 RCTs, moderate- to high-certainty evidence). No RCTs collected data about clinical outcomes. Evidence about serious adverse events in studies comparing intervals was of very low-certainty, owing to imprecision and indirectness. No deaths were reported in any of the studies (0/1898, 3 RCTs, low-certainty evidence). HPV vaccination of 10- to 26-year-old males In one RCT there was moderate-certainty evidence that quadrivalent HPV vaccine, compared with control, reduced the incidence of external genital lesions (control 36 per 3081 person-years; quadrivalent 6 per 3173 person-years; rate ratio 0.16, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.38; 6254 person-years) and anogenital warts (control 28 per 2814 person-years; quadrivalent 3 per 2831 person-years; rate ratio 0.11, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.38; 5645 person-years). The quadrivalent vaccine resulted in more injection-site adverse events, such as pain or redness, than control (537 versus 601 per 1000; risk ratio (RR) 1.12, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.18, 3895 participants, high-certainty evidence). There was very low-certainty evidence from two RCTs about serious adverse events with quadrivalent vaccine (control 12/2588; quadrivalent 8/2574), and about deaths (control 11/2591; quadrivalent 3/2582), owing to imprecision and indirectness. Nonavalent versus quadrivalent vaccine in 9- to 26-year-old females and males Three RCTs were included; one in females aged 9- to 15-years (n = 600), one in females aged 16- to 26-years (n = 14,215), and one in males aged 16- to 26-years (n = 500). The RCT in 16- to 26-year-old females reported clinical outcomes. There was little to no difference in the incidence of the combined outcome of high-grade cervical epithelial neoplasia, adenocarcinoma in situ, or cervical cancer between the HPV vaccines (quadrivalent 325/6882, nonavalent 326/6871; OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.16; 13,753 participants; high-certainty evidence). The other two RCTs did not collect data about clinical outcomes. There were slightly more local adverse events with the nonavalent vaccine (905 per 1000) than the quadrivalent vaccine (846 per 1000) (RR 1.07, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.08; 3 RCTs, 15,863 participants; high-certainty evidence). Comparative evidence about serious adverse events in the three RCTs (nonavalent 243/8234, quadrivalent 192/7629; OR 0.60, 95% CI 0.14 to 2.61) was of low certainty, owing to imprecision and indirectness. HPV vaccination for people living with HIV Seven RCTs reported on HPV vaccines in people with HIV, with two small trials that collected data about clinical outcomes. Antibody responses were higher following vaccination with either bivalent or quadrivalent HPV vaccine than with control, and these responses could be demonstrated to have been maintained for up to 24 months in children living with HIV (low-certainty evidence). The evidence about clinical outcomes and harms for HPV vaccines in people with HIV is very uncertain (low- to very low-certainty evidence), owing to imprecision and indirectness. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The immunogenicity of two-dose and three-dose HPV vaccine schedules, measured using antibody responses in young females, is comparable. The quadrivalent vaccine probably reduces external genital lesions and anogenital warts in males compared with control. The nonavalent and quadrivalent vaccines offer similar protection against a combined outcome of cervical, vaginal, and vulval precancer lesions or cancer. In people living with HIV, both the bivalent and quadrivalent HPV vaccines result in high antibody responses. For all comparisons of alternative HPV vaccine schedules, the certainty of the body of evidence about serious adverse events reported during the study periods was low or very low, either because the number of events was low, or the evidence was indirect, or both. Post-marketing surveillance is needed to continue monitoring harms that might be associated with HPV vaccines in the population, and this evidence will be incorporated in future updates of this review. Long-term observational studies are needed to determine the effectiveness of reduced-dose schedules against HPV-related cancer endpoints, and whether adopting these schedules improves vaccine coverage rates.

        "PQS Signaling for More than a Quorum: the Collective Stress Response Protects Healthy Pseudomonas aeruginosa Populations. In this issue, Bru et al. connect Pseudomonas aeruginosa PQS signaling secretion during stress response to swarming behavior (J.-L. Bru, B. Rawson, C. Trinh, K. Whiteson, et al., J Bacteriol 201:e00383-19, 2019, https://doi.org/10.1128/JB.00383-19). Phage-infected or antibiotic-treated bacterial cells secrete PQS to repel healthy, unexposed cells away from the source of the stress. Thus, the collective stress response mechanism driven by PQS signaling influences spatial organization and population dynamics in P. aeruginosa that may provide competitive advantages in certain niches.

        "The Geographic Distribution of Fentanyl-Involved Overdose Deaths in Cook County, Illinois. Objectives. To contrast the geographic distribution of fentanyl-involved and non-fentanyl-involved fatal overdoses between 2014 and 2018 in Cook County, Illinois.Methods. We conducted a spatial analysis using locations of fentanyl-involved fatal overdoses (n\u2009=\u20091433) compared with nonfentanyl opioid and polydrug fatal overdoses (n\u2009=\u20091838) collected through the Cook County Medical Examiner's Office from 2014 to 2018. We also used logistic regression to test significant individual- and neighborhood-level covariates.Results. Fentanyl overdoses geographically clustered more than nonfentanyl overdoses, and this difference was statistically significant. One area in particular showed significantly elevated risk for fentanyl overdoses (P\u2009<\u2009.05) located in 2 specific neighborhoods of Chicago. The odds of a fentanyl-involved overdose were significantly increased for men, Blacks, Latinos/as, and younger individuals. Neighborhood deprivation score was the only significant neighborhood-level predictor (odds ratio\u2009=\u20091.11; 95% confidence interval\u2009=\u20091.07, 1.17).Conclusions. Fentanyl-involved fatal overdoses follow a distinct geographic distribution associated with resource deprivation in neighborhoods where they occur. This suggests an evolving bifurcated drug market, with drug markets in resource-deprived neighborhoods disproportionately likely to include fentanyl. ",
        "Embryonic mesothelial-derived hepatic lineage of quiescent and heterogenous scar-orchestrating cells defined but suppressed by WT1. Activated hepatic stellate cells (aHSCs) orchestrate scarring during liver injury, with putative quiescent precursor mesodermal derivation. Here we use lineage-tracing from development, through adult homoeostasis, to fibrosis, to define morphologically and transcriptionally discreet subpopulations of aHSCs by expression of WT1, a transcription factor controlling morphological transitions in organogenesis and adult homoeostasis. Two distinct populations of aHSCs express WT1 after injury, and both re-engage a transcriptional signature reflecting embryonic mesothelial origin of their discreet quiescent adult precursor. WT1-deletion enhances fibrogenesis after injury, through upregulated Wnt-signalling and modulation of genes central to matrix persistence in aHSCs, and augmentation of myofibroblastic transition. The mesothelial-derived lineage demonstrates punctuated phenotypic plasticity through bidirectional mesothelial-mesenchymal transitions. Our findings demonstrate functional heterogeneity of adult scar-orchestrating cells that can be whole-life traced back through specific quiescent adult precursors to differential origin in development, and define WT1 as a paradoxical regulator of aHSCs induced by injury but suppressing scarring.

        "Exposure to Cannabis Marketing in Social and Traditional Media and Past-Year Use Among Adolescents in States With Legal Retail Cannabis. PURPOSE: The objective of this study was to examine adolescents' self-reported exposure to cannabis marketing in states with legalized cannabis and its association with past-year cannabis use. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional, online panel survey of 469 adolescents aged 15-19\u00a0years residing in four states with legal retail cannabis for adult use. Adolescents self-reported exposure to cannabis marketing on social or traditional media (i.e., outdoor or print) and past-year cannabis use. Logistic regression generated estimated odds of youths' past-year cannabis use by marketing exposure after adjusting for demographic factors and cannabis-related social norms. RESULTS: Exposure to cannabis marketing on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram was associated with increased odds of past-year cannabis use of 96% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 15%-234%), 88% (95% CI: 11%-219%), and 129% (95% CI: 32%-287%), respectively. Odds of past-year cannabis use increased by 48% (95% CI: 16%-87%) with each additional social media platform where adolescents reported exposure. CONCLUSIONS: Despite restrictions that prohibit cannabis advertising on social media, adolescents are exposed to cannabis marketing via social media, and this exposure is associated with recent cannabis use. States should consider further regulation of cannabis marketing on social media. ",
        "Development and Validation of a Model for Predicting the Risk of Acute Kidney Injury Associated With Contrast Volume Levels During Percutaneous Coronary Intervention. Importance: Determining the association of contrast volume during percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with the risk of acute kidney injury (AKI) is important for optimizing PCI safety. Objective: To quantify how the risk of AKI is associated with contrast volume, accounting for the possibility of nonlinearity and heterogeneity among different baseline risks. Design, Setting, and Participants: This prognostic study used data from the American College of Cardiology National Cardiovascular Data Registry CathPCI Registry for 1694 US hospitals. Derivation analysis included 2\u202f076\u202f694 individuals who underwent PCI from July 1, 2011, to June 30, 2015. Validation analysis included 961\u202f863 individuals who underwent PCI from July 1, 2015, to March 31, 2017. Data analysis took place from July 2018 to May 2019. Exposure: Contrast volume during PCI. Main Outcomes and Measures: Acute kidney injury was defined using 3 thresholds for preprocedure to postprocedure creatinine level increase (ie, \u22650.3 mg/dL, \u22650.5 mg/dL, and \u22651.0 mg/dL). A model quantifying the association of contrast volume with AKI was developed, and the existence of nonlinearity and heterogeneity were examined by likelihood ratio tests. The model was derived in the training set (a random 50% of the derivation cohort), and performance was evaluated in the test set (the remaining 50% of the derivation cohort) and an independent validation set by area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and calibration slope of observed vs predicted risks. Results: The 2\u202f076\u202f694 patients in the derivation set had a mean (SD) age of 65.1 (12.1) years, and 662\u202f525 (31.9%) were women; 133\u202f306 (6.4%) had creatinine level increases of at least 0.3 mg/dL, 66\u202f626 (3.2%) had creatinine level increases of at least 0.5 mg/dL, and 28\u202f378 (1.4%) had creatinine level increases of at least 1.0 mg/dL. In the validation set of 961\u202f843 patients (mean [SD] age, 65.7 [12.1] years; 305\u202f577 [31.8%] women), these rates were 62\u202f913 (6.5%), 34\u202f229 (3.6%), and 15\u202f555 (1.6%), respectively. The association of contrast volume and AKI risk was nonlinear (\u03c7226\u2009=\u20091436.2; P\u2009<\u2009.001) and varied by preprocedural risk (\u03c7220\u2009=\u2009105.6; P\u2009<\u2009.001). In the test set, the model yielded an AUC of 0.777 (95% CI, 0.775-0.779) for predicting risk of a creatinine level increase of at least 0.3 mg/dL, 0.839 (95% CI, 0.837-0.841) for predicting risk of a creatinine level increase of at least 0.5 mg/dL, and 0.870 (95% CI, 0.867-0.873) for predicting risk of a creatinine level increase of at least 1.0 mg/dL; it achieved a calibration slope of 0.998 (95% CI, 0.989-1.007), 0.999 (95% CI, 0.989-1.008), and 0.986 (95% CI, 0.973-0.998), respectively, for the AKI severity levels. The model had similar performance in the validation set (creatinine level increase of \u22650.3 mg/dL: AUC, 0.794; 95% CI, 0.792-0.795; calibration slope, 1.039; 95% CI, 1.030-1.047; creatinine level increase of \u22650.5 mg/dL: AUC, 0.845; 95% CI, 0.843-0.848; calibration slope, 1.063; 95% CI, 1.054-1.074; creatinine level increase of \u22651.0 mg/dL: AUC, 0.872; 95% CI, 0.869-0.875; calibration slope, 1.103; 95% CI, 1.089-1.117). Conclusions and Relevance: The association of contrast volume with AKI risk is complex, varies by baseline risk, and can be predicted by a model. Future research to evaluate the effect of the model on AKI is needed. ",
        "Distinct effects of orexin receptor antagonist and GABAA agonist on sleep and physical/cognitive functions after forced awakening. The majority of patients with insomnia are treated with hypnotic agents. In the present study, we evaluated the side-effect profile of an orexin receptor antagonist and \u03b3-aminobutyric acid A (GABAA) receptor agonist on physical/cognitive functions upon forced awakening. This double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, cross-over study was conducted on 30 healthy male subjects. Fifteen minutes before bedtime, the subjects took a pill of suvorexant (20 mg), brotizolam (0.25 mg), or placebo and were forced awake 90 min thereafter. Physical- and cognitive-function tests were performed before taking the pill, after forced awakening, and the next morning. Polysomnographic recordings revealed that the efficacies of the hypnotic agents in prolonging total sleep time (\u223c30 min) and increasing sleep efficiency (\u223c6%) were comparable. When the subjects were allowed to go back to sleep after the forced awakening, the sleep latency was shorter under the influence of hypnotic agents (\u223c2 min) compared to the placebo trial (24 min), and the rapid eye movement latency was significantly shorter under suvorexant (98.8, 81.7, and 48.8 min for placebo, brotizolam, and suvorexant, respectively). Although brotizolam significantly impaired the overall physical/cognitive performance (sum of z score) compared with placebo upon forced awakening, there was no significant difference in the total z score of performance between suvorexant and placebo. Notably, the score for static balance with the eyes open was higher under suvorexant compared to brotizolam administration. The energy expenditure was lower under suvorexant and brotizolam compared with the placebo. The effect size of brotizolam (d = 0.24) to reduce the energy expenditure was larger than that of suvorexant (d < 0.01). ",
        "Programming DNA-Based Biomolecular Reaction Networks on Cancer Cell Membranes. DNA is a highly programmable biomolecule and has been used to construct biological circuits for different purposes. An important development of DNA circuits is to process the information on receptors on cell membranes. In this Communication, we introduce an architecture to program localized DNA-based biomolecular reaction networks on cancer cell membranes. Based on our architecture, various types of reaction networks have been experimentally demonstrated, from simple linear cascades to reaction networks of complex structures. These localized DNA-based reaction networks can be used for medical applications such as cancer cell detection. Compared to prior work on DNA circuits for evaluating cell membrane receptors, the DNA circuits made by our architecture have several major advantages including simpler design, lower leak, lower cost, and higher signal-to-background ratio.

        "Online Reviews of Specialized Drug Treatment Facilities-Identifying Potential Drivers of High and Low Patient Satisfaction. BACKGROUND: Despite the importance of high-quality and patient-centered substance use disorder treatment, there are no standardized ratings of specialized drug treatment facilities and their services. Online platforms offer insights into potential drivers of high and low patient experience. OBJECTIVE: We sought to analyze publicly available online review content of specialized drug treatment facilities and identify themes within high and low ratings. DESIGN: This was a retrospective analysis of online ratings and reviews of specialized drug treatment facilities in Pennsylvania listed within the 2016 National Directory of Drug and Alcohol Abuse Treatment Facilities. Latent Dirichlet Allocation, a machine learning approach to narrative text, was used to identify themes within reviews. Differential Language Analysis was then used to measure correlations between themes and star ratings. SETTING: Online reviews of Pennsylvania's specialized drug treatment facilities posted to Google and Yelp (July 2010-August 2018). RESULTS: A total of 7823 online ratings were posted over 8\u00a0years. The distribution was bimodal (43% 5-star and 34% 1-star). The average weighted rating of a facility was 3.3 stars. Online themes correlated with 5-star ratings were the following: focus on recovery (r\u2009=\u20090.53), helpfulness of staff (r\u2009=\u20090.43), compassionate care (r\u2009=\u20090.37), experienced a life-changing moment (r\u2009=\u20090.32), and staff professionalism (r\u2009=\u20090.29). Themes correlated with a 1-star rating were waiting time (r\u2009=\u20090.41), poor accommodations (0.26), poor phone communication (r\u2009=\u20090.24), medications given (0.24), and appointment availability (r\u2009=\u20090.23). Themes derived from review content were similar to 9 of the 14 facility-level services highlighted by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration's National Survey of Substance Abuse Treatment Services. CONCLUSIONS: Individuals are sharing their ratings and reviews of specialized drug treatment facilities on online platforms. Organically derived reviews of the patient experience, captured by online platforms, reveal potential drivers of high and low ratings. These represent additional areas of focus which can inform patient-centered quality metrics for specialized drug treatment facilities. ",
        "Longitudinal molecular trajectories of diffuse glioma in adults. The evolutionary processes that drive universal therapeutic resistance in adult patients with diffuse glioma remain unclear1,2. Here we analysed temporally separated DNA-sequencing data and matched clinical annotation from 222 adult patients with glioma. By analysing mutations and copy numbers across the three major subtypes of diffuse glioma, we found that driver genes detected at the initial stage of disease were retained at recurrence, whereas there was little evidence of recurrence-specific gene alterations. Treatment with alkylating agents resulted in a hypermutator phenotype at different rates across the glioma subtypes, and hypermutation was not associated with differences in overall survival. Acquired aneuploidy was frequently detected in recurrent gliomas and was characterized by IDH mutation but without co-deletion of chromosome arms 1p/19q, and further converged with acquired alterations in the cell cycle and poor outcomes. The clonal architecture of each tumour remained similar over time, but the presence of subclonal selection was associated with decreased survival. Finally, there were no differences in the levels of immunoediting between initial and recurrent gliomas. Collectively, our results suggest that the strongest selective pressures occur during early glioma development and that current therapies shape this evolution in a largely stochastic manner. ",
        "The Impact of Obesity and Smoking on Outcomes After Volar Plate Fixation of Distal Radius Fractures. PURPOSE: Distal radius fractures are common fractures of the upper extremity. Whereas surgical outcomes have been extensively investigated, the impact of risk factors\u00a0such as body mass index (BMI) and smoking on patient outcomes has not been explored. We hypothesized that obesity and smoking would have a negative impact on the functional and radiographic outcomes of surgically treated patients with distal radius fractures. METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of patients surgically treated for a distal radius fracture between 2006 and 2017 at 2 level 1 trauma centers. Patients were divided into obese (BMI \u2265 30) and nonobese (BMI < 30) groups according to the World Health Organization BMI Classification. Patients were also divided into current, former, and\u00a0never smokers based on reported cigarette use. Primary outcomes included patient-reported outcome measures (Quick Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand [QuickDASH]), range of motion (ROM) arc (flexion-extension, pronation-supination), radiographic union (Radiographic Union Scoring System [RUSS] score), and change in radiographic alignment (radial height, radial inclination, volar tilt) between first and last\u00a0follow-up. Multivariable models corrected for age, sex, comorbidities, fracture complexity, osteoporosis, and time to surgery. RESULTS: Two hundred patients were identified, 39 with BMI of 30 or greater and 161 with\u00a0BMI less than 30. Obese patients had more comorbidities but similar fracture types.\u00a0At 3-month and 1-year follow-up, both groups achieved acceptable QuickDASH scores, close to those of the general population (21 vs 18, 14 vs 2, respectively). The 2 groups were similar in regard to motion, RUSS score, and alignment. There were 148 never smokers, 32 former smokers, and 20 current smokers. At 3 months, smokers demonstrated higher QuickDASH scores (42 vs 21-24) and a lower percentage of radiographically healed fractures (40% vs 69%-82%). At final follow-up, smokers reported small differences in patient-reported outcomes (QuickDASH 18 vs 9-13) whereas ROM, fracture healing, and complication rates were similar. CONCLUSIONS: Both obese and nonobese patients can achieve excellent outcomes following surgical treatment of distal radius fracture with similar self-reported outcomes, motion, RUSS score, and alignment. Despite slower healing in the early postoperative period, smokers had similar QuickDASH scores, ROM, and union rates to past smokers and never smokers at final follow-up, with a similar complication profile. TYPE OF STUDY/LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Prognostic IV. ",
        "Trends in Peritoneal Dialysis Use in the United States after Medicare Payment Reform. BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Peritoneal dialysis (PD) for ESKD is associated with similar mortality, higher quality of life, and lower costs compared with hemodialysis (HD), but has historically been underused. We assessed the effect of the 2011 Medicare prospective payment system (PPS) for dialysis on PD initiation, modality switches, and stable PD use. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: Using US Renal Data System and Medicare data, we identified all United States patients with ESKD initiating dialysis before (2006-2010) and after (2011-2013) PPS implementation, and observed their modality for up to 2 years after dialysis initiation. Using logistic regression models, we examined the associations between PPS and early PD experience (any PD 1-90 days after initiation), late PD use (any PD 91-730 days after initiation), and modality switches (PD-to-HD or HD-to-PD 91-730 days after initiation). We adjusted for patient, dialysis facility, and regional characteristics. RESULTS: Overall, 619,126 patients with incident ESKD received dialysis at Medicare-certified facilities, 2006-2013. Observed early PD experience increased from 9.4% before PPS to 12.6% after PPS. Observed late PD use increased from 12.1% to 16.1%. In adjusted analyses, PPS was associated with increased early PD experience (odds ratio [OR], 1.51; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.47 to 1.55; P<0.001) and late PD use (OR, 1.47; 95% CI, 1.45 to 1.50; P<0.001). In subgroup analyses, late PD use increased in part due to an increase in HD-to-PD switches among those without early PD experience (OR, 1.59; 95% CI, 1.52 to 1.66; P<0.001) and a decrease in PD-to-HD switches among those with early PD experience (OR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.87 to 0.98; P=0.004). CONCLUSIONS: More patients started, stayed on, and switched to PD after dialysis payment reform. This occurred without a substantial increase in transfers to HD. ",
        "Distinct metabolic adaptation of liver circadian pathways to acute and chronic patterns of alcohol intake. Binge drinking and chronic exposure to ethanol contribute to alcoholic liver diseases (ALDs). A potential link between ALDs and circadian disruption has been observed, though how different patterns of alcohol consumption differentially impact hepatic circadian metabolism remains virtually unexplored. Using acute versus chronic ethanol feeding, we reveal differential reprogramming of the circadian transcriptome in the liver. Specifically, rewiring of diurnal SREBP transcriptional pathway leads to distinct hepatic signatures in acetyl-CoA metabolism that are translated into the subcellular patterns of protein acetylation. Thus, distinct drinking patterns of alcohol dictate differential adaptation of hepatic circadian metabolism. ",
        "Behavioral Sciences in the Promotion of Oral Health. The importance and value of behavioral sciences in dentistry have long been recognized, and their contribution to dental education, research, clinical practice, and oral health policy has been significant over the past half century. Over time behavioral sciences have expanded our understanding of oral health beyond \"disease\" to a broader biopsychosocial concept of oral health. This in turn has led dentistry away from a focus of \"treatment\" to oral health \"care,\" notably in the new millennium. Key oral health behaviors have been identified for more than half a century: the importance of diet, oral hygiene, dental services, and other factors. Various behavioral models and theories have been proposed, particularly since the 1970s, providing useful frameworks with sound psychological basis to help understand the paths of oral health behaviors. These models draw on theories of self-efficacy, motivation, counseling, and \"behavior change.\" Since the 1980s, there has been a greater understanding that these behaviors often share a common pathway with the etiology of other diseases (common risk factors). Furthermore, the relationship between individual factors and the broader environmental factors has been increasingly emphasized since the 1990s, leading to a united call for action in addressing oral health inequalities. Within the past decade, there are useful examples of models, frameworks, and techniques of behavior change with respect to oral health, involving planning, prompting, encouraging, goal setting, and/or motivating. In particular, there is a growing interest and use of motivational interviewing. Likewise, behavioral therapies, such as cognitive behavioral therapy, are increasingly being employed in dental practice in the management of dental anxiety, pain, and psychosomatic dental and oral problems, with promising results. Recommendations are outlined for future directions for behavioral sciences in the promotion of oral health. ",
        "Labeling and Natural Post-Translational Modification of Peptides and Proteins via Chemoselective Pd-Catalyzed Prenylation of Cysteine. The prenylation of peptides and proteins is an important post-translational modification observed in vivo. We report that the Pd-catalyzed Tsuji-Trost allylation with a Pd/BIPHEPHOS catalyst system allows the allylation of Cys-containing peptides and proteins with complete chemoselectivity and high n/i regioselectivity. In contrast to recently established methods, which use non-native connections, the Pd-catalyzed prenylation produces the natural n-prenylthioether bond. In addition, a variety of biophysical probes such as affinity handles and fluorescent tags can be introduced into Cys-containing peptides and proteins. Furthermore, peptides containing two cysteine residues can be stapled or cyclized using homobifunctional allylic carbonate reagents. ",
        "Home-based Upper Extremity Stroke Therapy Using a Multiuser Virtual Reality Environment: A Randomized Trial. OBJECTIVE: To compare participation and subjective experience of participants in both home-based multiuser virtual reality (VR) therapy and home-based single-user (SU) VR therapy. DESIGN: Crossover, randomized trial. SETTING: Initial training and evaluations occurred in a rehabilitation hospital; the interventions took place in participants' homes. PARTICIPANTS: Survivors of stroke with chronic upper extremity impairment (N=20). INTERVENTIONS: Four weeks of in-home treatment using a custom, multiuser virtual reality system (VERGE): 2 weeks of both multiuser (MU) and SU versions of VERGE. The order of presentation of SU and MU versions was randomized such that participants were divided into 2 groups, First MU and First SU. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: We measured arm displacement during each session (m) as the primary outcome measure. Secondary outcome measures include time participants spent using each MU and SU VERGE and Intrinsic Motivation Inventory scores. Fugl-Meyer Assessment of Motor Recovery After Stroke Upper Extremity (FMA-UE) score and compliance with prescribed training were also evaluated. Measures were recorded before, midway, and after the treatment. Activity and movement were measured during each training session. RESULTS: Arm displacement during a session was significantly affected the mode of therapy (MU: 414.6m, SU: 327.0m, P=.019). Compliance was very high (99% compliance for MU mode and 89% for SU mode). Within a given session, participants spent significantly more time training in the MU mode than in the SU mode (P=.04). FMA-UE score improved significantly across all participants (\u03943.2, P=.001). CONCLUSIONS: Multiuser VR exercises may provide an effective means of extending clinical therapy into the home. ",
        "Changes in CT Radiomic Features Associated with Lymphocyte Distribution Predict Overall Survival and Response to Immunotherapy in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer. No predictive biomarkers can robustly identify patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who will benefit from immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapies. Here, in a machine learning setting, we compared changes (\"delta\") in the radiomic texture (DelRADx) of CT patterns both within and outside tumor nodules before and after two to three cycles of ICI therapy. We found that DelRADx patterns could predict response to ICI therapy and overall survival (OS) for patients with NSCLC. We retrospectively analyzed data acquired from 139 patients with NSCLC at two institutions, who were divided into a discovery set (D1 = 50) and two independent validation sets (D2 = 62, D3 = 27). Intranodular and perinodular texture descriptors were extracted, and the relative differences were computed. A linear discriminant analysis (LDA) classifier was trained with 8 DelRADx features to predict RECIST-derived response. Association of delta-radiomic risk score (DRS) with OS was determined. The association of DelRADx features with tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) density on the diagnostic biopsies (n = 36) was also evaluated. The LDA classifier yielded an AUC of 0.88 \u00b1 0.08 in distinguishing responders from nonresponders in D1, and 0.85 and 0.81 in D2 and D3 DRS was associated with OS [HR: 1.64; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.22-2.21; P = 0.0011; C-index = 0.72). Peritumoral Gabor features were associated with the density of TILs on diagnostic biopsy samples. Our results show that DelRADx could be used to identify early functional responses in patients with NSCLC. ",
        "Associations of Parental Marijuana Use With Offspring Marijuana, Tobacco, and Alcohol Use and Opioid Misuse. Importance: Marijuana use is increasing among adults and often co-occurs with other substance use; therefore, it is important to examine whether parental marijuana use is associated with elevated risk of substance use among offspring living in the same household. Objective: To examine associations of parental marijuana use with offspring marijuana, tobacco, and alcohol use and opioid misuse. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cross-sectional study used survey data from the 2015 through 2018 National Surveys on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH), which provide nationally representative data on adolescents or young adults living with a parent (the mother or the father). Annual average percentages were based on survey sampling weights. Final analyses were conducted September 21 through 23, 2019. Exposures: Parental marijuana use status. Main Outcomes and Measures: Offspring self-reported use of marijuana, tobacco, or alcohol or misuse of opioids. Results: Survey respondents included 24\u202f900 father-offspring or mother-offspring dyads sampled from the same household. Among mothers living with adolescent offspring, 8.2% (95% CI, 7.3%-9.2%) had past-year marijuana use, while 7.6% (95% CI, 6.2%-9.2%) of mothers living with young adult offspring had past-year marijuana use. Among fathers living with adolescent offspring, 9.6% (95% CI, 8.5%-10.8%) had past-year marijuana use, and 9.0% (95% CI, 7.4%-10.9%) of fathers living with young adult offspring had past-year marijuana use. Compared with adolescents whose mothers never used marijuana, adjusted relative risk (ARR) of past-year marijuana use was higher among those whose mothers had lifetime (without past-year) marijuana use (ARR, 1.3; 95% CI, 1.1-1.6; P\u2009=\u2009.007), less than 52 days of past-year marijuana use (ARR, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.1-2.7; P\u2009=\u2009.02), or 52 days or more of past-year marijuana use (ARR, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.1-2.2; P\u2009=\u2009.02). Compared with young adults whose mothers never used marijuana, adjusted risk of past-year marijuana use was higher among those whose mothers had lifetime (without past-year) marijuana use (ARR, 1.4; 95% CI, 1.1-1.7; P\u2009=\u2009.001), less than 52 days of past-year marijuana use (ARR, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.0-2.3; P\u2009=\u2009.049), or 52 days or more of past-year marijuana use (ARR, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.3-2.5; P\u2009=\u2009.002). Compared with adolescents whose fathers never used marijuana, adolescents whose fathers had less than 52 days of past-year marijuana use were more likely to use marijuana (ARR, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.2-2.7; P\u2009=\u2009.006). Compared with young adults whose fathers never used marijuana, young adults whose fathers had 52 days or more of past-year marijuana use were more likely to use marijuana (ARR, 2.1; 95% CI, 1.6-2.9; P\u2009<\u2009.001). Compared with their peers whose parents never used marijuana and after adjusting for covariates, the adjusted risk of past-year tobacco use was higher among adolescents whose mothers had lifetime marijuana use (ARR, 1.3; 95% CI, 1.0-1.6; P\u2009=\u2009.03), less than 52 days of past-year marijuana use (ARR, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.0-2.1; P\u2009=\u2009.04), or 52 days or more of past-year marijuana use (ARR, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.1-2.3; P\u2009=\u2009.03); adolescents whose fathers had lifetime marijuana use (ARR, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.1-1.9; P\u2009=\u2009.004) or 52 days or more of past-year marijuana use (ARR, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.2-2.7; P\u2009=\u2009.006); young adults whose mothers had lifetime marijuana use (ARR, 1.2; 95% CI, 1.0-1.4; P\u2009=\u2009.04); and young adults whose fathers had 52 days or more of past-year marijuana use (ARR, 1.4; 95% CI, 1.0-1.9; P\u2009=\u2009.046). Compared with their peers whose parents had no past marijuana use and after adjusting for covariates, risk of past-year alcohol use was higher among adolescents whose mothers had lifetime marijuana use (ARR, 1.2; 95% CI, 1.1-1.4; P\u2009=\u2009.004), less than 52 days of past-year marijuana use (ARR, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.2-1.9; P\u2009=\u2009.002), or 52 days or more of past-year marijuana use (ARR, 1.3; 95% CI, 1.0-1.7; P\u2009=\u2009.04). After adjusting for covariates, parental marijuana use was not associated with opioid misuse by offspring. Conclusions and Relevance: In this cross-sectional study, parental marijuana use was associated with increased risk of substance use among adolescent and young adult offspring living in the same household. Screening household members for substance use and counseling parents on risks posed by current and past marijuana use are warranted. ",
        "The Relationship Between Ambient Atmospheric Fine Particulate Matter (PM2.5) and Glaucoma in a Large Community Cohort. Purpose: Glaucoma is more common in urban populations than in others. Ninety percent of the world's population are exposed to air pollution above World Health Organization (WHO) recommended limits. Few studies have examined the association between air pollution and glaucoma. Methods: Questionnaire data, ophthalmic measures, and ambient residential area air quality data for 111,370 UK Biobank participants were analyzed. Particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter < 2.5 \u03bcm (PM2.5) was selected as the air quality exposure of interest. Eye measures included self-reported glaucoma, intraocular pressure (IOP), and average thickness of macular ganglion cell-inner plexiform layer (GCIPL) across nine Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) retinal subfields as obtained from spectral-domain optical coherence tomography. We examined the associations of PM2.5 concentration with self-reported glaucoma, IOP, and GCIPL. Results: Participants resident in areas with higher PM2.5 concentration were more likely to report a diagnosis of glaucoma (odds ratio = 1.06, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.01-1.12, per interquartile range [IQR] increase P = 0.02). Higher PM2.5 concentration was also associated with thinner GCIPL (\u03b2 = -0.56 \u03bcm, 95% CI = -0.63 to -0.49, per IQR increase, P = 1.2 \u00d7 10-53). A dose-response relationship was observed between higher levels of PM2.5 and thinner GCIPL (P < 0.001). There was no clinically relevant relationship between PM2.5 concentration and IOP. Conclusions: Greater exposure to PM2.5 is associated with both self-reported glaucoma and adverse structural characteristics of the disease. The absence of an association between PM2.5 and IOP suggests the relationship may occur through a non-pressure-dependent mechanism, possibly neurotoxic and/or vascular effects. ",
        "High expression of apoptosis protein (Api-5) in chemoresistant triple-negative breast cancers: an innovative target. Anti-apoptotic protein-5 (API-5) is a survival protein interacting with the protein acinus, preventing its cleavage by caspase-3 and thus inhibiting apoptosis. We studied the effect of targeting API-5 in chemoresistant triple negative breast cancers (TNBCs), to reverse chemoresistance. 78 TNBC biopsies from patients with different responses to chemotherapy were analysed for API-5 expression before any treatment. Further studies on API-5 expression and inhibition were performed on patient-derived TNBC xenografts, one highly sensitive to chemotherapies (XBC-S) and the other resistant to most tested drugs (XBC-R). In situ assessments of necrosis, cell proliferation, angiogenesis, and apoptosis in response to anti-API-5 peptide were performed on the TNBC xenografts. Clinical analyses of the 78 TNBC biopsies revealed that API-5 was more markedly expressed in endothelial cells before any treatment among patients with chemoresistant TNBC, and this was associated with greater micro-vessel density. A transcriptomic analysis of xenografted tumors showed an involvement of anti-apoptotic genes in the XBC-R model, and API-5 expression was higher in XBC-R endothelial cells. API-5 expression was also correlated with hypoxic stress conditions both in vitro and in vivo. 28 days of anti-API-5 peptide efficiently inhibited the XBC-R xenograft via caspase-3 apoptosis. This inhibition was associated with major inhibition of angiogenesis associated with necrosis and apoptosis. API-5 protein could be a valid therapeutic target in chemoresistant metastatic TNBC. ",
        "Fear in dreams and in wakefulness: Evidence for day/night affective homeostasis. Recent neuroscientific theories have proposed that emotions experienced in dreams contribute to the resolution of emotional distress and preparation for future affective reactions. We addressed one emerging prediction, namely that experiencing fear in dreams is associated with more adapted responses to threatening signals during wakefulness. Using a stepwise approach across two studies, we identified brain regions activated when experiencing fear in dreams and showed that frightening dreams modulated the response of these same regions to threatening stimuli during wakefulness. Specifically, in Study 1, we performed serial awakenings in 18 participants recorded throughout the night with high-density electroencephalography (EEG) and asked them whether they experienced any fear in their dreams. Insula and midcingulate cortex activity increased for dreams containing fear. In Study 2, we tested 89 participants and found that those reporting higher incidence of fear in their dreams showed reduced emotional arousal and fMRI response to fear-eliciting stimuli in the insula, amygdala and midcingulate cortex, while awake. Consistent with better emotion regulation processes, the same participants displayed increased medial prefrontal cortex activity. These findings support that emotions in dreams and wakefulness engage similar neural substrates, and substantiate a link between emotional processes occurring during sleep and emotional brain functions during wakefulness.

        "Topical rapamycin reduces markers of senescence and aging in human skin: an exploratory, prospective, randomized trial. Aging is a major risk factor for the majority of human diseases, and the development of interventions to reduce the intrinsic rate of aging is expected to reduce the risk for age-related diseases including cardiovascular disease, cancer, and dementia. In the skin, aging manifests itself in photodamage and dermal atrophy, with underlying tissue reduction and impaired barrier function. To determine whether rapamycin, an FDA-approved drug targeting the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) complex, can reduce senescence and markers of aging in human skin, an exploratory, placebo-controlled, interventional trial was conducted in a clinical dermatology setting. Participants were greater than 40 years of age with evidence of age-related photoaging and dermal volume loss and no major morbidities. Thirty-six participants were enrolled in the study, and nineteen discontinued or were lost to follow-up. A significant (P = 0.008) reduction in p16INK4A protein levels and an increase in collagen VII protein levels (P = 0.0077) were observed among participants at the end of the study. Clinical improvement in skin appearance was noted in multiple participants, and immunohistochemical analysis revealed improvement in histological appearance of skin tissue. Topical rapamycin reduced the expression of the p16INK4A protein consistent with a reduction in cellular senescence. This change was accompanied by relative improvement in clinical appearance of the skin and histological markers of aging and by an increase in collagen VII, which is critical to the integrity of the basement membrane. These results indicate that rapamycin treatment is a potential anti-aging therapy with efficacy in humans.Trial registration ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03103893. ",
        "Gap Junction Coupling Shapes the Encoding of Light in the Developing Retina. Detection of ambient illumination in the developing retina prior to maturation of conventional photoreceptors is mediated by intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) and is critical for driving several physiological processes, including light aversion, pupillary light reflexes, and photoentrainment of circadian rhythms. The strategies by which ipRGCs encode variations in ambient light intensity at these early ages are not known. Using unsupervised clustering of two-photon calcium responses followed by inspection of anatomical features, we found that the population activity of the neonatal retina could be modeled as six functional groups that were composed of mixtures of ipRGC subtypes and non-ipRGC cell types. By combining imaging, whole-cell recording, pharmacology, and anatomical techniques, we found that functional mixing of cell types is mediated in part by gap junction coupling. Together, these data show that both cell-autonomous intrinsic light responses and gap junction coupling among ipRGCs contribute to the proper encoding of light intensity in the developing retina. ",
        "HNF4 Regulates Fatty Acid Oxidation and Is Required for Renewal of Intestinal Stem Cells in Mice. BACKGROUND & AIMS: Functions of intestinal stem cells (ISCs) are regulated by diet and metabolic pathways. Hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 (HNF4) family are transcription factors that bind fatty acids. We investigated how HNF4 transcription factors regulate metabolism and their functions in ISCs in mice. METHODS: We performed studies with Villin-CreERT2;Lgr5-EGFP-IRES-CreERT2;Hnf4\u03b1f/f;Hnf4\u03b3Crispr/Crispr mice, hereafter referred to Hnf4\u03b1\u03b3DKO. Mice were given tamoxifen to induce Cre recombinase. Mice transgenic with only Cre alleles (Villin-CreERT2, Lgr5-EGFP-IRES-CreERT2, Hnf4\u03b1+/+, and Hnf4\u03b3+/+) or mice given vehicle were used as controls. Crypt and villus cells were isolated, incubated with fluorescently labeled fatty acids or glucose analog, and analyzed by confocal microscopy. Fatty acid oxidation activity and tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle metabolites were measured in cells collected from the proximal half of the small intestine of Hnf4\u03b1\u03b3DKO and control mice. We performed chromatin immunoprecipitation and gene expression profiling analyses to identify genes regulated by HNF4 factors. We established organoids from duodenal crypts, incubated them with labeled palmitate or acetate, and measured production of TCA cycle metabolites or fatty acids. Acetate, a precursor of acetyl coenzyme A (CoA) (a product of fatty acid \u03b2-oxidation [FAO]), or dichloroacetate, a compound that promotes pyruvate oxidation and generation of mitochondrial acetyl-CoA, were used for metabolic intervention. RESULTS: Crypt cells rapidly absorbed labeled fatty acids, and messenger RNA levels of Lgr5+ stem cell markers (Lgr5, Olfm4, Smoc2, Msi1, and Ascl2) were down-regulated in organoids incubated with etomoxir, an inhibitor of FAO, indicating that FAO was required for renewal of ISCs. HNF4A and HNF4G were expressed in ISCs and throughout the intestinal epithelium. Single knockout of either HNF4A or HNF4G did not affect maintenance of ISCs, but double-knockout of HNF4A and HNF4G resulted in ISC loss; stem cells failed to renew. FAO supports ISC renewal, and HNF4 transcription factors directly activate FAO genes, including Acsl5 and Acsf2 (encode regulators of acyl-CoA synthesis), Slc27a2 (encodes a fatty acid transporter), Fabp2 (encodes fatty acid binding protein), and Hadh (encodes hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase). In the intestinal epithelium of Hnf4\u03b1\u03b3DKO mice, expression levels of FAO genes, FAO activity, and metabolites of TCA cycle were all significantly decreased, but fatty acid synthesis transcripts were increased, compared with control mice. The contribution of labeled palmitate or acetate to the TCA cycle was reduced in organoids derived from Hnf4\u03b1\u03b3DKO mice, compared with control mice. Incubation of organoids derived from double-knockout mice with acetate or dichloroacetate restored stem cells. CONCLUSIONS: In mice, the transcription factors HNF4A and HNF4G regulate the expression of genes required for FAO and are required for renewal of ISCs. ",
        "Self-reported history of concussions is associated with risk factors for suicide completion among high school students. BACKGROUND: Suicide is the third leading cause of death among adolescents. While research has found concussions to be a risk factor for suicide in adults, this relationship is not well studied in nationally representative samples of youth. This study examines the relationship between self-reported history of sports-related concussion and five risk factors for suicide completion. METHODS: Data were obtained from the 2017 Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance Survey (n=13,353). Multivariate logistic regression models assessed the relationship between self-reported, sports-related concussion and five risk factors for suicide completion. Analyses controlled for sex, race/ethnicity, grade, bullying victimization, and sexual orientation. Subsample analyses were conducted stratified by sex. Interaction models examined biological sex as a possible effect modifier. RESULTS: Overall, 15.0% of high school students reported a sports-related concussion in the past 12-months. Self-reported, sports-related concussion was significantly associated with greater odds of feeling sad/hopeless (Adj OR: 1.20; 95% CI:1.02-1.42), suicidal ideations (Adj OR: 1.25; 95% CI:1.02-1.55), suicide attempt (Adj OR: 1.60; 95% CI:1.31-1.96), and suicide attempt treated by a doctor/nurse (Adj OR: 2.35; 95% CI:1.68-3.29), adjusting for covariates. Stratified analyses demonstrated differences by sex, however, no direct evidence of effect modification was observed in interaction models. LIMITATIONS: Data are cross-sectional, prohibiting causal inferences. Measures were assessed via self-report. No pre-concussion measures of mental health. CONCLUSION: Self-reported sports-related concussion was associated with risk factors for suicide completion. No direct evidence of effect modification was observed but stratified analyses suggest biological sex may impact the observed relationship. ",
        "Statin administration activates system xC- in skeletal muscle: a potential mechanism explaining statin-induced muscle pain. Statins are a cholesterol-lowering drug class that significantly reduce cardiovascular disease risk. Despite their safety and effectiveness, musculoskeletal side-effects, particularly myalgia, are prominent and the most common reason for discontinuance. The cause of statin-induced myalgia is unknown, so defining the underlying mechanism(s) and potential therapeutic strategies is of clinical importance. Here we tested the hypothesis that statin administration activates skeletal muscle system xC-, a cystine/glutamate antiporter, to increase intracellular cysteine and therefore glutathione synthesis to attenuate statin-induced oxidative stress. Increased system xC- activity would increase interstitial glutamate; an amino acid associated with peripheral nociception. Consistent with our hypothesis, atorvastatin treatment significantly increased mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS; 41%) and glutamate efflux (up to 122%) in C2C12 mouse skeletal muscle myotubes. Statin-induced glutamate efflux was confirmed to be the result of system xC- activation, as cotreatment with sulfasalazine (system xC- inhibitor) negated this rise in extracellular glutamate. These findings were reproduced in primary human myotubes but, consistent with being muscle-specific, were not observed in primary human dermal fibroblasts. To further demonstrate that statin-induced increases in ROS triggered glutamate efflux, C2C12 myotubes were cotreated with atorvastatin and various antioxidants. \u03b1-Tocopherol and cysteamine bitartrate reversed the increase in statin-induced glutamate efflux, bringing glutamate levels between 50 and 92% of control-treated levels. N-acetylcysteine (a system xC- substrate) increased glutamate efflux above statin treatment alone: up to 732% greater than control treatment. Taken together, we provide a mechanistic foundation for statin-induced myalgia and offer therapeutic insights to alleviate this particular statin-associated side-effect. ",
        "Intravascular Polarimetry in Patients With Coronary Artery Disease. OBJECTIVES: The aims of this first-in-human pilot study of intravascular polarimetry were to investigate polarization properties of coronary plaques in patients and to examine the relationship of these features with established structural characteristics available to conventional optical frequency domain imaging (OFDI) and with clinical presentation. BACKGROUND: Polarization-sensitive OFDI measures birefringence and depolarization of tissue together with conventional cross-sectional optical frequency domain images of subsurface microstructure. METHODS: Thirty patients undergoing polarization-sensitive OFDI (acute coronary syndrome, n\u00a0=\u00a012; stable angina pectoris, n\u00a0=\u00a018) participated in this study. Three hundred forty-two cross-sectional images evenly distributed along all imaged coronary arteries were classified into 1 of 7 plaque categories according to conventional OFDI. Polarization features averaged over the entire intimal area of each cross section were compared among plaque types and with structural parameters. Furthermore, the polarization properties in cross sections (n\u00a0=\u00a0244) of the fibrous caps of acute coronary syndrome and stable angina pectoris culprit lesions were assessed and compared with structural features using a generalized linear model. RESULTS: The median birefringence and depolarization showed statistically significant differences among plaque types (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001 for both, one-way analysis of variance). Depolarization differed significantly among individual plaque types (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05), except between normal arteries and fibrous plaques and between fibrofatty and fibrocalcified plaques. Caps of acute coronary syndrome lesions and ruptured caps exhibited lower birefringence than caps of stable angina pectoris lesions (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01). In addition to clinical presentation, cap birefringence was also associated with macrophage accumulation as assessed using normalized SD. CONCLUSIONS: Intravascular polarimetry provides quantitative metrics that help characterize coronary arterial tissues and may offer refined insight into coronary arterial atherosclerotic lesions in patients.

        "Short- and Long-Term Effects of Cannabis on Headache and Migraine. Use of cannabis to alleviate headache and migraine is relatively common, yet research on its effectiveness remains sparse. We sought to determine whether inhalation of cannabis decreases headache and migraine ratings as well as whether gender, type of cannabis (concentrate vs. flower), THC, CBD, or dose contribute to changes in these ratings. Finally, we explored evidence for tolerance to these effects. Archival data were obtained from StrainprintTM, a medical cannabis app that allows patients to track symptoms before and after using different strains and doses of cannabis. Latent change score models and multilevel models were used to analyze data from 12,293 sessions where cannabis was used to treat headache and 7,441 sessions where cannabis was used to treat migraine. There were significant reductions in headache and migraine ratings after cannabis use. Men reported larger reductions in headache than women and use of concentrates was associated with larger reductions in headache than flower. Further, there was evidence of tolerance to these effects. Perspective: Inhaled cannabis reduces self-reported headache and migraine severity by approximately 50%. However, its effectiveness appears to diminish across time and patients appear to use larger doses across time, suggesting tolerance to these effects may develop with continued use. ",

These variants showed replicative abilities and pathogenicity that is similar to those of wild-type isolates in hamsters; they also transmitted efficiently between ferrets by respiratory droplets. ",
        "CRISPR/Cas13a-Powered Electrochemical Microfluidic Biosensor for Nucleic Acid Amplification-Free miRNA Diagnostics. Noncoding small RNAs, such as microRNAs, are becoming the biomarkers of choice for multiple diseases in clinical diagnostics. A dysregulation of these microRNAs can be associated with many different diseases, such as cancer, dementia, and cardiovascular conditions. The key for effective treatment is an accurate initial diagnosis at an early stage, improving the patient's survival chances. In this work, the first clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas13a-powered microfluidic, integrated electrochemical biosensor for the on-site detection of microRNAs is introduced. Through this unique combination, the quantification of the potential tumor markers microRNA miR-19b and miR-20a is realized without any nucleic acid amplification. With a readout time of 9 min and an overall process time of less than 4 h, a limit of detection of 10 pm is achieved, using a measuring volume of less than 0.6 \u00b5L. Furthermore, the feasibility of the biosensor platform to detect miR-19b in serum samples of children, suffering from brain cancer, is demonstrated. The validation of the obtained results with a standard quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction method shows the ability of the electrochemical CRISPR-powered system to be a low-cost, easily scalable, and target amplification-free tool for nucleic acid based diagnostics.

        "A single-cell atlas of entorhinal cortex from individuals with Alzheimer's disease reveals cell-type-specific gene expression regulation. There is currently little information available about how individual cell types contribute to Alzheimer's disease. Here we applied single-nucleus RNA sequencing to entorhinal cortex samples from control and Alzheimer's disease brains (n\u2009=\u20096 per group), yielding a total of 13,214 high-quality nuclei. We detail cell-type-specific gene expression patterns, unveiling how transcriptional changes in specific cell subpopulations are associated with Alzheimer's disease. We report that the Alzheimer's disease risk gene APOE is specifically repressed in Alzheimer's disease oligodendrocyte progenitor cells and astrocyte subpopulations and upregulated in an Alzheimer's disease-specific microglial subopulation. Integrating transcription factor regulatory modules with Alzheimer's disease risk loci revealed drivers of cell-type-specific state transitions towards Alzheimer's disease. For example, transcription factor EB, a master regulator of lysosomal function, regulates multiple disease genes in a specific Alzheimer's disease astrocyte subpopulation. These results provide insights into the coordinated control of Alzheimer's disease risk genes and their cell-type-specific contribution to disease susceptibility.

        "Unsupervised identification of the internal states that shape natural behavior. Internal states shape stimulus responses and decision-making, but we lack methods to identify them. To address this gap, we developed an unsupervised method to identify internal states from behavioral data and applied it to a dynamic social interaction. During courtship, Drosophila melanogaster males pattern their songs using feedback cues from their partner. Our model uncovers three latent states underlying this behavior and is able to predict moment-to-moment variation in song-patterning decisions. These states correspond to different sensorimotor strategies, each of which is characterized by different mappings from feedback cues to song modes. We show that a pair of neurons previously thought to be command neurons for song production are sufficient to drive switching between states. Our results reveal how animals compose behavior from previously unidentified internal states, which is a necessary step for quantitative descriptions of animal behavior that link environmental cues, internal needs, neuronal activity and motor outputs.

        "Physician Perspectives on Deprescribing Cardiovascular Medications for Older Adults. BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Guideline-based management of cardiovascular disease often involves prescribing multiple medications, which contributes to polypharmacy and risk for adverse drug events in older adults. Deprescribing is a potential strategy to mitigate these risks. We sought to characterize and compare clinician perspectives regarding deprescribing cardiovascular medications across three specialties. DESIGN: National cross-sectional survey. SETTING: Ambulatory. PARTICIPANTS: Random sample of geriatricians, general internists, and cardiologists from the American College of Physicians. MEASUREMENTS: Electronic survey assessing clinical practice of deprescribing cardiovascular medications, reasons and barriers to deprescribing, and choice of medications to deprescribe in hypothetical clinical cases. RESULTS: In each specialty, 750 physicians were surveyed, with a response rate of 26% for geriatricians, 26% for general internists, and 12% for cardiologists. Over 80% of respondents within each specialty reported that they had recently considered deprescribing a cardiovascular medication. Adverse drug reactions were the most common reason for deprescribing for all specialties. Geriatricians also commonly reported deprescribing in the setting of limited life expectancy. Barriers to deprescribing were shared across specialties and included concerns about interfering with other physicians' treatment plans and patient reluctance. In hypothetical cases, over 90% of physicians in each specialty chose to deprescribe when patients experienced adverse drug reactions. Geriatricians were most likely and cardiologists were least likely to consider deprescribing cardiovascular medications in cases of limited life expectancy (all P\u2009<\u2009.001), such as recurrent metastatic cancer (84% of geriatricians, 68% of general internists, and 45% of cardiologists), Alzheimer dementia (92% of geriatricians, 81% of general internists, and 59% of cardiologists), or significant functional impairment (83% of geriatricians, 68% of general internists, and 45% of cardiologists). CONCLUSIONS: While barriers to deprescribing cardiovascular medications are shared across specialties, reasons for deprescribing, especially in the setting of limited life expectancy, varied. Implementing deprescribing will require improved processes for both physician-physician and physician-patient communication. J Am Geriatr Soc 68:78-86, 2019. ",
        "Extrudates of lipophilic tetracycline complexes: A new option for periodontitis therapy. The objective of this study was to develop an improved drug delivery system for the local antimicrobial treatment of periodontitis, that offers enhanced drug stability, easy application and controlled release over several weeks. Chelate complexes consisting of a tetracycline antibiotic and a fatty acid salt were developed. Minocycline and doxycycline were paired with magnesium- and calcium stearate in different molar ratios. These chelate complexes stabilize the active pharmaceutical ingredient and enable the incorporation into a PLGA (poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid)) polymer matrix via hot melt extrusion. The chelate complexes were characterized via UV/Vis- and IR-spectroscopy. A high antibiotic activity of the complex was observed in a disc diffusion test. The drug complex was mixed with different PLGA-polymers and cryomilled in advance of the extrusion. The hot melt extrusion yielded homogeneous extrudates with a diameter from 600 to 900\u202f\u00b5m. They contain 11.5% of minocycline, are adjustable in length and are easy to handle. In vitro release studies revealed a controlled release of the drug over 42\u202fdays. In conclusion, the developed extrudates are promising systems to improve the treatment of periodontitis. ",
        "An integrated health delivery platform, targeting soil-transmitted helminths (STH) and canine mediated human rabies, results in cost savings and increased breadth of treatment for STH in remote communities in Tanzania. BACKGROUND: Achieving the Sustainable Development Goal of a 90% reduction in neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) by 2030 requires innovative control strategies. This proof-of-concept study examined the effectiveness of integrating control programs for two NTDs: mass drug administration (MDA) for soil-transmitted helminths in humans and mass dog rabies vaccination (MDRV). METHODS: The study was carried out in 24 Tanzanian villages. The primary goal was to demonstrate the feasibility of integrating community-wide MDA for STH and MDRV for rabies. The objectives were to investigate the popularity, participation and cost and time savings of integrated delivery, and to investigate the reach of the MDA with respect to primary school-aged children and other community members. To implement, we randomly allocated villages for delivery of MDA and MDRV (Arm A), MDA only (Arm B) or MDRV only (Arm C). RESULTS: Community support for the integrated delivery was strong (e.g. 85% of focus group discussions concluded that it would result in people getting \"two for one\" health treatments). A high proportion of households participated in the integrated Arm A events (81.7% MDA, 80.4% MDRV), and these proportions were similar to those in Arms B and C. These findings suggest that coverage might not be reduced when interventions are integrated. Moreover, in addition to time savings, integrated delivery resulted in a 33% lower cost per deworming dose and a 16% lower cost per rabies vaccination. The median percentage of enrolled primary school children treated by this study was 76%. However, because 37% of the primary school aged children that received deworming treatment were not enrolled in school, we hypothesize that the employed strategy could reach more school-aged children than would be reached through a solely school-based delivery strategy. CONCLUSIONS: Integrated delivery platforms for health interventions can be feasible, popular, cost and time saving. The insights gained could be applicable in areas of sub-Saharan Africa that are remote or underserved by health services. These results indicate the utility of integrated One Health delivery platforms and suggest an important role in the global campaign to reduce the burden of NTDs, especially in hard-to-reach communities.

        "Increasing Frequencies of Antibiotic Resistant Non-typhoidal Salmonella Infections in Michigan and Risk Factors for Disease. Non-typhoidal Salmonella (NTS) are important enteric pathogens causing over 1 million foodborne illnesses in the U.S. annually. The widespread emergence of antibiotic resistance in NTS isolates has limited the availability of antibiotics that can be used for therapy. Since Michigan is not part of the FoodNet surveillance system, few studies have quantified antibiotic resistance frequencies and identified risk factors for NTS infections in the state. We obtained 198 clinical NTS isolates via active surveillance at four Michigan hospitals from 2011 to 2014 for classification of serovars and susceptibility to 24 antibiotics using broth microdilution. The 198 isolates belonged to 35 different serovars with Enteritidis (36.9%) predominating followed by Typhimurium (19.5%) and Newport (9.7%), though the proportion of each varied by year, residence, and season. The number of Enteritidis and Typhimurium cases was higher in the summer, while Enteritidis cases were significantly more common among urban vs. rural residents. A total of 30 (15.2%) NTS isolates were resistant to \u22651 antibiotic and 15 (7.5%) were resistant to \u22653 antimicrobial classes; a significantly greater proportion of Typhimurium isolates were resistant compared to Enteritidis isolates and an increasing trend in the frequency of tetracycline resistance and multidrug resistance was observed over the 4-year period. Resistant infections were associated with longer hospital stays as the mean stay was 5.9 days for patients with resistant isolates relative to 4.0 days for patients infected with susceptible isolates. Multinomial logistic regression indicated that infection with serovars other than Enteritidis [Odds ratio (OR): 3.8, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.23-11.82] as well as infection during the fall (OR: 3.0; 95% CI: 1.22-7.60) were independently associated with resistance. Together, these findings demonstrate the importance of surveillance, monitoring resistance frequencies, and identifying risk factors that can aid in the development of new prevention strategies. ",
        "Differential long-term regulation of TAS2R14 by structurally distinct agonists. Bitter taste receptor-14 (TAS2R14) is a GPCR also expressed on human airway smooth muscle cells, which signals to intracellular [Ca2+], resulting in relaxation of the airway, and is a novel target for bronchodilators. Here, we examine long-term, agonist-promoted down-regulation of TAS2R14 expression because tachyphylaxis would be an undesirable therapeutic characteristic. Five TAS2R structurally distinct full agonists were studied to ascertain biasing away from down-regulation. Agonist exposure for 18 h caused minimal desensitization by diphenhydramine (DPD) compared with \u223c50% desensitization with all other agonists. Agonists evoked \u03b2-arrestin recruitment to TAS2R14, which was not seen with a phosphoacceptor-deficient mutant, TAS2R14-10A. All agonists except for DPD also caused subsequent TAS2R14 internalization and trafficking via early and late endosomes to down-regulation. TAS2R14-10A failed to undergo these events with any agonist. Molecular docking showed that DPD has specific interactions deep within a binding pocket that are not observed with the other agonists, which may lock the receptor in a conformation that does not internalize and therefore does not undergo down-regulation. Thus, TAS2R14 is subject to \u03b2-arrestin-mediated internalization and subsequent down-regulation with chronic exposure to most agonists. However, by manipulating the agonist structure, biasing toward G-protein coupling but away from long-term down-regulation can be achieved.-Woo, J. A., Casta\u00f1o, M., Goss, A., Kim, D., Lewandowski, E. M., Chen, Y., Liggett, S. B. Differential long-term regulation of TAS2R14 by structurally distinct agonists. ",
        "Effects of tranexamic acid on death, disability, vascular occlusive events and other morbidities in patients with acute traumatic brain injury (CRASH-3): a randomised, placebo-controlled trial. BACKGROUND: Tranexamic acid reduces surgical bleeding and decreases mortality in patients with traumatic extracranial bleeding. Intracranial bleeding is common after traumatic brain injury (TBI) and can cause brain herniation and death. We aimed to assess the effects of tranexamic acid in patients with TBI. METHODS: This randomised, placebo-controlled trial was done in 175 hospitals in 29 countries. Adults with TBI who were within 3 h of injury, had a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 12 or lower or any intracranial bleeding on CT scan, and no major extracranial bleeding were eligible. The time window for eligibility was originally 8 h but in 2016 the protocol was changed to limit recruitment to patients within 3 h of injury. This change was made blind to the trial data, in response to external evidence suggesting that delayed treatment is unlikely to be effective. We randomly assigned (1:1) patients to receive tranexamic acid (loading dose 1 g over 10 min then infusion of 1 g over 8 h) or matching placebo. Patients were assigned by selecting a numbered treatment pack from a box containing eight packs that were identical apart from the pack number. Patients, caregivers, and those assessing outcomes were masked to allocation. The primary outcome was head injury-related death in hospital within 28 days of injury in patients treated within 3 h of injury. We prespecified a sensitivity analysis that excluded patients with a GCS score of 3 and those with bilateral unreactive pupils at baseline. All analyses were done by intention to treat. This trial was registered with ISRCTN (ISRCTN15088122), ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01402882), EudraCT (2011-003669-14), and the Pan African Clinical Trial Registry (PACTR20121000441277). RESULTS: Between July 20, 2012, and Jan 31, 2019, we randomly allocated 12\u2008737 patients with TBI to receive tranexamic acid (6406 [50\u00b73%] or placebo [6331 [49\u00b77%], of whom 9202 (72\u00b72%) patients were treated within 3 h of injury. Among patients treated within 3 h of injury, the risk of head injury-related death was 18\u00b75% in the tranexamic acid group versus 19\u00b78% in the placebo group (855 vs 892 events; risk ratio [RR] 0\u00b794 [95% CI 0\u00b786-1\u00b702]). In the prespecified sensitivity analysis that excluded patients with a GCS score of 3 or bilateral unreactive pupils at baseline, the risk of head injury-related death was 12\u00b75% in the tranexamic acid group versus 14\u00b70% in the placebo group (485 vs 525 events; RR 0\u00b789 [95% CI 0\u00b780-1\u00b700]). The risk of head injury-related death reduced with tranexamic acid in patients with mild-to-moderate head injury (RR 0\u00b778 [95% CI 0\u00b764-0\u00b795]) but not in patients with severe head injury (0\u00b799 [95% CI 0\u00b791-1\u00b707]; p value for heterogeneity 0\u00b7030). Early treatment was more effective than was later treatment in patients with mild and moderate head injury (p=0\u00b7005) but time to treatment had no obvious effect in patients with severe head injury (p=0\u00b773). The risk of vascular occlusive events was similar in the tranexamic acid and placebo groups (RR 0\u00b798 (0\u00b774-1\u00b728). The risk of seizures was also similar between groups (1\u00b709 [95% CI 0\u00b790-1\u00b733]). INTERPRETATION: Our results show that tranexamic acid is safe in patients with TBI and that treatment within 3 h of injury reduces head injury-related death. Patients should be treated as soon as possible after injury.

        "In situ characterization of nanoscale strains in loaded whole joints via synchrotron X-ray tomography. Imaging techniques for quantifying changes in the hierarchical structure of deforming joints are constrained by destructive sample treatments, sample-size restrictions and lengthy scan times. Here, we report the use of fast low-dose pink-beam synchrotron X-ray tomography in combination with mechanical loading at nanometric precision for in situ imaging, at resolutions below 100\u2009nm, of the mechanical strain in intact untreated joints under physiologically realistic conditions. We show that in young, older and osteoarthritic mice, hierarchical changes in tissue structure and mechanical behaviour can be simultaneously visualized, and that the tissue structure at the cellular level correlates with the mechanical performance of the whole joint. We also use the tomographic approach to study the colocalization of tissue strains to specific chondrocyte lacunar organizations within intact loaded joints and to explore the role of calcified-cartilage stiffness on the biomechanics of healthy and pathological joints.

        "Discovery of an antivirulence compound that reverses \u03b2-lactam resistance in MRSA. Staphylococcus aureus is the leading cause of infections worldwide, and methicillin-resistant strains (MRSA) are emerging. New strategies are urgently needed to overcome this threat. Using a cell-based screen of ~45,000 diverse synthetic compounds, we discovered a potent bioactive, MAC-545496, that reverses \u03b2-lactam resistance in the community-acquired MRSA USA300 strain. MAC-545496 could also serve as an antivirulence agent alone; it attenuates MRSA virulence in Galleria mellonella larvae. MAC-545496 inhibits biofilm formation and abrogates intracellular survival in macrophages. Mechanistic characterization revealed MAC-545496 to be a nanomolar inhibitor of GraR, a regulator that responds to cell-envelope stress and is an important virulence factor and determinant of antibiotic resistance. The small molecule discovered herein is an inhibitor of GraR function. MAC-545496 has value as a research tool to probe the GraXRS regulatory system and as an antibacterial lead series of a mechanism to combat drug-resistant Staphylococcal infections. ",
        "Safety evaluation of conditionally immortalized cells for renal replacement therapy. End-stage kidney disease represents irreversible kidney failure. Dialysis and transplantation, two main treatment options currently available, present various drawbacks and complications. Innovative cell-based therapies, such as a bioartificial kidney, have not reached the clinic yet, mostly due to safety and/or functional issues. Here, we assessed the safety of conditionally immortalized proximal tubule epithelial cells (ciPTECs) for bioartificial kidney application, by using in vitro assays and athymic nude rats. We demonstrate that these cells do not possess key properties of oncogenically transformed cells, including anchorage-independent growth, lack of contact inhibition and apoptosis-resistance. In late-passage cells we did observe complex chromosomal abnormalities favoring near-tetraploidy, indicating chromosomal instability. However, time-lapse imaging of ciPTEC-OAT1, confined to a 3D extracellular matrix (ECM)-based environment, revealed that the cells were largely non-invasive. Furthermore, we determined the viral integration sites of SV40 Large T antigen (SV40T), human telomerase (hTERT) and OAT1 (SLC22A6), the transgenes used for immortalization and cell function enhancement. All integrations sites were found to be located in the intronic regions of endogenous genes. Among these genes, early endosome antigen 1 (EEA1) involved in endocytosis, and BCL2 Like 1 (BCL2L1) known for its role in regulating apoptosis, were identified. Nevertheless, both gene products appeared to be functionally intact. Finally, after subcutaneous injection in athymic nude rats we show that ciPTEC-OAT1 lack tumorigenic and oncogenic effects in vivo, confirming the in vitro findings. Taken together, this study lays an important foundation towards bioartificial kidney (BAK) development by confirming the safety of the cell line intended for incorporation. ",
        "Stalled developmental programs at the root of pediatric brain tumors. Childhood brain tumors have suspected prenatal origins. To identify vulnerable developmental states, we generated a single-cell transcriptome atlas of >65,000 cells from embryonal pons and forebrain, two major tumor locations. We derived signatures for 191 distinct cell populations and defined the regional cellular diversity and differentiation dynamics. Projection of bulk tumor transcriptomes onto this dataset shows that WNT medulloblastomas match the rhombic lip-derived mossy fiber neuronal lineage and embryonal tumors with multilayered rosettes fully recapitulate a neuronal lineage, while group 2a/b atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumors may originate outside the neuroectoderm. Importantly, single-cell tumor profiles reveal highly defined cell hierarchies that mirror transcriptional programs of the corresponding normal lineages. Our findings identify impaired differentiation of specific neural progenitors as a common mechanism underlying these pediatric cancers and provide a rational framework for future modeling and therapeutic interventions.

        "A population-based study of cardiovascular disease mortality risk in US cancer patients. AIMS: This observational study characterized cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality risk for multiple cancer sites, with respect to the following: (i) continuous calendar year, (ii) age at diagnosis, and (iii) follow-up time after diagnosis. METHODS AND RESULTS: The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program was used to compare the US general population to 3 234 256 US cancer survivors (1973-2012). Standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) were calculated using coded cause of death from CVDs (heart disease, hypertension, cerebrovascular disease, atherosclerosis, and aortic aneurysm/dissection). Analyses were adjusted by age, race, and sex. Among 28 cancer types, 1 228 328 patients (38.0%) died from cancer and 365 689 patients (11.3%) died from CVDs. Among CVDs, 76.3% of deaths were due to heart disease. In eight cancer sites, CVD mortality risk surpassed index-cancer mortality risk in at least one calendar year. Cardiovascular disease mortality risk was highest in survivors diagnosed at <35\u2009years of age. Further, CVD mortality risk is highest (SMR 3.93, 95% confidence interval 3.89-3.97) within the first year after cancer diagnosis, and CVD mortality risk remains elevated throughout follow-up compared to the general population. CONCLUSION: The majority of deaths from CVD occur in patients diagnosed with breast, prostate, or bladder cancer. We observed that from the point of cancer diagnosis forward into survivorship cancer patients (all sites) are at elevated risk of dying from CVDs compared to the general US population. In endometrial cancer, the first year after diagnosis poses a very high risk of dying from CVDs, supporting early involvement of cardiologists in such patients. ",
        "The Leukemogenic TCF3-HLF Complex Rewires Enhancers Driving Cellular Identity and Self-Renewal Conferring EP300 Vulnerability. The chimeric transcription factor TCF3-HLF defines an incurable acute lymphoblastic leukemia subtype. Here we decipher the regulome of endogenous TCF3-HLF and dissect its essential transcriptional components and targets by functional genomics. We demonstrate that TCF3-HLF recruits HLF binding sites at hematopoietic stem cell/myeloid lineage associated (super-) enhancers to drive lineage identity and self-renewal. Among direct targets, hijacking an HLF binding site in a MYC enhancer cluster by TCF3-HLF activates a conserved MYC-driven transformation program crucial for leukemia propagation in\u00a0vivo. TCF3-HLF pioneers the cooperation with ERG and recruits histone acetyltransferase p300 (EP300), conferring susceptibility to EP300 inhibition. Our study provides a framework for targeting driving transcriptional dependencies in this fatal leukemia. ",
        "Association of Trajectory and Covariates of Children's Screen Media Time. Importance: Many children begin interacting with screen media as early as infancy. Although screen time is associated with negative developmental consequences, few longitudinal studies in the United States have examined covariates of screen time among children under 3 years of age. Objectives: To identify trajectories of screen time among children aged 1 to 3 years, to examine their association with screen use at 8 years of age, and to assess potential determinants of screen time. Design, Setting, and Participants: This prospective birth cohort study included 3895 children (3083 singletons and 812 unrelated multiples) in New York State who had screen time data available for at least 1 time point from 1 to 3 years of age; 1156 children had data at 8 years. The study spanned September 4, 2007, through June 12, 2014, in the first phase, and August 29, 2014, through November 15, 2019, in the second phase. Data analysis for the present study was conducted from September 28, 2018, to July 15, 2019. Main Outcomes and Measures: Maternal reports of children's television, movie, and computer game times were summed for total daily screen time at 12, 18, 24, 30, and 36 months of age. Two screen time trajectories (low and increasing use) were classified by cluster analysis, and logistic regression was used to model risk factors for the increasing trajectory. Children exhibiting the highest 10th percentile of screen use at each point were examined, and linear mixed models were used to identify risk factors of this high exposure category. Results: Among the 3895 children included in the analysis (2031 boys [52.1%] and 1864 girls [47.9%]), median daily screen time increased from 30 (interquartile range, 0-60) minutes at 12 months of age to 120 (interquartile range, 75-200) minutes at 36 months of age. Of 1045 children with complete data at all 5 time points, 279 (26.7%) had an increasing screen time trajectory. Female child sex (adjusted odds ratio [aOR],\u20090.90; 95% CI, 0.81-0.99) and graduate school levels of paternal (aOR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.56-0.95) and maternal (aOR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.47-0.77) education, compared with having completed college, were associated with lower risk of increasing trajectory. Maternal nulliparity was associated with higher risk of increasing trajectory (aOR, 1.14; 95% CI, 1.00-1.30). Children with an increasing trajectory from 1 to 3 years of age had an additional 22 (95% CI, 11-33) minutes per day of screen time at 8 years of age. Covariates associated with the highest 10th percentile of screen exposure included paterman graduate school education compared with college (aOR,\u20090.63; 95% CI, 0.39-0.99), maternal graduate school education compared with college (aOR, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.37-0.82), maternal nulliparity (aOR, 1.98; 95% CI, 1.50-2.61), twins compared with singletons (aOR, 1.41; 95% CI, 1.05-1.91), non-Hispanic black compared with non-Hispanic white race/ethnicity (aOR, 4.77; 95% CI, 2.25-10.10), and type of care (home-based care aOR, 2.17 [95% CI, 1.38-3.41]; parental care aOR, 2.11 [95% CI, 1.41-3.15]) compared with center-based care. Conclusions and Relevance: These findings suggest that a range of parental and child characteristics are associated with screen time. Screen time habits appear to track from as early as infancy, emphasizing the need for earlier interventions. ",
        "Secretome of pleural effusions associated with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and malignant mesothelioma: therapeutic implications. INTRODUCTION: We compared the secretome of metastatic (non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)) and primary (mesothelioma) malignant pleural effusions, benign effusions and the published plasma profile of patients receiving chimeric antigen receptor T cells (CAR-T), to determine factors unique to neoplasia in pleural effusion (PE) and those accompanying an efficacious peripheral anti-tumor immune response. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cryopreserved cell-free PE fluid from 101 NSCLC patients, 8 mesothelioma and 13 with benign PE was assayed for a panel of 40 cytokines/chemokines using the Luminex system. RESULTS: Profiles of benign and malignant PE were dominated by high concentrations of sIL-6R\u03b1, CCL2/MCP1, CXCL10/IP10, IL-6, TGF\u03b21, CCL22/MDC, CXCL8/IL-8 and IL-10. Malignant PE contained significantly higher (p < 0.01, Bonferroni-corrected) concentrations of MIP1\u03b2, CCL22/MDC, CX3CL1/fractalkine, IFN\u03b12, IFN\u03b3, VEGF, IL-1\u03b1 and FGF2. When grouped by function, mesothelioma PE had lower effector cytokines than NSCLC PE. Comparing NSCLC PE and published plasma levels of CAR-T recipients, both were dominated by sIL-6R\u03b1 and IL-6 but NSCLC PE had more VEGF, FGF2 and TNF\u03b1, and less IL-2, IL-4, IL-13, IL-15, MIP1\u03b1 and IFN\u03b3. CONCLUSIONS: An immunosuppressive, wound-healing environment characterizes both benign and malignant PE. A dampened effector response (IFN\u03b12, IFN\u03b3, MIP1\u03b1, TNF\u03b1 and TNF\u03b2) was detected in NSCLC PE, but not mesothelioma or benign PE. The data indicate that immune effectors are present in NSCLC PE and suggest that the IL-6/sIL-6R\u03b1 axis is a central driver of the immunosuppressive, tumor-supportive pleural environment. A combination localized antibody-based immunotherapy with or without cellular therapy may be justified in this uniformly fatal condition. ",

Recent data suggest that allergen-specific IgE levels in serum of allergic patients are sustained by two different mechanisms: inducible IgE production through allergen exposure, and continuous IgE production occurring even in the absence of allergen stimulus that maintains IgE levels. This assumption is supported by two observations. First, allergen exposure induces transient increases of systemic IgE production. Second, reduction in IgE levels upon depletion of IgE from the blood of allergic patients using immunoapheresis is only temporary and IgE levels quickly return to pre-treatment levels even in the absence of allergen exposure. Though IgE production has been observed in the peripheral blood and locally in various human tissues (e.g., nose, lung, spleen, bone marrow), the origin and main sites of IgE production in humans remain unknown. Furthermore, IgE-producing cells in humans have yet to be fully characterized. Capturing IgE-producing cells is challenging not only because current staining technologies are inadequate, but also because the cells are rare, they are difficult to discriminate from cells bearing IgE bound to IgE-receptors, and plasma cells express little IgE on their surface. However, due to the central role in mediating both the early and late phases of allergy, free IgE, IgE-bearing effector cells and IgE-producing cells are important therapeutic targets. Here, we discuss current knowledge and unanswered questions regarding IgE production in allergic patients as well as possible therapeutic approaches targeting IgE. ",
        "A comparison of thermographic characteristics of the hands and wrists of rheumatoid arthritis patients and healthy controls. Thermal imaging has been applied to detect possible temperature variations in various rheumatic disorders. This study sought to determine whether rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients without active synovitis in their hands exhibit different baseline thermographic patterns of the fingers and palms when compared to healthy individuals. Data from 31 RA patients were compared to that of 51 healthy controls. The RA patients were recruited upon confirmed absence of synovitis by clinical examination and musculoskeletal ultrasound. Participants underwent medical infrared imaging of the regions of interest (ROIs). Significant differences were found between the mean temperatures of the palm regions (29.37\u2009\u00b0C (SD2.2); n\u2009=\u2009306) and fingers (27.16\u2009\u00b0C (SD3.2); n\u2009=\u2009510) of the healthy participants when compared to the palm regions (31.4(SD1.84)\u00b0C; n\u2009=\u2009186) and fingers (30.22\u2009\u00b0C (SD2.4); n\u2009=\u2009299) of their RA counterparts (p\u2009=\u20090.001), with the latter group exhibiting higher temperatures in all ROIs. Logistic regression models confirm that both palm and finger temperature increase significantly in RA without active inflammation. These innovative findings provide evidence that baseline thermal data in RA differs significantly from healthy individuals. Thermal imaging may have the potential to become an adjunct assessment method of disease activity in patients with RA. ",
        "IL6 receptor358Ala variant and trans-signaling are disease modifiers in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) inheriting the common interleukin 6 receptor (IL6R) coding variant (Asp358Ala, rs2228145, C allele) have associated increases in interleukin 6 (IL6) and IL6R levels in serum and CSF and faster disease progression than noncarriers. METHODS: An observational, case-control study of paired serum and CSF of 47 patients with ALS, 46 healthy, and 23 neurologic disease controls from the Northeastern ALS Consortium Biofluid Repository (cohort 1) was performed to determine serum levels of IL6, sIL6R, and soluble glycoprotein 130 and compared across groups and IL6R genotype. Clinical data regarding disease progression from a separate cohort of 35 patients with ALS from the Wake Forest ALS Center (cohort 2) were used to determine change in ALSFRS-R scores by genotype. RESULTS: Patients with ALS had increased CSF IL6 levels compared with healthy (p < 0.001) and neurologic (p = 0.021) controls. Patients with ALS also had increased serum IL6 compared with healthy (p = 0.040) but not neurologic controls. Additive allelic increases in serum IL6R were observed in all groups (average increase of 52% with the presence of the IL6R C allele; p < 0.001). However, only subjects with ALS had significantly increased CSF sIL6R levels compared with controls (p < 0.001). When compared across genotypes, only patients with ALS inheriting the IL6R C allele exhibit increased CSF IL6. ALSFRS-R scores decreased more in patients with ALS with the IL6R C allele than in those without (p = 0.019). CONCLUSIONS: Theses results suggest that for individuals inheriting the IL6R C allele, the cytokine exerts a disease- and location-specific role in ALS. Follow-up, prospective studies are necessary, as this subgroup of patients may be identified as ideally responsive to IL6 receptor-blocking therapies. ",
        "A prospective study of holiday weight gain. BACKGROUND: It is commonly asserted that the average American gains 5 lb (2.3 kg) or more over the holiday period between Thanksgiving and New Year's Day, yet few data support this statement. METHODS: To estimate actual holiday-related weight variation, we measured body weight in a convenience sample of 195 adults. The subjects were weighed four times at intervals of six to eight weeks, so that weight change was determined for three periods: preholiday (from late September or early October to mid-November), holiday (from mid-November to early or mid-January), and postholiday (from early or mid-January to late February or early March). A final measurement of body weight was obtained in 165 subjects the following September or October. Data on other vital signs and self-reported health measures were obtained from the patients in order to mask the main outcome of interest. RESULTS: The mean (+/-SD) weight increased significantly during the holiday period (gain, 0.37+/-1.52 kg; P<0.001), but not during the preholiday period (gain, 0.18+/-1.49 kg; P=0.09) or the postholiday period (loss, 0.07+/-1.14 kg; P=0.36). As compared with their weight in late September or early October, the study subjects had an average net weight gain of 0.48+/-2.22 kg in late February or March (P=0.003). Between February or March and the next September or early October, there was no significant additional change in weight (gain, 0.21 kg+/-2.3 kg; P=0.13) for the 165 participants who returned for follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: The average holiday weight gain is less than commonly asserted. Since this gain is not reversed during the spring or summer months, the net 0.48-kg weight gain in the fall and winter probably contributes to the increase in body weight that frequently occurs during adulthood.

        "Prefrontal and posterior parietal contributions to the perceptual awareness of touch. Which brain regions contribute to the perceptual awareness of touch remains largely unclear. We collected structural magnetic resonance imaging scans and neurological examination reports of 70 patients with brain injuries or stroke in S1 extending into adjacent parietal, temporal or pre-/frontal regions. We applied voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping to identify brain areas that overlap with an impaired touch perception (i.e., hypoesthesia). As expected, patients with hypoesthesia (n\u2009=\u200943) presented lesions in all Brodmann areas in S1 on postcentral gyrus (BA 1, 2, 3a, 3b). At the anterior border to BA 3b, we additionally identified motor area BA 4p in association with hypoesthesia, as well as further ventrally the ventral premotor cortex (BA 6, BA 44), assumed to be involved in whole-body perception. At the posterior border to S1, we found hypoesthesia associated effects in attention-related areas such as the inferior parietal lobe and intraparietal sulcus. Downstream to S1, we replicated previously reported lesion-hypoesthesia associations in the parietal operculum and insular cortex (i.e., ventral pathway of somatosensory processing). The present findings extend this pathway from S1 to the insular cortex by prefrontal and posterior parietal areas involved in multisensory integration and attention processes. ",
        "Mortality After Invasive Second Breast Cancers Following Prior Radiotherapy for DCIS. BACKGROUND: Women with a history of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) are at increased risk for developing a second breast cancer (SBC). A prior meta-analysis of randomized studies of radiotherapy (RT) for DCIS has shown a trend toward increased breast cancer-specific mortality after SBC, but it did not have the power needed to detect a significant difference, due to a limited number of recurrences. This study sought to evaluate the impact of RT for DCIS on mortality after SBC in a larger cohort. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Using the SEER database, 3,407 patients were identified who received breast-conserving therapy with or without RT for primary DCIS in 2000 through 2013 and subsequently developed a stage I-III invasive SBC within the same time period. Fine-Gray competing risk models were used to study the association between receipt of RT and mortality after SBC. RESULTS: Prior RT was found to be associated with higher rates of breast cancer-specific mortality (hazard ratio [HR], 1.70; 95% CI, 1.18-2.45; P=.005), even after controlling for cancer stage. Interaction analysis suggested that this risk trended higher in patients with ipsilateral versus contralateral SBC (HR, 2.07 vs 1.26; P=.16). Furthermore, compared with patients who developed contralateral SBC, those with ipsilateral SBC were younger (P<.001) and more often lacked estrogen receptor expression (P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: Patients who previously received RT for DCIS had higher mortality after developing an invasive SBC than those who did not receive RT. This finding may have implications for initial treatment decisions in the management of DCIS. ",
        "A new perspective on fungal metabolites: identification of bioactive compounds from fungi using zebrafish embryogenesis as read-out. There is a constant need for new therapeutic compounds. Fungi have proven to be an excellent, but underexplored source for biologically active compounds with therapeutic potential. Here, we combine mycology, embryology and chemistry by testing secondary metabolites from more than 10,000 species of fungi for biological activity using developing zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos. Zebrafish development is an excellent model for high-throughput screening. Development is rapid, multiple cell types are assessed simultaneously and embryos are available in high numbers. We found that 1,526 fungal strains produced secondary metabolites with biological activity in the zebrafish bioassay. The active compounds from 39 selected fungi were purified by liquid-liquid extraction and preparative HPLC. 34 compounds were identified by a combination of chemical analyses, including LCMS, UV-Vis spectroscopy/ spectrophotometry, high resolution mass spectrometry and NMR. Our results demonstrate that fungi express a wide variety of biologically active compounds, consisting of both known therapeutic compounds as well as relatively unexplored compounds. Understanding their biological activity in zebrafish may provide insight into underlying biological processes as well as mode of action. Together, this information may provide the first step towards lead compound development for therapeutic drug development. ",
        "Aerosol Gas-Phase Components from Cannabis E-Cigarettes and Dabbing: Mechanistic Insight and Quantitative Risk Analysis. Consumption of cannabis by nontraditional methods has surged since the advent of legalization in North America and worldwide. Inhaling cannabis extracts using vaporizers and via dabbing has risen in popularity, while concerns over product safety have not hindered their proliferation. The work herein is the first step toward assessing the safety of vaporizing and dabbing concentrated cannabis extracts as a function of gas-phase reaction products. The gas-phase thermal degradants of \u03949-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) have not been previously investigated. It was found that users may be exposed to concerning degradants such as methacrolein, benzene, and methyl vinyl ketone when using cartridge vaporizers and dabbing. It was shown that THC alone and mixed with terpenes generated similar degradation products and, most notably, elevated levels of isoprene. Importantly, it was shown that added terpenes led to higher levels of gas-phase products compared to THC alone. To estimate cancer and noncancer risks associated with exposure to these and other degradants, quantitative risk assessment was applied to experimentally determined values for dabbing and vaping and literature-sourced levels of hazardous components in cannabis smoke. Overall, gas-phase aerosol products had significantly lower values in dabbing and vaporizing compared to cannabis smoking, although these results should be interpreted in light of potential variations in degradant levels due to disparate usage patterns and the dangers of the higher aerosol concentration of THC.

        "Perceived discrimination in addiction recovery: Assessing the prevalence, nature, and correlates using a novel measure in a U.S. National sample. BACKGROUND: Alcohol and other drug (AOD) problems are among the most stigmatized conditions globally diminishing help-seeking due to fear of discrimination. Discrimination is common also among people already in AOD recovery, but little is known about the prevalence and nature of perceived discrimination. Greater knowledge would inform treatment and policy. METHOD: Nationally representative cross-sectional sample of U.S. adults who reported resolving an AOD problem (final weighted sample n\u2009=\u20092002). Participants were asked, \"Since resolving your problem with alcohol or drugs, how frequently have the following occurred because someone knew about your alcohol or drug history?\". MEASURES: Item response models yielded two types of discrimination: 1. Micro discrimination (personal slights) 2. Macro discrimination (violations of personal rights); psychological distress, quality of life, and recovery capital. RESULTS: About one quarter of participants reported some type of micro discrimination (e.g., held to a higher standard) with slightly less reporting a violation of personal rights (e.g., couldn't get a job). After adjusting for addiction severity and years since problem resolution, greater micro and macro discrimination were associated with higher psychological distress (\u03b2\u2009=\u2009.45, 95% CI\u2009=\u2009.35,.55 and \u03b2\u2009=\u2009.59, 95% CI\u2009=\u2009.45,.73), lower quality of life (\u03b2 =-.41, 95% CI=-.57,-.26 and \u03b2 =-.49, 95% CI=-.76,-.21) and recovery capital (\u03b2 =-.33, 95% CI=-.54,-.12 and \u03b2 =-.68, 95% CI=-.97,-.40) respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Despite being in recovery, different types of discrimination are experienced. These are associated with increased distress, and lower quality of life and recovery capital. Prospective studies are needed to help clarify the exact nature and impact of such discrimination on AOD problem recurrence. ",
        "Perturbations in imprinted methylation from assisted reproductive technologies but not advanced maternal age in mouse preimplantation embryos. BACKGROUND: Over the last several decades, the average age of first-time mothers has risen steadily. With increasing maternal age comes a decrease in fertility, which in turn has led to an increase in the use of assisted reproductive technologies by these women. Assisted reproductive technologies (ARTs), including superovulation and embryo culture, have been shown separately to alter imprinted DNA methylation maintenance in blastocysts. However, there has been little investigation on the effects of advanced maternal age, with or without ARTs, on genomic imprinting. We hypothesized that ARTs and advanced maternal age, separately and together, alter imprinted methylation in mouse preimplantation embryos. For this study, we examined imprinted methylation at three genes, Snrpn, Kcnq1ot1, and H19, which in humans are linked to ART-associated methylation errors that lead to imprinting disorders. RESULTS: Our data showed that imprinted methylation acquisition in oocytes was unaffected by increasing maternal age. Furthermore, imprinted methylation was normally acquired when advanced maternal age was combined with superovulation. Analysis of blastocyst-stage embryos revealed that imprinted methylation maintenance was also not affected by increasing maternal age. In a comparison of ARTs, we observed that the frequency of blastocysts with imprinted methylation loss was similar between the superovulation only and the embryo culture only groups, while the combination of superovulation and embryo culture resulted in a higher frequency of mouse blastocysts with maternal imprinted methylation perturbations than superovulation alone. Finally, the combination of increasing maternal age with ARTs had no additional effect on the frequency of imprinted methylation errors. CONCLUSION: Collectively, increasing maternal age with or without superovulation had no effect of imprinted methylation acquisition at Snrpn, Kcnq1ot1, and H19 in oocytes. Furthermore, during preimplantation development, while ARTs generated perturbations in imprinted methylation maintenance in blastocysts, advanced maternal age did not increase the burden of imprinted methylation errors at Snrpn, Kcnq1ot1, and H19 when combined with ARTs. These results provide cautious optimism that advanced maternal age is not a contributing factor to imprinted methylation errors in embryos produced in the clinic. Furthermore, our data on the effects of ARTs strengthen the need to advance clinical methods to reduce imprinted methylation errors in in vitro-produced embryos. ",
        "Ketamine can reduce harmful drinking by pharmacologically rewriting drinking memories. Maladaptive reward memories (MRMs) are involved in the development and maintenance of acquired overconsumption disorders, such as harmful alcohol and drug use. The process of memory reconsolidation - where stored memories become briefly labile upon retrieval - may offer a means to disrupt MRMs and prevent relapse. However, reliable means for pharmacologically weakening MRMs in humans remain elusive. Here we demonstrate that the N-methyl D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonist ketamine is able to disrupt MRMs in hazardous drinkers when administered immediately after their retrieval. MRM retrieval\u2009+\u2009ketamine (RET\u2009+\u2009KET) effectively reduced the reinforcing effects of alcohol and long-term drinking levels, compared to ketamine or retrieval alone. Blood concentrations of ketamine and its metabolites during the critical 'reconsolidation window' predicted beneficial changes only following MRM reactivation. Pharmacological reconsolidation interference may provide a means to rapidly rewrite maladaptive memory and should be further pursued in alcohol and drug use disorders. ",
        "Improvements in Metabolic Syndrome by Xanthohumol Derivatives Are Linked to Altered Gut Microbiota and Bile Acid Metabolism. SCOPE: Two hydrogenated xanthohumol (XN) derivatives, \u03b1,\u03b2-dihydro-XN (DXN) and tetrahydro-XN (TXN), improved parameters of metabolic syndrome (MetS), a critical risk factor of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and type 2 diabetes, in a diet-induced obese murine model. It is hypothesized that improvements in obesity and MetS are linked to changes in composition of the gut microbiota, bile acid metabolism, intestinal barrier function, and inflammation. METHODS AND RESULTS: To test this hypothesis, 16S rRNA genes were sequenced and bile acids were measured in fecal samples from C57BL/6J mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD) or HFD containing XN, DXN or TXN. Expression of genes associated with epithelial barrier function, inflammation, and bile acid metabolism were measured in the colon, white adipose tissue (WAT), and liver, respectively. Administration of XN derivatives decreases intestinal microbiota diversity and abundance-specifically Bacteroidetes and Tenericutes-alters bile acid metabolism, and reduces inflammation. In WAT, TXN supplementation decreases pro-inflammatory gene expression by suppressing macrophage infiltration. Transkingdom network analysis connects changes in the microbiota to improvements in MetS in the host. CONCLUSION: Changes in the gut microbiota and bile acid metabolism may explain, in part, the improvements in obesity and MetS associated with administration of XN and its derivatives. ",
        "Neuronal maturation reduces the type I IFN response to orthobunyavirus infection and leads to increased apoptosis of human neurons. BACKGROUND: La Crosse virus (LACV) is the leading cause of pediatric arboviral encephalitis in the USA. LACV encephalitis can result in learning and memory deficits, which may be due to infection and apoptosis of neurons in the brain. Despite neurons being the primary cell infected in the brain by LACV, little is known about neuronal responses to infection. METHODS: Human cerebral organoids (COs), which contain a spectrum of developing neurons, were used to examine neuronal responses to LACV. Plaque assay and quantitative reverse transcription (qRT)\u00a0PCR were used to determine the susceptibility of COs to LACV infection. Immunohistochemistry, flow cytometry, and single-cell transcriptomics were used to determine specific neuronal subpopulation responses to the virus. RESULTS: Overall, LACV readily infected COs causing reduced cell viability and increased apoptosis. However, it was determined that neurons at different stages of development had distinct responses to LACV. Both neural progenitors and committed neurons were infected with LACV, however, committed neurons underwent apoptosis at a higher rate. Transcriptomic analysis showed that committed neurons expressed fewer interferon (IFN)-stimulated genes (ISGs) and genes involved IFN signaling in response to infection compared to neural progenitors. Furthermore, induction of interferon signaling in LACV-infected COs by application of recombinant IFN enhanced cell viability. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that neuronal maturation increases the susceptibility of neurons to LACV-induced apoptosis. This susceptibility is likely due, at least in part, to mature neurons being less responsive to virus-induced IFN as evidenced by their poor ISG response to LACV. Furthermore, exogenous administration of recombinant IFN to LACV COs rescued cellular viability suggesting that increased IFN signaling is overall protective in this complex neural tissue. Together these findings indicate that induction of IFN signaling in developing neurons is an important deciding factor in virus-induced cell death. ",
        "Activation of pruritogenic TGR5, MrgprA3, and MrgprC11 on colon-innervating afferents induces visceral hypersensitivity. Itch induces scratching that removes irritants from the skin, whereas pain initiates withdrawal or avoidance of tissue damage. While pain arises from both the skin and viscera, we investigated whether pruritogenic irritant mechanisms also function within visceral pathways. We show that subsets of colon-innervating sensory neurons in mice express, either individually or in combination, the pruritogenic receptors Tgr5 and the Mas-gene-related GPCRs Mrgpra3 and Mrgprc11. Agonists of these receptors activated subsets of colonic sensory neurons and evoked colonic afferent mechanical hypersensitivity via a TRPA1-dependent mechanism. In vivo intracolonic administration of individual TGR5, MrgprA3, or MrgprC11 agonists induced pronounced visceral hypersensitivity to colorectal distension. Coadministration of these agonists as an \"itch cocktail\" augmented hypersensitivity to colorectal distension and changed mouse behavior. These irritant mechanisms were maintained and enhanced in a model of chronic visceral hypersensitivity relevant to irritable bowel syndrome. Neurons from human dorsal root ganglia also expressed TGR5, as well as the human ortholog MrgprX1, and showed increased responsiveness to pruritogenic agonists in pathological states. These data support the existence of an irritant-sensing system in the colon that is a visceral representation of the itch pathways found in skin, thereby contributing to sensory disturbances accompanying common intestinal disorders.

        "Therapeutic inhibition of Mcl-1 blocks cell survival in estrogen receptor-positive breast cancers. Cancers often overexpress anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins for cell death evasion, a recognized hallmark of cancer progression. While estrogen receptor (ER)-\u03b1+ breast cancers express high levels of three anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members (Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Mcl-1), pharmacological inhibition of Bcl-2 and/or Bcl-xL fails to induce cell death in ER\u03b1+ breast cancer cell lines, due to rapid and robust Mcl-1 upregulation. The mechanisms of acute Mcl-1 upregulation in response to Bcl-2/Bcl-xL inhibition remain undefined in in ER\u03b1+ breast cancers. We report here that blockade of Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL, alone or together, rapidly induced mTOR signaling in ER\u03b1+ breast cancer cells, rapidly increasing cap-dependent Mcl-1 translation. Cells treated with a pharmacological inhibitor of cap-dependent translation, or with the mTORC1 inhibitor RAD001/everolimus, displayed reduced protein levels of Mcl-1 under basal conditions, and failed to upregulate Mcl-1 protein expression following treatment with ABT-263, a pharmacological inhibitor of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL. Although treatment with ABT-263 alone did not sustain apoptosis in tumor cells in culture or in vivo, ABT-263 plus RAD001 increased apoptosis to a greater extent than either agent used alone. Similarly, combined use of the selective Mcl-1 inhibitor VU661013 with ABT-263 resulted in tumor cell apoptosis and diminished tumor growth in vivo. These findings suggest that rapid Mcl-1 translation drives ABT-263 resistance, but can be combated directly using emerging Mcl-1 inhibitors, or indirectly through existing and approved mTOR inhibitors.

        "Intracellular Neuroprotective Mechanisms in Neuron-Glial Networks Mediated by Glial Cell Line-Derived Neurotrophic Factor. Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) has a pronounced neuroprotective effect in various nervous system pathologies, including ischaemic brain damage and neurodegenerative diseases. In this work, we studied the effect of GDNF on the ultrastructure and functional activity of neuron-glial networks during acute hypoxic exposure, a key damaging factor in numerous brain pathologies. We analysed the molecular mechanisms most likely involved in the positive effects of GDNF. Hypoxia modelling was performed on day 14 of culturing primary hippocampal cells obtained from mouse embryos (E18). GDNF (1\u2009ng/ml) was added to the culture medium 20\u2009min before oxygen deprivation. Acute hypoxia-induced irreversible changes in the ultrastructure of neurons and astrocytes led to the loss of functional \u0421a2+ activity and neural network disruption. Destructive changes in the mitochondrial apparatus and its functional activity characterized by an increase in the basal oxygen consumption rate and respiratory chain complex II activity during decreased stimulated respiration intensity were observed 24 hours after hypoxic injury. At a concentration of 1\u2009ng/ml, GDNF maintained the functional metabolic network activity in primary hippocampal cultures and preserved the structure of the synaptic apparatus and number of mature chemical synapses, confirming its neuroprotective effect. GDNF maintained the normal structure of mitochondria in neuronal outgrowth but not in the soma. Analysis of the possible GDNF mechanism revealed that RET kinase, a component of the receptor complex, and the PI3K/Akt pathway are crucial for the neuroprotective effect of GDNF. The current study also revealed the role of GDNF in the regulation of HIF-1\u03b1 transcription factor expression under hypoxic conditions. ",
        "Increased Serological Response Against Human Herpesvirus 6A Is Associated With Risk for Multiple Sclerosis. Human herpesvirus (HHV)-6A or HHV-6B involvement in multiple sclerosis (MS) etiology has remained controversial mainly due to the lack of serological methods that can distinguish the two viruses. A novel multiplex serological assay measuring IgG reactivity against the immediate-early protein 1 from HHV-6A (IE1A) and HHV-6B (IE1B) was used in a MS cohort (8,742 persons with MS and 7,215 matched controls), and a pre-MS cohort (478 individuals and 476 matched controls) to investigate this further. The IgG response against IE1A was positively associated with MS (OR = 1.55, p = 9 \u00d7 10-22), and increased risk of future MS (OR = 2.22, p = 2 \u00d7 10-5). An interaction was observed between IE1A and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) antibody responses for MS risk (attributable proportion = 0.24, p = 6 \u00d7 10-6). In contrast, the IgG response against IE1B was negatively associated with MS (OR = 0.74, p = 6 \u00d7 10-11). The association did not differ between MS subtypes or vary with severity of disease. The genetic control of HHV-6A/B antibody responses were located to the Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) region and the strongest association for IE1A was the DRB1*13:01-DQA1*01:03-DQB1*06:03 haplotype while the main association for IE1B was DRB1*13:02-DQA1*01:02-DQB1*06:04. In conclusion a role for HHV-6A in MS etiology is supported by an increased serological response against HHV-6A IE1 protein, an interaction with EBV, and an association to HLA genes. ",
        "A Virus-Infected, Reprogrammed Somatic Cell-Derived Tumor Cell (VIReST) Vaccination Regime Can Prevent Initiation and Progression of Pancreatic Cancer. PURPOSE: Pancreatic cancer remains one of the most lethal cancers, and late detection renders most tumors refractory to conventional therapies. Development of cancer prophylaxis may be the most realistic option for improving mortality associated with this disease. Here, we develop a novel individualized prophylactic and therapeutic vaccination regimen using induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC), gene editing, and tumor-targeted replicating oncolytic viruses. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We created a Virus-Infected, Reprogrammed Somatic cell-derived Tumor cell (VIReST) regime. iPSCs from healthy cells were induced to pancreatic tumor cells using in situ gene editing via stable provision of KRasG12D and p53R172H tumor driver mutations. These cells were preinfected with oncolytic Adenovirus (AdV) as prime or Vaccinia virus (VV) as boost, to improve vaccine immunogenicity, prior to delivery of vaccines in a sequential regime to young KPC transgenic mice, genetically programmed to develop pancreatic cancer, to prevent and delay disease development. RESULTS: Tumor cells preinfected with oncolytic AdV as prime or VV as boost were the best regime to induce tumor-specific immunity. iPSC-derived tumor cells were highly related in antigen repertoire to pancreatic cancer cells of KPC transgenic mice, suggesting that an individual's stem cells can provide an antigenically matched whole tumor cell vaccine. The VIReST vaccination primed tumor-specific T-cell responses, resulting in delayed disease emergence and progression and significantly prolonged survival of KPC transgenic mice. Importantly, this regime was well-tolerated and nontoxic. CONCLUSIONS: These results provide both proof of concept and a robust technology platform for the development of personalized prophylactic cancer vaccines to prevent pancreatic malignancies in at-risk individuals.

        "LFRET, a novel rapid assay for anti-tissue transglutaminase antibody detection. The diagnosis of celiac disease (CD) is currently based on serology and intestinal biopsy, with detection of anti-tissue transglutaminase (tTG) IgA antibodies recommended as the first-line test. Emphasizing the increasing importance of serological testing, new guidelines and evidence suggest basing the diagnosis solely on serology without confirmatory biopsy. Enzyme immunoassays (EIAs) are the established approach for anti-tTG antibody detection, with the existing point-of-care (POC) tests lacking sensitivity and/or specificity. Improved POC methods could help reduce the underdiagnosis and diagnostic delay of CD. We have previously developed rapid homogenous immunoassays based on time-resolved F\u00f6rster resonance energy transfer (TR-FRET), and demonstrated their suitability in serodiagnostics with hanta- and Zika virus infections as models. In this study, we set out to establish a protein L -based TR-FRET assay (LFRET) for the detection of anti-tTG antibodies. We studied 74 patients with biopsy-confirmed CD and 70 healthy controls, with 1) the new tTG-LFRET assay, and for reference 2) a well-established EIA and 3) an existing commercial POC test. IgG depletion was employed to differentiate between anti-tTG IgA and IgG positivity. The sensitivity and specificity of the first-generation tTG-LFRET POC assay in detection of CD were 87.8% and 94.3%, respectively, in line with those of the reference POC test. The sensitivity and specificity of EIA were 95.9% and 91.9%, respectively. This study demonstrates the applicability of LFRET to serological diagnosis of autoimmune diseases in general and of CD in particular. ",
        "In Vivo Validation of a Small Molecule Inhibitor of Tau Self-Association in htau Mice. Tau oligomers have been shown to transmit tau pathology from diseased neurons to healthy neurons through seeding, tau misfolding, and aggregation that is thought to play an influential role in the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related tauopathies. To develop a small molecule therapeutic for AD and related tauopathies, we have developed in vitro and cellular assays to select molecules inhibiting the first step in tau aggregation, the self-association of tau into oligomers. In vivo validation studies of an optimized lead compound were independently performed in the htau mouse model of tauopathy that expresses the human isoforms of tau without inherited tauopathy mutations that are irrelevant to AD. Treated mice did not show any adverse events related to the compound. The lead compound significantly reduced the level of self-associated tau and total and phosphorylated insoluble tau aggregates. The dose response was linear with respect to levels of compound in the brain. A confirmatory study was performed with male htau mice that gave consistent results. The results validated our screening approach by showing that targeting tau self-association can inhibit the entire tau aggregation pathway by using the selected and optimized lead compound whose activity translated from in vitro and cellular assays to an in vivo model of tau aggregation.

BACKGROUND: There is growing interest in public health strategies to modify dementia risk in midlife to reduce the burden of cognitive impairment in subsequent decades. Risk reduction messages should include key recommendations for women in response to the high prevalence of dementia observed in this population. Midlife is a critical period for dementia-related brain changes and psychosocial crises. Psychological well-being can improve resilience to crises, yet it is not well understood with respect to dementia risk reduction. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to examine the association between midlife psychological well-being and cognitive function in later life in women. METHODS: The study included 703 women from the British 1946 birth cohort in the Medical Research Council's National Survey of Health and Development. Psychological well-being at 52 years was assessed using the Ryff Scales of Psychological Well-being over six dimensions: autonomy, environmental mastery, personal growth, positive relations with others, purpose in life, and self-acceptance. Cognitive function at 69 years was measured using the Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination, Third Edition. RESULTS: After controlling for cognitive ability at eight years, educational attainment by 26 years, occupational attainment and marital status by 53 years, depression, smoking, and physical exercise at 60-64 years, there was a significant association between greater personal growth and lower self-acceptance at 52 years, and better cognition at 69 years. However, there was no association between cognition and the other four Ryff scales. CONCLUSION: Most aspects of midlife psychological well-being, except for personal growth and self-acceptance, were not prospectively associated with cognition. ",
        "Microarray Gene Expression Dataset Re-analysis Reveals Variability in Influenza Infection and Vaccination. Influenza, a communicable disease, affects thousands of people worldwide. Young children, elderly, immunocompromised individuals and pregnant women are at higher risk for being infected by the influenza virus. Our study aims to highlight differentially expressed genes in influenza disease compared to influenza vaccination, including variability due to age and sex. To accomplish our goals, we conducted a meta-analysis using publicly available microarray expression data. Our inclusion criteria included subjects with influenza, subjects who received the influenza vaccine and healthy controls. We curated 18 microarray datasets for a total of 3,481 samples (1,277 controls, 297 influenza infection, 1,907 influenza vaccination). We pre-processed the raw microarray expression data in R using packages available to pre-process Affymetrix and Illumina microarray platforms. We used a Box-Cox power transformation of the data prior to our down-stream analysis to identify differentially expressed genes. Statistical analyses were based on linear mixed effects model with all study factors and successive likelihood ratio tests (LRT) to identify differentially-expressed genes. We filtered LRT results by disease (Bonferroni adjusted p < 0.05) and used a two-tailed 10% quantile cutoff to identify biologically significant genes. Furthermore, we assessed age and sex effects on the disease genes by filtering for genes with a statistically significant (Bonferroni adjusted p < 0.05) interaction between disease and age, and disease and sex. We identified 4,889 statistically significant genes when we filtered the LRT results by disease factor, and gene enrichment analysis (gene ontology and pathways) included innate immune response, viral process, defense response to virus, Hematopoietic cell lineage and NF-kappa B signaling pathway. Our quantile filtered gene lists comprised of 978 genes each associated with influenza infection and vaccination. We also identified 907 and 48 genes with statistically significant (Bonferroni adjusted p < 0.05) disease-age and disease-sex interactions, respectively. Our meta-analysis approach highlights key gene signatures and their associated pathways for both influenza infection and vaccination. We also were able to identify genes with an age and sex effect. This gives potential for improving current vaccines and exploring genes that are expressed equally across ages when considering universal vaccinations for influenza. ",
        "Evolution and Global Transmission of a Multidrug-Resistant, Community-Associated Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus Lineage from the Indian Subcontinent. The evolution and global transmission of antimicrobial resistance have been well documented for Gram-negative bacteria and health care-associated epidemic pathogens, often emerging from regions with heavy antimicrobial use. However, the degree to which similar processes occur with Gram-positive bacteria in the community setting is less well understood. In this study, we traced the recent origins and global spread of a multidrug-resistant, community-associated Staphylococcus aureus lineage from the Indian subcontinent, the Bengal Bay clone (ST772). We generated whole-genome sequence data of 340 isolates from 14 countries, including the first isolates from Bangladesh and India, to reconstruct the evolutionary history and genomic epidemiology of the lineage. Our data show that the clone emerged on the Indian subcontinent in the early 1960s and disseminated rapidly in the 1990s. Short-term outbreaks in community and health care settings occurred following intercontinental transmission, typically associated with travel and family contacts on the subcontinent, but ongoing endemic transmission was uncommon. Acquisition of a multidrug resistance integrated plasmid was instrumental in the emergence of a single dominant and globally disseminated clade in the early 1990s. Phenotypic data on biofilm, growth, and toxicity point to antimicrobial resistance as the driving force in the evolution of ST772. The Bengal Bay clone therefore combines the multidrug resistance of traditional health care-associated clones with the epidemiological transmission of community-associated methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). Our study demonstrates the importance of whole-genome sequencing for tracking the evolution of emerging and resistant pathogens. It provides a critical framework for ongoing surveillance of the clone on the Indian subcontinent and elsewhere.IMPORTANCE The Bengal Bay clone (ST772) is a community-associated and multidrug-resistant Staphylococcus aureus lineage first isolated from Bangladesh and India in 2004. In this study, we showed that the Bengal Bay clone emerged from a virulent progenitor circulating on the Indian subcontinent. Its subsequent global transmission was associated with travel or family contact in the region. ST772 progressively acquired specific resistance elements at limited cost to its fitness and continues to be exported globally, resulting in small-scale community and health care outbreaks. The Bengal Bay clone therefore combines the virulence potential and epidemiology of community-associated clones with the multidrug resistance of health care-associated S. aureus lineages. This study demonstrates the importance of whole-genome sequencing for the surveillance of highly antibiotic-resistant pathogens, which may emerge in the community setting of regions with poor antibiotic stewardship and rapidly spread into hospitals and communities across the world.

        "Ten simple rules for the computational modeling of behavioral data. Computational modeling of behavior has revolutionized psychology and neuroscience. By fitting models to experimental data we can probe the algorithms underlying behavior, find neural correlates of computational variables and better understand the effects of drugs, illness and interventions. But with great power comes great responsibility. Here, we offer ten simple rules to ensure that computational modeling is used with care and yields meaningful insights. In particular, we present a beginner-friendly, pragmatic and details-oriented introduction on how to relate models to data. What, exactly, can a model tell us about the mind? To answer this, we apply our rules to the simplest modeling techniques most accessible to beginning modelers and illustrate them with examples and code available online. However, most rules apply to more advanced techniques. Our hope is that by following our guidelines, researchers will avoid many pitfalls and unleash the power of computational modeling on their own data. ",
        "Status determinants, social incongruity and economic transition: Gender, relative material wealth and heterogeneity in the cultural lifestyle of forager-horticulturalists. For small-scale societies, transitions from self-sufficiency to cash-based labor in market economies have been associated with the exacerbation of existing, and the emergence of new, social incongruities. Social incongruity occurs when two or more of a person's status determinants (e.g. age, gender, wealth) conflict, resulting in reduced social status. A central focus of theory and research on social incongruity is the relationship between the cultural prototype of what is needed to live a good life-or lifestyle-and status determinants. Assessment of status determinants is challenging because of their relative nature at multiple levels of analysis. This study uses theory and methods from cognitive anthropology to investigate whether and how individual knowledge of a cultural lifestyle prototype conflicts with status determinants at two levels of economic transition among 101 adults from a small-scale society of forager-horticulturalists in Bolivian Amazonia, the Tsimane'. Results support cultural consensus in a 38-item model labeled market lifestyle (explaining 72.7% of sample variance). While the model includes both overlapping traditional (e.g. weaving) and market-related (e.g. education) items and behaviors, most market alternatives were rated higher. When market lifestyle was tested for social incongruity against other status determinants, only gender predicted variation. Thematically, when lifestyle was stratified by gender, men rated several items of relational wealth higher than women did. Analysis of model residual agreement revealed heterogeneity in the form of a syncretic lifestyle model (explaining 18.2% of additional variance). Participants whose knowledge better matched syncretic lifestyle rated traditional items and market alternatives closer to parity. Agreement with the syncretic model correlated with lower material wealth and less market integration. In sum, the findings document a modern, market-oriented form of Tsimane' lifestyle that varies ontologically from past modelling and ethnographic accounts in preferred forms of livelihood and wealth.

        "Midlife physical activity is associated with lower incidence of vascular dementia but not Alzheimer's disease. BACKGROUND: Physical activity might reduce the risk of developing dementia. However, it is still unclear whether the protective effect differs depending on the subtype of dementia. We aimed to investigate if midlife physical activity affects the development of vascular dementia (VaD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) differently in two large study populations with different designs. METHODS: Using a prospective observational design, we studied whether long-distance skiers of the Swedish Vasaloppet (n\u2009=\u2009197,685) exhibited reduced incidence of VaD or AD compared to matched individuals from the general population (n\u2009=\u2009197,684) during 21\u2009years of follow-up (median 10, interquartile range (IQR) 5-15\u2009years). Next, we studied the association between self-reported physical activity, stated twice 5\u2009years apart, and incident VaD and AD in 20,639 participants in the Swedish population-based Malmo Diet and Cancer Study during 18\u2009years of follow-up (median 15, IQR 14-17\u2009years). Finally, we used a mouse model of AD and studied brain levels of amyloid-\u03b2, synaptic proteins, and cognitive function following 6\u2009months of voluntary wheel running. RESULTS: Vasaloppet skiers (median age 36.0\u2009years [IQR 29.0-46.0], 38% women) had lower incidence of all-cause dementia (adjusted hazard ratio (HR) 0.63, 95% CI 0.52-0.75) and VaD (adjusted HR 0.49, 95% CI 0.33-0.73), but not AD, compared to non-skiers. Further, faster skiers exhibited a reduced incidence of VaD (adjusted HR 0.38, 95% CI 0.16-0.95), but not AD or all-cause dementia compared to slower skiers. In the Malmo Diet and Cancer Study (median age 57.5\u2009years [IQR 51.0-63.8], 60% women), higher physical activity was associated with reduced incidence of VaD (adjusted HR 0.65, 95% CI 0.49-0.87), but not AD nor all-cause dementia. These findings were also independent of APOE-\u03b54 genotype. In AD mice, voluntary running did not improve memory, amyloid-\u03b2, or synaptic proteins. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that physical activity in midlife is associated with lower incidence of VaD. Using three different study designs, we found no significant association between physical activity and subsequent development of AD. ",
        "Temporal Associations of Screen Time and Anxiety Symptoms Among Adolescents. There are indications that screen time is associated with symptoms of anxiety in adolescents, but from a longitudinal perspective, the magnitude, specificity, and temporal precedence in this association are relatively under-explored. To address this gap, over the course of 4 years, we annually surveyed adolescents assessing their usage of various types of screen time per day and symptoms of anxiety. ",
        "A Simulated Microgravity Environment Causes a Sustained Defect in Epithelial Barrier Function. Intestinal epithelial cell (IEC) junctions constitute a robust barrier to invasion by viruses, bacteria and exposure to ingested agents. Previous studies showed that microgravity compromises the human immune system and increases enteropathogen virulence. However, the effects of microgravity on epithelial barrier function are poorly understood. The aims of this study were to identify if simulated microgravity alters intestinal epithelial barrier function (permeability), and susceptibility to barrier-disrupting agents. IECs (HT-29.cl19a) were cultured on microcarrier beads in simulated microgravity using a rotating wall vessel (RWV) for 18 days prior to seeding on semipermeable supports to measure ion flux (transepithelial electrical resistance (TER)) and FITC-dextran (FD4) permeability over 14 days. RWV cells showed delayed apical junction localization of the tight junction proteins, occludin and ZO-1. The alcohol metabolite, acetaldehyde, significantly decreased TER and reduced junctional ZO-1 localization, while increasing FD4 permeability in RWV cells compared with static, motion and flask control cells. In conclusion, simulated microgravity induced an underlying and sustained susceptibility to epithelial barrier disruption upon removal from the microgravity environment. This has implications for gastrointestinal homeostasis of astronauts in space, as well as their capability to withstand the effects of agents that compromise intestinal epithelial barrier function following return to Earth.

        "Ternary meter from spatial sounds: Differences in neural entrainment between musicians and non-musicians. The present study explores the relationship between the rhythmic structure of music and the spatial dimension of sound. We study how the brain interacts with spatially-separated sounds to build up a metrical structure. Participants listened to sequences of isochronous sounds that came from different positions on the azimuth plane: 0\u00b0 (control condition), \u00b130\u00b0, \u00b160\u00b0 or \u00b190\u00b0 (spatial conditions). Ternary meter was signaled by the alternation of one sound on one side and two sounds on the symmetrical side. In Experiment 1, musicians and non-musicians paid attention to the spatial sounds. In Experiment 2, participants paid attention to a visual distractor. We recorded their electroencephalograms and performed frequency-tagging analyses. In both experiments, the isochronous beat elicited steady-state evoked-potentials at the frequency of the beat (2.4\u202fHz). While in Experiment 1 the alternation produced clear responses at the frequency of the ternary meter (0.8\u202fHz), in Experiment 2 these responses were only significant in the Spatial 90\u00b0 condition, and mainly in musicians. This suggests that top-down attentional mechanisms are in play for meter induction. Besides, musicians showed stronger responses to beat and meter than non-musicians, suggesting that formal musical training enhances the neural entrainment to spatially-defined rhythms. ",
        "Discovery of autism/intellectual disability somatic mutations in Alzheimer's brains: mutated ADNP cytoskeletal impairments and repair as a case study. With Alzheimer's disease (AD) exhibiting reduced ability of neural stem cell renewal, we hypothesized that de novo mutations controlling embryonic development, in the form of brain somatic mutations instigate the disease. A leading gene presenting heterozygous dominant de novo autism-intellectual disabilities (ID) causing mutations is activity-dependent neuroprotective protein (ADNP), with intact ADNP protecting against AD-tauopathy. We discovered a genomic autism ADNP mutation (c.2188C>T) in postmortem AD olfactory bulbs and hippocampi. RNA-Seq of olfactory bulbs also identified a novel ADNP hotspot mutation, c.2187_2188insA. Altogether, 665 mutations in 596 genes with 441 mutations in AD patients (389 genes, 38% AD-exclusive mutations) and 104 genes presenting disease-causing mutations (OMIM) were discovered. OMIM AD mutated genes converged on cytoskeletal mechanisms, autism and ID causing mutations (about 40% each). The number and average frequencies of AD-related mutations per subject were higher in AD subjects compared to controls. RNA-seq datamining (hippocampus, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, fusiform gyrus and superior frontal gyrus-583 subjects) yielded similar results. Overlapping all tested brain areas identified unique and shared mutations, with ADNP singled out as a gene associated with autism/ID/AD and presenting several unique aging/AD mutations. The large fusiform gyrus library (117 subjects) with high sequencing coverage correlated the c.2187_2188insA ADNP mutation frequency to Braak stage (tauopathy) and showed more ADNP mutations in AD specimens. In cell cultures, the ADNP-derived snippet NAP inhibited mutated-ADNP-microtubule (MT) toxicity and enhanced Tau-MT association. We propose a paradigm-shifting concept in the perception of AD whereby accumulating mosaic somatic mutations promote brain pathology. ",
        "Association of Trajectory and Covariates of Children's Screen Media Time. Importance: Many children begin interacting with screen media as early as infancy. Although screen time is associated with negative developmental consequences, few longitudinal studies in the United States have examined covariates of screen time among children under 3 years of age. Objectives: To identify trajectories of screen time among children aged 1 to 3 years, to examine their association with screen use at 8 years of age, and to assess potential determinants of screen time. Design, Setting, and Participants: This prospective birth cohort study included 3895 children (3083 singletons and 812 unrelated multiples) in New York State who had screen time data available for at least 1 time point from 1 to 3 years of age; 1156 children had data at 8 years. The study spanned September 4, 2007, through June 12, 2014, in the first phase, and August 29, 2014, through November 15, 2019, in the second phase. Data analysis for the present study was conducted from September 28, 2018, to July 15, 2019. Main Outcomes and Measures: Maternal reports of children's television, movie, and computer game times were summed for total daily screen time at 12, 18, 24, 30, and 36 months of age. Two screen time trajectories (low and increasing use) were classified by cluster analysis, and logistic regression was used to model risk factors for the increasing trajectory. Children exhibiting the highest 10th percentile of screen use at each point were examined, and linear mixed models were used to identify risk factors of this high exposure category. Results: Among the 3895 children included in the analysis (2031 boys [52.1%] and 1864 girls [47.9%]), median daily screen time increased from 30 (interquartile range, 0-60) minutes at 12 months of age to 120 (interquartile range, 75-200) minutes at 36 months of age. Of 1045 children with complete data at all 5 time points, 279 (26.7%) had an increasing screen time trajectory. Female child sex (adjusted odds ratio [aOR],\u20090.90; 95% CI, 0.81-0.99) and graduate school levels of paternal (aOR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.56-0.95) and maternal (aOR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.47-0.77) education, compared with having completed college, were associated with lower risk of increasing trajectory. Maternal nulliparity was associated with higher risk of increasing trajectory (aOR, 1.14; 95% CI, 1.00-1.30). Children with an increasing trajectory from 1 to 3 years of age had an additional 22 (95% CI, 11-33) minutes per day of screen time at 8 years of age. Covariates associated with the highest 10th percentile of screen exposure included paterman graduate school education compared with college (aOR,\u20090.63; 95% CI, 0.39-0.99), maternal graduate school education compared with college (aOR, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.37-0.82), maternal nulliparity (aOR, 1.98; 95% CI, 1.50-2.61), twins compared with singletons (aOR, 1.41; 95% CI, 1.05-1.91), non-Hispanic black compared with non-Hispanic white race/ethnicity (aOR, 4.77; 95% CI, 2.25-10.10), and type of care (home-based care aOR, 2.17 [95% CI, 1.38-3.41]; parental care aOR, 2.11 [95% CI, 1.41-3.15]) compared with center-based care. Conclusions and Relevance: These findings suggest that a range of parental and child characteristics are associated with screen time. Screen time habits appear to track from as early as infancy, emphasizing the need for earlier interventions. ",
        "Nucleolar dynamics and interactions with nucleoplasm in living cells. Liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) has been recognized as one of the key cellular organizing principles and was shown to be responsible for formation of membrane-less organelles such as nucleoli. Although nucleoli were found to behave like liquid droplets, many ramifications of LLPS including nucleolar dynamics and interactions with the surrounding liquid remain to be revealed. Here, we study the motion of human nucleoli in vivo, while monitoring the shape of the nucleolus-nucleoplasm interface. We reveal two types of nucleolar pair dynamics: an unexpected correlated motion prior to coalescence and an independent motion otherwise. This surprising kinetics leads to a nucleolar volume distribution, [Formula: see text], unaccounted for by any current theory. Moreover, we find that nucleolus-nucleoplasm interface is maintained by ATP-dependent processes and susceptible to changes in chromatin transcription and packing. Our results extend and enrich the LLPS framework by showing the impact of the surrounding nucleoplasm on nucleoli in living cells. ",
        "Integrin nanoclusters can bridge thin matrix fibres to form cell-matrix adhesions. Integrin-mediated cell-matrix adhesions are key to sensing the geometry and rigidity of extracellular environments and influence vital cellular processes. In vivo, the extracellular matrix is composed of fibrous arrays. To understand the fibre geometries that are required for adhesion formation, we patterned nanolines of various line widths and arrangements in single, crossing or paired arrays with the integrin-binding peptide Arg-Gly-Asp. Single thin lines (width \u226430\u2009nm) did not support cell spreading or formation of focal adhesions, despite the presence of a high density of Arg-Gly-Asp, but wide lines (>40\u2009nm) did. Using super-resolution microscopy, we observed stable, dense integrin clusters formed on parallel (within 110\u2009nm) or crossing thin lines (mimicking a matrix mesh) similar to those on continuous substrates. These dense clusters bridged the line pairs by recruiting activated but unliganded integrins, as verified by integrin mutants unable to bind ligands that coclustered with ligand-bound integrins when present in an active extended conformation. Thus, in a fibrous extracellular matrix mesh, stable integrin nanoclusters bridge between thin (\u226430\u2009nm) matrix fibres and bring about downstream consequences of cell motility and growth. ",
        "225Ac-PSMA-617/177Lu-PSMA-617 tandem therapy of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer: pilot experience. PURPOSE: Up to 30% of patients with prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-positive metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) never respond or develop resistance to 177Lu-labeled PSMA-targeted radioligand monotherapy. Single-agent PSMA-targeted radioligand therapy (PRLT) with the alpha-emitter 225Ac showed promise against mCRPC but may cause severe and/or persistent xerostomia, which may substantially impair patients' quality-of-life. We hypothesized that when 177Lu-PSMA ligand alone is ineffective, tandem therapy with low-activity 225Ac-PSMA ligand plus full activity of the beta emitter may enhance efficacy while minimizing xerostomia severity. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed pilot experience with 1 course of 225Ac-PSMA-617/177Lu-PSMA-617 tandem therapy in our first 20 patients with mCRPC receiving this intervention after insufficiently responding to 177Lu-PSMA-617 monotherapy. This cohort had late-stage/end-stage disease with high baseline prostate-specific antigen (PSA) concentration (median 215 ng/mL), heavy pre-treatment (abiraterone and/or enzalutamide, and 177Lu-PRLT [median cumulative activity, 26.3 GBq] in 20/20 patients, 100%; docetaxel and/or cabazitaxel in 13/20 patients, 65%), and frequent Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 2 (8/20 patients, 40%). RESULTS: Median (minimum-maximum) administered activities were 225Ac-PSMA-617, 5.3 (1.5-7.9) MBq, and 177Lu-PSMA-617, 6.9 (5.0-11.6) GBq. Significant responders to tandem therapy received 177Lu-PSMA-617 monotherapy as maintenance (median [minimum-maximum]: 1 [0-5] cycle). After a median (minimum-maximum) 22 (14-63) weeks' follow-up, 13/20 patients (65%) had as best biochemical response a PSA decline > 50%. Median (95% confidence interval) progression-free survival was 19 (12-26) weeks, and overall survival was 48 (4-92) weeks post-tandem therapy administration. Xerostomia was reported as grade 1 (very mild) in 8/20 patients (40%), grade 2 (mild) in 5/20 (25%), and grade 3/4 in 0/20. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that a single course of tandem therapy with low-activity 225Ac-PSMA-617/full-activity 177Lu-PSMA-617 may safely enhance response to PRLT in men with late-stage/end-stage mCRPC while minimizing xerostomia severity. Formal study of this combination is warranted. ",
        "Strong habitat and weak genetic effects shape the lifetime reproductive success in a wild clownfish population. The relative contributions of environmental, maternal and additive genetic factors to the Lifetime reproductive success (LRS) determine whether species can adapt to rapid environmental change. Yet to date, studies quantifying LRS across multiple generations in marine species in the wild are non-existent. Here we used 10-year pedigrees resolved for a wild orange clownfish population from Kimbe Island (PNG) and a quantitative genetic linear mixed model approach to quantify the additive genetic, maternal and environmental contributions to variation in LRS for the self-recruiting portion of the population. We found that the habitat of the breeder, including the anemone species and geographic location, made the greatest contribution to LRS. There were low to negligible contributions of genetic and maternal factors equating with low heritability and evolvability. Our findings imply that our population will be susceptible to short-term, small-scale changes in habitat structure and may have limited capacity to adapt to these changes. ",
        "Blood Pressure and Heart Rate Variability in Preschool Children Exposed to Smokeless Tobacco in Fetal Life. Background Maternal smoking during pregnancy has been associated with higher blood pressure and autonomic imbalance in the offspring. However, it has been difficult to determine the selective prenatal and postnatal contributions as children frequently have been exposed to smoking both before and after birth. The specific role of nicotine is also unclear. We aimed to determine whether exclusive prenatal exposure to nicotine from maternal use of smokeless tobacco (Swedish snus) in pregnancy was associated with blood pressure and autonomic heart rate control in their children. Methods and Results We measured oscillometric blood pressures in forty 5- to 6-year-old children with snus exposure in fetal life (n=21) and in tobacco-free controls (n=19). Taking the child's age and height into account, snus-exposed children had 4.2 (95% CI, 0.2-8.1) mm\u00a0Hg higher systolic blood pressure than controls (P=0.038). The corresponding sex-, age-, and height-standardized systolic blood pressure centiles were 61 and 46 (95% CI of the difference, 2-28) (P=0.029). Heart rate variability was tested in 30 of the children. The spectral heart rate variability variable low-frequency/high-frequency ratio was higher (median, 0.69; interquartile range, 0.45-1.21) in snus-exposed children than in controls (median, 0.21; interquartile range, 0.32-0.57; P=0.034). Conclusions Prenatal snus exposure was associated with higher systolic blood pressure and altered heart rate variability at 6\u00a0years of age. These findings may indicate adverse prenatal programming of nicotine, but implications for cardiovascular health in later life remain to be studied. Meanwhile, women should be recommended to abstain from all types of tobacco and nicotine products during pregnancy. ",
        "Validation of a sensitive UHPLC-MS/MS method for cytochrome P450 probe substrates caffeine, tolbutamide, dextromethorphan, and alprazolam in human serum reveals drug contamination of serum used for research. To evaluate the potential for interactions between botanical dietary supplements and drug metabolism, Phase I clinical pharmacokinetics studies are conducted using an oral cocktail of probe substrates of cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes. A sensitive, specific, and fast ultra-high performance liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS) method was developed and validated for determination of caffeine (probe of CYP1A2), tolbutamide (probe of CYP2C9), dextromethorphan (probe of CYP2D6), and alprazolam (probe of CYP3A4/5) in human serum. Stable isotope-labelled analogs were used as internal standards, and sample preparation involved only rapid protein precipitation and centrifugation. The method of standard addition was used for the measurement of caffeine, because commercially available pooled human serum contains caffeine. Out of 18 lots of pooled human serum tested, caffeine was detection in all lots, alprazolam was detected in 13 lots, 8 lots contained dextromethorphan, and no tolbutamide was detected. Only serum prepared from the blood of select individuals was determined to be drug-free. The analytical method was validated with respect to linearity, accuracy and precision, recovery, stability, and matrix effects. The calibration curves were linear over the range of 25-12,000\u202fng/mL for caffeine, 75-36,000\u202fng/mL for tolbutamide, 0.05-30\u202fng/mL for dextromethorphan, and 0.1-60\u202fng/mL for alprazolam. The intra-assay and inter-assay coefficients of variation (%CV) and %Bias were <13 % (<17 % at the lower limit of quantitation). The recovery of each probe substrate ranged from 84.2%-98.5 %. All analytes were stable during sample storage and handling. Matrix effects were minimized by using stable isotope-labeled internal standards. The method was successfully applied to clinical studies investigating the pharmacokinetic alterations of probe substrates caused by chronic consumption of botanical dietary supplements. ",
        "Preventing disease in the 21st century: early breast milk exposure and later cardiovascular health in premature infants. Cardiovascular health of premature infants reaching early adulthood is an area of ongoing research. There is emerging evidence delineating the challenges faced by those individuals. Young adults born premature demonstrate a unique cardiac phenotype characterized by reduced biventricular volume, relatively lower systolic and diastolic function, and a disproportionate increase in muscle mass. This may clinically manifest by an increased risk of cardiovascular incidents, hypertension, and reduced exercise tolerance. Those consequences appear to result from early postnatal cardiac remodeling due to premature birth and associated co-morbidities. Recent evidence suggests that early exposure to breast milk slows down or even arrests those pathophysiological changes, thereby mitigating the long-term adverse effects of premature birth on cardiovascular health. In this review article, we discuss the role of breast milk in preventing early adulthood cardiovascular disease in infants born premature. We explore the emerging evidence and examine the possible mechanistic pathways mediating this phenomenon. Furthermore, we aim to demonstrate the vital role of early breast milk exposure in preventing cardiovascular disease in preterm infants. ",
        "CD44-high neural crest stem-like cells are associated with tumour aggressiveness and poor survival in neuroblastoma tumours. BACKGROUND: Neuroblastoma is a paediatric tumour originated from sympathoadrenal precursors and characterized by its heterogeneity and poor outcome in advanced stages. Intra-tumoral cellular heterogeneity has emerged as an important feature in neuroblastoma, with a potential major impact on tumour aggressiveness and response to therapy. CD44 is an adhesion protein involved in tumour progression, metastasis and stemness in different cancers; however, there has been controversies about the significance of CD44 expression in neuroblastoma and its relationship with tumour progression. METHODS: We have performed transcriptomic analysis on patient tumour samples studying the outcome of patients with high CD44 expression. Adhesion, invasion and proliferation assays were performed in sorted CD44high neuroblastoma cells. Tumoursphere cultures have been used to enrich in undifferentiated stem-like cells and to asses self-renewal and differentiation potential. We have finally performed in vivo tumorigenic assays on cell line-derived or Patient-derived xenografts. FINDINGS: We show that high CD44 expression is associated with low survival in high-grade human neuroblastoma, independently of MYCN amplification. CD44 is expressed in a cell population with neural crest stem-like features, and with the capacity to generate multipotent, undifferentiated tumourspheres in culture. These cells are more invasive and proliferative in vitro. CD44 positive cells obtained from tumours are more tumorigenic and metastatic, giving rise to aggressive neuroblastic tumours at high frequency upon transplantation. INTERPRETATION: We describe an unexpected intra-tumoural heterogeneity within cellular entities expressing CD44 in neuroblastoma, and propose that CD44 has a role in neural crest stem-like undifferentiated cells, which can contribute to tumorigenesis and malignancy in this type of cancer.

        "Randomized Trial of Three Anticonvulsant Medications for Status Epilepticus. BACKGROUND: The choice of drugs for patients with status epilepticus that is refractory to treatment with benzodiazepines has not been thoroughly studied. METHODS: In a randomized, blinded, adaptive trial, we compared the efficacy and safety of three intravenous anticonvulsive agents - levetiracetam, fosphenytoin, and valproate - in children and adults with convulsive status epilepticus that was unresponsive to treatment with benzodiazepines. The primary outcome was absence of clinically evident seizures and improvement in the level of consciousness by 60 minutes after the start of drug infusion, without additional anticonvulsant medication. The posterior probabilities that each drug was the most or least effective were calculated. Safety outcomes included life-threatening hypotension or cardiac arrhythmia, endotracheal intubation, seizure recurrence, and death. RESULTS: A total of 384 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive levetiracetam (145 patients), fosphenytoin (118), or valproate (121). Reenrollment of patients with a second episode of status epilepticus accounted for 16 additional instances of randomization. In accordance with a prespecified stopping rule for futility of finding one drug to be superior or inferior, a planned interim analysis led to the trial being stopped. Of the enrolled patients, 10% were determined to have had psychogenic seizures. The primary outcome of cessation of status epilepticus and improvement in the level of consciousness at 60 minutes occurred in 68 patients assigned to levetiracetam (47%; 95% credible interval, 39 to 55), 53 patients assigned to fosphenytoin (45%; 95% credible interval, 36 to 54), and 56 patients assigned to valproate (46%; 95% credible interval, 38 to 55). The posterior probability that each drug was the most effective was 0.41, 0.24, and 0.35, respectively. Numerically more episodes of hypotension and intubation occurred in the fosphenytoin group and more deaths occurred in the levetiracetam group than in the other groups, but these differences were not significant. CONCLUSIONS: In the context of benzodiazepine-refractory convulsive status epilepticus, the anticonvulsant drugs levetiracetam, fosphenytoin, and valproate each led to seizure cessation and improved alertness by 60 minutes in approximately half the patients, and the three drugs were associated with similar incidences of adverse events.

        "Deportation Worry, Cardiovascular Disease Risk Factor Trajectories, and Incident Hypertension: A Community-Based Cohort Study. Background Worry about deportation has been associated with cardiovascular disease risk factors in cross-sectional research. No research has evaluated this association longitudinally or examined the association between deportation worry and incident cardiovascular disease outcomes. Methods and Results We used data from an ongoing community-based cohort of 572 women primarily of Mexican origin. We estimated associations between self-reported deportation worry and: (1) trajectories of blood pressure, body mass index, and waist circumference with linear mixed models, and (2) incident hypertension with Cox proportional hazards models. Nearly half (48%) of women reported \"a lot,\" 24% reported \"moderate,\" and 28% reported \"not too much\" deportation worry. Higher worry at baseline was associated with nonlinear systolic blood pressure and mean arterial pressure trajectories. For example, compared with not too much worry, a lot of worry was associated with a faster initial increase (\u03b2, interaction with linear year term: 4.10; 95% CI, 1.17-7.03) followed by a faster decrease in systolic blood pressure (\u03b2, interaction with quadratic year term: -0.80; 95% CI, -1.55 to -0.06). There was weak evidence of an association between deportation worry and diastolic blood pressure and no association with body mass index, waist circumference, or pulse pressure trajectories. Among 408 women without baseline hypertension, reporting a lot (hazard ratio, 2.17; 95% CI, 1.15-4.10) and moderate deportation worry (hazard ratio, 2.48; 95% CI, 1.17-4.30) were each associated with greater risk of incident hypertension compared with reporting not too much worry. Conclusions Deportation worry may contribute to widening disparities in some cardiovascular disease risk factors and outcomes over time. ",
        "Angiopoietin-like 4 binds neuropilins and cooperates with VEGF to induce diabetic macular edema. The majority of patients with diabetic macular edema (DME), the most common cause of vision loss in working-age Americans, do not respond adequately to current therapies targeting VEGFA. Here, we show that expression of angiopoietin-like 4 (ANGPTL4), a HIF-1-regulated gene product, is increased in the eyes of diabetic mice and patients with DME. We observed that ANGPTL4 and VEGF act synergistically to destabilize the retinal vascular barrier. Interestingly, while ANGPTL4 modestly enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of VEGF receptor 2, promotion of vascular permeability by ANGPTL4 was independent of this receptor. Instead, we found that ANGPTL4 binds directly to neuropilin 1 (NRP1) and NRP2 on endothelial cells (ECs), leading to rapid activation of the RhoA/ROCK signaling pathway and breakdown of EC-EC junctions. Treatment with a soluble fragment of NRP1 (sNRP1) prevented ANGPTL4 from binding to NRP1 and blocked ANGPTL4-induced activation of RhoA as well as EC permeability in vitro and retinal vascular leakage in diabetic animals in vivo. In addition, sNRP1 reduced the stimulation of EC permeability by aqueous fluid from patients with DME. Collectively, these data identify the ANGPTL4/NRP/RhoA pathway as a therapeutic target for the treatment of DME. ",
        "Parallel Accelerated Evolution in Distant Hibernators Reveals Candidate Cis Elements and Genetic Circuits Regulating Mammalian Obesity. Obesity is a clinical problem and an important adaptation in many species. Hibernating mammals, for example, become obese, insulin resistant, and hyperinsulinemic to store fat. Here, we combine comparative phylogenomics with large-scale human genome data to uncover candidate cis elements regulating mammalian obesity. Our study examines genetic elements conserved across non-hibernating mammals to identify genome-wide patterns of accelerated evolution in hibernators from different clades. The results reveal the existence of parallel accelerated regions (pARs) in distant hibernators. Hibernator pARs are disproportionately located near human obesity susceptibility genes compared to random conserved regions, hibernator ARs that are not parallel, and non-hibernator pARs. We found 364 candidate obesity-regulating cis elements and genetic circuits in different cell types. The Fat Mass and Obesity (FTO) locus, the strongest genetic risk factor for human obesity, is an enriched site for hibernator pARs. Our results uncover noncoding cis elements with putative roles in obesity and hibernation. ",
        "Life Expectancy and Mortality Rates in the United States, 1959-2017. Importance: US life expectancy has not kept pace with that of other wealthy countries and is now decreasing. Objective: To examine vital statistics and review the history of changes in US life expectancy and increasing mortality rates; and to identify potential contributing factors, drawing insights from current literature and an analysis of state-level trends. Evidence: Life expectancy data for 1959-2016 and cause-specific mortality rates for 1999-2017 were obtained from the US Mortality Database and CDC WONDER, respectively. The analysis focused on midlife deaths (ages 25-64 years), stratified by sex, race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and geography (including the 50 states). Published research from January 1990 through August 2019 that examined relevant mortality trends and potential contributory factors was examined. Findings: Between 1959 and 2016, US life expectancy increased from 69.9 years to 78.9 years but declined for 3 consecutive years after 2014. The recent decrease in US life expectancy culminated a period of increasing cause-specific mortality among adults aged 25 to 64 years that began in the 1990s, ultimately producing an increase in all-cause mortality that began in 2010. During 2010-2017, midlife all-cause mortality rates increased from 328.5 deaths/100\u202f000 to 348.2 deaths/100\u202f000. By 2014, midlife mortality was increasing across all racial groups, caused by drug overdoses, alcohol abuse, suicides, and a diverse list of organ system diseases. The largest relative increases in midlife mortality rates occurred in New England (New Hampshire, 23.3%; Maine, 20.7%; Vermont, 19.9%) and the Ohio Valley (West Virginia, 23.0%; Ohio, 21.6%; Indiana, 14.8%; Kentucky, 14.7%). The increase in midlife mortality during 2010-2017 was associated with an estimated 33\u202f307 excess US deaths, 32.8% of which occurred in 4 Ohio Valley states. Conclusions and Relevance: US life expectancy increased for most of the past 60 years, but the rate of increase slowed over time and life expectancy decreased after 2014. A major contributor has been an increase in mortality from specific causes (eg, drug overdoses, suicides, organ system diseases) among young and middle-aged adults of all racial groups, with an onset as early as the 1990s and with the largest relative increases occurring in the Ohio Valley and New England. The implications for public health and the economy are substantial, making it vital to understand the underlying causes. ",
        "Time to start intervening in the human germline? A utilitarian perspective. Focusing on present-day possibilities raised by existing technology, I consider the normative aspects of genetically modifying the human germline from a utilitarian standpoint. With reference to a hypothetical case, I examine the probable consequences of permitting a well-conceived attempt to correct a disease-associated gene in the human germline using current CRISPR gene-editing technology. I consider inter alia the likely effects on utility of creating healthy new lives, of discouraging adoption, and of kickstarting a revolution in human germline genetic modification (HGGM). I reject various objections to HGGM, including claims that the risks of genetic harm outweigh the likely benefits. From this utilitarian analysis, I conclude that strong grounds exist to support intervening in the human germline using current technology. Delay in commencing such work will impose a utility cost, because the longer we wait until commencing the HGGM revolution and moving towards a world of increased utility, the greater will be the quantity of suffering accrued meantime through genetically influenced disease. Nevertheless, considering residual safety concerns and the negative publicity engendered by an ethically problematic recent (2018) first attempt at HGGM, it seems prudent-and ultimately generative of the greatest amount of utility-to delay implementing HGGM for a modest period of time, in the order of 1-2 years.

        "Time-invariant working memory representations in the presence of code-morphing in the lateral prefrontal cortex. Maintenance of working memory is thought to involve the activity of prefrontal neuronal populations with strong recurrent connections. However, it was recently shown that distractors evoke a morphing of the prefrontal population code, even when memories are maintained throughout the delay. How can a morphing code maintain time-invariant memory information? We hypothesized that dynamic prefrontal activity contains time-invariant memory information within a subspace of neural activity. Using an optimization algorithm, we found a low-dimensional subspace that contains time-invariant memory information. This information was reduced in trials where the animals made errors in the task, and was also found in periods of the trial not used to find the subspace. A bump attractor model replicated these properties, and provided predictions that were confirmed in the neural data. Our results suggest that the high-dimensional responses of prefrontal cortex contain subspaces where different types of information can be simultaneously encoded with minimal interference. ",
        "Mapping brain recovery after concussion: From acute injury to 1 year after medical clearance. OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that concussion-related brain alterations seen at symptomatic injury and medical clearance to return to play (RTP) will have dissipated by 1 year after RTP. METHODS: For this observational study, 24 athletes with concussion were scanned longitudinally within 1 week after injury, at RTP, and 1 year after RTP. A large control cohort of 122 athletes were also scanned before the season. Each imaging session assessed global functional connectivity (Gconn) and cerebral blood flow (CBF), along with white matter fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD). The main effects of concussion on MRI parameters were evaluated at each postinjury time point. In addition, covariation was assessed between MRI parameters and clinical measures of acute symptom severity and time to RTP. RESULTS: Different aspects of brain physiology showed different patterns of recovery over time. Both Gconn and FA displayed no significant effects at 1 year after RTP, whereas CBF and MD exhibited persistent long-term effects. The effects of concussion on MRI parameters were also dependent on acute symptom severity and time to RTP for all postinjury time points. CONCLUSION: This study provides the first longitudinal evaluation of concussion focused on time of RTP and 1 year after medical clearance, using multiple different MRI measures to assess brain structure and function. These findings significantly enhance our understanding of the natural course of brain recovery after a concussion. ",
        "A National Approach to Pediatric Sepsis Surveillance. Pediatric sepsis is a major public health concern, and robust surveillance tools are needed to characterize its incidence, outcomes, and trends. The increasing use of electronic health records (EHRs) in the United States creates an opportunity to conduct reliable, pragmatic, and generalizable population-level surveillance using routinely collected clinical data rather than administrative claims or resource-intensive chart review. In 2015, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recruited sepsis investigators and representatives of key professional societies to develop an approach to adult sepsis surveillance using clinical data recorded in EHRs. This led to the creation of the adult sepsis event definition, which was used to estimate the national burden of sepsis in adults and has been adapted into a tool kit to facilitate widespread implementation by hospitals. In July 2018, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention convened a new multidisciplinary pediatric working group to tailor an EHR-based national sepsis surveillance approach to infants and children. Here, we describe the challenges specific to pediatric sepsis surveillance, including evolving clinical definitions of sepsis, accommodation of age-dependent physiologic differences, identifying appropriate EHR markers of infection and organ dysfunction among infants and children, and the need to account for children with medical complexity and the growing regionalization of pediatric care. We propose a preliminary pediatric sepsis event surveillance definition and outline next steps for refining and validating these criteria so that they may be used to estimate the national burden of pediatric sepsis and support site-specific surveillance to complement ongoing initiatives to improve sepsis prevention, recognition, and treatment.

        "Machine learning-based dynamic mortality prediction after traumatic brain injury. Our aim was to create simple and largely scalable machine learning-based algorithms that could predict mortality in a real-time fashion during intensive care after traumatic brain injury. We performed an observational multicenter study including adult TBI patients that were monitored for intracranial pressure (ICP) for at least 24\u2009h in three ICUs. We used machine learning-based logistic regression modeling to create two algorithms (based on ICP, mean arterial pressure [MAP], cerebral perfusion pressure [CPP] and Glasgow Coma Scale [GCS]) to predict 30-day mortality. We used a stratified cross-validation technique for internal validation. Of 472 included patients, 92 patients (19%) died within 30 days. Following cross-validation, the ICP-MAP-CPP algorithm's area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) increased from 0.67 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.60-0.74) on day 1 to 0.81 (95% CI 0.75-0.87) on day 5. The ICP-MAP-CPP-GCS algorithm's AUC increased from 0.72 (95% CI 0.64-0.78) on day 1 to 0.84 (95% CI 0.78-0.90) on day 5. Algorithm misclassification was seen among patients undergoing decompressive craniectomy. In conclusion, we present a new concept of dynamic prognostication for patients with TBI treated in the ICU. Our simple algorithms, based on only three and four main variables, discriminated between survivors and non-survivors with accuracies up to 81% and 84%. These open-sourced simple algorithms can likely be further developed, also in low and middle-income countries. ",

        "2-APB and CBD-Mediated Targeting of Charged Cytotoxic Compounds Into Tumor Cells Suggests the Involvement of TRPV2 Channels. Targeted delivery of therapeutic compounds to particular cell types such that they only affect the target cells is of great clinical importance since it can minimize undesired side effects. For example, typical chemotherapeutic treatments used in the treatment of neoplastic disorders are cytotoxic not only to cancer cells but also to most normal cells when exposed to a critical concentration of the compound. As such, many chemotherapeutics exhibit severe side effects, often prohibiting their effective use in the treatment of cancer. Here, we describe a new means for facilitated delivery of a clinically used chemotherapy compound' doxorubicin, into hepatocellular carcinoma cell line (BNL1 ME). We demonstrate that these cells express a large pore, cation non-selective transient receptor potential (TRP) channel V2. We utilized this channel to shuttle doxorubicin into BNL1 ME cells. We show that co-application of either cannabidiol (CBD) or 2-APB, the activators of TRPV2 channels, together with doxorubicin leads to significantly higher accumulation of doxorubicin in BNL1 ME cells than in BNL1 ME cells that were exposed to doxorubicin alone. Moreover, we demonstrate that sub-effective doses of doxorubicin when co-applied with either 2-APB or CBD lead to a significant decrease in the number of living BNL1 ME cell and BNL1 ME cell colonies in comparison to application of doxorubicin alone. Finally, we demonstrate that the doxorubicin-mediated cell death is significantly more potent, requiring an order of magnitude lower dose, when co-applied with CBD than with 2-APB. We suggest that CBD may have a dual effect in promoting doxorubicin-mediated cell death by facilitating the entry of doxorubicin via TRPV2 channels and preventing its clearance from the cells by inhibiting P-glycoprotein ATPase transporter. Collectively, these results provide a foundation for the use of large pore cation-non selective channels as \"natural\" drug delivery systems for targeting specific cell types. ",
        "Anisotropic polymer nanoparticles with controlled dimensions from the morphological transformation of isotropic seeds. Understanding and controlling self-assembly processes at multiple length scales is vital if we are to design and create advanced materials. In particular, our ability to organise matter on the nanoscale has advanced considerably, but still lags far behind our skill in manipulating individual molecules. New tools allowing controlled nanoscale assembly are sorely needed, as well as the physical understanding of how they work. Here, we report such a method for the production of highly anisotropic nanoparticles with controlled dimensions based on a morphological transformation process (MORPH, for short) driven by the formation of supramolecular bonds. We present a minimal physical model for MORPH that suggests a general mechanism which is potentially applicable to a large number of polymer/nanoparticle systems. We envision MORPH becoming a valuable tool for controlling nanoscale self-assembly, and for the production of functional nanostructures for diverse applications. ",
        "Imaging Patients with Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer Using 89Zr-DFO-MSTP2109A Anti-STEAP1 Antibody. Six-transmembrane epithelial antigen of prostate-1 (STEAP1) is a relatively newly identified target in prostate cancer. We evaluated the ability of PET/CT with 89Zr-DFO-MSTP2109A, an antibody that recognizes STEAP1, to detect lesions in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). Methods: Nineteen mCRPC patients were prospectively imaged using approximately 185 MBq/10 mg of 89Zr-DFO-MSTP2109A. 89Zr-DFO-MSTP2109A PET/CT images obtained 4-7 d after injection were compared with bone and CT scans. Uptake in lesions was measured. Fifteen patients were treated with an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) based on MSTP2109A; ADC treatment-related data were correlated with tumor uptake by PET imaging. Bone or soft-tissue biopsy samples were evaluated. Results: No significant toxicity occurred. Excellent uptake was observed in bone and soft-tissue disease. Median SUVmax was 20.6 in bone and 16.8 in soft tissue. Sixteen of 17 lesions biopsied were positive on 89Zr-DFO-MSTP2109A, and all sites were histologically positive (1 on repeat biopsy). Bayesian analysis resulted in a best estimate of 86% of histologically positive lesions being true-positive on imaging (95% confidence interval, 75%-100%). There was no correlation between SUVmax tumor uptake and STEAP1 immunohistochemistry, survival after ADC treatment, number of ADC treatment cycles, or change in prostate-specific antigen level. Conclusion:89Zr-DFO-MSTP2109A is well tolerated and shows localization in mCRPC sites in bone and soft tissue. Given the high SUV in tumor and localization of a large number of lesions, this reagent warrants further exploration as a companion diagnostic in patients undergoing STEAP1-directed therapy. ",
        "Demographic and geographical variability in physiotherapy provision following hip and knee replacement. An analysis from the National Joint Registry for England, Wales, Northern Ireland and the Isle of Man. BACKGROUND: Total hip (THR) and knee replacement (TKR) are two of the most common elective orthopaedic procedures worldwide. Physiotherapy is core to the recovery of people following joint replacement. However, there remains uncertainty as to physiotherapy provision at a national level. OBJECTIVES: To examine the relationship between patient impairment and geographical variation on the provision of physiotherapy among patients who undergo primary total hip or knee replacement (THR/TKR). DESIGN: Population-based observational cohort study. METHODS: Patients undergoing THR (n=17,338) or TKR (n=20,260) recorded in the National Joint Registry for England (NJR) between 2009 and 2010 and completed Patient Reported Outcome Measures (PROMs) questionnaires at Baseline and 12 months postoperatively. Data were analysed on the frequency of physiotherapy over the first postoperative year across England's Strategic Health Authorities (SHAs). Logistic regression analyses examined the relationship between a range of patient and geographical characteristics and physiotherapy provision. RESULTS: Following THR, patients were less likely to receive physiotherapy than following TKR patients ('some' treatment by a physiotherapist within 1st post operative year: 53% vs 79%). People with worse functional outcomes 12 months postoperatively, received more physiotherapy after THR and TKR. There was substantial variation in provision of physiotherapy according to age (younger people received more physiotherapy), gender (females received more physiotherapy) ethnicity (non-whites received more physiotherapy) and geographical location (40% of patients from South West received some physiotherapy compared to 40 73% in London after THR). CONCLUSIONS: There is substantial variation in the provision of physiotherapy nationally. This variation is not explained by differences in the patient's clinical presentation. ",
        "Pembrolizumab for Treatment-Refractory Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer: Multicohort, Open-Label Phase II KEYNOTE-199 Study. PURPOSE: Pembrolizumab has previously shown antitumor activity against programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1)-positive metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). Here, we assessed the antitumor activity and safety of pembrolizumab in three parallel cohorts of a larger mCRPC population. METHODS: The phase II KEYNOTE-199 study included three cohorts of patients with mCRPC treated with docetaxel and one or more targeted endocrine therapies. Cohorts 1 and 2 enrolled patients with RECIST-measurable PD-L1-positive and PD-L1-negative disease, respectively. Cohort 3 enrolled patients with bone-predominant disease, regardless of PD-L1 expression. All patients received pembrolizumab 200 mg every 3 weeks for up to 35 cycles. The primary end point was objective response rate per RECIST v1.1 assessed by central review in cohorts 1 and 2. Secondary end points included disease control rate, duration of response, overall survival (OS), and safety. RESULTS: Two hundred fifty-eight patients were enrolled: 133 in cohort 1, 66 in cohort 2, and 59 in cohort 3. Objective response rate was 5% (95% CI, 2% to 11%) in cohort 1 and 3% (95% CI, < 1% to 11%) in cohort 2. Median duration of response was not reached (range, 1.9 to \u2265 21.8 months) and 10.6 months (range, 4.4 to 16.8 months), respectively. Disease control rate was 10% in cohort 1, 9% in cohort 2, and 22% in cohort 3. Median OS was 9.5 months in cohort 1, 7.9 months in cohort 2, and 14.1 months in cohort 3. Treatment-related adverse events occurred in 60% of patients, were of grade 3 to 5 severity in 15%, and led to discontinuation of treatment in 5%. CONCLUSION: Pembrolizumab monotherapy shows antitumor activity with an acceptable safety profile in a subset of patients with RECIST-measurable and bone-predominant mCRPC previously treated with docetaxel and targeted endocrine therapy. Observed responses seem to be durable, and OS estimates are encouraging. ",
        "Targeted and Synergic Glioblastoma Treatment: Multifunctional Nanoparticles Delivering Verteporfin as Adjuvant Therapy for Temozolomide Chemotherapy. Despite advances in cancer therapies, glioblastoma multiforme treatment remains inefficient due to the brain-blood barrier (BBB) inhibitory activity and to the low temozolomide (TMZ) chemotherapeutic selectivity. To improve therapeutic outcomes, in this work we propose two strategies, (i) photodynamic therapy (PDT) as adjuvant treatment and (ii) engineering of multifunctional theranostic/targeted nanoparticles ( m-NPs) that integrate biotin as a targeting moiety with rhodamine-B as a theranostic agent in pluronic P85/F127 copolymers. These smart m-NPs can surmount the BBB and coencapsulate multiple cargoes under optimized conditions. Overall, the present study conducts a rational m-NP design, characterization, and optimizes the formulation conditions. Confocal microscopy studies on T98-G, U87-MG, and U343 glioblastoma cells and on NIH-3T3 normal fibroblast cells show that the m-NPs and the encapsulated drugs are selectively taken up by tumor cells presenting a broad intracellular distribution. The formulations display no toxicity in the absence of light and are not toxic to healthy cells, but they exert a robust synergic action in cancer cells in the case of concomitant PDT/TMZ treatment, especially at low TMZ concentrations and higher light doses, as demonstrated by nonlinear dose-effect curves based on the Chou-Talalay method. The results evidenced different mechanisms of action related to the disjoint cell cycle phases at the optimal PDT/TMZ ratio. This effect favors synergism between the PDT and the chemotherapy with TMZ, enhances the antiproliferative effect, and overcomes cross-resistance mechanisms. These results point out that m-NP-based PDT adjuvant therapy is a promising strategy to improve TMZ-based glioblastoma multiforme treatments. ",
        "A neurobiological mechanism linking transportation noise to cardiovascular disease in humans. AIMS: Chronic noise exposure associates with increased cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk; however, the role of confounders and the underlying mechanism remain incompletely defined. The amygdala, a limbic centre involved in stress perception, participates in the response to noise. Higher amygdalar metabolic activity (AmygA) associates with increased CVD risk through a mechanism involving heightened arterial inflammation (ArtI). Accordingly, in this retrospective study, we tested whether greater noise exposure associates with higher: (i) AmygA, (ii) ArtI, and (iii) risk for major adverse cardiovascular disease events (MACE). METHODS AND RESULTS: Adults (N\u2009=\u2009498) without CVD or active cancer underwent clinical 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography imaging. Amygdalar metabolic activity and ArtI were measured, and MACE within 5 years was adjudicated. Average 24-h transportation noise and potential confounders were estimated at each individual's home address. Over a median 4.06\u2009years, 40 individuals experienced MACE. Higher noise exposure (per 5 dBA increase) predicted MACE [hazard ratio (95% confidence interval, CI) 1.341 (1.147-1.567), P\u2009<\u20090.001] and remained robust to multivariable adjustments. Higher noise exposure associated with increased AmygA [standardized \u03b2 (95% CI) 0.112 (0.051-0.174), P\u2009<\u20090.001] and ArtI [0.045 (0.001-0.090), P\u2009=\u20090.047]. Mediation analysis suggested that higher noise exposure associates with MACE via a serial mechanism involving heightened AmygA and ArtI that accounts for 12-26% of this relationship. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that noise exposure associates with MACE via a mechanism that begins with increased stress-associated limbic (amygdalar) activity and includes heightened arterial inflammation. This potential neurobiological mechanism linking noise to CVD merits further evaluation in a prospective population. ",
        "Prenatal THC exposure produces a hyperdopaminergic phenotype rescued by pregnenolone. The increased legal availability of cannabis has led to a common misconception that it is a safe natural remedy for, among others, pregnancy-related ailments such as morning sickness. Emerging clinical evidence, however, indicates that prenatal cannabis exposure (PCE) predisposes offspring to various neuropsychiatric disorders linked to aberrant dopaminergic function. Yet, our knowledge of how cannabis exposure affects the maturation of this neuromodulatory system remains limited. Here, we show that male, but not female, offspring of \u03949-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)-exposed dams, a rat PCE model, exhibit extensive molecular and synaptic changes in dopaminergic neurons of the ventral tegmental area, including altered excitatory-to-inhibitory balance and switched polarity of long-term synaptic plasticity. The resulting hyperdopaminergic state leads to increased behavioral sensitivity to acute THC exposure during pre-adolescence. The neurosteroid pregnenolone, a US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved drug, rescues synaptic defects and normalizes dopaminergic activity and behavior in PCE offspring, thus suggesting a therapeutic approach for offspring exposed to cannabis during pregnancy.

Therapies targeting tumor vasculature would improve the treatment of lung metastasis, although the early changes in vascular structure are incompletely understood. Here, we show that obstructive metastatic foci in lung arterioles decrease the pulmonary vascular network. To generate a mouse model of lung metastasis activation, luciferase-expressing tumor cells were inoculated into the subiliac lymph node (SiLN) of an MXH10/Mo-lpr/lpr mouse, and metastatic tumor cells in the lungs were activated by SiLN resection. Activation of metastases was monitored by in vivo bioluminescence imaging. Pulmonary blood vessel characteristics were analyzed using ex vivo micro-computed tomography. The enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect in neovasculature after tumor cell activation was evaluated from the accumulation of intravenously injected indocyanine green (ICG)\u00a0liposomes. Metastatic foci in lung arterioles were investigated histologically. Micro-computed tomography revealed decreases in pulmonary blood vessel length, volume and number of branching nodes during the early stage of metastasis caused by metastatic foci. ICG liposome accumulation by the EPR effect was not detected. Histology identified metastatic foci in lung arterioles. The lack of an EPR effect after the formation of metastatic foci in lung arterioles makes conventional systemic chemotherapy ineffective for lung metastasis. Thus, alternative therapeutic methods of drug delivery are needed. ",
        "Elucidating the active \u03b4-opioid receptor crystal structure with peptide and small-molecule agonists. Selective activation of the \u03b4-opioid receptor (DOP) has great potential for the treatment of chronic pain, benefitting from ancillary anxiolytic and antidepressant-like effects. Moreover, DOP agonists show reduced adverse effects as compared to \u03bc-opioid receptor (MOP) agonists that are in the spotlight of the current \"opioid crisis.\" Here, we report the first crystal structures of the DOP in an activated state, in complex with two relevant and structurally diverse agonists: the potent opioid agonist peptide KGCHM07 and the small-molecule agonist DPI-287 at 2.8 and 3.3 \u00c5 resolution, respectively. Our study identifies key determinants for agonist recognition, receptor activation, and DOP selectivity, revealing crucial differences between both agonist scaffolds. Our findings provide the first investigation into atomic-scale agonist binding at the DOP, supported by site-directed mutagenesis and pharmacological characterization. These structures will underpin the future structure-based development of DOP agonists for an improved pain treatment with fewer adverse effects. ",
        "Fortification of wheat and maize flour with folic acid for population health outcomes. BACKGROUND: Folate is a B-vitamin required for DNA synthesis, methylation, and cellular division. Wheat and maize (corn) flour are staple crops consumed widely throughout the world and have been fortified with folic acid in over 80 countries to prevent neural tube defects. Folic acid fortification may be an effective strategy to improve folate status and other health outcomes in the overall population. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the health benefits and safety of folic acid fortification of wheat and maize flour (i.e. alone or in combination with other micronutrients) on folate status and health outcomes in the overall population, compared to wheat or maize flour without folic acid (or no intervention). SEARCH METHODS: We searched the following databases in March and May 2018: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE and MEDLINE In Process, Embase, CINAHL, Web of Science (SSCI, SCI), BIOSIS, Popline, Bibliomap, TRoPHI, ASSIA, IBECS, SCIELO, Global Index Medicus-AFRO and EMRO, LILACS, PAHO, WHOLIS, WPRO, IMSEAR, IndMED, and Native Health Research Database. We searched the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov for ongoing or planned studies in June 2018, and contacted authors for further information. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), with randomisation at the individual or cluster level. We also included non-RCTs and prospective observational studies with a control group; these studies were not included in meta-analyses, although their characteristics and findings were described. Interventions included wheat or maize flour fortified with folic acid (i.e. alone or in combination with other micronutrients), compared to unfortified flour (or no intervention). Participants were individuals over two years of age (including pregnant and lactating women), from any country. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently assessed study eligibility, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. MAIN RESULTS: We included 10 studies: four provided data for quantitative analyses (437 participants); five studies were randomised trials (1182 participants); three studies were non-RCTs (1181 participants, 8037 live births); two studies were interrupted time series (ITS) studies (1 study population of 2,242,438, 1 study unreported). Six studies were conducted in upper-middle-income countries (China, Mexico, South Africa), one study was conducted in a lower-middle-income country (Bangladesh), and three studies were conducted in a high-income country (Canada). Seven studies examined wheat flour fortified with folic acid alone or with other micronutrients. Three studies included maize flour fortified with folic acid alone or with other micronutrients. The duration of interventions ranged from two weeks to 36 months, and the ITS studies included postfortification periods of up to seven years. Most studies had unclear risk of bias for randomisation, blinding, and reporting, and low/unclear risk of bias for attrition and contamination.Neural tube defects: none of the included RCTs reported neural tube defects as an outcome. In one non-RCT, wheat flour fortified with folic acid and other micronutrients was associated with significantly lower occurrence of total neural tube defects, spina bifida, and encephalocoele, but not anencephaly, compared to unfortified flour (total neural tube defects risk ratio (RR) 0.32, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.21 to 0.48; 1 study, 8037 births; low-certainty evidence).Folate status: pregnant women who received folic acid-fortified maize porridge had significantly higher erythrocyte folate concentrations (mean difference (MD) 238.90 nmol/L, 95% CI 149.40 to 328.40); 1 study, 38 participants; very low-certainty evidence) and higher plasma folate (MD 14.98 nmol/L, 95% CI 9.63 to 20.33; 1 study, 38 participants; very low-certainty evidence), compared to no intervention. Women of reproductive age consuming maize flour fortified with folic acid and other micronutrients did not have higher erythrocyte folate (MD -61.80 nmol/L, 95% CI -152.98 to 29.38; 1 study, 35 participants; very low-certainty evidence) or plasma folate (MD 0.00 nmol/L, 95% CI -0.00 to 0.00; 1 study, 35 participants; very low-certainty evidence) concentrations, compared to women consuming unfortified maize flour. Adults consuming folic acid-fortified wheat flour bread rolls had higher erythrocyte folate (MD 0.66 nmol/L, 95% CI 0.13 to 1.19; 1 study, 30 participants; very low-certainty evidence) and plasma folate (MD 27.00 nmol/L, 95% CI 15.63 to 38.37; 1 study, 30 participants; very low-certainty evidence), versus unfortified flour. In two non-RCTs, serum folate concentrations were significantly higher among women who consumed flour fortified with folic acid and other micronutrients compared to women who consumed unfortified flour (MD 2.92 nmol/L, 95% CI 1.99 to 3.85; 2 studies, 657 participants; very low-certainty evidence).Haemoglobin or anaemia: in a cluster-randomised trial among children, there were no significant effects of fortified wheat flour flatbread on haemoglobin concentrations (MD 0.00 nmol/L, 95% CI -2.08 to 2.08; 1 study, 334 participants; low-certainty evidence) or anaemia (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.55; 1 study, 334 participants; low-certainty evidence), compared to unfortified wheat flour flatbread. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Fortification of wheat flour with folic acid may reduce the risk of neural tube defects; however, this outcome was only reported in one non-RCT. Fortification of wheat or maize flour with folic acid (i.e. alone or with other micronutrients) may increase erythrocyte and serum/plasma folate concentrations. Evidence is limited for the effects of folic acid-fortified wheat or maize flour on haemoglobin levels or anaemia. The effects of folic acid fortification of wheat or maize flour on other primary outcomes assessed in this review is not known. No studies reported on the occurrence of adverse effects. Limitations of this review were the small number of studies and participants, limitations in study design, and low-certainty of evidence due to how included studies were designed and reported. ",
        "Association Between Obesity-Mediated Atrial Fibrillation and Therapy With Sodium Channel Blocker Antiarrhythmic Drugs. Importance: The association between obesity, an established risk factor for atrial fibrillation (AF), and response to antiarrhythmic drugs (AADs) remains unclear. Objective: To test the hypothesis that obesity differentially mediates response to AADs in patients with symptomatic AF and in mice with diet-induced obesity (DIO) and pacing induced AF. Design, Setting, and Participants: An observational cohort study was conducted including 311 patients enrolled in a clinical-genetic registry. Mice fed a high-fat diet for 10 weeks were also evaluated. The study was conducted from January 1, 2018, to June 2, 2019. Main Outcomes and Measures: Symptomatic response was defined as continuation of the same AAD for at least 3 months. Nonresponse was defined as discontinuation of the AAD within 3 months of initiation because of poor symptomatic control of AF necessitating alternative rhythm control therapy. Outcome measures in DIO mice were pacing-induced AF and suppression of AF after 2 weeks of treatment with flecainide acetate or sotalol hydrochloride. Results: A total of 311 patients (mean [SD] age, 65 [12] years; 120 women [38.6%]) met the entry criteria and were treated with a class I or III AAD for symptomatic AF. Nonresponse to class I AADs in patients with obesity was less than in those without obesity (30% [obese] vs 6% [nonobese]; difference, 0.24; 95% CI, 0.11-0.37; P\u2009=\u2009.001). Both groups had similar symptomatic response to a potassium channel blocker AAD. On multivariate analysis, obesity, AAD class (class I vs III AAD [obese] odds ratio [OR], 4.54; 95% Wald CI, 1.84-11.20; P\u2009=\u2009.001), female vs male sex (OR, 2.31; 95% Wald CI, 1.07-4.99; P\u2009=\u2009.03), and hyperthyroidism (OR, 4.95; 95% Wald CI, 1.23-20.00; P\u2009=\u2009.02) were significant indicators of the probability of failure to respond to AADs. Pacing induced AF in 100% of DIO mice vs 30% (P\u2009<\u2009.001) in controls. Furthermore, DIO mice showed a greater reduction in AF burden when treated with sotalol compared with flecainide (85% vs 25%; P\u2009<\u2009.01). Conclusions and Relevance: Results suggest that obesity differentially mediates response to AADs in patients and in mice with AF, possibly reducing the therapeutic effectiveness of sodium channel blockers. These findings may have implications for the management of AF in patients with obesity. ",
        "Feeling the pressure: a cross-sectional study exploring feasibility of a healthcare Pop-Up for intraocular pressure measurements in shopping centres in England. OBJECTIVES: To test the hypothesis that a shopping centre Pop-Up health check combining an intraocular pressure (IOP) check with a general health check (blood pressure (BP)) is more readily accepted by the general public than an IOP check only. We investigate public awareness of IOP compared with BP and the feasibility of measuring IOP in large numbers in a Pop-Up. DESIGN: A cross-sectional study using a tailor-made healthcare Pop-Up. SETTING: The 'Feeling the Pressure' Pop-Up was sited in eight regionally-different shopping centres in England. PARTICIPANTS: Adult members of the public in shopping centres. METHODS: On one day we measured IOP only and on another measured BP and IOP. IOP was measured by Icare IC100 tonometer (Helsinki, Finland). Potential participants were asked about their awareness of IOP and BP and when they last visited their optometrist. RESULTS: More people attended the combined BP + IOP days (461; 60%; 95% CI 56% to 64%) than IOP-only days (307; 40%, 95% CI 37% to 43%) over 16 days of testing. We recorded IOP in 652 participants (median (IQR) age and IOP of 54 (42 to 68) years and 13 (11 to 15) mm Hg, respectively). Fewer people reported awareness about IOP (19%, 95% CI 16% to 23%) compared with BP (71%, 95% CI 66% to 75%). Of 768 participants, 60 (8%) reported no previous optometric eye examination and 185 (24%) reported >2 years since their most recent examination. CONCLUSIONS: Measuring IOP in large numbers of the public via a shopping centre Pop-Up is feasible. Public engagement was greater when a BP check was offered alongside an IOP check, suggesting unfamiliar health checks can be promoted by aligning them with a more familiar check. Our findings hint at strategies for public health schemes that engage the public with their eye health. ",
        "Cross-National Comparisons and Correlates of Harms From the Drinking of People With Whom You Work. BACKGROUND: While research in high-income countries (HICs) has established high costs associated with alcohol's harm to others (AHTO) in the workplace, scant attention has been paid to AHTO in the workplace in lower- or middle-income countries (LMICs). AIM: To compare estimates and predictors of alcohol's impacts upon coworkers among workers in 12 countries. METHODS: Cross-sectional surveys from 9,693 men and 8,606 women employed in Switzerland, Australia, the United States, Ireland, New Zealand, Chile, Nigeria, Lao PDR, Thailand, Vietnam, India, and Sri Lanka. Five questions were asked about harms in the past year because of coworkers' drinking: Had they (i) covered for another worker; (ii) worked extra hours; (iii) been involved in an accident or close call; or had their (iv) own productivity been reduced; or (v) ability to do their job been affected? Logistic regression and meta-analyses were estimated with 1 or more harms (vs. none) as the dependent variable, adjusting for age, sex, rurality of location, and the respondent worker's own drinking. RESULTS: Between 1% (New Zealand) and 16% (Thailand) of workers reported that they had been adversely affected by a coworker's drinking in the previous year (with most countries in the 6 to 13% range). Smaller percentages (<1% to 12%) reported being in an accident or close call due to others' drinking. Employed men were more likely to report harm from coworkers' drinking than employed women in all countries apart from the United States, New Zealand, and Vietnam, and own drinking pattern was associated with increased harm in 5 countries. Harms were distributed fairly equally across age and geographic regions. Harm from coworkers' drinking was less prevalent among men in HICs compared with LMICs. CONCLUSIONS: Workforce impairment because of drinking extends beyond the drinker in a range of countries and impacts productivity and economic development, particularly affecting men in LMICs. ",
        "Concentration-Dependent Activity of Hydromethylthionine on Cognitive Decline and Brain Atrophy in Mild to Moderate Alzheimer's Disease. BACKGROUND: Although hydromethylthionine is a potent tau aggregation inhibitor, no difference was found in either of two Phase III trials in mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease (AD) comparing doses in the range 150-250\u200amg/day with 8\u200amg/day intended as a control. OBJECTIVE: To determine how drug exposure is related to treatment response. METHODS: A sensitive plasma assay for the drug was used in a population pharmacokinetic analysis of samples from 1,162 of the 1,686 patients who participated in either of the Phase III trials with available samples and efficacy outcome data. RESULTS: There are steep concentration-response relationships for steady state plasma levels in the range 0.3-0.8\u200ang/ml at the 8\u200amg/day dose. Using a threshold based on the lower limit of quantitation of the assay on Day 1, there are highly significant differences in cognitive decline and brain atrophy in patients with above threshold plasma levels, both for monotherapy and add-on therapy, but with effect sizes reduced by half as add-on. Plasma concentrations in the range 4-21\u200ang/ml produced by the high doses are not associated with any additional benefit. CONCLUSIONS: Hydromethylthionine has pharmacological activity on brain structure and function at the 8\u200amg/day dose as monotherapy or as add-on to symptomatic treatments. This combined with a plateau at higher doses is consistent with the lack of dose-response seen in the Phase III trials. Treatment benefit is predicted to be maximal at 16\u200amg/day as monotherapy. A placebo-controlled trial in mild/moderate AD is now ongoing to confirm efficacy at this dose. ",
        "Lipid order and charge protect killer T cells from accidental death. Killer T cells (cytotoxic T lymphocytes, CTLs) maintain immune homoeostasis by eliminating virus-infected and cancerous cells. CTLs achieve this by forming an immunological synapse with their targets and secreting a pore-forming protein (perforin) and pro-apoptotic serine proteases (granzymes) into the synaptic cleft. Although the CTL and the target cell are both exposed to perforin within the synapse, only the target cell membrane is disrupted, while the CTL is invariably spared. How CTLs escape unscathed remains a mystery. Here, we report that CTLs achieve this via two protective properties of their plasma membrane within the synapse: high lipid order repels perforin and, in addition, exposed phosphatidylserine sequesters and inactivates perforin. The resulting resistance of CTLs to perforin explains their ability to kill target cells in rapid succession and to survive these encounters. Furthermore, these mechanisms imply an unsuspected role for plasma membrane organization in protecting cells from immune attack. ",
        "A Genome-wide Screen Reveals that Reducing Mitochondrial DNA Polymerase Can Promote Elimination of Deleterious Mitochondrial Mutations. A mutant mitochondrial genome arising amid the pool of mitochondrial genomes within a cell must compete with existing genomes to survive to the next generation. Even weak selective forces can bias transmission of one genome over another to affect the inheritance of mitochondrial diseases and guide the evolution of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). Studies in several systems suggested that purifying selection in the female germline reduces transmission of detrimental mitochondrial mutations [1-7]. In contrast, some selfish genomes can take over despite a cost to host fitness [8-13]. Within individuals, the outcome of competition is therefore influenced by multiple selective forces. The nuclear genome, which encodes most proteins within mitochondria, and all external regulators of mitochondrial biogenesis and dynamics can influence the competition between mitochondrial genomes [14-18], yet little is known about how this works. Previously, we established a Drosophila line transmitting two mitochondrial genomes in a stable ratio enforced by purifying selection benefiting one genome and a selfish advantage favoring the other [8]. Here, to find nuclear genes that impact mtDNA competition, we screened heterozygous deletions tiling \u223c70% of the euchromatic regions and examined their influence on this ratio. This genome-wide screen detected many nuclear modifiers of this ratio and identified one as the catalytic subunit of mtDNA polymerase gene (POLG), tam. A reduced dose of tam drove elimination of defective mitochondrial genomes. This study suggests that our approach will uncover targets for interventions that would block propagation of pathogenic mitochondrial mutations. ",
        "Impact of the pharmacist-led intervention on the control of medical cardiovascular risk factors for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease in general practice: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials. AIMS: To conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of the effectiveness of general practice-based pharmacist interventions in reducing the medical risk factors for the primary prevention of cardiovascular events. METHODS: A systemic search was undertaken in 8 databases: PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBAS, PsycINFO, Cochrane Library, CINAHL Plus, SCOPUS and Science Citation Index, with no start date up to 27 March 2019. Randomised controlled trials assessing the effectiveness of pharmacist-led interventions delivered in the general practice in reducing the medical risk factors of cardiovascular events were included in the review. The risk of bias in the studies was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. RESULTS: A total of 1604 studies were identified, with 21 randomised controlled trials (8933 patients) meeting the inclusion criteria. Fourteen studies were conducted in patients with diabetes, 7 in hypertension, 2 involving dyslipidaemia, and 2 with hypertension and diabetes together. The most frequently used interventions were medication review and medication management. The quality of the included studies was variable. Patients receiving pharmacist-led interventions were associated with a statistically significant reduction in their systolic blood pressure (-9.33 mmHg [95% Confidence Interval (CI) -13.36 to -5.30]), haemoglobin A1C (-0.76% [95% CI -1.15 to -0.37]) and low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (-15.19 mg/dL [95% CI -24.05 to -6.33]). Moreover, practice-based pharmacists' interventions were also reported to have a positive impact on patient adherence to medications. CONCLUSION: The findings of this review suggest that pharmacist-led interventions in general practice can significantly reduce the medical risk factors of cardiovascular disease events. These findings support the involvement of pharmacists as healthcare providers in managing patients with hypertension, diabetes and dyslipidaemia. ",
        "Altered chromosomal topology drives oncogenic programs in SDH-deficient GISTs. Epigenetic aberrations are widespread in cancer, yet the underlying mechanisms and causality remain poorly understood1-3. A subset of gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GISTs) lack canonical kinase mutations but instead have succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) deficiency and global DNA hyper-methylation4,5. Here, we associate this hyper-methylation with changes in genome topology that activate oncogenic programs. To investigate epigenetic alterations systematically, we mapped DNA methylation, CTCF insulators, enhancers, and chromosome topology in KIT-mutant, PDGFRA-mutant and SDH-deficient GISTs. Although these respective subtypes shared similar enhancer landscapes, we identified hundreds of putative insulators where DNA methylation replaced CTCF binding in SDH-deficient GISTs. We focused on a disrupted insulator that normally partitions a core GIST super-enhancer from the FGF4 oncogene. Recurrent loss of this insulator alters locus topology in SDH-deficient GISTs, allowing aberrant physical interaction between enhancer and oncogene. CRISPR-mediated excision of the corresponding CTCF motifs in an SDH-intact GIST model disrupted the boundary between enhancer and oncogene, and strongly upregulated FGF4 expression. We also identified a second recurrent insulator loss event near the KIT oncogene, which is also highly expressed across SDH-deficient GISTs. Finally, we established a patient-derived xenograft (PDX) from an SDH-deficient GIST that faithfully maintains the epigenetics of the parental tumour, including hypermethylation and insulator defects. This PDX model is highly sensitive to FGF receptor (FGFR) inhibition, and more so to combined FGFR and KIT inhibition, validating the functional significance of the underlying epigenetic lesions. Our study reveals how epigenetic alterations can drive oncogenic programs in the absence of canonical kinase mutations, with implications for mechanistic targeting of aberrant pathways in cancers. ",

        "Advanced maternal age compromises fetal growth and induces sex-specific changes in placental phenotype in rats. Advanced maternal age is associated with an increased risk of pregnancy complications. It programmes sex-specific cardiovascular dysfunction in rat offspring, however the intrauterine mechanisms involved remain unknown. This study in the rat assessed the impact of advanced maternal age on placental phenotype in relation to the growth of female and male fetuses. We show that relative to young (3-4 months) dams, advanced maternal age (9.5-10 months) compromises growth of both female and male fetuses but affects the placental phenotype sex-specifically. In placentas from aged versus young dams, the size of the placental transport and endocrine zones were increased and expression of Igf2 (+41%) and placental lactogen (Prl3b1: +59%) genes were upregulated in female, but not male fetuses. Placental abundance of IGF2 protein also decreased in the placenta of males only (-95%). Moreover, in placentas from aged versus young dams, glucocorticoid metabolism (11\u03b2-hsd2: +63% and 11\u03b2-hsd1: -33%) was higher in females, but lower in males (11\u03b2-hsd2: -50% and 11\u03b2-hsd1: unaltered). There was however, no change in the placental abundance of 11\u03b2-HSD2 protein in aged versus young dams regardless of fetal sex. Levels of oxidative stress in the placenta were increased in female and male fetuses (+57% and +90%, respectively) and apoptosis increased specifically in the placenta of males from aged rat dams (+700%). Thus, advanced maternal age alters placental phenotype in a sex-specific fashion. These sexually-divergent changes may play a role in determining health outcomes of female and male offspring of aged mothers. ",
        "Cardiologists' and patients' views about the informed consent process and their understanding of the anticipated treatment benefits of coronary angioplasty: A survey study. BACKGROUND: Percutaneous coronary intervention is a common revascularisation technique. Serious complications are uncommon, but death is one of them. Seeking informed consent in advance of percutaneous coronary intervention is mandatory. Research shows that percutaneous coronary intervention patients have inaccurate perceptions of risks, benefits and alternative treatments. AIM: To assess cardiologists' and patients' views about the informed consent process and anticipated treatment benefits. METHODS: Two cross-sectional, anonymous surveys were distributed in England: an electronic version to a sample of cardiologists and a paper-based version to patients recruited from 10 centres. RESULTS: A sample of 118 cardiologists and 326 patients completed the surveys. Cardiologists and patients shared similar views on the purpose of informed consent; however, over 40% of patients and over a third of cardiologists agreed with statements that patients do not understand, or remember, the information given to them. Patients placed less value than cardiologists on the consent process and over 60% agreed that patients depended on their doctor to make the decision for them. Patients' and cardiologists' views on the benefits of percutaneous coronary intervention were significantly different; notably, 60% of patients mistakenly believed that percutaneous coronary intervention was curative. CONCLUSIONS: The percutaneous coronary intervention informed consent process requires improvement to ensure that patients are more involved and accurately understand treatment benefits to make an informed decision. Redesign of the patient pathway is recommended to allow protected time for health professionals to engage in discussions using evidence-based approaches such as 'teach back' and decision support which improve patient comprehension.

        "Presence of Bisphenol A and Parabens in a Neonatal Intensive Care Unit: An Exploratory Study of Potential Sources of Exposure. BACKGROUND:. Newborns in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) are in contact with a variety of medical products whose production might include synthetic chemicals with hormonal activity. . OBJECTIVES:. Our aim was to assess the content of bisphenol A (BPA) and parabens (PBs) and the hormone-like activities of a subset of medical products commonly used in NICUs in prolonged intimate contact with NICU newborns. . METHODS:. Fifty-two NICU items were analyzed, determining the concentrations of BPA and PBs [methyl- (MeP), ethyl- (EtP), propyl- (PrP), and butylparaben (BuP)] and using the E-Screen and PALM-luciferase assays to measure the in vitro (anti-)estrogenic and (anti-)androgenic activity, respectively, of the extracts. Items found to have elevated BPA/PB content or hormone-like activities were further extracted using leaching methodologies. . RESULTS:. BPA was found in three-fifths and PBs in four-fifths of tested NICU items, and \u223c25% and \u223c10% of extracts evidenced estrogenic and anti-androgenic activity, respectively. The highest BPA content was found in the three-way stopcock (>7.000\u2009ng/g), followed by patterned transparent film dressing, gastro-duodenal feeding tubes, sterile gloves, single-lumen umbilical catheters, and intravenous (IV) infusion extension sets (concentrations ranged from 100 to 700\u2009ng/g BPA). A total PB concentration (\u2211PBs) >100\u2009ng/g was observed in several items, including light therapy protection glasses, patterned transparent film dressing, winged IV catheters, IV infusion extension sets, and textile tape. The highest estrogenic activity [>450\u2002pM estradiol equivalent (E2eq)] was found in small dummy nipples, three-way stopcocks, and patterned transparent film dressing and the highest anti-androgenic activity [>5\u2009mM procymidone equivalent units per gram (Proceq/g)] in small dummy nipples and three-way stopcocks. . DISCUSSION:. According to these findings, neonates might be exposed to multiple sources of BPA and PBs in NICUs via inhalation, dermal, oral, and IV/parenteral routes. There is a need to address the future health implications for these extremely vulnerable patients and to adopt precautionary preventive measures as a matter of urgency. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP5564.

        "Age at First Alcohol Use as a Possible Risk Factor for Adolescent Acute Alcohol Intoxication Hospital Admission in the Netherlands. BACKGROUND: The primary objective of this study is to determine whether age at first alcohol use is a determinant for adolescent acute alcohol intoxication characteristics, such as age at first acute alcohol intoxication and blood alcohol concentration (BAC) at hospital admission. Around the world, as in the Netherlands, a key aim of alcohol policy is to postpone the age at first alcohol use. This is based on cohort studies that indicate a relationship between a younger age at first alcohol use and subsequent adult alcohol use disorders. METHODS: This study was conducted using a cohort of data comprising individuals under 18\u00a0years of age. Data were collected between 2007 and 2017 by the Dutch Pediatric Surveillance System (NSCK) in order to monitor trends in admissions for acute alcohol intoxication. Multivariate linear regression analyses were used to determine the association between age at first alcohol use and acute alcohol intoxication characteristics, such as age at first acute alcohol intoxication and BAC at admission. RESULTS: This study indicates that among adolescents admitted for acute alcohol intoxication, adolescents who started drinking at\u00a0\u2264\u00a014\u00a0years of age are significantly more often female, lower educated, and raised in nontraditional family structures than adolescents who started drinking between 15 and 18\u00a0years of age. Multiple linear regression analyses indicated that age at first alcohol use, corrected for covariates, significantly predicted the age at acute alcohol intoxication and BAC at admission. The association between age at first alcohol use and age at intoxication was also found to be clinically relevant. CONCLUSIONS: Although causation cannot be implied based on the results of these analyses, the results of this study suggest that interventions delaying the age at first alcohol use could be successful in increasing the average age that adolescents are admitted to the hospital for acute alcohol intoxication.

        "Plasmodium vivax Malaria Viewed through the Lens of an Eradicated European Strain. The protozoan Plasmodium vivax is responsible for 42% of all cases of malaria outside Africa. The parasite is currently largely restricted to tropical and subtropical latitudes in Asia, Oceania, and the Americas. Though, it was historically present in most of Europe before being finally eradicated during the second half of the 20th century. The lack of genomic information on the extinct European lineage has prevented a clear understanding of historical population structuring and past migrations of P.\u00a0vivax. We used medical microscope slides prepared in 1944 from malaria-affected patients from the Ebro Delta in Spain, one of the last footholds of malaria in Europe, to generate a genome of a European P.\u00a0vivax strain. Population genetics and phylogenetic analyses placed this strain basal to a cluster including samples from the Americas. This genome allowed us to calibrate a genomic mutation rate for P.\u00a0vivax, and to estimate the mean age of the last common ancestor between European and American strains to the 15th century. This date points to an introduction of the parasite during the European colonization of the Americas. In addition, we found that some known variants for resistance to antimalarial drugs, including Chloroquine and Sulfadoxine, were already present in this European strain, predating their use. Our results shed light on the evolution of an important human pathogen and illustrate the value of antique medical collections as a resource for retrieving genomic information on pathogens from the past.

        "Barrier bednets target malaria vectors and expand the range of usable insecticides. Transmission of Plasmodium falciparum malaria parasites occurs when nocturnal Anopheles mosquito vectors feed on human blood. In Africa, where malaria burden is highest, bednets treated with pyrethroid insecticide were highly effective in preventing mosquito bites and reducing transmission, and essential to achieving unprecedented reductions in malaria until 2015 (ref. 1). Since then, progress has stalled2, and with insecticidal bednets losing efficacy against pyrethroid-resistant Anopheles vectors3,4, methods that restore performance are urgently needed to eliminate any risk of malaria returning to the levels seen before their widespread use throughout sub-Saharan Africa5. Here, we show that the primary malaria vector Anopheles gambiae is targeted and killed by small insecticidal net barriers positioned above a standard bednet in a spatial region of high mosquito activity but zero contact with sleepers, opening the way for deploying many more insecticides on bednets than is currently possible. Tested against wild pyrethroid-resistant A. gambiae in Burkina Faso, pyrethroid bednets with organophosphate barriers achieved significantly higher killing rates than bednets alone. Treated barriers on untreated bednets were equally effective, without significant loss of personal protection. Mathematical modelling of transmission dynamics predicted reductions in clinical malaria incidence with barrier bednets that matched those of 'next-generation' nets recommended by the World Health Organization against resistant vectors. Mathematical models of mosquito-barrier interactions identified alternative barrier designs to increase performance. Barrier bednets that overcome insecticide resistance are feasible using existing insecticides and production technology, and early implementation of affordable vector control tools is a realistic prospect.

        "Plasma protein patterns as comprehensive indicators of health. Proteins are effector molecules that mediate the functions of genes1,2 and modulate comorbidities3-10, behaviors and drug treatments11. They represent an enormous potential resource for personalized, systemic and data-driven diagnosis, prevention, monitoring and treatment. However, the concept of using plasma proteins for individualized health assessment across many health conditions simultaneously has not been tested. Here, we show that plasma protein expression patterns strongly encode for multiple different health states, future disease risks and lifestyle behaviors. We developed and validated protein-phenotype models for 11\u2009different health indicators: liver fat, kidney filtration, percentage body fat, visceral fat mass, lean body mass, cardiopulmonary fitness, physical activity, alcohol consumption, cigarette smoking, diabetes risk and primary cardiovascular event risk. The analyses were prospectively planned, documented and executed at scale on archived samples and clinical data, with a total of ~85\u2009million protein measurements in 16,894\u2009participants. Our proof-of-concept study demonstrates that protein expression patterns reliably encode for many different health issues, and that large-scale protein scanning12-16 coupled with machine learning is viable for the development and future simultaneous delivery of multiple measures of health. We anticipate that, with further validation and the addition of more protein-phenotype models, this approach could enable a single-source, individualized so-called liquid health check. ",
        "Activation of Kappa Opioid Receptor Regulates the Hypothermic Response to Calorie Restriction and Limits Body Weight Loss. Mammals maintain a nearly constant core body temperature (Tb) by balancing heat production and heat dissipation. This comes at a high metabolic cost that is sustainable if adequate calorie intake is maintained. When nutrients are scarce or experimentally reduced such as during calorie restriction (CR), endotherms can reduce energy expenditure by lowering Tb [1-6]. This adaptive response conserves energy, limiting the loss of body weight due to low calorie intake [7-10]. Here we show that this response is regulated by the kappa opioid receptor (KOR). CR is associated with increased hypothalamic levels of the endogenous opioid Leu-enkephalin, which is derived from the KOR agonist precursor dynorphin [11]. Pharmacological inhibition of KOR, but not of the delta or the mu opioid receptor subtypes, fully blocked CR-induced hypothermia and increased weight loss during CR independent of calorie intake. Similar results were seen with DIO mice subjected to CR. In contrast, inhibiting KOR did not change Tb in animals fed ad libitum (AL). Chemogenetic inhibition of KOR neurons in the hypothalamic preoptic area reduced the CR-induced hypothermia, whereas chemogenetic activation of prodynorphin-expressing neurons in the arcuate or the parabrachial nucleus lowered Tb. These data indicate that KOR signaling is a pivotal regulator of energy homeostasis and can affect body weight during dieting by modulating Tb and energy expenditure. ",
        "Prenatal androgen exposure and transgenerational susceptibility to polycystic ovary syndrome. How obesity and elevated androgen levels in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) affect their offspring is unclear. In a Swedish nationwide register-based cohort and a clinical case-control study from Chile, we found that daughters of mothers with PCOS were more likely to be diagnosed with PCOS. Furthermore, female mice (F0) with PCOS-like traits induced by late-gestation injection of dihydrotestosterone, with and without obesity, produced female F1-F3 offspring with PCOS-like reproductive and metabolic phenotypes. Sequencing of single metaphase II oocytes from F1-F3 offspring revealed common and unique altered gene expression across all generations. Notably, four genes were also differentially expressed in serum samples from daughters in the case-control study and unrelated women with PCOS. Our findings provide evidence of transgenerational effects in female offspring of mothers with PCOS and identify possible candidate genes for the prediction of a PCOS phenotype in future generations.

        "Development of an integrated fingerstick blood self-collection device for radiation countermeasures. We report the development of system for packaging critical components of the traditional collection kit to make an integrated fingerstick blood collector for self-collecting blood samples of 100 \u03bcl or more for radiation countermeasures. A miniaturized vacuum tube system (VacuStor system) has been developed to facilitate liquid reagent storage, simple operation and reduced sample contamination. Vacuum shelf life of the VacuStor tube has been analyzed by the ideal gas law and gas permeation theory, and multiple ways to extend vacuum shelf life beyond one year have been demonstrated, including low temperature storage, Parylene barrier coating and container vacuum bag sealing. Self-collection was also demonstrated by healthy donors without any previous fingerstick collection experience. The collected blood samples showed similar behavior in terms of gene expression and cytogenetic biodosimetry assays comparing to the traditionally collected samples. The integrated collector may alleviate the sample collection bottleneck for radiation countermeasures following a large-scale nuclear event, and may be useful in other applications with its self-collection and liquid reagent sample preprocessing capabilities.

        "A Randomized, Controlled Trial of Ebola Virus Disease Therapeutics. BACKGROUND: Although several experimental therapeutics for Ebola virus disease (EVD) have been developed, the safety and efficacy of the most promising therapies need to be assessed in the context of a randomized, controlled trial. METHODS: We conducted a trial of four investigational therapies for EVD in the Democratic Republic of Congo, where an outbreak began in August 2018. Patients of any age who had a positive result for Ebola virus RNA on reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction assay were enrolled. All patients received standard care and were randomly assigned in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to intravenous administration of the triple monoclonal antibody ZMapp (the control group), the antiviral agent remdesivir, the single monoclonal antibody MAb114, or the triple monoclonal antibody REGN-EB3. The REGN-EB3 group was added in a later version of the protocol, so data from these patients were compared with those of patients in the ZMapp group who were enrolled at or after the time the REGN-EB3 group was added (the ZMapp subgroup). The primary end point was death at 28 days. RESULTS: A total of 681 patients were enrolled from November 20, 2018, to August 9, 2019, at which time the data and safety monitoring board recommended that patients be assigned only to the MAb114 and REGN-EB3 groups for the remainder of the trial; the recommendation was based on the results of an interim analysis that showed superiority of these groups to ZMapp and remdesivir with respect to mortality. At 28 days, death had occurred in 61 of 174 patients (35.1%) in the MAb114 group, as compared with 84 of 169 (49.7%) in the ZMapp group (P\u2009=\u20090.007), and in 52 of 155 (33.5%) in the REGN-EB3 group, as compared with 79 of 154 (51.3%) in the ZMapp subgroup (P\u2009=\u20090.002). A shorter duration of symptoms before admission and lower baseline values for viral load and for serum creatinine and aminotransferase levels each correlated with improved survival. Four serious adverse events were judged to be potentially related to the trial drugs. CONCLUSIONS: Both MAb114 and REGN-EB3 were superior to ZMapp in reducing mortality from EVD. Scientifically and ethically sound clinical research can be conducted during disease outbreaks and can help inform the outbreak response.

        "Human confidence judgments reflect reliability-based hierarchical integration of contextual information. Our immediate observations must be supplemented with contextual information to resolve ambiguities. However, the context is often ambiguous too, and thus it should be inferred itself to guide behavior. Here, we introduce a novel hierarchical task (airplane task) in which participants should infer a higher-level, contextual variable to inform probabilistic inference about a hidden dependent variable at a lower level. By controlling the reliability of past sensory evidence through varying the sample size of the observations, we find that humans estimate the reliability of the context and combine it with current sensory uncertainty to inform their confidence reports. Behavior closely follows inference by probabilistic message passing between latent variables across hierarchical state representations. Commonly reported inferential fallacies, such as sample size insensitivity, are not present, and neither did participants appear to rely on simple heuristics. Our results reveal uncertainty-sensitive integration of information at different hierarchical levels and temporal scales. ",
        "Sequential Ipilimumab After Chemoradiotherapy in Curative-Intent Treatment of Patients With Node-Positive Cervical Cancer. Importance: Despite standard chemoradiotherapy (CRT), most women with lymph node (LN)-positive cervical cancer experience disease recurrence. Immunotherapy is being investigated in the up-front treatment setting. Objectives: To assess the safety of sequential immunotherapy after CRT and to investigate human papillomavirus (HPV) genotype and HLA allele status on survival and programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) expression before and after CRT and sequential immunotherapy. Design, Setting, and Participants: This prospective phase 1 trial conducted in 29 Gynecology Oncology Cooperative Group member institutions enrolled participants from December 18, 2012, to August 31, 2016, with a 14.8-month median follow-up and translational end points. Thirty-four women with International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stage IB2 to IVA cervical cancer with positive pelvic LNs, para-aortic LNs, or both were enrolled; 13 did not receive ipilimumab and were excluded from the analysis. Data were analyzed from January 21 to April 4, 2018. Interventions: Treatment consisted of 6 weekly doses of cisplatin, 40 mg/m2, concurrent with radiotherapy. After completion of chemotherapy, sequential ipilimumab was given every 21 days for 4 doses. Two dosage levels of ipilimumab, 3 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg, were studied to identify the maximum tolerated dose. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary end point was safety, and the secondary end points were overall survival and progression-free survival. Exploratory end points included HPV genotype, HLA allele status, and PD-1 expression measured in peripheral blood. Results: The median age of the 32 participants included in the intent-to-treat analysis was 50 (range, 26-61) years, and 22 patients (69%) were white. Of the 21 patients who received ipilimumab, all had positive pelvic LN, and 6 (29%) had positive para-aortic LNs. All patients completed CRT, and of the 21 patients who received at least 2 cycles of ipilimumab, 18 (86%) completed 4 cycles of ipilimumab, and 3 (14%) completed 2 cycles. The maximum tolerated dose was 10 mg/kg. Two of the 21 patients (9.5%) who received ipilimumab had self-limiting grade 3 toxic effects (lipase increase; dermatitis). The 12-month overall survival was 90%, and progression-free survival was 81%. Human papillomavirus genotype and HLA subtype were not associated with progression-free survival or overall survival. T cells expressing PD-1 increased after CRT, and levels were sustained with ipilimumab. Conclusions and Relevance: This study's findings suggest that the use of immunotherapy after CRT for curative-intent treatment of patients with cervical cancer is tolerable and effective. The results indicated that PD-1 was upregulated after CRT and sustained with sequential ipilimumab therapy. These immune findings may help guide future therapies to harness the activated T-cell phenotype in patients with node-positive cervical cancer. ",
        "Metagenome-wide association study of gut microbiome revealed novel aetiology of rheumatoid arthritis in the Japanese population. OBJECTIVE: The causality and pathogenic mechanism of microbiome composition remain elusive in many diseases, including autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA). This study aimed to elucidate gut microbiome's role in RA pathology by a comprehensive metagenome-wide association study (MWAS). METHODS: We conducted MWAS of the RA gut microbiome in the Japanese population (ncase=82, ncontrol=42) by using whole-genome shotgun sequencing of high depth (average 13\u2009Gb per sample). Our MWAS consisted of three major bioinformatic analytic pipelines (phylogenetic analysis, functional gene analysis and pathway analysis). RESULTS: Phylogenetic case-control association tests showed high abundance of multiple species belonging to the genus Prevotella (e.g., Prevotella denticola) in the RA case metagenome. The non-linear machine learning method efficiently deconvoluted the case-control phylogenetic discrepancy. Gene functional assessments showed that the abundance of one redox reaction-related gene (R6FCZ7) was significantly decreased in the RA metagenome compared with controls. A variety of biological pathways including those related to metabolism (e.g., fatty acid biosynthesis and glycosaminoglycan degradation) were enriched in the case-control comparison. A population-specific link between the metagenome and host genome was identified by comparing biological pathway enrichment between the RA metagenome and the RA genome-wide association study results. No apparent discrepancy in alpha or beta diversities of metagenome was found between RA cases and controls. CONCLUSION: Our shotgun sequencing-based MWAS highlights a novel link among the gut microbiome, host genome and pathology of RA, which contributes to our understanding of the microbiome's role in RA aetiology.

        "Evidence accumulation during a sensorimotor decision task revealed by whole-brain imaging. Although animals can accumulate sensory evidence over considerable time scales to appropriately select behavior, little is known about how the vertebrate brain as a whole accomplishes this. In this study, we developed a new sensorimotor decision-making assay in larval zebrafish based on whole-field visual motion. Fish responded by swimming in the direction of perceived motion, such that the latency to initiate swimming and the fraction of correct turns were modulated by motion strength. Using whole-brain functional imaging, we identified neural activity relevant to different stages of the decision-making process, including the momentary evaluation and accumulation of sensory evidence. This activity is distributed in functional clusters across different brain regions and is characterized by a wide range of time constants. In addition, we found that the caudal interpeduncular nucleus (IPN), a circular structure located ventrally on the midline of the brain, reliably encodes the left and right turning rates. ",
        "Annexin A6 modulates TBC1D15/Rab7/StARD3 axis to control endosomal cholesterol export in NPC1 cells. Cholesterol accumulation in late endosomes is a prevailing phenotype of Niemann-Pick type C1 (NPC1) mutant cells. Likewise, annexin A6 (AnxA6) overexpression induces a phenotype reminiscent of NPC1 mutant cells. Here, we demonstrate that this cellular cholesterol imbalance is due to AnxA6 promoting Rab7 inactivation via TBC1D15, a Rab7-GAP. In NPC1 mutant cells, AnxA6 depletion and eventual Rab7 activation was associated with peripheral distribution and increased mobility of late endosomes. This was accompanied by an enhanced lipid accumulation in lipid droplets in an acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT)-dependent manner. Moreover, in AnxA6-deficient NPC1 mutant cells, Rab7-mediated rescue of late endosome-cholesterol export required the StAR-related lipid transfer domain-3 (StARD3) protein. Electron microscopy revealed a significant increase of membrane contact sites (MCS) between late endosomes and ER in NPC1 mutant cells lacking AnxA6, suggesting late endosome-cholesterol transfer to the ER via Rab7 and StARD3-dependent MCS formation. This study identifies AnxA6 as a novel gatekeeper that controls cellular distribution of late endosome-cholesterol via regulation of a Rab7-GAP and MCS formation. ",
        "Enrichment of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells in the zebrafish kidney. Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) maintain the entire blood system throughout life and are utilized in therapeutic approaches for blood diseases. Prospective isolation of highly purified HSCs is crucial to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying regulation of HSCs. The zebrafish is an elegant genetic model for the study of hematopoiesis due to its many unique advantages. It has not yet been possible, however, to purify HSCs in adult zebrafish due to a lack of specific HSC markers. Here we show the enrichment of zebrafish HSCs by a combination of two HSC-related transgenes, gata2a:GFP and runx1:mCherry. The double-positive fraction of gata2a:GFP and runx1:mCherry (gata2a+ runx1+) was detected at approximately 0.16% in the kidney, the main hematopoietic organ in teleosts. Transcriptome analysis revealed that gata2a+ runx1+ cells showed typical molecular signatures of HSCs, including upregulation of gata2b, gfi1aa, runx1t1, pbx1b, and meis1b. Transplantation assays demonstrated that long-term repopulating HSCs were highly enriched within the gata2a+ runx1+ fraction. In contrast, colony-forming assays showed that gata2a- runx1+ cells abundantly contain erythroid- and/or myeloid-primed progenitors. Thus, our purification method of HSCs in the zebrafish kidney is useful to identify molecular cues needed to regulate self-renewal and differentiation of HSCs. ",
        "The NLRP3 inflammasome is involved with the pathogenesis of Mayaro virus. Mayaro virus (MAYV) is an arbovirus that circulates in Latin America and is emerging as a potential threat to public health. Infected individuals develop Mayaro fever, a severe inflammatory disease characterized by high fever, rash, arthralgia, myalgia and headache. The disease is often associated with a prolonged arthralgia mediated by a chronic inflammation that can last months. Although the immune response against other arboviruses, such as chikungunya virus (CHIKV), dengue virus (DENV) and Zika virus (ZIKV), has been extensively studied, little is known about the pathogenesis of MAYV infection. In this study, we established models of MAYV infection in macrophages and in mice and found that MAYV can replicate in bone marrow-derived macrophages and robustly induce expression of inflammasome proteins, such as NLRP3, ASC, AIM2, and Caspase-1 (CASP1). Infection performed in macrophages derived from Nlrp3-/-, Aim2-/-, Asc-/-and Casp1/11-/-mice indicate that the NLRP3, but not AIM2 inflammasome is essential for production of inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1\u03b2. We also determined that MAYV triggers NLRP3 inflammasome activation by inducing reactive oxygen species (ROS) and potassium efflux. In vivo infections performed in inflammasome-deficient mice indicate that NLRP3 is involved with footpad swelling, inflammation and pain, establishing a role of the NLRP3 inflammasome in the MAYV pathogenesis. Accordingly, we detected higher levels of caspase1-p20, IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18 in the serum of MAYV-infected patients as compared to healthy individuals, supporting the participation of the NLRP3-inflammasome during MAYV infection in humans.

        "Imaging suicidal thoughts and behaviors: a comprehensive review of 2 decades of neuroimaging studies. Identifying brain alterations that contribute to suicidal thoughts and behaviors (STBs) are important to develop more targeted and effective strategies to prevent suicide. In the last decade, and especially in the last 5 years, there has been exponential growth in the number of neuroimaging studies reporting structural and functional brain circuitry correlates of STBs. Within this narrative review, we conducted a comprehensive review of neuroimaging studies of STBs published to date and summarize the progress achieved on elucidating neurobiological substrates of STBs, with a focus on converging findings across studies. We review neuroimaging evidence across differing mental disorders for structural, functional, and molecular alterations in association with STBs, which converges particularly in regions of brain systems that subserve emotion and impulse regulation including the ventral prefrontal cortex (VPFC) and dorsal PFC (DPFC), insula and their mesial temporal, striatal and posterior connection sites, as well as in the connections between these brain areas. The reviewed literature suggests that impairments in medial and lateral VPFC regions and their connections may be important in the excessive negative and blunted positive internal states that can stimulate suicidal ideation, and that impairments in a DPFC and inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) system may be important in suicide attempt behaviors. A combination of VPFC and DPFC system disturbances may lead to very high risk circumstances in which suicidal ideation is converted to lethal actions via decreased top-down inhibition of behavior and/or maladaptive, inflexible decision-making and planning. The dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and insula may play important roles in switching between these VPFC and DPFC systems, which may contribute to the transition from suicide thoughts to behaviors. Future neuroimaging research of larger sample sizes, including global efforts, longitudinal designs, and\u00a0careful consideration of developmental stages, and sex and gender, will facilitate more effectively targeted preventions and interventions to reduce loss of life to suicide.

        "Default mode network anatomy and function is linked to pediatric concussion recovery. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether anatomical and functional brain features relate to key persistent post-concussion symptoms (PPCS) in children recovering from mild traumatic brain injuries (mTBI), and whether such brain indices can predict individual recovery from PPCS. METHODS: One hundred and ten children with mixed recovery following mTBI were seen at the concussion clinic at Neurology department Alberta Children's Hospital. The primary outcome was the Post-Concussion Symptom Inventory (PCSI, parent proxy). Sleep disturbance scores (PCSI subdomain) and the Neurocognition Index (CNS Vital Signs) were also measured longitudinally. PPCS was assessed at 4\u00a0weeks postinjury and 8-10\u00a0weeks postinjury. Gray matter volumes were assessed using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and voxel-based morphometry at 4 weeks postinjury. Functional connectivity was estimated at the same timepoint using resting-state MRI. Two complementary machine learning methods were used to assess if the combination of gray matter and functional connectivity indices carried meaningful prognostic information. RESULTS: Higher scores on a composite index of sleep disturbance, including fatigue, were associated with converging decreases in gray matter volume and local functional connectivity in two key nodes of the default mode network: the posterior cingulate cortex and the medial prefrontal cortex. Sleep-related disturbances also significantly correlated with reductions in functional connectivity between these brain regions. The combination of structural and functional brain indices associated to individual variations in the default mode network accurately predicted clinical outcomes at follow-up (area under the curve\u00a0=\u00a00.86). INTERPRETATION: These results highlight that the function-structure profile of core default mode regions underpins sleep-related problems following mTBI and carries meaningful prognostic information for pediatric concussion recovery.

        "S100A9 extends lifespan in insulin deficiency. Tens of millions suffer from insulin deficiency (ID); a defect leading to severe metabolic imbalance and death. The only means for management of ID is insulin therapy; yet, this approach is sub-optimal and causes life-threatening hypoglycemia. Hence, ID represents a great medical and societal challenge. Here we report that S100A9, also known as Calgranulin B or Myeloid-Related Protein 14 (MRP14), is a leptin-induced circulating cue exerting beneficial anti-diabetic action. In murine models of ID, enhanced expression of S100A9 alone (i.e. without administered insulin and/or leptin) slightly improves hyperglycemia, and normalizes key metabolic defects (e.g. hyperketonemia, hypertriglyceridemia, and increased hepatic fatty acid oxidation; FAO), and extends lifespan by at least a factor of two. Mechanistically, we report that Toll-Like Receptor 4 (TLR4) is required, at least in part, for the metabolic-improving and pro-survival effects of S100A9. Thus, our data identify the S100A9/TLR4 axis as a putative target for ID care. ",
        "A projection specific logic to sampling visual inputs in mouse superior colliculus. Using sensory information to trigger different behaviors relies on circuits that pass through brain regions. The rules by which parallel inputs are routed to downstream targets are poorly understood. The superior colliculus mediates a set of innate behaviors, receiving input from >30 retinal ganglion cell types and projecting to behaviorally important targets including the pulvinar and parabigeminal nucleus. Combining transsynaptic circuit tracing with in vivo and ex vivo electrophysiological recordings, we observed a projection-specific logic where each collicular output pathway sampled a distinct set of retinal inputs. Neurons projecting to the pulvinar or the parabigeminal nucleus showed strongly biased sampling from four cell types each, while six others innervated both pathways. The visual response properties of retinal ganglion cells correlated well with those of their disynaptic targets. These findings open the possibility that projection-specific sampling of retinal inputs forms a basis for the selective triggering of behaviors by the superior colliculus. ",
        "The Flavonoid Metabolite 2,4,6-Trihydroxybenzoic Acid Is a CDK Inhibitor and an Anti-Proliferative Agent: A Potential Role in Cancer Prevention. Flavonoids have emerged as promising compounds capable of preventing colorectal cancer (CRC) due to their anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. It is hypothesized that the metabolites of flavonoids are primarily responsible for the observed anti-cancer effects owing to the unstable nature of the parent compounds and their degradation by colonic microflora. In this study, we investigated the ability of one metabolite, 2,4,6-trihydroxybenzoic acid (2,4,6-THBA) to inhibit Cyclin Dependent Kinase (CDK) activity and cancer cell proliferation. Using in vitro kinase assays, we demonstrated that 2,4,6-THBA dose-dependently inhibited CDKs 1, 2 and 4 and in silico studies identified key amino acids involved in these interactions. Interestingly, no significant CDK inhibition was observed with the structurally related compounds 3,4,5-trihydroxybenzoic acid (3,4,5-THBA) and phloroglucinol, suggesting that orientation of the functional groups and specific amino acid interactions may play a role in inhibition. We showed that cellular uptake of 2,4,6-THBA required the expression of functional SLC5A8, a monocarboxylic acid transporter. Consistent with this, in cells expressing functional SLC5A8, 2,4,6-THBA induced CDK inhibitory proteins p21Cip1 and p27Kip1 and inhibited cell proliferation. These findings, for the first time, suggest that the flavonoid metabolite 2,4,6-THBA may mediate its effects through a CDK- and SLC5A8-dependent pathway contributing to the prevention of CRC. ",
        "WNT signaling and AHCTF1 promote oncogenic MYC expression through super-enhancer-mediated gene gating. WNT signaling activates MYC expression in cancer cells. Here we report that this involves an oncogenic super-enhancer-mediated tethering of active MYC alleles to nuclear pores to increase transcript export rates. As the decay of MYC transcripts is more rapid in the nucleus than in the cytoplasm, the oncogenic super-enhancer-facilitated export of nuclear MYC transcripts expedites their escape from the nuclear degradation system in colon cancer cells. The net sum of this process, as supported by computer modeling, is greater cytoplasmic MYC messenger RNA levels in colon cancer cells than in wild type cells. The cancer-cell-specific gating of MYC is regulated by AHCTF1 (also known as ELYS), which connects nucleoporins to the oncogenic super-enhancer via \u03b2-catenin. We conclude that WNT signaling collaborates with chromatin architecture to post-transcriptionally dysregulate the expression of a canonical cancer driver. ",
        "The phenanthrene derivative PJ34 exclusively eradicates human pancreatic cancer cells in xenografts. Recent reports demonstrate an exclusive eradication of a variety of human cancer cells by the modified phenanthridine PJ34. Their eradication during mitosis is attributed to PJ34 preventing NuMA clustering in the mitotic spindle poles of human malignant cells, which is crucial for their normal mitosis. Here, the effect of PJ34 is tested in cell cultures and xenografts of human pancreas ductal adenocarcinoma. Evidence is presented for a substantial reduction (80-90%) of PANC1 cancer cells in xenografts, measured 30 days after the treatment with PJ34 has been terminated. Benign cells infiltrated into the PANC1 tumors (stroma) were not affected. Growth, weight gain and behavior of the treated nude mice were not impaired during, and 30 days after the treatment with PJ34. The efficient eradication of malignant cells in human pancreas cancer xenografts presents a new model of pancreas cancer treatment. ",
        "Association Between Marijuana Use and Risk of Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis. Importance: Marijuana use is common and growing in the United States amid a trend toward legalization. Exposure to tobacco smoke is a well-described preventable cause of many cancers; the association of marijuana use with the development of cancer is not clear. Objective: To assess the association of marijuana use with cancer development. Data Sources: A search of PubMed, Embase, PsycINFO, MEDLINE, and the Cochrane Library was conducted on June 11, 2018, and updated on April 30, 2019. A systematic review and meta-analysis of studies published from January 1, 1973, to April 30, 2019, and references of included studies were performed, with data analyzed from January 2 through October 4, 2019. Study Selection: English-language studies involving adult marijuana users and reporting cancer development. The search strategy contained the following 2 concepts linked together with the AND operator: marijuana OR marihuana OR tetrahydrocannabinol OR cannabinoid OR cannabis; AND cancer OR malignancy OR carcinoma OR tumor OR neoplasm. Data Extraction and Synthesis: Two reviewers independently reviewed titles, abstracts, and full-text articles; 3 reviewers independently assessed study characteristics and graded evidence strength by consensus. Main Outcomes and Measures: Rates of cancer in marijuana users, with ever use defined as at least 1 joint-year exposure (equivalent to 1 joint per day for 1 year), compared with nonusers. Meta-analysis was conducted if there were at least 2 studies of the same design addressing the same cancer without high risk of bias when heterogeneity was low to moderate for the following 4 cancers: lung, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, oral squamous cell carcinoma, and testicular germ cell tumor (TGCT), with comparisons expressed as odds ratios (ORs) with 95% CIs. Results: Twenty-five English-language studies (19 case-control, 5 cohort, and 1 cross-sectional) were included; few studies (n\u2009=\u20092) were at low risk of bias. In pooled analysis of case-control studies, ever use of marijuana was not associated with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma or oral cancer. In pooled analysis of 3 case-control studies, more than 10 years of marijuana use (joint-years not reported) was associated with TGCT (OR, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.03-1.81; P\u2009=\u2009.03; I2\u2009=\u20090%) and nonseminoma TGCT (OR, 1.85; 95% CI, 1.10-3.11; P\u2009=\u2009.04; I2\u2009=\u20090%). Evaluations of ever use generally found no association with cancers, but exposure levels were low and poorly defined. Findings for lung cancer were mixed, confounded by few marijuana-only smokers, poor exposure assessment, and inadequate adjustment; meta-analysis was not performed for several outcomes. Conclusions and Relevance: Low-strength evidence suggests that smoking marijuana is associated with developing TGCT; its association with other cancers and the consequences of higher levels of use are unclear. Long-term studies in marijuana-only smokers would improve understanding of marijuana's association with lung, oral, and other cancers. Trial Registration: PROSPERO identifier: CRD42018102457. ",
        "Early Mobilization of Infants Intubated for Acute Respiratory Failure. BACKGROUND: Early mobility in the intensive care unit is being promoted as a way to improve outcomes but has not been studied in young infants. OBJECTIVE: To determine the safety of a holding intervention for infants intubated for respiratory failure. METHODS: Infants less than 6 months of age intubated for respiratory failure underwent a holding intervention in which a caretaker held the infant at least twice a day once the infant was medically stabilized. Rates of adverse events were compared with historical controls matched by age and Pediatric Index of Mortality 2 score. Vital signs before and during holding were recorded to assess for physiologic tolerance. RESULTS: Twenty-four infants with a total of 158 holding interventions were studied. Mean holding duration was 99 minutes. Twenty holding interventions were terminated early, most commonly because of agitation. The 24 historical controls had 1 unplanned extubation and 2 arterial catheter removals. The intervention group had no unplanned extubations, inadvertent central catheter removals, or urinary catheter removals and had 1 arterial catheter removal that was not associated with holding. Vital signs before and during holding were similar. There were no differences between the control and intervention groups in duration of intubation (7.3 vs 6.0 days, P = .98), length of intensive care unit stay (9.1 vs 9.0 days, P = .52), or length of hospital stay (11.5 vs 12.5 days, P = .28). CONCLUSIONS: Holding intubated infants in the intensive care unit was well tolerated, without an increase in adverse events. ",
        "Placebos in Australian general practice: A national survey of physician use, beliefs and attitudes. BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: International surveys indicate that placebo use by general practitioners (GPs) is remarkably high, but usage in Australia is currently unknown. To address this, the aim of this study was to examine rates of use and beliefs about placebos in Australian general practice. METHOD: This study was conducted using a cross-sectional internet-based survey of a random sample of Australian GPs from a national database between February and April 2018. In total, 641 GPs opened the email invitation and 136 (18%) took part. RESULTS: Thirty-nine percent of GPs had used an inert placebo, and 77% had used an active placebo. GPs primarily used placebos because they believed placebos could provide genuine benefit and viewed themselves as having a strong role in shaping patients' expectations. Of concern, antibiotics were the most common type of active placebo prescribed. DISCUSSION: Placebo use by Australian GPs is fairly common, particularly the use of active placebos. Ethical issues surrounding the prescription of placebos in general practice are discussed. ",
        "False-Positive Results in a Population-Based Colorectal Screening Program: Cumulative Risk from 2000 to 2017 with Biennial Screening. BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to estimate the cumulative risk of a false-positive (FP) result in a fecal occult blood test (FOBT) through 7 screening rounds and to identify its associated factors in a population-based colorectal cancer screening program. METHODS: Retrospective cohort study, which included participants ages 50 to 69 years of a colorectal cancer screening program in Catalonia, Spain. During this period, 2 FOBTs were used (guaiac and immunochemical). A discrete-time survival model was performed to identify risk factors of receiving a positive FOBT with no high-risk adenoma or colorectal cancer in the follow-up colonoscopy. We estimated the probability of having at least 1 FP over 7 screening rounds. RESULTS: During the period of 2000 to 2017, the cumulative FP risk was 16.3% (IC95%: 14.6%-18.3%), adjusted by age, sex, and type of test. The median number of screens was 2. Participants who began screening at age 50 years had a 7.3% [95% confidence interval (CI), 6.35-8.51] and a 12.4% (95% CI, 11.00-13.94) probability of an FP with 4 screening rounds of guaiac-based test and immunochemical test, respectively. Age, the fecal immunochemical test, first screening, and number of personal screens were factors associated with an FP result among screenees. CONCLUSIONS: The cumulative risk of an FP in colorectal screening using FOBT seems acceptable as the colonoscopy, with its high accuracy, lengthens the time until additional colorectal screening is required, while complication rates remain low. IMPACT: It is useful to determine the cumulative FP risk in cancer screening for both advising individuals and for health resources planning. ",
        "Perinatal outcomes following bariatric surgery between a first and second pregnancy: a population data linkage study. OBJECTIVES: To describe the population of women having bariatric surgery and compare the pregnancy outcomes for women having bariatric surgery with a non-bariatric surgery population having a first and second pregnancy. DESIGN: Population-based record linkage study. SETTING: New South Wales (NSW), Australia. POPULATION: All women aged 15-45\u00a0years with a hospital record in NSW (2002-2014) and all women giving birth in NSW (1994-2015; n\u00a0=\u00a01\u00a0606\u00a0737 women). METHODS: Pregnancy and birth outcomes were compared between first and second pregnancies using repeated-measures logistic regression and paired Student's t-tests. Bariatric and non-bariatric groups were also compared. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Maternal diabetes, preterm birth (<37\u00a0weeks of gestation) and large for gestational age. RESULTS: There was a 13-fold increase in hospitalisations for primary bariatric surgery during 2002-2014. Compared with the general birthing population, women who had bariatric surgery experienced higher rates of hypertension, diabetes, and preterm birth. Among women who had bariatric surgery between a first and second pregnancy, there were reduced rates of hypertension (OR 0.39, 95%\u00a0CI 0.29-0.53), spontaneous preterm birth (OR 0.37, 95%\u00a0CI 0.16-0.86), infants that were large for gestational age (OR 0.63, 95%\u00a0CI 0.44-0.88), and the admission of infants to a special care nursery or neonatal intensive care (OR 0.64, 95%\u00a0CI 0.46-0.90) in the second pregnancy. Rates for small-for-gestational age and gestational diabetes following surgery were 8.3 and 11.4%, respectively CONCLUSIONS: Bariatric surgery between a first and second pregnancy was associated with reductions in obesity-related adverse pregnancy outcomes. Bariatric surgery performed for the management of obesity in accordance with current clinical criteria is associated with improved pregnancy outcomes in a subsequent pregnancy. TWEETABLE ABSTRACT: Bariatric surgery for obesity may improve pregnancy and birth outcomes in a subsequent pregnancy. ",
        "Distinct tumor microenvironments of lytic and blastic bone metastases in prostate cancer patients. The most common metastatic lesions of prostate cancer are in bone and can be classified into three distinct pathology subtypes: lytic, blastic, and an indeterminate mixture of both. We investigated a cohort of decalcified formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE) patient specimens from the bone that contained metastatic prostate cancer with lytic or blastic features. These tissue sections were utilized for immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining, isolation of RNA for gene expression, and Digital Spatial Profiling (DSP) of changes in both the tumor and microenvironment. A diverse set of unique immune cell populations and signaling pathways to both lytic and blastic types of prostate cancer metastases were present. In blastic lesions immune cells were enriched for pSTAT3 and components of the JAK-STAT pathway. In lytic-type lesions, immune cells were enriched for pAKT activity and components of the PI3K-AKT pathway. Enrichment for immune checkpoints including PD-L1, B7-H4, OX40L, and IDO-1 were identified in blastic prostate cancer, providing new therapeutic targets for patients with bone metastases. Biopsies could guide selection of patients into appropriate therapeutic interventions based on protein levels and RNA expression of desired targets in metastatic disease. Molecular pathology has been an excellent complement to the diagnosis, treatment, and management of primary tumors and could be successfully extended to patients with metastatic lesions. ",
        "Phenolic compounds from coffee by-products modulate adipogenesis-related inflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and insulin resistance in adipocytes, via insulin/PI3K/AKT signaling pathways. The aim of this study was to evaluate the inhibitory potential of aqueous extracts from coffee silverskin (CSE) and husk (CHE) and their main phenolics on adipogenesis, obesity-related inflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and insulin resistance, in vitro. Coffee by-products extracts (31-500\u202f\u03bcg\u202fmL-1) and pure phenolics (100\u202f\u03bcmol\u202fL-1) reduced lipid accumulation and increased mitochondrial activity in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Also reduced the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase and cyclooxygenase-2 and diminished secretion of pro-inflammatory factors in LPS-stimulated RAW2643.7 macrophages. Cytokine release diminished (tumor necrosis factor \u03b1: 23-57%; monocyte chemoattractant protein 1: 42-60%; interleukin-6: 30-39%) and adiponectin increased (7-13- fold) in adipocytes treated with macrophage-conditioned media. ROS scavenging and activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor \u03b3 coactivator 1-\u03b1 pathway counteracted mitochondrial dysfunction. Increases in insulin receptor (1.4 to 4-fold), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (2 to 3-fold) and protein kinase B (1.3 to 3-fold) phosphorylation, in conjunction with a decrease in serine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 1, evoked glucose transporter 4 translocation (8-15-fold) and glucose uptake (44-85%). CSE and CHE phenolics inhibited adipogenesis and elicited adipocytes browning. Suppressing macrophages-adipocytes interaction alleviated inflammation-triggered mitochondrial dysfunction and insulin resistance. CSE and CHE are beneficial in reducing adipogenesis and inflammation-related disorders. ",
        "A Multiplexed Serologic Test for Diagnosis of Lyme Disease for Point-of-Care Use. Single multiplexed assays could replace the standard 2-tiered (STT) algorithm recommended for the laboratory diagnosis of Lyme disease if they perform with a specificity and a sensitivity superior or equal to those of the STT algorithm. We used human serum rigorously characterized to be sera from patients with acute- and convalescent-phase early Lyme disease, Lyme arthritis, and posttreatment Lyme disease syndrome, as well as the necessary controls (n\u2009=\u2009241 samples), to select the best of 12 Borrelia burgdorferi proteins to improve our microfluidic assay (mChip-Ld). We then evaluated its serodiagnostic performance in comparison to that of a first-tier enzyme immunoassay and the STT algorithm. We observed that more antigens became positive as Lyme disease progressed from early to late stages. We selected three antigens (3Ag) to include in the mChip-Ld: VlsE and a proprietary synthetic 33-mer peptide (PepVF) to capture sensitivity in all disease stages and OspC for early Lyme disease. With the specificity set at 95%, the sensitivity of the mChip-Ld with 3Ag ranged from 80% (95% confidence interval [CI], 56% to 94%) and 85% (95% CI, 74% to 96%) for two panels of serum from patients with early Lyme disease and was 100% (95% CI, 83% to 100%) for serum from patients with Lyme arthritis; the STT algorithm detected early Lyme disease in the same two panels of serum from patients with early Lyme disease with a sensitivity of 48.5% and 75% and Lyme arthritis in serum from patients with Lyme arthritis with a sensitivity of 100%, and the specificity was 97.5% to 100%. The mChip-Ld platform outperformed the STT algorithm according to sensitivity. These results open the door for the development of a single, rapid, multiplexed diagnostic test for point-of-care use that can be designed to identify the Lyme disease stage. ",
        "HMCES Functions in the Alternative End-Joining Pathway of the DNA DSB Repair during Class Switch Recombination in B Cells. HMCES (5hmC binding, embryonic stem cell-specific-protein), originally identified as a protein capable of binding 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), an epigenetic modification generated by TET proteins, was previously reported to covalently crosslink to DNA at abasic sites via a conserved cysteine. We show here that Hmces-deficient mice display normal hematopoiesis without global alterations in 5hmC. HMCES specifically enables DNA double-strand break repair through the microhomology-mediated alternative-end-joining (Alt-EJ) pathway during class switch recombination (CSR) in B cells, and HMCES deficiency leads to a significant defect in CSR. HMCES mediates Alt-EJ through its SOS-response-associated-peptidase domain (SRAPd), a function that requires DNA binding but is independent of its autopeptidase and DNA-crosslinking activities. We show that HMCES is recruited to switch regions of the immunoglobulin locus and provide a potential structural basis for the interaction of HMCES with long DNA overhangs generated by Alt-EJ during CSR. Our studies provide further evidence for a specialized role for HMCES in DNA repair. ",
        "Prospective virome analyses in young children at increased genetic risk for type 1 diabetes. Viruses are implicated in autoimmune destruction of pancreatic islet \u03b2 cells, which results in insulin deficiency and type 1 diabetes (T1D)1-4. Certain enteroviruses can infect \u03b2 cells in vitro5, have been detected in the pancreatic islets of patients with T1D6 and have shown an association with T1D in meta-analyses4. However, establishing consistency in findings across studies has proven difficult. Obstacles to convincingly linking RNA viruses to islet autoimmunity may be attributed to rapid viral mutation rates, the cyclical periodicity of viruses7 and the selection of variants with altered pathogenicity and ability to spread in populations. \u03b2 cells strongly express cell-surface coxsackie and adenovirus receptor (CXADR) genes, which can facilitate enterovirus infection8. Studies of human pancreata and cultured islets have shown significant variation in enteroviral virulence to \u03b2 cells between serotypes and within the same serotype9,10. In this large-scale study of known eukaryotic DNA and RNA viruses in stools from children, we evaluated fecally shed viruses in relation to islet autoimmunity and T1D. This study showed that prolonged enterovirus B rather than independent, short-duration enterovirus B infections may be involved in the development of islet autoimmunity, but not T1D, in some young children. Furthermore, we found that fewer early-life human mastadenovirus C infections, as well as CXADR rs6517774, independently correlated with islet autoimmunity. ",
        "Prevalence of Prediabetes Among Adolescents and Young Adults in the United States, 2005-2016. Importance: Individuals with prediabetes are at increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and cardiovascular disease. The incidence and prevalence of type 2 diabetes in the US adolescent population have increased in the last decade. Therefore, it is important to monitor the prevalence of prediabetes and varying levels of glucose tolerance to assess the future risk of type 2 diabetes in the youngest segment of the population. Objective: To examine the prevalence of impaired fasting glucose (IFG), impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), and increased glycated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels in US adolescents (aged 12-18 years) and young adults (aged 19-34 years) without diabetes. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cross-sectional analyses of the 2005-2016 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey assessed a population-based sample of adolescents and young adults who were not pregnant, did not have diabetes, and had measured fasting plasma glucose, 2-hour plasma glucose after a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test, and HbA1c levels. Analysis began in April 2017. Main Outcomes and Measures: Impaired fasting glucose was defined as fasting plasma glucose of 100 mg/dL to less than 126 mg/dL, IGT as 2-hour plasma glucose of 140 mg/dL to less than 200 mg/dL, and increased HbA1c level as HbA1c level between 5.7% and 6.4%. The prevalence of IFG, isolated IFG, IGT, isolated IGT, increased HbA1c level, isolated increased HbA1c level, and prediabetes (defined as having IFG, IGT, or increased HbA1c level) were estimated. Fasting insulin levels and cardiometabolic risk factors across glycemic abnormality phenotypes were also compared. Obesity was defined as having age- and sex-specific body mass index (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) in the 95th percentile or higher in adolescents or 30 or higher in young adults. Results: Of 5786 individuals, 2606 (45%) were adolescents and 3180 (55%) were young adults. Of adolescents, 50.6% (95% CI, 47.6%-53.6%) were boys, and 50.6% (95% CI, 48.8%-52.4%) of young adults were men. Among adolescents, the prevalence of prediabetes was 18.0% (95% CI, 16.0%-20.1%) and among young adults was 24.0% (95% CI, 22.0%-26.1%). Impaired fasting glucose constituted the largest proportion of prediabetes, with prevalence of 11.1% (95% CI, 9.5%-13.0%) in adolescents and 15.8% (95% CI, 14.0%-17.9%) in young adults. In multivariable logistic models including age, sex, race/ethnicity, and body mass index, the predictive marginal prevalence of prediabetes was significantly higher in male than in female individuals (22.5% [95% CI, 19.5%-25.4%] vs 13.4% [95% CI, 10.8%-16.5%] in adolescents and 29.1% [95% CI, 26.4%-32.1%] vs 18.8% [95% CI, 16.5%-21.3%] in young adults). Prediabetes prevalence was significantly higher in individuals with obesity than in those with normal weight (25.7% [95% CI, 20.0%-32.4%] vs 16.4% [95% CI, 14.3%-18.7%] in adolescents and 36.9% [95% CI, 32.9%-41.1%] vs 16.6% [95% CI, 14.2%-19.4%] in young adults). Compared with persons with normal glucose tolerance, adolescents and young adults with prediabetes had significantly higher non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, systolic blood pressure, central adiposity, and lower insulin sensitivity (P\u2009<\u2009.05 for all). Conclusions and Relevance: In the United States, about 1 of 5 adolescents and 1 of 4 young adults have prediabetes. The adjusted prevalence of prediabetes is higher in male individuals and in people with obesity. Adolescents and young adults with prediabetes also present an unfavorable cardiometabolic risk profile, putting them both at increased risk of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. ",
        "Gabapentinoid treatment promotes corticospinal plasticity and regeneration following murine spinal cord injury. Axon regeneration failure causes neurological deficits and long-term disability after spinal cord injury (SCI). Here, we found that the \u03b12\u03b42 subunit of voltage-gated calcium channels negatively regulates axon growth and regeneration of corticospinal neurons, the cells that originate the corticospinal tract. Increased \u03b12\u03b42 expression in corticospinal neurons contributed to loss of corticospinal regrowth ability during postnatal development and after SCI. In contrast, \u03b12\u03b42 pharmacological blockade through gabapentin administration promoted corticospinal structural plasticity and regeneration in adulthood. Using an optogenetic strategy combined with in vivo electrophysiological recording, we demonstrated that regenerating corticospinal axons functionally integrate into spinal circuits. Mice administered gabapentin recovered upper extremity function after cervical SCI. Importantly, such recovery relies on reorganization of the corticospinal pathway, as chemogenetic silencing of injured corticospinal neurons transiently abrogated recovery. Thus, targeting \u03b12\u03b42 with a clinically relevant treatment strategy aids repair of motor circuits after SCI. ",
        "Hepatocyte gene expression and DNA methylation as ancestry-dependent mechanisms in African Americans. African Americans (AAs) are an admixed population with widely varying proportion of West African ancestry (WAA). Here we report the correlation of WAA to gene expression and DNA methylation in AA-derived hepatocytes, a cell type important in disease and drug response. We perform mediation analysis to test whether methylation is a mediator of the effect of ancestry on expression. GTEx samples and a second cohort are used as validation. One hundred and thirty-one genes are associated with WAA (FDR\u2009<\u20090.10), 28 of which replicate and represent 220 GWAS phenotypes. Among PharmGKB pharmacogenes, VDR, PTGIS, ALDH1A1, CYP2C19, and P2RY1 nominally associate with WAA (p\u2009<\u20090.05). We find 1037 WAA-associated, differentially methylated regions (FDR\u2009<\u20090.05), with hypomethylated genes enriched in drug-response pathways. In conclusion, WAA contributes to variability in hepatocyte expression and DNA methylation with identified genes previously implicated for diseases disproportionately affecting AAs, including cardiovascular (PTGIS, PLAT) and renal (APOL1) disease, and drug response (CYP2C19).

        "Molecular determinants of chaperone interactions on MHC-I for folding and antigen repertoire selection. The interplay between a highly polymorphic set of MHC-I alleles and molecular chaperones shapes the repertoire of peptide antigens displayed on the cell surface for T cell surveillance. Here, we demonstrate that the molecular chaperone TAP-binding protein related (TAPBPR) associates with a broad range of partially folded MHC-I species inside the cell. Bimolecular fluorescence complementation and deep mutational scanning reveal that TAPBPR recognition is polarized toward the \u03b12 domain of the peptide-binding groove, and depends on the formation of a conserved MHC-I disulfide epitope in the \u03b12 domain. Conversely, thermodynamic measurements of TAPBPR binding for a representative set of properly conformed, peptide-loaded molecules suggest a narrower MHC-I specificity range. Using solution NMR, we find that the extent of dynamics at \"hotspot\" surfaces confers TAPBPR recognition of a sparsely populated MHC-I state attained through a global conformational change. Consistently, restriction of MHC-I groove plasticity through the introduction of a disulfide bond between the \u03b11/\u03b12 helices abrogates TAPBPR binding, both in solution and on a cellular membrane, while intracellular binding is tolerant of many destabilizing MHC-I substitutions. Our data support parallel TAPBPR functions of 1) chaperoning unstable MHC-I molecules with broad allele-specificity at early stages of their folding process, and 2) editing the peptide cargo of properly conformed MHC-I molecules en route to the surface, which demonstrates a narrower specificity. Our results suggest that TAPBPR exploits localized structural adaptations, both near and distant to the peptide-binding groove, to selectively recognize discrete conformational states sampled by MHC-I alleles, toward editing the repertoire of displayed antigens.

        "Reduction in Glycated Hemoglobin and Daily Insulin Dose Alongside Circadian Clock Upregulation in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes Consuming a Three-Meal Diet: A Randomized Clinical Trial. OBJECTIVE: In type 2 diabetes, insulin resistance and progressive \u03b2-cell failure require treatment with high insulin doses, leading to weight gain. Our aim was to study whether a three-meal diet (3Mdiet) with a carbohydrate-rich breakfast may upregulate clock gene expression and, as a result, allow dose reduction of insulin, leading to weight loss and better glycemic control compared with an isocaloric six-meal diet (6Mdiet). RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Twenty-eight volunteers with diabetes (BMI 32.4 \u00b1 5.2 kg/m2 and HbA1c 8.1 \u00b1 1.1% [64.5 \u00b1 11.9 mmol/mol]) were randomly assigned to 3Mdiet or 6Mdiet. Body weight, glycemic control, continuous glucose monitoring (CGM), appetite, and clock gene expression were assessed at baseline, after 2 weeks, and after 12 weeks. RESULTS: 3Mdiet, but not 6Mdiet, led to a significant weight loss (-5.4 \u00b1 0.9 kg) (P < 0.01) and decreased HbA1c (-12 mmol/mol [-1.2%]) (P < 0.0001) after 12 weeks. Fasting glucose and daily and nocturnal glucose levels were significantly lower on the 3Mdiet. CGM showed a significant decrease in the time spent in hyperglycemia only on the 3Mdiet. Total daily insulin dose was significantly reduced by 26 \u00b1 7 units only on the 3Mdiet. There was a significant decrease in the hunger and cravings only in the 3Mdiet group. Clock genes exhibited oscillation, increased expression, and higher amplitude on the 3Mdiet compared with the 6Mdiet. CONCLUSIONS: A 3Mdiet, in contrast to an isocaloric 6Mdiet, leads to weight loss and significant reduction in HbA1c, appetite, and overall glycemia, with a decrease in daily insulin. Upregulation of clock genes seen in this diet intervention could contribute to the improved glucose metabolism. ",
        "Protein Intake Greater than the RDA Differentially Influences Whole-Body Lean Mass Responses to Purposeful Catabolic and Anabolic Stressors: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis. Under stressful conditions such as energy restriction (ER) and physical activity, the RDA for protein of 0.8\u00a0g \u00b7 kg-1 \u00b7 d-1 may no longer be an appropriate recommendation. Under catabolic or anabolic conditions, higher protein intakes are proposed to attenuate the loss or increase the gain of whole-body lean mass, respectively. No known published meta-analysis compares protein intakes greater than the RDA with intakes at the RDA. Therefore, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the effects of protein intakes greater than the RDA, compared with at the RDA, on changes in whole-body lean mass. Three researchers independently screened 1520 articles published through August 2018 using the PubMed, Scopus, CINAHL, and Cochrane databases, with additional articles identified in published systematic review articles. Randomized, controlled, parallel studies \u22656 wk long with apparently healthy adults (\u226519 y) were eligible for inclusion. Data from 18 studies resulting in 22 comparisons of lean mass changes were included in the final overall analysis. Among all comparisons, protein intakes greater than the RDA benefitted changes in lean mass relative to consuming the RDA [weighted mean difference (95% CI): 0.32 (0.01, 0.64) kg, n\u00a0=\u00a022 comparisons]. In the subgroup analyses, protein intakes greater than the RDA attenuated lean mass loss after ER [0.36 (0.06, 0.67) kg, n\u00a0=\u00a014], increased lean mass after resistance training (RT) [0.77 (0.23, 1.31) kg, n\u00a0=\u00a03], but did not differentially affect changes in lean mass [0.08 (-0.59, 0.75) kg, n\u00a0=\u00a07] under nonstressed conditions (no ER\u00a0+\u00a0no RT). Protein intakes greater than the RDA beneficially influenced changes in lean mass when adults were purposefully stressed by the catabolic stressor of dietary ER with and without the anabolic stressor of RT. The RDA for protein is adequate to support lean mass in adults during nonstressed states. This review was registered at www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero as CRD 42018106532. ",
        "Impact of universal antiretroviral treatment eligibility on rapid treatment initiation among young adolescents with HIV in sub-Saharan Africa. BACKGROUND: Young adolescents with perinatally-acquired HIV are at risk for poor care outcomes. We examined whether universal antiretroviral treatment (ART) eligibility policies (Treat All) improved rapid ART initiation following care enrollment among 10-14-year-olds in seven sub-Saharan African countries. METHODS: Regression discontinuity analysis and data for 6,912 10-14-year-old patients were used to estimate changes in rapid ART initiation (within 30 days of care enrollment) following adoption of Treat All policies in two groups of countries: Uganda and Zambia (policy adopted in 2013) and Burundi, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Kenya, Malawi, and Rwanda (policy adopted in 2016). RESULTS: There were immediate increases in rapid ART initiation among young adolescents after national adoption of Treat All. Increases were greater in countries adopting the policy in 2016, compared with those adopting it in 2013: 23.4 percentage points (pp) (95%CI: 13.9-32.8) vs. 11.2pp (95%CI: 2.5-19.9). However, the rate of increase in rapid ART initiation among 10-14-year-olds rose appreciably in countries with earlier treatment expansions, from 1.5pp per year before Treat All to 7.7pp afterwards. CONCLUSIONS: Universal ART eligibility has increased rapid treatment initiation among young adolescents enrolling in HIV care. Further research should assess their retention in care and viral suppression under Treat All. ",
        "The proteasome regulator PI31 is required for protein homeostasis, synapse maintenance, and neuronal survival in mice. Proteasome-mediated degradation of intracellular proteins is essential for cell function and survival. The proteasome-binding protein PI31 (Proteasomal Inhibitor of 31kD) promotes 26S assembly and functions as an adapter for proteasome transport in axons. As localized protein synthesis and degradation is especially critical in neurons, we generated a conditional loss of PI31 in spinal motor neurons (MNs) and cerebellar Purkinje cells (PCs). A cKO of PI31 in these neurons caused axon degeneration, neuronal loss, and progressive spinal and cerebellar neurological dysfunction. For both MNs and PCs, markers of proteotoxic stress preceded axonal degeneration and motor dysfunction, indicating a critical role for PI31 in neuronal homeostasis. The time course of the loss of MN and PC function in developing mouse central nervous system suggests a key role for PI31 in human neurodegenerative diseases. ",
        "4-Repeat tau seeds and templating subtypes as brain and CSF biomarkers of frontotemporal lobar degeneration. To address the need for more meaningful biomarkers of tauopathies, we have developed an ultrasensitive tau seed amplification assay (4R RT-QuIC) for the 4-repeat (4R) tau aggregates of progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), corticobasal degeneration (CBD), and other diseases with 4R tauopathy. The assay detected seeds in 106-109-fold dilutions of 4R tauopathy brain tissue but was orders of magnitude less responsive to brain with other types of tauopathy, such as from Alzheimer's disease cases. The analytical sensitivity for synthetic 4R tau fibrils was\u2009~\u200950\u00a0fM or 2\u00a0fg/sample. A novel dimension of this tau RT-QuIC testing was the identification of three disease-associated classes of 4R tau seeds; these classes were revealed by conformational variations in the in vitro amplified tau fibrils as detected by thioflavin T fluorescence amplitudes and FTIR spectroscopy. Tau seeds were detected in postmortem cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from all neuropathologically confirmed PSP and CBD cases but not in controls. CSF from living subjects had weaker seeding activities; however, mean assay responses for cases clinically diagnosed as PSP and CBD/corticobasal syndrome were significantly higher than those from control cases. Altogether, 4R RT-QuIC provides a practical cell-free method of detecting and subtyping pathologic 4R tau aggregates as biomarkers. ",
        "Eomes and Brachyury control pluripotency exit and germ-layer segregation by changing the chromatin state. The first lineage specification of pluripotent mouse epiblast segregates neuroectoderm (NE) from mesoderm and definitive endoderm (ME) by mechanisms that are not well understood. Here we demonstrate that the induction of ME gene programs critically relies on the T-box transcription factors Eomesodermin (also known as Eomes) and Brachyury, which concomitantly repress pluripotency and NE gene programs. Cells deficient in these T-box transcription factors retain pluripotency and differentiate to NE lineages despite the presence of ME-inducing signals transforming growth factor \u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2)/Nodal and Wnt. Pluripotency and NE gene networks are additionally repressed by ME factors downstream of T-box factor induction, demonstrating a redundancy in program regulation to safeguard mutually exclusive lineage specification. Analyses of chromatin revealed that accessibility of ME enhancers depends on T-box factor binding, whereas NE enhancers are accessible and already activation primed at pluripotency. This asymmetry of the chromatin landscape thus explains the default differentiation of pluripotent cells to NE in the absence of ME induction that depends on activating and repressive functions of Eomes and Brachyury.

        "Impacts of past abrupt land change on local biodiversity globally. Abrupt land change, such as deforestation or agricultural intensification, is a key driver of biodiversity change. Following abrupt land change, local biodiversity often continues to be influenced through biotic lag effects. However, current understanding of how terrestrial biodiversity is impacted by past abrupt land changes is incomplete. Here we show that abrupt land change in the past continues to influence present species assemblages globally. We combine geographically and taxonomically broad data on local biodiversity with quantitative estimates of abrupt land change detected within time series of satellite imagery from 1982 to 2015. Species richness and abundance were 4.2% and 2% lower, respectively, and assemblage composition was altered at sites with an abrupt land change compared to unchanged sites, although impacts differed among taxonomic groups. Biodiversity recovered to levels comparable to unchanged sites after >10 years. Ignoring delayed impacts of abrupt land changes likely results in incomplete assessments of biodiversity change. ",
        "Comparative In Vitro Evaluation of Antibacterial and Osteogenic Activity of Polysaccharide and Flavonoid Fractions Isolated from the leaves of Saussurea controversa. The osteogenic, cytotoxic, and antibacterial activities of polysaccharide (PS-SC) and flavonoid (F-SC) fractions isolated from the leaves extract of Saussurea controversa were studied in vitro. F-SC consists of the five quercetin glycosides in the ratio 2:8:10:1:4, which were isolated from the leaves extract of S. controversa and have been characterized previously. PS-SC was first isolated from the leaves extract of S. controversa and has been described. PS-SC consists in 30 compounds is characterized by a high degree of heterogeneity with a heterogeneity index of 19.74. The Mw and Mn of PS-SC were 108.6 and 5.5 kDa, respectively. Structural fragments are represented by galactose, arabinose, xylose, glucose, uronic acids, mannose, and rhamnose in a 10.1:3.3:2.2:2.1:1.7:0.9:0.5 molar ratio. F-SC as compared with PS-SC showed in vitro microbicidal (50 g/L) and better bacteriostatic (6.25 g/L versus 25 g/L of PS-SC) effects against the 24-h growth of Staphylococcus aureus strain 209 P and a 21-day absence of cytotoxicity on human adipose-derived multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells (hAMMSCs). Both fractions (PS-SC>F-SC) at doses of 10-50 mg/L stimulated differentiation of hAMMSCs into secreting osteoblasts accompanied by local mineralization of extracellular matrix. These fractions of S. controversa and especially F-SC, might be promising peroral drugs in the complex treatment of bone fractures and for prophylaxis of their infectious complications. ",
        "Lack Of Access To Specialists Associated With Mortality And Preventable Hospitalizations Of Rural Medicare Beneficiaries. People living in rural areas have worse health outcomes than their urban counterparts do. Understanding what factors account for this could inform policy interventions for reducing rural-urban disparities in health. We examined a nationally representative survey of Medicare beneficiaries with one or more complex chronic conditions, which represented 61\u00a0percent of rural and 57\u00a0percent of urban Medicare beneficiaries. We found that rural residence was associated with a 40\u00a0percent higher preventable hospitalization rate and a 23\u00a0percent higher mortality rate, compared to urban residence. Having one or more specialist visits during the previous year was associated with a 15.9\u00a0percent lower preventable hospitalization rate and a 16.6\u00a0percent lower mortality rate for people with chronic conditions, after we controlled for having one or more primary care provider visits. Access to specialists accounted for 55\u00a0percent and 40\u00a0percent of the rural-urban difference in preventable hospitalizations and mortality, respectively. Medicare should consider interventions for rural beneficiaries who lack access to specialist care to reduce rural-urban disparities in health outcomes. ",
        "Quantitative In\u00a0Vivo Proteomics of Metformin Response in Liver Reveals AMPK-Dependent and -Independent Signaling Networks. Metformin is the front-line treatment for type 2 diabetes worldwide. It acts via effects on glucose and lipid metabolism in metabolic tissues, leading to enhanced insulin sensitivity. Despite significant effort, the molecular basis for metformin response remains poorly understood, with a limited number of specific biochemical pathways studied to date. To broaden our understanding of hepatic metformin response, we combine phospho-protein enrichment in tissue from genetically engineered mice with a quantitative proteomics platform to enable the discovery and quantification of basophilic kinase substrates in\u00a0vivo. We define proteins whose binding to 14-3-3 are acutely regulated by metformin treatment and/or loss of the serine/threonine kinase, LKB1. Inducible binding of 250 proteins following metformin treatment is observed, 44% of which proteins bind in a manner requiring LKB1. Beyond AMPK, metformin activates protein kinase D and MAPKAPK2 in an LKB1-independent manner, revealing additional kinases that may mediate aspects of metformin response. Deeper analysis uncovered substrates of AMPK in endocytosis and calcium homeostasis. ",
        "ERAP1 enzyme-mediated trimming and structural analyses of MHC I-bound precursor peptides yield novel insights into antigen processing and presentation. Endoplasmic reticulum aminopeptidase 1 (ERAP1) and ERAP2 critically shape the major histocompatibility complex I (MHC I) immunopeptidome. The ERAPs remove N-terminal residues from antigenic precursor peptides and generate optimal-length peptides (i.e. 8-10-mers) to fit into the MHC class I groove. It is therefore intriguing that MHC class I molecules can present N-terminally extended peptides on the cell surface that can elicit CD8+ T-cell responses. This observation likely reflects gaps in our understanding of how antigens are processed by the ERAP enzymes. To better understand ERAPs' function in antigen processing, here we generated a nested set of N-terminally extended 10-20-mer peptides (RA) .                         n.                      AAKKKYCL covalently bound to the human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-B*0801. We used X-ray crystallography, thermostability assessments, and an ERAP1-trimming assay to characterize these complexes. The X-ray structures determined at 1.40-1.65 \u00c5 resolutions revealed that the residue extensions (RA) .                         n.                      unexpectedly protrude out of the A pocket of HLA-B*0801, whereas the AAKKKYCL core of all peptides adopts similar, bound conformations. HLA-B*0801 residue 62 was critical to open the A pocket. We also show that HLA-B*0801 and antigenic precursor peptides form stable complexes. Finally, ERAP1-mediated trimming of the MHC I-bound peptides required a minimal length of 14 amino acids. We propose a mechanistic model explaining how ERAP1-mediated trimming of MHC I-bound peptides in cells can generate peptides of canonical as well as noncanonical lengths that still serve as stable MHC I ligands. Our results provide a framework to better understand how the ERAP enzymes influence the MHC I immunopeptidome. ",
        "Human Colon-on-a-Chip Enables Continuous In\u00a0Vitro Analysis of Colon Mucus Layer Accumulation and Physiology. BACKGROUND & AIMS: The mucus layer in the human colon protects against commensal bacteria and pathogens, and defects in its unique bilayered structure contribute to intestinal disorders, such as ulcerative colitis. However, our understanding of colon physiology is limited by the lack of in\u00a0vitro models that replicate human colonic mucus layer structure and function. Here, we investigated if combining organ-on-a-chip and organoid technologies can be leveraged to develop a human-relevant in\u00a0vitro model of colon mucus physiology. METHODS: A human colon-on-a-chip (Colon Chip) microfluidic device lined by primary patient-derived colonic epithelial cells was used to recapitulate mucus bilayer formation, and to visualize mucus accumulation in living cultures noninvasively. RESULTS: The Colon Chip supports spontaneous goblet cell differentiation and accumulation of a mucus bilayer with impenetrable and penetrable layers, and a thickness similar to that observed in the human colon, while maintaining a subpopulation of proliferative epithelial cells. Live imaging of the mucus layer formation on-chip showed that stimulation of the colonic epithelium with prostaglandin E2, which is increased during inflammation, causes rapid mucus volume expansion via an Na-K-Cl cotransporter 1 ion channel-dependent increase in its hydration state, but no increase in de novo mucus secretion. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows the production of colonic mucus with a physiologically relevant bilayer structure in\u00a0vitro, which can be analyzed in real time noninvasively. The Colon Chip may offer a new preclinical tool to analyze the role of mucus in human intestinal homeostasis as well as diseases, such as ulcerative colitis and cancer. ",
        "Review of obesity and periodontitis: an epidemiological view. Obesity and periodontitis are among the most common non-communicable diseases, and epidemiological studies report the influence of obesity in the onset and progression of periodontitis. Data indicate that increased body mass index, waist circumference, percentage of subcutaneous body fat, and serum lipid levels are associated with increased risk to develop periodontitis. The underlying biological mechanisms of this association involve adipose tissue-derived cytokines, such as tumour necrosis factor-\u03b1 and interleukin-6, which affect whole-body metabolism and contribute to the development of a low-grade systemic inflammation. Multiple studies report a positive association between these two diseases across diverse populations. Obesity does not appear to impair the success of periodontal therapy. However, currently available evidence is variable and therefore inconclusive. Despite the limited evidence about recommendations on treatment planning, oral healthcare professionals need to be aware of the complexity of obesity to counsel their patients about the importance of maintaining healthy body weight and performing good oral hygiene procedures.

        "Specific Inhibition of the NLRP3 Inflammasome as an Antiinflammatory Strategy in Cystic Fibrosis. Rationale: Cystic fibrosis (CF) pulmonary disease is characterized by chronic infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa and sustained neutrophil-dominant inflammation. The lack of effective antiinflammatory therapies for people with CF (PWCF) represents a significant challenge.Objectives: To identify altered immunometabolism in the CF neutrophil and investigate the feasibility of specific inhibition of the NLRP3 (NOD-, LRR-, and pyrin domain-containing protein 3) inflammasome as a CF antiinflammatory strategy in vivo.Methods: Key markers of increased aerobic glycolysis, known as a Warburg effect, including cytosolic PKM2 (pyruvate kinase M2), phosphorylated PKM2, succinate, HIF-1\u03b1 (hypoxia-inducible factor-1\u03b1), lactate, and the IL-1\u03b2 precursor pro-IL-1\u03b2, as well as caspase-1 activity and processing of pro-IL-1\u03b2 to IL-1\u03b2 by the NLRP3 inflammasome, were measured in neutrophils from blood and airway secretions from healthy control subjects (n\u2009=\u200912), PWCF (n\u2009=\u200916), and PWCF after double-lung transplantation (n\u2009=\u20096). The effects of specific inhibition of NLRP3 on airway inflammation and bacterial clearance in a murine CF model were subsequently assessed in vivo.Measurements and Main Results: CF neutrophils display increased aerobic glycolysis in the systemic circulation. This effect is driven by low-level endotoxemia, unaffected by CFTR (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator) modulation, and resolves after transplant. The increased pro-IL-1\u03b2 produced is processed to its mature active form in the LPS-rich CF lung by the NLRP3 inflammasome via caspase-1. Specific NLRP3 inhibition in vivo with MCC950 inhibited IL-1\u03b2 in the lungs of CF mice (P\u2009<\u20090.0001), resulting in significantly reduced airway inflammation and improved Pseudomonas clearance (P\u2009<\u20090.0001).Conclusions: CF neutrophil immunometabolism is altered in response to inflammation. NLRP3 inflammasome inhibition may have an antiinflammatory and anti-infective role in CF. ",
        "Requiem for the STAT Test: Automation and Point of Care Testing. OBJECTIVE: Quick turnaround of laboratory test results is needed for medical and administrative reasons. Historically, laboratory tests have been requested as routine or STAT. With a few exceptions, a total turnaround time of 90 minutes has been the usually acceptable turnaround time for STAT tests. METHODS: We implemented front-end automation and autoverification and eliminated batch testing for routine tests. We instituted on-site intraoperative testing for selected analytes and employed point of care (POC) testing judiciously. The pneumatic tube system for specimen transport was expanded. RESULTS: The in-laboratory turnaround time was reduced to 45 minutes for more than 90% of tests that could reasonably be ordered STAT. With rare exceptions, the laboratory no longer differentiates between routine and STAT testing. Having a single queue for all tests has improved the efficiency of the laboratory. CONCLUSION: It has been recognized in manufacturing that batch processing and having multiple queues for products are inefficient. The same principles were applied to laboratory testing, which resulted in improvement in operational efficiency and elimination of STAT tests. We propose that the target for in-laboratory turnaround time for STAT tests, if not all tests, be 45 minutes or less for more than 90% of specimens. ",
        "Development of a Paper-Based Sensor Compatible with a Mobile Phone for the Detection of Common Iron Formulas Used in Fortified Foods within Resource-Limited Settings. A lack of quality control tools limits the enforcement of fortification policies. In alignment with the World Health Organization's ASSURED criteria (affordable, sensitive, specific, user-friendly, rapid and robust, equipment-free, and deliverable), a paper-based assay that interfaces with a smartphone application for the quantification of iron fortificants is presented. The assay is based on the Ferrozine colorimetric method. The reaction started after deposition of the 5 \u00b5L aqueous sample and drying. After developing color, pixel intensity values were obtained using a smartphone camera and image processing software or a mobile application, Nu3px. From these values, the actual iron concentration from ferrous sulfate and ferrous fumarate was calculated. The limits of detection, quantification, linearity, range, and errors (systematic and random) were ascertained. The paper-based values from real samples (wheat flour, nixtamalized corn flour, and infant formula) were compared against atomic emission spectroscopy. The comparison of several concentrations of atomic iron between the spectrophotometric and paper-based assays showed a strong positive linear correlation (y = 47.01x + 126.18; R2 = 0.9932). The dynamic range (5.0-100 \u00b5g/mL) and limit of detection (3.691 \u00b5g/mL) of the paper-based assay are relevant for fortified food matrices. Random and systematic errors were 15.9% and + 8.65 \u00b5g/g food, respectively. The concept can be applied to limited-resource settings to measure iron in fortified foods. ",
        "Creating a neuroprosthesis for active tactile exploration of textures. Intracortical microstimulation (ICMS) of the primary somatosensory cortex (S1) can produce percepts that mimic somatic sensation and, thus, has potential as an approach to sensorize prosthetic limbs. However, it is not known whether ICMS could recreate active texture exploration-the ability to infer information about object texture by using one's fingertips to scan a surface. Here, we show that ICMS of S1 can convey information about the spatial frequencies of invisible virtual gratings through a process of active tactile exploration. Two rhesus monkeys scanned pairs of visually identical screen objects with the fingertip of a hand avatar-controlled first via a joystick and later via a brain-machine interface-to find the object with denser virtual gratings. The gratings consisted of evenly spaced ridges that were signaled through individual ICMS pulses generated whenever the avatar's fingertip crossed a ridge. The monkeys learned to interpret these ICMS patterns, evoked by the interplay of their voluntary movements and the virtual textures of each object, to perform a sensory discrimination task. Discrimination accuracy followed Weber's law of just-noticeable differences (JND) across a range of grating densities; a finding that matches normal cutaneous sensation. Moreover, 1 monkey developed an active scanning strategy where avatar velocity was integrated with the ICMS pulses to interpret the texture information. We propose that this approach could equip upper-limb neuroprostheses with direct access to texture features acquired during active exploration of natural objects. ",
        "MOWChIP-seq for low-input and multiplexed profiling of genome-wide histone modifications. Epigenetic mechanisms such as histone modifications play critical roles in adaptive tuning of chromatin structures. Profiling of various histone modifications at the genome scale using tissues from animal and human samples is an important step for functional studies of epigenomes and epigenomics-based precision medicine. Because the profile of a histone mark is highly specific to a cell type, cell isolation from tissues is often necessary to generate a homogeneous cell population, and such operations tend to yield a low number of cells. In addition, high-throughput processing is often desirable because of the multiplexity of histone marks of interest and the large quantity of samples in a hospital setting. In this protocol, we provide detailed instructions for device fabrication, setup, and operation of microfluidic oscillatory washing-based chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (MOWChIP-seq) for profiling of histone modifications using as few as 100 cells per assay with a throughput as high as eight assays in one run. MOWChIP-seq operation involves flowing of chromatin fragments through a packed bed of antibody-coated beads, followed by vigorous microfluidic oscillatory washing. Our process is semi-automated to reduce labor and improve reproducibility. Using one eight-unit device, it takes 2 d to produce eight sequencing libraries from chromatin samples. The technology is scalable. We used the protocol to study a number of histone modifications in various types of mouse and human tissues. The protocol can be conducted by a user who is familiar with molecular biology procedures and has basic engineering skills. ",
        "Core Element Cloning, Cis-Element Mapping and Serum Regulation of the Human EphB4 Promoter: A Novel TATA-Less Inr/MTE/DPE-Like Regulated Gene. The EphB4 gene encodes for a transmembrane tyrosine kinase receptor involved in embryonic blood vessel differentiation and cancer development. Although EphB4 is known to be regulated at the post-translational level, little is known about its gene regulation. The present study describes the core promoter elements' identification and cloning, the cis-regulatory elements' mapping and the serum regulation of the human EphB4 gene promoter region. Using bioinformatic analysis, Sanger sequencing and recombinant DNA technology, we analyzed the EphB4 gene upstream region spanning +40/-1509 from the actual transcription start site (TSS) and proved it to be a TATA-less gene promoter with dispersed regulatory elements characterized by a novel motif-of-ten element (MTE) at positions +18/+28, and a DPE-like motif and a DPE-like-repeated motif (DRM) spanning nt +27/+30 and +32 +35, respectively. We also mapped both proximal (multiple Sp1) and distal (HoxA9) trans-activating/dispersed cis-acting transcription factor (TF)-binding elements on the region we studied and used a transient transfection reporter assay to characterize its regulation by serum and IGF-II using EphB4 promoter deletion constructs with or without the identified new DNA-binding elements. Altogether, these findings shed new light on the human EphB4 promoter structure and regulation, suggesting mechanistic features conserved among Pol-II TATA-less genes phylogenetically shared from Drosophila to Human genomes.

        "An integrin/MFG-E8 shuttle loads HIV-1 viral-like particles onto follicular dendritic cells in mouse lymph node. During human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) infection lymphoid organ follicular dendritic cells (FDCs) serve as a reservoir for infectious virus and an obstacle to curative therapies. Here, we identify a subset of lymphoid organ sinus lining macrophage (SMs) that provide a cell-cell contact portal, which facilitates the uptake of HIV-1 viral-like particles (VLPs) by FDCs and B cells in mouse lymph node. Central for portal function is the bridging glycoprotein MFG-E8. Using a phosphatidylserine binding domain and an RGD motif, MFG-E8 helps target HIV-1 VLPs to \u03b1v integrin bearing SMs. Lack of MFG-E8 or integrin blockade severely limits HIV-1 VLP spread onto FDC networks. Direct SM-FDC virion transfer also depends upon short-lived FDC network abutment, likely triggered by SCSM antigen uptake. This provides a mechanism for rapid FDC loading broadening the opportunity for rare, antigen reactive follicular B cells to acquire antigen, and a means for HIV virions to accumulate on the FDC network.

        "Aspirin in the Treatment and Prevention of Migraine Headaches: Possible Additional Clinical Options for Primary Healthcare Providers. Migraine headaches are among the most common and potentially debilitating disorders encountered by primary healthcare providers. In the treatment of acute migraine and the prevention of recurrent attacks, there are prescription drugs of proven benefit. However, for those without health insurance or high co-pays, these drugs may be neither available nor affordable and, for all patients, they may be either poorly tolerated or contraindicated. The totality of evidence, which includes data from randomized trials, suggests that high-dose aspirin, in doses from 900 to 1300 mg, taken at the onset of symptoms, is an effective and safe treatment option for acute migraine headaches. In addition, the totality of evidence, including some, but not all, randomized trials, suggests the possibility that daily aspirin, in doses from 81 to 325 mg, may be an effective and safe treatment option for the prevention of recurrent migraine headaches. The relatively favorable side effect profile of aspirin and extremely low costs compared with other prescription drug therapies may provide additional options for primary healthcare providers in the treatment of both acute and recurrent migraine headaches.

        "LRIG1 is a pleiotropic androgen receptor-regulated feedback tumor suppressor in prostate cancer. LRIG1 has been reported to be a tumor suppressor in gastrointestinal tract and epidermis. However, little is known about the expression, regulation and biological functions of LRIG1 in prostate cancer (PCa). We find that LRIG1 is overexpressed in PCa, but its expression correlates with better patient survival. Functional studies reveal strong tumor-suppressive functions of LRIG1 in both AR+ and AR- xenograft models, and transgenic expression of LRIG1 inhibits tumor development in Hi-Myc and TRAMP models. LRIG1 also inhibits castration-resistant PCa and exhibits therapeutic efficacy in pre-established tumors. We further show that 1) AR directly transactivates LRIG1 through binding to several AR-binding sites in LRIG1 locus, and 2) LRIG1 dampens ERBB expression in a cell type-dependent manner and inhibits ERBB2-driven tumor growth. Collectively, our study indicates that LRIG1 represents a pleiotropic AR-regulated feedback tumor suppressor that functions to restrict oncogenic signaling from AR, Myc, ERBBs, and, likely, other oncogenic drivers.

        "Optimal solid state neurons. Bioelectronic medicine is driving the need for neuromorphic microcircuits that integrate raw nervous stimuli and respond identically to biological neurons. However, designing such circuits remains a challenge. Here we estimate the parameters of highly nonlinear conductance models and derive the ab\u00a0initio equations of intracellular currents and membrane voltages embodied in analog solid-state electronics. By configuring individual ion channels of solid-state neurons with parameters estimated from large-scale assimilation of electrophysiological recordings, we successfully transfer the complete dynamics of hippocampal and respiratory neurons in\u00a0silico. The solid-state neurons are found to respond nearly identically to biological neurons under stimulation by a wide range of current injection protocols. The optimization of nonlinear models demonstrates a powerful method for programming analog electronic circuits. This approach offers a route for repairing diseased biocircuits and emulating their function with biomedical implants that can adapt to biofeedback. ",
        "Public Opinions on Using Social Media Content to Identify Users With Depression and Target Mental Health Care Advertising: Mixed Methods Survey. BACKGROUND: Depression is a common disorder that still remains underdiagnosed and undertreated in the UK National Health Service. Charities and voluntary organizations offer mental health services, but they are still struggling to promote these services to the individuals who need them. By analyzing social media (SM) content using machine learning techniques, it may be possible to identify which SM users are currently experiencing low mood, thus enabling the targeted advertising of mental health services to the individuals who would benefit from them. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to understand SM users' opinions of analysis of SM content for depression and targeted advertising on SM for mental health services. METHODS: A Web-based, mixed methods, cross-sectional survey was administered to SM users aged 16 years or older within the United Kingdom. It asked participants about their demographics, their usage of SM, and their history of depression and presented structured and open-ended questions on views of SM content being analyzed for depression and views on receiving targeted advertising for mental health services. RESULTS: A total of 183 participants completed the survey, and 114 (62.3%) of them had previously experienced depression. Participants indicated that they posted less during low moods, and they believed that their SM content would not reflect their depression. They could see the possible benefits of identifying depression from SM content but did not believe that the risks to privacy outweighed these benefits. A majority of the participants would not provide consent for such analysis to be conducted on their data and considered it to be intrusive and exposing. CONCLUSIONS: In a climate of distrust of SM platforms' usage of personal data, participants in this survey did not perceive that the benefits of targeting advertisements for mental health services to individuals analyzed as having depression would outweigh the risks to privacy. Future work in this area should proceed with caution and should engage stakeholders at all stages to maximize the transparency and trustworthiness of such research endeavors. ",
        "Functional organization of motor networks in the lumbosacral spinal cord of non-human primates. Implantable spinal-cord-neuroprostheses aiming to restore standing and walking after paralysis have been extensively studied in animal models (mainly cats) and have shown promising outcomes. This study aimed to take a critical step along the clinical translation path of these neuroprostheses, and investigated the organization of the neural networks targeted by these implants in a non-human primate. This was accomplished by advancing a microelectrode into various locations of the lumbar enlargement of the spinal cord, targeting the ventral horn of the gray matter. Microstimulation in these locations produced a variety of functional movements in the hindlimb. The resulting functional map of the spinal cord in monkeys was found to have a similar overall organization along the length of the spinal cord to that in cats. This suggests that the human spinal cord may also be organized similarly. The obtained spinal cord maps in monkeys provide important knowledge that will guide the very first testing of these implants in humans. ",
        "U.S. Physician Recommendations to Their Patients About the Use of Complementary Health Approaches. .                         Objective:.                      There are no nationally representative studies using a probability sample that have been published examining whether physicians recommend complementary health approaches (CHAs) to their patients, as previous research has focused only on selected medical specialties or a particular U.S. region. This article fills a void in the current literature for robust data on recommendations for CHAs by office-based physicians in the United States. .                         Design:.                      Descriptive statistics and multivariable regression analyses of physician-level data were from the 2012 Physician Induction Interview of the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NAMCS PII), a nationally representative survey of office-based physicians. Weighted response rate among eligible physicians sampled for the 2012 NAMCS PII was 59.7%. .                         Setting/Location:.                      United States. .

Differences in recommendations by physician demographic characteristics were identified. .                         Results:.                      Massage therapy was the most commonly recommended CHA (30.4%), followed by chiropractic/osteopathic manipulation (27.1%), herbs/nonvitamin supplements (26.5%), yoga (25.6%), and acupuncture (22.4%). The most commonly recommended CHAs by general/family practice physicians were chiropractic/osteopathic manipulation (54.0%) and massage therapy (52.6%). Of all U.S. physicians, 53.1% recommended at least one CHA to patients during the previous 12 months. Multivariable analyses found physician's sex, race, specialty, and U.S. region to be significant predictors of CHA recommendations. Female physicians were more likely than male physicians to recommend massage therapy (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]\u2009=\u20091.76, 95% confidence interval [CI]\u2009=\u20091.40-2.20), herbs/nonvitamin supplements (aOR\u2009=\u20091.85, 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.46-2.35), yoga (aOR\u2009=\u20092.16, 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.70-2.75), acupuncture (aOR\u2009=\u20091.65, 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.27-2.13), and mind-body therapies (aOR\u2009=\u20092.63, 95% CI\u2009=\u20092.02-3.41) to patients.

Conclusions:.                      Overall, more than half of office-based physicians recommended at least one CHA to their patients. Female physicians recommended every individual CHA at a higher rate than male physicians except for chiropractic and osteopathic manipulation. These findings may enable consumers, physicians, and medical schools to better understand potential differences in use of CHAs with patients. ",
        "Hypothalamic neuronal circuits regulating hunger-induced taste modification. The gustatory system plays a critical role in sensing appetitive and aversive taste stimuli for evaluating food quality. Although taste preference is known to change depending on internal states such as hunger, a mechanistic insight remains unclear. Here, we examine the neuronal mechanisms regulating hunger-induced taste modification. Starved mice exhibit an increased preference for sweetness and tolerance for aversive taste. This hunger-induced taste modification is recapitulated by selective activation of orexigenic Agouti-related peptide (AgRP)-expressing neurons in the hypothalamus projecting to the lateral hypothalamus, but not to other regions. Glutamatergic, but not GABAergic, neurons in the lateral hypothalamus function as downstream neurons of AgRP neurons. Importantly, these neurons play a key role in modulating preferences for both appetitive and aversive tastes by using distinct pathways projecting to the lateral septum or the lateral habenula, respectively. Our results suggest that these hypothalamic circuits would be important for optimizing feeding behavior under fasting. ",
        "Despite early antiretroviral therapy effector memory and follicular helper CD4 T cells are major reservoirs in visceral lymphoid tissues of SIV-infected macaques. Whereas antiretroviral therapy (ART) suppresses viral replication, ART discontinuation results in viral rebound, indicating the presence of viral reservoirs (VRs) established within lymphoid tissues. Herein, by sorting CD4 T-cell subsets from the spleen, mesenteric and peripheral lymph nodes (LNs) of SIVmac251-infected rhesus macaques (RMs), we demonstrate that effector memory (TEM) and follicular helper (TFH) CD4+ T cells harbor the highest frequency of viral DNA and RNA, as well of early R-U5 transcripts in ART-na\u00efve RMs. Furthermore, our results highlight that these two CD4 T cells subsets harbor viral DNA and early R-U5 transcripts in the spleen and mesenteric LNs (but not in peripheral LN) of RMs treated with ART at day 4 post infection suggesting that these two anatomical sites are important for viral persistence. Finally, after ART interruption, we demonstrate the rapid and, compared to peripheral LNs, earlier seeding of SIV in spleen and mesenteric LNs, thereby emphasizing the importance of these two anatomical sites for viral replication dynamics. Altogether our results advance understanding of early viral seeding in which visceral lymphoid tissues are crucial in maintaining TEM and TFH VRs. ",
        "Human health risks due to airborne polychlorinated biphenyls are highest in New Bedford Harbor communities living closest to the harbor. In response to concerns raised by communities surrounding the New Bedford Harbor Superfund site, we completed a field and modeling study that concluded the harbor is the primary source of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in air around the harbor. The follow-up question from residents was whether the PCBs measured in air pose a risk to their health. The US Environmental Protection Agency focuses their site-specific, risk-based decisions for site clean-up on cancers. We focused our assessment on the non-cancer effects on the thyroid based on the congener specific patterns and concentrations of PCBs measured in air near and distant to the harbor. Human and animal studies of PCB-induced effects on the thyroid provide evidence to support our analysis. Drawing from the published toxicological data, we used a Margin of Exposure (MOE) approach to derive a human-equivalent concentration in air associated with human health effects on the thyroid. Based on the MOEs calculated herein, evaluation of the MOE indicates that changes in thyroid hormone levels are possible among people living adjacent to the Harbor. Changes in thyroid hormone levels are more likely among people who live near the harbor compared to residents living in areas distant from the harbor. This risk assessment documents potential health risks associated with proximity to a marine Superfund Site using site-specific ambient air PCB congener data. ",
        "Effect of Single-Fraction vs Multifraction Radiotherapy on Ambulatory Status Among Patients With Spinal Canal Compression From Metastatic Cancer: The SCORAD Randomized Clinical Trial. Importance: Malignant spinal canal compression, a major complication of metastatic cancer, is managed with radiotherapy to maintain mobility and relieve pain, although there is no standard radiotherapy regimen. Objective: To evaluate whether single-fraction radiotherapy is noninferior to 5 fractions of radiotherapy. Design, Setting, and Participants: Multicenter noninferiority randomized clinical trial conducted in 42 UK and 5 Australian radiotherapy centers. Eligible patients (n\u2009=\u2009686) had metastatic cancer with spinal cord or cauda equina compression, life expectancy greater than 8 weeks, and no previous radiotherapy to the same area. Patients were recruited between February 2008 and April 2016, with final follow-up in September 2017. Interventions: Patients were randomized to receive external beam single-fraction 8-Gy radiotherapy (n\u2009=\u2009345) or 20 Gy of radiotherapy in 5 fractions over 5 consecutive days (n\u2009=\u2009341). Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary end point was ambulatory status at week 8, based on a 4-point scale and classified as grade 1 (ambulatory without the use of aids and grade 5 of 5 muscle power) or grade 2 (ambulatory using aids or grade 4 of 5 muscle power). The noninferiority margin for the difference in ambulatory status was -11%. Secondary end points included ambulatory status at weeks 1, 4, and 12 and overall survival. Results: Among 686 randomized patients (median [interquartile range] age, 70 [64-77] years; 503 (73%) men; 44% had prostate cancer, 19% had lung cancer, and 12% had breast cancer), 342 (49.8%) were analyzed for the primary end point (255 patients died before the 8-week assessment). Ambulatory status grade 1 or 2 at week 8 was achieved by 115 of 166 (69.3%) patients in the single-fraction group vs 128 of 176 (72.7%) in the multifraction group (difference, -3.5% [1-sided 95% CI, -11.5% to \u221e]; P value for noninferiority\u2009=\u2009.06). The difference in ambulatory status grade 1 or 2 in the single-fraction vs multifraction group was -0.4% (63.9% vs 64.3%; [1-sided 95% CI, -6.9 to \u221e]; P value for noninferiority\u2009=\u2009.004) at week 1, -0.7% (66.8% vs 67.6%; [1-sided 95% CI, -8.1 to \u221e]; P value for noninferiority\u2009=\u2009.01) at week 4, and 4.1% (71.8% vs 67.7%; [1-sided 95% CI, -4.6 to \u221e]; P value for noninferiority\u2009=\u2009.002) at week 12. Overall survival rates at 12 weeks were 50% in the single-fraction group vs 55% in the multifraction group (stratified hazard ratio, 1.02 [95% CI, 0.74-1.41]). Of the 11 other secondary end points that were analyzed, the between-group differences were not statistically significant or did not meet noninferiority criterion. Conclusions and Relevance: Among patients with malignant metastatic solid tumors and spinal canal compression, a single radiotherapy dose, compared with a multifraction dose delivered over 5 days, did not meet the criterion for noninferiority for the primary outcome (ambulatory at 8 weeks). However, the extent to which the lower bound of the CI overlapped with the noninferiority margin should be considered when interpreting the clinical importance of this finding.

        "Prostate Cancer Outcomes Following Solid-Organ Transplantation: A SEER-Medicare Analysis. BACKGROUND: Immunosuppressive regimens associated with organ transplantation increase the risk of developing cancer. Transplant candidates and recipients with prostate cancer are often treated, even if low risk features would ordinarily justify active surveillance. METHODS: Using SEER-Medicare, we identified 163,676 men aged \u226566, diagnosed with non-metastatic prostate cancer. History of solid organ transplant was identified using diagnosis or procedure codes. A propensity score-matched cohort was identified by matching transplanted men to non-transplanted controls by age, race, region, year, T-stage, grade, comorbidity and cancer therapy. Fine-Gray competing risk models assessed associations between transplant status and prostate cancer-specific (PCSM) and overall mortality (OM). RESULTS: We identified 620 men (0.4%) with transplant up to 10 years before (n\u2009=\u2009320) or 5 years after (n\u2009=\u2009300) prostate cancer diagnosis and matched them to 3,100 men. At 10-years, OM was 55.7% and PCSM was 6.0% in the transplant cohort, compared to 42.4% (p\u2009<\u20090.001) and 7.6% (p\u2009=\u20090.70) in the non-transplant cohort, respectively. Adjusted models showed no difference in PCSM for transplanted men (HR\u2009=\u20090.88, 95% CI\u2009=\u20090.61-1.27, p\u2009=\u20090.70) or differences by prostate cancer therapy. Among 334 transplanted men with T1-2N0, well/moderately differentiated 'low-risk' prostate cancer, PCSM was similar for treated and untreated men (HR\u2009=\u20090.92, 95% CI\u2009=\u20090.47 to 1.81). CONCLUSIONS: Among men age \u226566 y with prostate cancer, an organ transplant is associated with higher OM but no observable difference in PCSM. These findings suggest men with prostate cancer and previous or future organ transplantation should be managed per usual standards of care, including consideration of active surveillance for low-risk cancer characteristics.

        "Microbiological study of used cosmetic products: highlighting possible impact on consumer health. AIMS: To investigate the nature and extent of microbial contamination in five categories of used cosmetic products (lipstick, lip gloss, eyeliners, mascaras and beauty blenders) and highlight the potential risk posed to consumers in the UK. METHODS AND RESULTS: Used products were donated and microbial contents were determined by microbial culture and identification. About 79-90% of all used products were contaminated with bacteria, with bacterial loads ranging between 102 and 103 \u00a0CFU per ml, beauty blenders contained an average load of >106 \u00a0CFU per ml. Presence of Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli and Citrobacter freundii was detected. Enterobacteriaceae and fungi were detected in all product types, and were prevalent in beauty blenders (26\u00b758 and 56\u00b796% respectively). Ninety-three per cent of beauty blenders had not been cleaned and 64% had been dropped on the floor and continued to be used. CONCLUSIONS: Significant levels of microbial contamination occur during use of cosmetic products and presence of pathogenic organisms pose a potential risk to health. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The nature and high level of contamination in used cosmetic products indicate that greater user awareness and education are required. Manufacturers should ensure that product expiry dates are prominently displayed and consumers can identify the symbols used on product packaging. ",
        "Using immersive virtual reality to improve the beliefs and intentions of influenza vaccine avoidant 18-to-49-year-olds: Considerations, effects, and lessons learned. OBJECTIVE: Only one-third of adults 18-49\u202fyears old in the United States receive a recommended annual influenza vaccination. This study examined whether supplementing vaccine information statements (VIS) with an immersive virtual reality (VR), short video or electronic pamphlet story designed to convey the community immunity benefits of influenza vaccination would improve influenza vaccine avoidant participants' influenza-related perceptions as well as their influenza vaccination-related beliefs, confidence and intentions. METHOD: A one-way between-subjects experimental design compared the effects of adding a supplemental education experience prior to VIS exposure with flu vaccine avoidant 18-to-49-year-olds. The 171 participants recruited from the community were randomly assigned to one of three modality treatment conditions [VR, video, or e-pamphlet (i.e., story board presented via electronic tablet)] or a VIS-only control condition. RESULTS: Compared to the modalities, the VR intervention created a stronger perception of presence (i.e., feeling of \"being there\" in the story), which, in turn, increased participants' concern about transmitting influenza to others and raised vaccination intention. Increased concern about transmitting influenza to others was associated with positive effects on influenza vaccination-related beliefs, including confidence that one's flu vaccination would protect others. Neither the e-pamphlet nor the video intervention were able to elicit a sense of presence nor were they able to improve the impact of the VIS on the outcome measures. CONCLUSIONS: Immersive VR has much potential to increase understanding of key immunization concepts, such as community immunity, through creative executions that increase a sense of presence. Given the need to increase influenza vaccination uptake among 18-to-49-year-olds, and the projected growth in VR accessibility and use, additional applications and assessments related to vaccination communication and education are needed and warranted. By increasing the ability to convey key vaccine and immunization concepts, immersive VR could help address vaccination hesitancy and acceptance challenges. ",
        "Analysis of Single Nucleotide Variants in CRISPR-Cas9 Edited Zebrafish Exomes Shows No Evidence of Off-Target Inflation. Therapeutic applications of CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing have spurred innovation in Cas9 enzyme engineering and single guide RNA (sgRNA) design algorithms to minimize potential off-target events. While recent work in rodents outlines favorable conditions for specific editing and uses a trio design (mother, father, offspring) to control for the contribution of natural genome variation, the potential for CRISPR-Cas9 to induce de novo mutations in vivo remains a topic of interest. In zebrafish, we performed whole exome sequencing (WES) on two generations of offspring derived from the same founding pair: 54 exomes from control and CRISPR-Cas9 edited embryos in the first generation (F0), and 16 exomes from the progeny of inbred F0 pairs in the second generation (F1). We did not observe an increase in the number of transmissible variants in edited individuals in F1, nor in F0 edited mosaic individuals, arguing that in vivo editing does not precipitate an inflation of deleterious point mutations.

        "DNA methylation in AgRP neurons regulates voluntary exercise behavior in mice. DNA methylation regulates cell type-specific gene expression. Here, in a transgenic mouse model, we show that deletion of the gene encoding DNA methyltransferase Dnmt3a in hypothalamic AgRP neurons causes a sedentary phenotype characterized by reduced voluntary exercise and increased adiposity. Whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) and transcriptional profiling in neuronal nuclei from the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus (ARH) reveal differentially methylated genomic regions and reduced expression of AgRP neuron-associated genes in knockout mice. We use read-level analysis of WGBS data to infer putative ARH neural cell types affected by the knockout, and to localize promoter hypomethylation and increased expression of the growth factor Bmp7 to AgRP neurons, suggesting a role for aberrant TGF-\u03b2 signaling in the development of this phenotype. Together, these data demonstrate that DNA methylation in AgRP neurons is required for their normal epigenetic development and neuron-specific gene expression profiles, and regulates voluntary exercise behavior.

        "The therapeutic efficacy of Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis BB-12\u00ae in infant colic: A randomised, double blind, placebo-controlled trial. BACKGROUND: The pathogenesis of infant colic is poorly defined. Gut microbiota seems to be involved, supporting the potential therapeutic role of probiotics. AIMS: To assess the rate of infants with a reduction of \u226550% of mean daily crying duration after 28\u00a0days of intervention with the probiotic Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis BB-12\u00ae (BB-12). Secondary outcomes were daily number of crying episodes, sleeping time, number of bowel movements and stool consistency. METHODS: Randomized controlled trial (RCT) on otherwise healthy exclusively breastfed infants with infant colic randomly allocated to receive BB-12 (1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0109 \u00a0CFU/day) or placebo for 28\u00a0days. Gut microbiota structure and butyrate, beta-defensin-2 (HBD-2), cathelicidin (LL-37), secretory IgA (sIgA) and faecal calprotectin levels were assessed. RESULTS: Eighty infants were randomised, 40/group. The rate of infants with reduction of \u226550% of mean daily crying duration was higher in infants treated with BB-12, starting from the end of 2nd week. No infant relapsed when treatment was stopped. The mean number of crying episodes decreased in both groups, but with a higher effect in BB-12 group (-4.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.4 vs -2.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.2, P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Mean daily stool frequency decreased in both groups but the effect was significantly higher in the BB-12 group; stool consistency was similar between the two groups. An increase in Bifidobacterium abundance (with significant correlation with crying time reduction), butyrate and HBD-2, LL-37, sIgA levels associated with a decrease in faecal calprotectin level were observed in the BB-12 group. CONCLUSIONS: Supplementation with BB-12 is effective in managing infant colic. The effect could derive from immune and non-immune mechanisms associated with a modulation of gut microbiota structure and function. ",
        "Shigella flexneri Adherence Factor Expression in In Vivo-Like Conditions. The Shigella species are Gram-negative, facultative intracellular pathogens that invade the colonic epithelium and cause significant diarrheal disease. Despite extensive research on the pathogen, a comprehensive understanding of how Shigella initiates contact with epithelial cells remains unknown. Shigella maintains many of the same Escherichia coli adherence gene operons; however, at least one critical gene component in each operon is currently annotated as a pseudogene in reference genomes. These annotations, coupled with a lack of structures upon microscopic analysis following growth in laboratory media, have led the field to hypothesize that Shigella is unable to produce fimbriae or other traditional adherence factors. Nevertheless, our previous analyses have demonstrated that a combination of bile salts and glucose induces both biofilm formation and adherence to colonic epithelial cells. The goal of this study was to perform transcriptomic and genetic analyses to demonstrate that adherence gene operons in Shigella flexneri strain 2457T are functional, despite the gene annotations. Our results demonstrate that at least three structural genes facilitate S. flexneri 2457T adherence for epithelial cell contact and biofilm formation. Furthermore, our results demonstrate that host factors, namely, glucose and bile salts at their physiological concentrations in the small intestine, offer key environmental stimuli required for adherence factor expression in S. flexneri This research may have a significant impact on Shigella vaccine development and further highlights the importance of utilizing in vivo-like conditions to study bacterial pathogenesis.IMPORTANCE Bacterial pathogens have evolved to regulate virulence gene expression at critical points in the colonization and infection processes to successfully cause disease. The Shigella species infect the epithelial cells lining the colon to result in millions of cases of diarrhea and a significant global health burden. As antibiotic resistance rates increase, understanding the mechanisms of infection is vital to ensure successful vaccine development. Despite significant gains in our understanding of Shigella infection, it remains unknown how the bacteria initiate contact with the colonic epithelium. Most pathogens harbor multiple adherence factors to facilitate this process, but Shigella was thought to have lost the ability to produce these factors. Interestingly, we have identified conditions that mimic some features of gastrointestinal transit and that enable Shigella to express adherence structural genes. This work highlights aspects of genetic regulation for Shigella adherence factors and may have a significant impact on future vaccine development. ",
        "An ER Assembly Line of AMPA-Receptors Controls Excitatory Neurotransmission and Its Plasticity. Excitatory neurotransmission and its activity-dependent plasticity are largely determined by AMPA-receptors (AMPARs), ion channel complexes whose cell physiology is encoded by their interactome. Here, we delineate the assembly of AMPARs in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of native neurons as multi-state production line controlled by distinct interactome constituents: ABHD6 together with porcupine stabilizes pore-forming GluA monomers, and the intellectual-disability-related FRRS1l-CPT1c complexes promote GluA oligomerization and co-assembly of GluA tetramers with cornichon and transmembrane AMPA-regulatory proteins (TARP) to render receptor channels ready for ER exit. Disruption of the assembly line by FRRS1l deletion largely reduces AMPARs in the plasma membrane, impairs synapse formation, and abolishes activity-dependent synaptic plasticity, while FRRS1l overexpression has the opposite effect. As a consequence, FRSS1l knockout mice display severe deficits in learning tasks and behavior. Our results provide mechanistic insight into the stepwise biogenesis of AMPARs in\u00a0native ER membranes and establish FRRS1l as\u00a0a\u00a0powerful regulator of synaptic signaling and plasticity.

        "Dietary guideline adherence during preconception and pregnancy: A systematic review. The aim of this study is to determine the level of adherence to dietary guidelines among men and women during preconception, and pregnant women, and factors associated with adherence. Searches were conducted in CINAHL, AMED, EMBASE, and Maternity and Infant Care from inception to March 2018. Observational studies assessing the primary outcome (adherence to dietary guidelines and/or nutritional recommendations) and/or secondary outcome (factors associated with adherence) were eligible. Study quality was assessed using the National Institutes of Health Quality Assessment Tool for Observational Cohort and Cross-sectional studies. Men or women (aged \u226518 years) who identified as trying/intending to conceive or were pregnant. Eighteen studies were included. The quality of studies was fair (44%) to good (56%). Most studies indicated preconceptual and pregnant women do not meet recommendations for vegetable, cereal grain, or folate intake. Pregnant women did not meet iron or calcium intake requirements in 91% and 55% of included studies, respectively, and also exceeded fat intake recommendations in 55% of included studies. Higher level education was associated with improved guideline adherence in pregnant women, whereas older age and non-smoking status were associated with greater guideline adherence in preconceptual and pregnant women. The findings of this review suggest that preconceptual and pregnant women may not be meeting the minimum requirements stipulated in dietary guidelines and/or nutritional recommendations. This could have potential adverse consequences for pregnancy and birth outcomes and the health of the offspring. Major knowledge gaps identified in this review, which warrant further investigation, are the dietary intakes of men during preconception, and the predictors of guideline adherence. ",
        "The JAK-Inhibitor Tofacitinib Rescues Human Intestinal Epithelial Cells and Colonoids from Cytokine-Induced Barrier Dysfunction. BACKGROUND: Alterations to epithelial tight junctions can compromise the ability of the epithelium to act as a barrier between luminal contents and the underlying tissues, thereby increasing intestinal permeability, an early critical event in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Tofacitinib (Xeljanz), an orally administered pan-Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor, was recently approved for the treatment of moderate to severe ulcerative colitis. Nevertheless, the effects of tofacitinib on intestinal epithelial cell functions are largely unknown. The aim of this study was to determine if JAK inhibition by tofacitinib can rescue cytokine-induced barrier dysfunction in intestinal epithelial cells (IECs). METHODS: T84 IECs were used to evaluate the effects of tofacitinib on JAK-signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) activation, barrier permeability, and expression and localization of tight junction proteins. The impact of tofacitinib on claudin-2 promoter activity was assessed in HT-29 IECs. Tofacitinib rescue of barrier function was also tested in human colonic stem cell-derived organoids. RESULTS: Pretreatment with tofacitinib prevented IFN-\u03b3-induced decreases in transepithelial electrical resistance (TER) and increases in 4 kDa FITC-dextran permeability (FD4), partly due to claudin-2 transcriptional regulation and restriction of ZO-1 rearrangement at tight junctions. Although tofacitinib administered after IFN-\u03b3 challenge only partially normalized TER and claudin-2 levels, FD4 permeability and ZO-1 localization were fully recovered. The IFN-\u03b3-induced FD4 permeability in primary human colonoids was fully rescued by tofacitinib. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest differential therapeutic efficacy of tofacitinib in the rescue of pore vs leak-tight junction barrier defects and indicate a potential contribution of improved epithelial barrier function to the beneficial effects of tofacitinib in IBD patients.

        "A Single Ketamine Infusion Combined With Motivational Enhancement Therapy for Alcohol Use Disorder: A Randomized Midazolam-Controlled Pilot Trial. OBJECTIVE: Pharmacotherapy and behavioral treatments for alcohol use disorder are limited in their effectiveness, and new treatments with innovative mechanisms would be valuable. In this pilot study, the authors tested whether a single subanesthetic infusion of ketamine administered to adults with alcohol dependence and engaged in motivational enhancement therapy affects drinking outcomes. METHODS: Participants were randomly assigned to a 52-minute intravenous administration of ketamine (0.71 mg/kg, N=17) or the active control midazolam (0.025 mg/kg, N=23), provided during the second week of a 5-week outpatient regimen of motivational enhancement therapy. Alcohol use following the infusion was assessed with timeline followback method, with abstinence confirmed by urine ethyl glucuronide testing. A longitudinal logistic mixed-effects model was used to model daily abstinence from alcohol over the 21 days after ketamine infusion. RESULTS: Participants (N=40) were mostly middle-aged (mean age=53 years [SD=9.8]), predominantly white (70.3%), and largely employed (71.8%) and consumed an average of five drinks per day prior to entering the study. Ketamine significantly increased the likelihood of abstinence, delayed the time to relapse, and reduced the likelihood of heavy drinking days compared with midazolam. Infusions were well tolerated, with no participants removed from the study as a result of adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: A single ketamine infusion was found to improve measures of drinking in persons with alcohol dependence engaged in motivational enhancement therapy. These preliminary data suggest new directions in integrated pharmacotherapy-behavioral treatments for alcohol use disorder. Further research is needed to replicate these promising results in a larger sample. ",
        "Association Between Change in Circulating Progenitor Cells During Exercise Stress and Risk of Adverse Cardiovascular Events in Patients With Coronary Artery Disease. Importance: Stem and progenitor cells mobilize from the bone marrow in response to myocardial ischemia. However, the association between the change in circulating progenitor cell (CPC) counts and disease prognosis among patients with ischemia is unknown. Objective: To investigate the association between the change in CPC counts during stress testing and the risk of adverse cardiovascular events in patients with stable coronary artery disease (CAD). Design, Setting, and Participants: This prospective cohort study included a population-based sample of 454 patients with stable CAD who were recruited between June 1, 2011, and August 15, 2014, at Emory University-affiliated hospitals and followed up for 3 years. Data were analyzed from September 15, 2018, to October 15, 2018. Exposures: Myocardial perfusion imaging with technetium Tc 99m sestamibi at rest and 30 to 60 minutes after conventional stress testing. Main Outcomes and Measures: Circulating progenitor cells were enumerated with flow cytometry as CD34-expressing mononuclear cells (CD45med/CD34+), with additional quantification of subsets coexpressing the chemokine (C-X-C motif) receptor 4 (CD34+/CXCR4+). Changes in CPC counts were calculated as poststress minus resting CPC counts. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to identify factors associated with the combined end point of cardiovascular death and myocardial infarction after adjusting for clinical covariates, including age, sex, race, smoking history, body mass index, and history of heart failure, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and diabetes. Results: Of the 454 patients (mean [SD] age, 63 [9] years; 76% men) with stable CAD enrolled in the study, 142 (31.3%) had stress-induced ischemia and 312 (68.7%) did not, as measured by single-photon emission computed tomography. During stress testing, patients with stress-induced ischemia had a mean decrease of 20.2% (interquartile range [IQR], -45.3 to 5.5; P\u2009<\u2009.001) in their CD34+/CXCR4+ counts, and patients without stress-induced ischemia had a mean increase of 3.2% (IQR, -20.6 to 35.1; P\u2009<\u2009.001) in their CD34+/CXCR4+ counts. Twenty-four patients (5.2%) experienced adverse events. After adjustment, baseline CPC counts were associated with worse adverse outcomes, but this association was not present after stress-induced ischemia was included in the model. However, the change in CPC counts during exercise remained significantly associated with adverse events (hazard ratio, 2.59; 95% CI, 1.15-5.32, per 50% CD34+/CXCR4+ count decrease), even after adjustment for clinical variables and the presence of ischemia. The discrimination of risk factors associated with incident adverse events improved (increase in C statistic from 0.72 to 0.77; P\u2009=\u2009.003) with the addition of the change in CD34+/CXCR4+ counts to a model that included clinical characteristics, baseline CPC count, and ischemia. Conclusions and Relevance: In this study of patients with CAD, a decrease in CPC counts during exercise is associated with a worse disease prognosis compared with the presence of stress-induced myocardial ischemia. Further studies are needed to evaluate whether strategies to improve CPC responses during exercise stress will be associated with improvements in the prognosis of patients with CAD. ",
        "Host Cell Calpains Can Cleave Structural Proteins from the Enterovirus Polyprotein. Enteroviruses are small RNA viruses that cause diseases with various symptoms ranging from mild to severe. Enterovirus proteins are translated as a single polyprotein, which is cleaved by viral proteases to release capsid and nonstructural proteins. Here, we show that also cellular calpains have a potential role in the processing of the enteroviral polyprotein. Using purified calpains 1 and 2 in an in vitro assay, we show that addition of calpains leads to an increase in the release of VP1 and VP3 capsid proteins from P1 of enterovirus B species, detected by western blotting. This was prevented with a calpain inhibitor and was dependent on optimal calcium concentration, especially for calpain 2. In addition, calpain cleavage at the VP3-VP1 interface was supported by a competition assay using a peptide containing the VP3-VP1 cleavage site. Moreover, a mass spectrometry analysis showed that calpains can cleave this same peptide at the VP3-VP1 interface, the cutting site being two amino acids aside from 3C's cutting site. Furthermore, we show that calpains cannot cleave between P1 and 2A. In conclusion, we show that cellular proteases, calpains, can cleave structural proteins from enterovirus polyprotein in vitro. Whether they assist polyprotein processing in infected cells remains to be shown. ",
        "An Internet-Based Cognitive Behavioral Therapy Program Adapted to Patients With Cardiovascular Disease and Depression: Randomized Controlled Trial. BACKGROUND: Depression is a common cause of reduced well-being and prognosis in patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD). However, there is a lack of effective intervention strategies targeting depression. OBJECTIVE: The study aimed to evaluate the effects of a nurse-delivered and adapted internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (iCBT) program aimed at reducing depression in patients with CVD. METHODS: A randomized controlled trial was conducted. A total of 144 patients with CVD with at least mild depression (Patient Health Questionnaire-9 [PHQ-9] score \u22655) were randomized 1:1 to a 9-week program of iCBT (n=72) or an active control participating in a Web-based discussion forum (online discussion forum [ODF], n=72). The iCBT program, which included 7 modules, was adapted to fit patients with CVD. Nurses with an experience of CVD care provided feedback and a short introduction to cognitive behavioral therapy. The primary outcome, depression, was measured using PHQ-9. Secondary outcomes were depression measured using the Montgomery-\u00c5sberg Depression Rating Scale-self-rating version (MADRS-S), health-related quality of life (HRQoL) measured using Short Form 12 (SF-12) survey and EuroQol Visual Analogue Scale (EQ-VAS), and the level of adherence. An intention-to-treat analysis with multiple imputations was used. Between-group differences in the primary and secondary outcomes were determined by the analysis of covariance, and a sensitivity analysis was performed using mixed models. RESULTS: Compared with ODF, iCBT had a significant and moderate treatment effect on the primary outcome depression (ie, PHQ-9; mean group difference=-2.34 [95% CI -3.58 to -1.10], P<.001, Cohen d=0.62). In the secondary outcomes, compared with ODF, iCBT had a significant and large effect on depression (ie, MADRS-S; P<.001, Cohen d=0.86) and a significant and moderate effect on the mental component scale of the SF-12 (P<.001, Cohen d=0.66) and the EQ-VAS (P<.001, Cohen d=0.62). Overall, 60% (n=43) of the iCBT group completed all 7 modules, whereas 82% (n=59) completed at least half of the modules. No patients were discontinued from the study owing to a high risk of suicide or deterioration in depression. CONCLUSIONS: Nurse-delivered iCBT can reduce depression and improve HRQoL in patients with CVD, enabling treatment for depression in their own homes and at their preferred time.

        "Long-term ambient hydrocarbons exposure and incidence of ischemic stroke. Exposure to air pollutants is known to have adverse effects on human health; however, little is known about the association between hydrocarbons in air and an ischemic stroke (IS) event. We investigated whether long-term exposure to airborne hydrocarbons, including volatile organic compounds, increased IS risk. This retrospective cohort study included 283,666 people aged 40 years or older in Taiwan. Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was used to fit single- and multiple-pollutant models for two targeted pollutants, total hydrocarbons (THC) and nonmethane hydrocarbons (NMHC), and estimated the risk of IS. Before controlling for multiple pollutants, hazard ratios (HRs) of IS with 95% confidence intervals for the overall population were 2.69 (2.64-2.74) at 0.16-ppm increase in THC and 1.62 (1.59-1.66) at 0.11-ppm increase in NMHC. For the multiple-pollutant models controlling for PM2.5, the adjusted HR was 3.64 (3.56-3.72) for THC and 2.21 (2.16-2.26) for NMHC. Our findings suggest that long-term exposure to THC and NMHC may be a risk factor for IS development. ",
        "Nonidentical Twins With Asthma: Spatially Matched CT Airway and MRI Ventilation Abnormalities. Recent pulmonary functional MRI findings of spatially and temporally persistent ventilation abnormalities in patients with asthma contrast with previous in\u00a0silico modeling studies that suggest that in asthma, ventilation defects may be randomly distributed. In a case study that used pulmonary MRI, CT imaging, and pulmonary function tests, we prospectively evaluated over the course of 7 years, nonidentical female adult twins, each with a lifelong history of asthma. We evaluated pulmonary function and MRI ventilation heterogeneity at baseline and follow-up after 7 years. In both twins, there was a spatially identical MRI ventilation defect and an abnormal subsegmental left-sided upper lobe airway that persisted in the same spatial location after 7 years. If ventilation defects are randomly distributed, this bears a probability of approximately one per 130,000 people. Our MRI observations in related patients with asthma suggest that ventilation abnormalities may not be randomly distributed in patients with asthma and persist distal to airway abnormalities for long periods of time.

        "Mindfulness-Based Blood Pressure Reduction (MB-BP): Stage 1 single-arm clinical trial. BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Impacts of mindfulness-based programs on blood pressure remain equivocal, possibly because the programs are not adapted to engage with determinants of hypertension, or due to floor effects. Primary objectives were to create a customized Mindfulness-Based Blood Pressure Reduction (MB-BP) program, and to evaluate acceptability, feasibility, and effects on hypothesized proximal self-regulation mechanisms. Secondary outcomes included modifiable determinants of blood pressure (BP), and clinic-assessed systolic blood pressure (SBP). METHODS: This was a Stage 1 single-arm trial with one year follow-up. Focus groups and in-depth interviews were performed to evaluate acceptability and feasibility. Self-regulation outcomes, and determinants of BP, were assessed using validated questionnaires or objective assessments. The MB-BP curriculum was adapted from Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction to direct participants' mindfulness skills towards modifiable determinants of blood pressure. RESULTS: Acceptability and feasibility findings showed that of 53 eligible participants, 48 enrolled (91%). Of these, 43 (90%) attended at least 7 of the 10 MB-BP classes; 43 were followed to one year (90%). Focus groups (n = 19) and semi-structured interviews (n = 10) showed all participants viewed the delivery modality favorably, and identified logistic considerations concerning program access as barriers. A priori selected primary self-regulation outcomes showed improvements at one-year follow-up vs. baseline, including attention control (Sustained Attention to Response Task correct no-go score, p<0.001), emotion regulation (Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Score, p = 0.02), and self-awareness (Multidimensional Assessment of Interoceptive Awareness, p<0.001). Several determinants of hypertension were improved in participants not adhering to American Heart Association guidelines at baseline, including physical activity (p = 0.02), Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension-consistent diet (p<0.001), and alcohol consumption (p<0.001). Findings demonstrated mean 6.1 mmHg reduction in SBP (p = 0.008) at one year follow-up; effects were most pronounced in Stage 2 uncontrolled hypertensives (SBP\u2265140 mmHg), showing 15.1 mmHg reduction (p<0.001). CONCLUSION: MB-BP has good acceptability and feasibility, and may engage with self-regulation and behavioral determinants of hypertension. ",
        "Structural heterogeneity of \u03b1-synuclein fibrils amplified from patient brain extracts. Parkinson's disease (PD) and Multiple System Atrophy (MSA) are clinically distinctive diseases that feature a common neuropathological hallmark of aggregated \u03b1-synuclein. Little is known about\u00a0how differences in \u03b1-synuclein aggregate structure affect disease phenotype. Here, we amplified \u03b1-synuclein aggregates from PD and MSA brain extracts and analyzed the conformational properties using fluorescent probes, NMR spectroscopy and electron paramagnetic resonance. We also generated and analyzed several in vitro \u03b1-synuclein polymorphs. We found that brain-derived \u03b1-synuclein fibrils were structurally different to all of the in vitro polymorphs analyzed. Importantly, there was a greater structural heterogeneity among \u03b1-synuclein fibrils from the\u00a0PD brain compared to those from the\u00a0MSA brain, possibly reflecting on the greater variability of disease phenotypes evident in PD. Our findings have significant ramifications for the use of non-brain-derived \u03b1-synuclein fibrils in PD and MSA studies, and raise important questions regarding the one disease-one strain hypothesis in the study of \u03b1-synucleinopathies.

        "A novel defective recombinant porcine enterovirus G virus carrying a porcine torovirus papain-like cysteine protease gene and a putative anti-apoptosis gene in place of viral structural protein genes. Enterovirus G (EV-G) belongs to the family of Picornaviridae. Two types of recombinant porcine EV-Gs carrying papain-like cysteine protease (PLCP) gene of porcine torovirus, a virus in Coronaviridae, are reported. Type 1 recombinant EV-Gs are detected in pig feces in Japan, USA, and Belgium and carry the PLPC gene at the junction site of 2C/3A genes, while PLPC gene replaces the viral structural genes in type 2 recombinant EV-G detected in pig feces in a Chinese farm. We identified a novel type 2 recombinant EV-G carrying the PLCP gene with flanking sequences in place of the viral structural genes in pig feces in Japan. The ~0.3\u202fkb-long upstream flanking sequence had no sequence homology with any proteins deposited in GenBank, while the downstream ~0.9\u202fkb-long flanking sequence included a domain having high amino acid sequence homology with a baculoviral inhibitor of apoptosis repeat superfamily. The pig feces, where the novel type 2 recombinant EV-G was detected, also carried type 1 recombinant EV-G. The amount of type 1 and type 2 recombinant EV-G genomes was almost same in the pig feces. Although the phylogenetic analysis suggested that these two recombinant EV-Gs have independently evolved, type 1 recombinant EV-G might have served as a helper virus by providing viral structural proteins for dissemination of the type 2 recombinant EV-G.

        "A mouse model of prostate cancer bone metastasis in a syngeneic immunocompetent host. We report the establishment of B6CaP, an allograft tumor line from a Hi-Myc transgenic mouse that had been backcrossed onto C57BL/6J background. This tumor line grows subcutaneously in wildtype C57BL/6J immunocompetent mice, expresses AR, and has a luminal cytokeratin profile. When digested into single cells and injected via intracardiac injection, B6CaP produces metastatic widespread metastases including frequent bone lesions. Metastatic lesions occur most often in the femur, spine, and skull, and have a mixed osteolytic/osteoblastic phenotype. B6CaP allografts are androgen dependent, and regress after castration. However, castration resistant tumors regrow after 4-6 months and can be maintained as androgen-independent clones. This is the first example of a prostate-derived tumor line that shows frequent metastasis to bone and grows in an immunocompetent host, making this model useful for studying mechanisms of bone metastasis and tumor immune response.

        "Characterization of artificially re-pigmented ARPE-19 retinal pigment epithelial cell model. Melanin pigment has a significant role in ocular pharmacokinetics, because many drugs bind at high extent to melanin in the retinal pigment epithelial cells. Most retinal pigment epithelial cell lines lack pigmentation and, therefore, we re-pigmented human ARPE-19 cells to generate a pigmented cell model. Melanosomes from porcine retinal pigment epithelium were isolated and co-incubated with ARPE-19 cells that spontaneously phagocytosed the melanosomes. Internalized melanosomes were functionally integrated to the cellular system as evidenced by correct translocation of cellular Rab27a protein to the melanosomal membranes. The pigmentation was retained during cell cultivation and the level of pigmentation can be controlled by altering the amount of administered melanosomes. We used these cells to study melanosomal uptake of six drugs. The uptake was negligible with low melanin-binders (methotrexate, diclofenac) whereas most of the high melanin-binders (propranolol, chloroquine) were extensively taken up by the melanosomes. This cell line can be used to model pigmentation of the retinal pigment epithelium, while maintaining the beneficial cell line characteristics, such as fast generation of cultures, low cost, long-term maintenance and good reproducibility. The model enables studies at normal and decreased levels of pigmentation to model different retinal conditions. ",
        "Mathematical modelling of cancer stem cell-targeted immunotherapy. The cancer stem cell hypothesis states that tumors are heterogeneous and comprised of several different cell types that have a range of reproductive potentials. Cancer stem cells (CSCs), represent one class of cells that has both reproductive potential and the ability to differentiate. These cells are thought to drive the progression of aggressive and recurring cancers since they give rise to all other constituent cells within a tumor. With the development of immunotherapy in the last decade, the specific targeting of CSCs has become feasible and presents a novel therapeutic approach. In this paper, we construct a mathematical model to study how specific components of the immune system, namely dendritic cells and cytotoxic T-cells interact with different cancer cell types (CSCs and non-CSCs). Using a system of ordinary differential equations, we model the effects of immunotherapy, specifically dendritic cell vaccines and T-cell adoptive therapy, on tumor growth, with and without chemotherapy. The model reproduces several results observed in the literature, including temporal measurements of tumor size from in vivo experiments, and it is used to predict the optimal treatment schedule when combining different treatment modalities. Importantly, the model also demonstrates that chemotherapy increases tumorigenicity whereas CSC-targeted immunotherapy decreases it. ",
        "Newly diagnosed patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer: A clinical description of those with moderate to severe depressive symptoms. OBJECTIVES: The aims of this observational study were to 1) accrue newly diagnosed patients with advanced-stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) awaiting the start of first-line treatment and identify those with moderate to severe depressive symptoms and, 2) provide a clinical description of the multiple, co-occurring psychological and behavioral difficulties and physical symptoms that potentially exacerbate and maintain depressive symptoms. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with stage IV NSCLC (N\u202f=\u202f186) were enrolled in an observational study (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03199651) and completed the American Society of Clinical Oncology-recommended screening measure for depression (Patient Health Questionnaire-9 [PHQ-9]). Individuals with none/mild (n\u202f=\u202f119; 64 %), moderate (n\u202f=\u202f52; 28 %), and severe (n\u202f=\u202f15; 8 %) depressive symptoms were identified. Patients also completed measures of hopelessness, generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) symptoms, stress, illness perceptions, functional status, and symptoms. RESULTS: Patients with severe depressive symptoms reported concomitant feelings of hopelessness (elevating risk for suicidal behavior), anxiety symptoms suggestive of GAD, and traumatic, cancer-specific stress. They perceived lung cancer as consequential for their lives and not controllable with treatment. Pain and multiple severe symptoms were present along with substantial functional impairment. Patients with moderate depressive symptoms had generally lower levels of disturbance, though still substantial. The most salient differences were low GAD symptom severity and fewer functional impairments for those with moderate symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Depressive symptoms of moderate to severe levels co-occur in a matrix of clinical levels of anxiety symptoms, traumatic stress, impaired functional status, and pain and other physical symptoms. All of the latter factors have been shown, individually and collectively, to contribute to the maintenance or exacerbation of depressive symptoms. As life-extending targeted and immunotherapy use expands, prompt identification of patients with moderate to severe depressive symptoms, referral for evaluation, and psychological/behavioral treatment are key to maximizing treatment outcomes and quality of life for individuals with advanced NSCLC.

        "Three-dimensional spatially resolved geometrical and functional models of human liver tissue reveal new aspects of NAFLD progression. Early disease diagnosis is key to the effective treatment of diseases. Histopathological analysis of human biopsies is the gold standard to diagnose tissue alterations. However, this approach has low resolution and overlooks 3D (three-dimensional) structural changes resulting from functional alterations. Here, we applied multiphoton imaging, 3D digital reconstructions and computational simulations to generate spatially resolved geometrical and functional models of human liver tissue at different stages of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). We identified a set of morphometric cellular and tissue parameters correlated with disease progression, and discover profound topological defects in the 3D bile canalicular (BC) network. Personalized biliary fluid dynamic simulations predicted an increased pericentral biliary pressure and micro-cholestasis, consistent with elevated cholestatic biomarkers in patients' sera. Our spatially resolved models of human liver tissue can contribute to high-definition medicine by identifying quantitative multiparametric cellular and tissue signatures to define disease progression and provide new insights into NAFLD pathophysiology.

        "NOTCH1 signaling in oral squamous cell carcinoma via a TEL2/SERPINE1 axis. Inactivating mutations in the EGF-like ligand binding domain of NOTCH1 are a prominent feature of the mutational landscape of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). In this study, we investigated NOTCH1 mutations in keratinocyte lines derived from OSCC biopsies that had been subjected to whole exome sequencing. One line, SJG6, was found to have truncating mutations in both NOTCH1 alleles, resulting in loss of NOTCH1 expression. Overexpression of the NOTCH1 intracellular domain (NICD) in SJG6 cells promoted cell adhesion and differentiation, while suppressing proliferation, migration and clonal growth, consistent with the previously reported tumour suppressive function of NOTCH1 in OSCC. Comparative gene expression profiling identified SERPINE1 as being downregulated on NICD overexpression and predicted an interaction between SERPINE1 and genes involved in cell proliferation and migration. Mechanistically, overexpression of NICD resulted in upregulation of ETV7/TEL2, which negatively regulates SERPINE1 expression. Knockdown of SERPINE1 phenocopied the effects of NICD overexpression in culture. Consistent with previous studies and our in vitro findings, there were inverse correlations between ETV7 and SERPINE1 expression and survival in OSCC primary tumours. Our results suggest that the tumour suppressive role of NOTCH1 in OSCC is mediated, at least in part, by inhibition of SERPINE1 via ETV7. ",
        "Alcohol policies and alcohol-attributable cancer mortality in U.S. States. BACKGROUND: Although more restrictive alcohol control policies (e.g., higher alcohol taxes) are related to lower levels of alcohol consumption, little is known about the relationship between alcohol policies and rates of alcohol-attributable cancer. METHODS: State alcohol policy restrictiveness, as measured by a validated policy scale, were related to state rates of six alcohol attributable cancers in the U.S. from 2006 to 2010 in a lagged, cross-sectional linear regression that controlled for a variety of state-level factors. Cancer mortality rates were from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention's Alcohol-Related Disease Impact application, which uses population-attributable fraction methodology to calculate mortality from cancers of the esophagus, larynx, liver, oropharynx, prostate (male only) and breast (female only). RESULTS: More restrictive state alcohol policies were associated with lower cancer mortality rates for the six cancer types overall (beta [\u03b2] -0.33; 95% confidence interval [CI] -0.59, -0.07), and among men (\u03b2 -0.45; 95% CI -0.81, -0.10) and women (\u03b2 -0.21; 95% CI -0.40, -0.02). A 10% increase in the restrictiveness of alcohol policies (based on the mean APS among states) was associated with an 8.5% decrease in rates of combined alcohol-attributable cancers. In all analyses stratified by cancer subtype and sex, the associations were in the hypothesized direction (i.e., more restrictive state policy environments were associated with lower rates of alcohol-attributable cancers), with the exception of laryngeal cancer among women. CONCLUSION: Strengthening alcohol policies is a promising prevention strategy for alcohol-related cancer. ",
        "Rural-Urban Differences In Severe Maternal Morbidity And Mortality In The US, 2007-15. In the United States, severe maternal morbidity and mortality is climbing-a reality that is especially challenging for rural communities, which face declining access to obstetric services. Severe maternal morbidity refers to potentially life-threatening complications or the need to undergo a lifesaving procedure during or immediately following childbirth. Using data for 2007-15 from the National Inpatient Sample, we analyzed severe maternal morbidity and mortality during childbirth hospitalizations among rural and urban residents. We found that severe maternal morbidity and mortality increased among both rural and urban residents in the study period, from 109 per 10,000 childbirth hospitalizations in 2007 to 152 per 10,000 in 2015. When we controlled for sociodemographic factors and clinical conditions, we found that rural residents had a 9\u00a0percent greater probability of severe maternal morbidity and mortality, compared with urban residents. Attention to the challenges faced by rural patients and health care facilities is crucial to the success of efforts to reduce maternal morbidity and mortality in rural areas. These challenges include both clinical factors (workforce shortages, low patient volume, and the opioid epidemic) and social determinants of health (transportation, housing, poverty, food security, racism, violence, and trauma).

        "The relationship between social media use and disordered eating in young adolescents. BACKGROUND: The relationship between social media (SM) use and disordered eating (DE) has not been adequately explored in young adolescents. METHODS: Data from 996 Grade 7 and 8 adolescents (n = 534 girls; M age = 13.08) was investigated. DE cognitions (Eating Disorder Examination-Questionnaire [EDE-Q]), DE behaviors (Project Eating Among Teens), and SM use measures related to Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, and Tumblr were completed. RESULTS: DE behaviors were reported by 51.7% of girls and 45.0% of boys, with strict exercise and meal skipping the most common. A total of 75.4% of girls and 69.9% of boys had at least one SM account where Instagram was the most common, used by 68.1% of girls and 61.7% of boys. Global EDE-Q scores were significantly higher for girls and boys with each type of SM account, except for Facebook and Instagram for girls. A greater number of SM accounts was associated with higher DE scores for both cognitions and behaviors. Girls with Snapchat and Tumblr accounts and boys with Snapchat, Facebook and Instagram were significantly more likely to have both DE behaviors and over-evaluation of shape and weight in the clinical range. Greater daily time spent using Instagram was associated with significantly higher Global EDE-Q scores and DE behaviors for girls, while this pattern was also found for Snapchat usage and DE behaviors for girls. CONCLUSIONS: A clear pattern of association was found between SM usage and DE cognitions and behaviors with this exploratory study confirming that these relationships occur at younger-age than previously investigated.

        "Impact of lifestyle behaviors in early childhood on obesity and cardiometabolic risk in children: Results from the Spanish INMA birth cohort study. BACKGROUND: Identifying modifiable lifestyle behaviors linked to childhood obesity is necessary to develop preventive strategies. OBJECTIVE: To estimate the association of five lifestyle behaviors in children aged 4\u00a0years on obesity and cardiometabolic risk factors at age 4\u00a0years and on obesity and blood pressure at age 7\u00a0years. METHODS: We used child lifestyle data from the INMA project at age 4\u00a0years (n\u00a0=\u00a01480). We constructed a child lifestyle score by summing five behaviors (physical activity, sleep time, television time, plant based foods and intake of ultra-processed foods) and we categorized it into tertiles. At ages 4 and 7 years, we calculated age- and sex-specific z-scores for BMI, waist circumference (WC), and blood pressure. At age 4, we also calculated age-, and sex-, specific z-scores for triglycerides and HDL. We used linear and logistic regression analyses. RESULTS: The lifestyle score was not associated with the outcomes at 4\u00a0years, but it was negatively associated with BMI and WC z-scores at age 7 years. Children at age 4 years in the highest tertile of the score had lower risk of overweight or obesity at age 7 years (OR = 0.61; 95% CI 0.39; 0.96) and abdominal obesity (OR = 0.48; 95% CI 0.24; 0.96). CONCLUSIONS: Higher adherence to a healthy lifestyle at age 4\u00a0years decreased risk of overweight, obesity and abdominal obesity at 7\u00a0years. ",
        "Neuropsin (OPN5) Mediates Local Light-Dependent Induction of Circadian Clock Genes and Circadian Photoentrainment in Exposed Murine Skin. Nearly all mammalian tissues have functional, autonomous circadian clocks, which free-run with non-24\u00a0h periods and must be synchronized (entrained) to the 24\u00a0h day. This entrainment mechanism is thought to be hierarchical, with photic input to the retina entraining the master circadian clock in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) and the SCN in turn synchronizing peripheral tissues via endocrine mechanisms. Here, we assess the function of a population of melanocyte precursor cells in hair and vibrissal follicles that express the photopigment neuropsin (OPN5). Organotypic cultures of murine outer ear and vibrissal skin entrain to a light-dark cycle ex\u00a0vivo, requiring cis-retinal chromophore and Opn5 gene function. Short-wavelength light strongly phase shifts skin circadian rhythms ex\u00a0vivo via an Opn5-dependent mechanism. In\u00a0vivo, the normal amplitude of Period mRNA expression in outer ear skin is dependent on both the light-dark cycle and Opn5 function. In\u00a0Opn4-/-; Pde6brd1/rd1 mice that cannot behaviorally entrain to light-dark cycles, the phase of skin-clock gene expression remains synchronized to the light-dark cycle, even as other peripheral clocks remain phase-locked to the free-running behavioral rhythm. Taken together, these results demonstrate the presence of a direct photic circadian entrainment pathway and direct light-response elements for clock genes in murine skin, similar to pathways previously described for invertebrates and certain non-mammalian vertebrates.

        "Evaluation of appendicitis risk prediction models in adults with\u00a0suspected appendicitis. BACKGROUND: Appendicitis is the most common general surgical emergency worldwide, but its diagnosis remains challenging. The aim of this study was to determine whether existing risk prediction models can reliably identify patients presenting to hospital in the UK with acute right iliac fossa (RIF) pain who are at low risk of appendicitis. METHODS: A systematic search was completed to identify all existing appendicitis risk prediction models. Models were validated using UK data from an international prospective cohort study that captured consecutive patients aged 16-45\u2009years presenting to hospital with acute RIF in March to June 2017. The main outcome was best achievable model specificity (proportion of patients who did not have appendicitis correctly classified as low risk) whilst maintaining a failure rate below 5 per cent (proportion of patients identified as low risk who actually had appendicitis). RESULTS: Some 5345 patients across 154 UK hospitals were identified, of which two-thirds (3613 of 5345, 67\u00b76 per cent) were women. Women were more than twice as likely to undergo surgery with removal of a histologically normal appendix (272 of 964, 28\u00b72 per cent) than men (120 of 993, 12\u00b71 per cent) (relative risk 2\u00b733, 95 per cent c.i. 1\u00b792 to 2\u00b784; P\u2009<\u20090\u00b7001). Of 15 validated risk prediction models, the Adult Appendicitis Score performed best (cut-off score 8 or less, specificity 63\u00b71 per cent, failure rate 3\u00b77 per cent). The Appendicitis Inflammatory Response Score performed best for men (cut-off score 2 or less, specificity 24\u00b77 per cent, failure rate 2\u00b74 per cent). CONCLUSION: Women in the UK had a disproportionate risk of admission without surgical intervention and had high rates of normal appendicectomy. Risk prediction models to support shared decision-making by identifying adults in the UK at low risk of appendicitis were identified. ",

        "Psoriasis, cardiovascular risk factors and metabolic disorders: sex-specific findings of a population-based study. BACKGROUND: Scientific evidence suggests an association between psoriasis and cardiovascular and metabolic diseases. However, there are hardly any sex-specific results from population-based studies reporting the prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors in patients with psoriasis and point estimates of the association between psoriasis and cardiovascular and metabolic disorders. OBJECTIVE: Aims are to evaluate the sex-specific prevalence of psoriasis and cardiovascular risk factors, and to estimate sex-specific associations between psoriasis and diabetes type 2 (DM) and metabolic syndrome (MetS). METHODS: We used data of 3723 participants (45-75\u00a0years, 54.1% women) without coronary heart disease and missing data (psoriasis, DM, MetS) from the Heinz Nixdorf Recall study. Standardized information on health outcomes and risk factors was assessed. We performed descriptive statistics and multiple regression analyses to calculate prevalence rate ratios (PR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). RESULTS: The prevalence of psoriasis was 3.8% (n\u00a0=\u00a0143), with no differences between sex. We observed more often metabolic and cardiovascular risk factors in women with psoriasis compared to women without psoriasis. Interestingly, in men, this pattern was partly reversed. Multiple regression analyses revealed distinctly elevated PRs for DM for both women and men with psoriasis (fully adjusted PR: 2.43; 95% CI: 1.17-5.07, resp. 2.09; 1.16-3.76). Regarding the MetS, the results were inconsistent, showing a positive association between psoriasis and MetS in women (1.84; 1.14-2.98), but a negative association in men, even though with a wide 95% CI (0.69; 0.42-1.12). CONCLUSION: The results of our cross-sectional, population-based analysis show a distinct association between psoriasis and DM, whereas for the MetS the results contrasted between men and women, translating in women with MetS showing a higher and in men a lower chance to be psoriatic.

BACKGROUND: Fluid intelligence (Gf) is a critical cognitive ability that is predictive of real-world outcomes, and it has been a persistent aim to characterize its neural architecture. PROCEDURE: We advance our prior research by applying latent class analysis to evaluate individual differences in the neural and cognitive foundations of Gf over the course of a 16-week randomized, multi-modal intervention trial in neurologically healthy, younger adults (N\u202f=\u202f424). RESULTS: Controlling for pre-intervention ability, three latent classes described individual performance at post-intervention and one group (n\u202f=\u202f71) showed greater gains in visuospatial reasoning and high performance at post-intervention. The high performance group was predicted by larger anterior cingulate cortex, caudate and hippocampus volumes, and smaller middle frontal, insula and parahippocampal cortex volumes. CONCLUSION: Regions that support cognitive control, working memory, and relational processes differentiated individuals who had higher Gf ability at pre-intervention and demonstrated a cumulative better response to the intervention.

        "Corpora amylacea act as containers that remove waste products from the brain. Corpora amylacea (CA) in the human brain are granular bodies formed by polyglucosan aggregates that amass waste products of different origins. They are generated by astrocytes, mainly during aging and neurodegenerative conditions, and are located predominantly in periventricular and subpial regions. This study shows that CA are released from these regions to the cerebrospinal fluid and are present in the cervical lymph nodes, into which cerebrospinal fluid drains through the meningeal lymphatic system. We also show that CA can be phagocytosed by macrophages. We conclude that CA can act as containers that remove waste products from the brain and may be involved in a mechanism that cleans the brain. Moreover, we postulate that CA may contribute in some autoimmune brain diseases, exporting brain substances that interact with the immune system, and hypothesize that CA may contain brain markers that may aid in the diagnosis of certain brain diseases.

        "Smad7 in intestinal CD4+ T cells determines autoimmunity in a spontaneous model of multiple sclerosis. Environmental triggers acting at the intestinal barrier are thought to contribute to the initiation of autoimmune disorders. The transforming growth factor beta inhibitor Smad7 determines the phenotype of CD4+ T cells. We hypothesized that Smad7 in intestinal CD4+ T cells controls initiation of opticospinal encephalomyelitis (OSE), a murine model of multiple sclerosis (MS), depending on the presence of gut microbiota. Smad7 was overexpressed or deleted in OSE CD4+ T cells to determine the effect on clinical progression, T cell differentiation, and T cell migration from the intestine to the central nervous system (CNS). Smad7 overexpression worsened the clinical course of OSE and increased CNS inflammation and demyelination. It favored expansion of intestinal CD4+ T cells toward an inflammatory phenotype and migration of intestinal CD4+ T cells to the CNS. Intestinal biopsies from MS patients revealed decreased transforming growth factor beta signaling with a shift toward inflammatory T cell subtypes. Smad7 in intestinal T cells might represent a valuable therapeutic target for MS to achieve immunologic tolerance in the intestine and suppress CNS inflammation. ",
        "Psychophysiological Responses in People Living with Dementia after an Art Gallery Intervention: An Exploratory Study. The use of existing public spaces by people living with dementia, such as museums and art galleries, are becoming popular due to their ability to facilitate programs which promote social engagement and inclusion. However, few studies have investigated physiological outcomes of art gallery-based programs. Using a quasi-experimental design, the present study aimed to investigate the levels of salivary biomarkers of cortisol and interleukin-6, quality of life (QoL), depressive symptoms, cognition, and wellbeing, after attending the National Gallery of Australia (NGA) Art and Dementia program. Twenty-eight people living with dementia, each supported by a carer or family member, were recruited for a six-week program and were followed up at twelve weeks. In total, 25 participants (17 female; mean age 84.6\u00b17.27 years) completed the study, and 22 provided viable saliva samples. The waking to evening salivary cortisol ratio was higher post-intervention (p\u200a=\u200a0.033), and returned to baseline levels at follow-up (p\u200a=\u200a1.00), indicating a more dynamic salivary cortisol rhythm in response to the six-week program. Interleukin-6 levels remained unchanged (p\u200a=\u200a0.664). No improvements in QoL (DEMQOL-Carer) were observed between baseline and post-intervention (p\u200a=\u200a0.076). However, self-reported depressive symptoms decreased post-intervention compared with baseline (p\u200a=\u200a0.015), and memory (immediate recall) (p\u200a=\u200a0.009) and verbal fluency (p\u200a=\u200a0.027) improved between the same timepoints. The NGA Art and Dementia program appears to have quantifiable benefits, including improved hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis function, justifying a need for longer controlled trial inclusive of physiological outcomes.

        "Opioid-Related Hospitalization and Its Association With Chronic Diseases: Findings From the National Inpatient Sample, 2011-2015. Chronic disease and opioid-related hospitalizations in the United States are increasing. We analyzed nationally representative data on patients aged 18 years or older from the 2011-2015 National Inpatient Sample to assess the association between opioid-related hospitalization and chronic diseases. We found that most patients with opioid-related hospitalization were white, aged 35-54 years, in urban hospitals, and had 2 or more comorbid conditions. Patients with 2 or more chronic conditions accounted for more than 90% of opioid-related hospitalizations in all years. The results suggest a need for targeted interventions to prevent opioid misuse in patients with multiple chronic conditions. ",
        "Predictive impact of rare genomic copy number variations in siblings of individuals with autism spectrum disorders. Identification of genetic biomarkers associated with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) could improve recurrence prediction for families with a child with ASD. Here, we describe clinical microarray findings for 253 longitudinally phenotyped ASD families from the Baby Siblings Research Consortium (BSRC), encompassing 288 infant siblings. By age 3, 103 siblings (35.8%) were diagnosed with ASD and 54 (18.8%) were developing atypically. Thirteen siblings have copy number variants (CNVs) involving ASD-relevant genes: 6 with ASD, 5 atypically developing, and 2 typically developing. Within these families, an ASD-related CNV in a sibling has a positive predictive value (PPV) for ASD or atypical development of 0.83; the Simons Simplex Collection of ASD families shows similar PPVs. Polygenic risk analyses suggest that common genetic variants may also contribute to ASD. CNV findings would have been pre-symptomatically predictive of ASD or atypical development in 11 (7%) of the 157 BSRC siblings who were eventually diagnosed clinically. ",
        "Phosphorylation of Npas4 by MAPK Regulates Reward-Related Gene Expression and Behaviors. Dopamine (DA) activates mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) via protein kinase A (PKA)/Rap1 in medium spiny neurons (MSNs) expressing the dopamine D1 receptor (D1R) in the nucleus accumbens (NAc), thereby regulating reward-related behavior. However, how MAPK regulates reward-related learning and memory through gene expression is poorly understood. Here, to identify the relevant transcriptional factors, we perform proteomic analysis using affinity beads coated with cyclic AMP response element binding protein (CREB)-binding protein (CBP), a transcriptional coactivator involved in reward-related behavior. We identify more than 400 CBP-interacting proteins, including Neuronal Per Arnt Sim domain protein 4 (Npas4). We find that MAPK phosphorylates Npas4 downstream of PKA, increasing the Npas4-CBP interaction and the transcriptional activity of Npas4 at the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) promoter. The deletion of Npas4 in D1R-expressing MSNs impairs cocaine-induced place preference, which is rescued by Npas4-wild-type (WT), but not by a phospho-deficient Npas4 mutant. These observations suggest that MAPK phosphorylates Npas4 in D1R-MSNs and increases transcriptional activity to enhance reward-related learning and memory. ",
        "Evolutionary loss of foot muscle during development with characteristics of atrophy and no evidence of cell death. Many species that run or leap across sparsely vegetated habitats, including horses and deer, evolved the severe reduction or complete loss of foot muscles as skeletal elements elongated and digits were lost, and yet the developmental mechanisms remain unknown. Here, we report the natural loss of foot muscles in the bipedal jerboa, Jaculus jaculus. Although adults have no muscles in their feet, newborn animals have muscles that rapidly disappear soon after birth. We were surprised to find no evidence of apoptotic or necrotic cell death during stages of peak myofiber loss, countering well-supported assumptions of developmental tissue remodeling. We instead see hallmarks of muscle atrophy, including an ordered disassembly of the sarcomere associated with upregulation of the E3 ubiquitin ligases, MuRF1 and Atrogin-1. We propose that the natural loss of muscle, which remodeled foot anatomy during evolution and development, involves cellular mechanisms that are typically associated with disease or injury. ",
        "Chronic inflammation in the etiology of disease across the life span. Although intermittent increases in inflammation are critical for survival during physical injury and infection, recent research has revealed that certain social, environmental and lifestyle factors can promote systemic chronic inflammation (SCI) that can, in turn, lead to several diseases that collectively represent the leading causes of disability and mortality worldwide, such as cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and autoimmune and neurodegenerative disorders. In the present Perspective we describe the multi-level mechanisms underlying SCI and several risk factors that promote this health-damaging phenotype, including infections, physical inactivity, poor diet, environmental and industrial toxicants and psychological stress. Furthermore, we suggest potential strategies for advancing the early diagnosis, prevention and treatment of SCI. ",
        "The effect of bigger human bodies on the future global calorie requirements. Existing studies show how population growth and rising incomes will cause a massive increase in the future global demand for food. We add to the literature by estimating the potential effect of increases in human weight, caused by rising BMI and height, on future calorie requirements. Instead of using a market based approach, the estimations are solely based on human energy requirements for maintenance of weight. We develop four different scenarios to show the effect of increases in human height and BMI. In a world where the weight per age-sex group would stay stable, we project calorie requirements to increases by 61.05 percent between 2010 and 2100. Increases in BMI and height could add another 18.73 percentage points to this. This additional increase amounts to more than the combined calorie requirements of India and Nigeria in 2010. These increases would particularly affect Sub-Saharan African countries, which will already face massively rising calorie requirements due to the high population growth. The stark regional differences call for policies that increase food access in currently economically weak regions. Such policies should shift consumption away from energy dense foods that promote overweight and obesity, to avoid the direct burden associated with these conditions and reduce the increases in required calories. Supplying insufficient calories would not solve the problem but cause malnutrition in populations with weak access to food. As malnutrition is not reducing but promoting rises in BMI levels, this might even aggravate the situation. ",
        "Functional Translatome Proteomics Reveal Converging and Dose-Dependent Regulation by mTORC1 and eIF2\u03b1. Regulation of translation is essential during stress. However, the precise sets of proteins regulated by the key translational stress responses-the integrated stress response (ISR) and mTORC1-remain elusive. We developed multiplexed enhanced protein dynamics (mePROD) proteomics, adding signal amplification to dynamic-SILAC and multiplexing, to enable measuring acute changes in protein synthesis. Treating cells with ISR/mTORC1-modulating stressors, we showed extensive translatome modulation with \u223c20% of proteins synthesized at highly reduced rates. Comparing translation-deficient sub-proteomes revealed an extensive overlap demonstrating that target specificity is achieved on\u00a0protein level and not by pathway activation. Titrating cap-dependent translation inhibition confirmed that synthesis of individual proteins is controlled by intrinsic properties responding to global translation attenuation. This study reports a highly sensitive method to measure relative translation at the nascent chain level and provides insight into how the ISR and mTORC1, two key cellular pathways, regulate the translatome to guide cellular survival upon stress.

        "Functional genetic validation of key genes conferring insecticide resistance in the major African malaria vector, Anopheles gambiae. Resistance in Anopheles gambiae to members of all 4 major classes (pyrethroids, carbamates, organochlorines, and organophosphates) of public health insecticides limits effective control of malaria transmission in Africa. Increase in expression of detoxifying enzymes has been associated with insecticide resistance, but their direct functional validation in An. gambiae is still lacking. Here, we perform transgenic analysis using the GAL4/UAS system to examine insecticide resistance phenotypes conferred by increased expression of the 3 genes-Cyp6m2, Cyp6p3, and Gste2-most often found up-regulated in resistant An. gambiae We report evidence in An. gambiae that organophosphate and organochlorine resistance is conferred by overexpression of GSTE2 in a broad tissue profile. Pyrethroid and carbamate resistance is bestowed by similar Cyp6p3 overexpression, and Cyp6m2 confers only pyrethroid resistance when overexpressed in the same tissues. Conversely, such Cyp6m2 overexpression increases susceptibility to the organophosphate malathion, presumably due to conversion to the more toxic metabolite, malaoxon. No resistant phenotypes are conferred when either Cyp6 gene overexpression is restricted to the midgut or oenocytes, indicating that neither tissue is involved in insecticide resistance mediated by the candidate P450s examined. Validation of genes conferring resistance provides markers to guide control strategies, and the observed negative cross-resistance due to Cyp6m2 gives credence to proposed dual-insecticide strategies to overcome pyrethroid resistance. These transgenic An. gambiae-resistant lines are being used to test the \"resistance-breaking\" efficacy of active compounds early in their development. ",
        "Mechanical stress compromises multicomponent efflux complexes in bacteria. Physical forces have a profound effect on growth, morphology, locomotion, and survival of organisms. At the level of individual cells, the role of mechanical forces is well recognized in eukaryotic physiology, but much less is known about prokaryotic organisms. Recent findings suggest an effect of physical forces on bacterial shape, cell division, motility, virulence, and biofilm initiation, but it remains unclear how mechanical forces applied to a bacterium are translated at the molecular level. In Gram-negative bacteria, multicomponent protein complexes can form rigid links across the cell envelope and are therefore subject to physical forces experienced by the cell. Here we manipulate tensile and shear mechanical stress in the bacterial cell envelope and use single-molecule tracking to show that octahedral shear (but not hydrostatic) stress within the cell envelope promotes disassembly of the tripartite efflux complex CusCBA, a system used by Escherichia coli to resist copper and silver toxicity. By promoting disassembly of this protein complex, mechanical forces within the cell envelope make the bacteria more susceptible to metal toxicity. These findings demonstrate that mechanical forces can inhibit the function of cell envelope protein assemblies in bacteria and suggest the possibility that other multicomponent, transenvelope efflux complexes may be sensitive to mechanical forces including complexes involved in antibiotic resistance, cell division, and translocation of outer membrane components. By modulating the function of proteins within the cell envelope, mechanical stress has the potential to regulate multiple processes required for bacterial survival and growth. ",
        "Fracture repair requires TrkA signaling by skeletal sensory nerves. Bone is richly innervated by nerve growth factor-responsive (NGF-responsive) tropomyosin receptor kinase A-expressing (TrKa-expressing) sensory nerve fibers, which are required for osteochondral progenitor expansion during mammalian skeletal development. Aside from pain sensation, little is known regarding the role of sensory innervation in bone repair. Here, we characterized the reinnervation of tissue following experimental ulnar stress fracture and assessed the impact of loss of TrkA signaling in this process. Sequential histological data obtained in reporter mice subjected to fracture demonstrated a marked upregulation of NGF expression in periosteal stromal progenitors and fracture-associated macrophages. Sprouting and arborization of CGRP+TrkA+ sensory nerve fibers within the reactive periosteum in NGF-enriched cellular domains were evident at time points preceding periosteal vascularization, ossification, and mineralization. Temporal inhibition of TrkA catalytic activity by administration of 1NMPP1 to TrkAF592A mice significantly reduced the numbers of sensory fibers, blunted revascularization, and delayed ossification of the fracture callus. We observed similar deficiencies in nerve regrowth and fracture healing in a mouse model of peripheral neuropathy induced by paclitaxel treatment. Together, our studies demonstrate an essential role of TrkA signaling for stress fracture repair and implicate skeletal sensory nerves as an important upstream mediator of this repair process. ",
        "c-Jun overexpression in CAR T cells induces exhaustion resistance. Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells mediate anti-tumour effects in a small subset of patients with cancer1-3, but dysfunction due to T cell exhaustion is an important barrier to progress4-6. To investigate the biology of exhaustion in human T cells expressing CAR receptors, we used a model system with a tonically signaling CAR, which induces hallmark features of exhaustion6. Exhaustion was associated with a profound defect in the production of IL-2, along with increased chromatin accessibility of AP-1 transcription factor motifs and overexpression of the bZIP and IRF transcription factors that have been implicated in mediating dysfunction in exhausted T cells7-10. Here we show that CAR T cells engineered to overexpress the canonical AP-1 factor c-Jun have enhanced expansion potential, increased functional capacity, diminished terminal differentiation and improved anti-tumour potency in five different mouse tumour models in vivo. We conclude that a functional deficiency in c-Jun mediates dysfunction in exhausted human T cells, and that engineering CAR T cells to overexpress c-Jun renders them resistant to exhaustion, thereby addressing a major barrier to progress for this emerging class of therapeutic agents.

        "Relation of Total Sugars, Sucrose, Fructose, and Added Sugars With the Risk of Cardiovascular Disease: A Systematic Review and Dose-Response Meta-analysis of Prospective Cohort Studies. OBJECTIVE: To determine the association of total and added fructose-containing sugars on cardiovascular (CVD) incidence and mortality. METHODS: MEDLINE, EMBASE and Cochrane Library were searched from January 1, 1980, to July 31, 2018. Prospective cohort studies assessing the association of reported intakes of total, sucrose, fructose and added sugars with CVD incidence and mortality in individuals free from disease at baseline were included. Risk estimates were pooled using the inverse variance method, and dose-response analysis was modeled. RESULTS: Eligibility criteria were met by 24 prospective cohort comparisons (624,128 unique individuals; 11,856 CVD incidence cases and 12,224 CVD mortality cases). Total sugars, sucrose, and fructose were not associated with CVD incidence. Total sugars (risk ratio, 1.09 [95% confidence interval, 1.02 to 1.17]) and fructose (1.08 [1.01 to 1.15]) showed a harmful association for CVD mortality, there was no association for added sugars and a beneficial association for sucrose (0.94 [0.89 to 0.99]). Dose-response analyses showed a beneficial linear dose-response gradient for sucrose and nonlinear dose-response thresholds for harm for total sugars (133 grams, 26% energy), fructose (58 grams, 11% energy) and added sugars (65 grams, 13% energy) in relation to CVD mortality (P<.05). The certainty of the evidence using GRADE was very low for CVD incidence and low for CVD mortality for all sugar types. CONCLUSION: Current evidence supports a threshold of harm for intakes of total sugars, added sugars, and fructose at higher exposures and lack of harm for sucrose independent of food form for CVD mortality. Further research of different food sources of sugars is needed to define better the relationship between sugars and CVD. REGISTRATION: clinicaltrials.gov, NCT01608620. ",
        "The impact of change in definition of increased-risk donors on survival after lung transplant. OBJECTIVES: To study the impact of using the US Public Health Service broadened definition of \"increased-risk\" donors (2013) in comparison with \"high-risk\" (1994) and standard infectious risk donors on lung transplant recipient outcomes. METHODS: Patients who underwent lung transplant between January 1, 2006, and May 31, 2017, in the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients were divided into 2 cohorts, recipients of: (1) high-risk donors: January 1, 2006, to October 1, 2013, and (2) increased-risk donors: January 1, 2014, to May 31, 2017, and compared with matched recipients who received standard-risk donors. Risks for acute rejection, patient, and graft survival using propensity score matched cohorts, multivariable logistic, and Cox models were examined. RESULTS: In total, 18,490 lung transplant recipients were analyzed with 36% transplanted during the increased-risk donor definition period. The proportion of donors classified as nonstandard infectious risk increased with the definition change (8% high-risk donors vs 22% increased-risk donors; P\u00a0<\u00a0.001). In both cohorts, male patients with a lower forced expiratory volume in 1\u00a0second and greater creatinine were more likely to receive an organ from increased risk donors. Neither graft nor patient survival differed by donor type in either period. Acute treated rejection within 1\u00a0year did not differ by period for recipients of increased risk donors (odds ratio, 0.87; P\u00a0=\u00a0.23) or recipients of high-risk donors (odds ratio, 1.2; P\u00a0=\u00a0.27). CONCLUSIONS: The 2013 broadened definition of donor risk increased the proportion of nonstandard infectious risk donors. Recipients of increased/high-risk donors had similar graft and patient survival compared with standard-risk donors. ",
        "Integrative proteogenomic analyses of human tumours identifies ADNP as a novel oncogenic mediator of cell cycle progression in high-grade serous ovarian cancer with poor prognosis. BACKGROUND: Despite toxic side effects and limited durable response, the current standard-of-care treatment for high grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) remains platinum/taxane-based chemotherapy. Given that the overall prognosis has not improved drastically over the past several decades, there is a critical need to understand the underlying mechanisms that lead to tumour development and progression. METHODS: We utilized an integrative proteogenomic analysis of HGSOC tumours applying a poor prognosis gene expression signature (PPS) as a conceptual framework to analyse orthogonal genomic and proteomic data from the TCGA (n\u202f=\u202f488) and CPTAC (n\u202f=\u202f169) studies. Genes identified through in silico analyses were assessed in vitro studies to demonstrate their impact on proliferation and cell cycle progression. FINDINGS: These analyses identified DNA amplification and overexpression of the transcription factor ADNP (Activity Dependent Neuroprotector Homeobox) in poorly prognostic tumours. Validation studies confirmed the prognostic capacity of ADNP and suggested an oncogenic role for this protein given the association between ADNP expression and pro-proliferative signalling. In vitro studies confirmed ADNP as a novel and essential mediator of cell proliferation through dysregulation of cell cycle checkpoints. INTERPRETATION: We identified ADNP as being amplified and overexpressed in poor prognosis HGSOC in silico analyses and demonstrated that ADNP is a novel and essential oncogene in HGSOC which mediates proliferation through dysregulation of cell cycle checkpoints in vitro.

        "Recognition of human gastrointestinal cancer neoantigens by circulating PD-1+ lymphocytes. Tumor-resident lymphocytes can mount a response against neoantigens expressed in microsatellite-stable gastrointestinal (GI) cancers, and adoptive transfer of neoantigen-specific lymphocytes has demonstrated antitumor activity in selected patients. However, whether peripheral blood could be used as an alternative minimally invasive source to identify lymphocytes targeting neoantigens in patients with GI cancer with relatively low mutation burden is unclear. We used a personalized high-throughput screening strategy to investigate whether PD-1 expression in peripheral blood could be used to identify CD8+ or CD4+ lymphocytes recognizing neoantigens identified by whole-exome sequencing in 7 patients with GI cancer. We found that neoantigen-specific lymphocytes were preferentially enriched in the CD8+PD-1+/hi or CD4+PD-1+/hi subsets, but not in the corresponding bulk or PD-1- fractions. In 6 of 7 individuals analyzed we identified circulating CD8+ and CD4+ lymphocytes targeting 6 and 4 neoantigens, respectively. Moreover, neoantigen-reactive T cells and a T cell receptor (TCR) isolated from the CD8+PD-1+ subsets recognized autologous tumor, albeit at reduced levels, in 2 patients with available cell lines. These data demonstrate the existence of circulating T cells targeting neoantigens in GI cancer patients and provide an approach to generate enriched populations of personalized neoantigen-specific lymphocytes and isolate TCRs that could be exploited therapeutically to treat cancer.

        "Prospective validation study of an epilepsy seizure risk system for outpatient evaluation. OBJECTIVE: We conducted clinical testing of an automated Bayesian machine learning\u00a0algorithm (Epilepsy Seizure Assessment Tool [EpiSAT]) for outpatient seizure risk assessment using seizure counting data, and validated performance against specialized epilepsy clinician\u00a0experts. METHODS: We conducted a prospective longitudinal study of EpiSAT performance against 24 specialized clinician experts\u00a0at three tertiary referral epilepsy centers in the United States. Accuracy, interrater reliability, and intra-rater reliability of EpiSAT\u00a0for correctly identifying\u00a0changes in\u00a0seizure risk (improvements, worsening, or no change) were evaluated using 120 seizures from four synthetic seizure diaries (seizure risk known) and 120 seizures from four real seizure diaries (seizure risk unknown). The proportion of observed agreement between EpiSAT and clinicians was evaluated to assess compatibility of EpiSAT with clinical decision patterns by epilepsy experts. RESULTS: EpiSAT exhibited substantial observed agreement (75.4%) with clinicians for assessing seizure risk. The mean accuracy of epilepsy providers for correctly assessing seizure risk was 74.7%. EpiSAT accurately identified seizure risk in 87.5% of seizure diary entries, corresponding to a significant improvement of 17.4% (P\u00a0=\u00a0.002). Clinicians exhibited low-to-moderate interrater reliability for seizure risk assessment (Krippendorff's \u03b1\u00a0=\u00a00.46) with good intrarater reliability across a 4- to 12-week evaluation period (Scott's \u03c0\u00a0=\u00a00.89). SIGNIFICANCE: These results validate the ability of EpiSAT to yield objective clinical recommendations on seizure risk which follow decision patterns similar to those from specialized epilepsy providers, but with improved accuracy and reproducibility. This algorithm may serve as a useful clinical decision support system for quantitative analysis of clinical seizure frequency in clinical epilepsy practice. ",
        "Perinatal maternal antibiotic exposure augments lung injury in offspring in experimental bronchopulmonary dysplasia. During the newborn period, intestinal commensal bacteria influence pulmonary mucosal immunology via the gut-lung axis. Epidemiological studies have linked perinatal antibiotic exposure in human newborns to an increased risk for bronchopulmonary dysplasia, but whether this effect is mediated by the gut-lung axis is unknown. To explore antibiotic disruption of the newborn gut-lung axis, we studied how perinatal maternal antibiotic exposure influenced lung injury in a hyperoxia-based mouse model of bronchopulmonary dysplasia. We report that disruption of intestinal commensal colonization during the perinatal period promotes a more severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia phenotype characterized by increased mortality and pulmonary fibrosis. Mechanistically, metagenomic shifts were associated with decreased IL-22 expression in bronchoalveolar lavage and were independent of hyperoxia-induced inflammasome activation. Collectively, these results demonstrate a previously unrecognized influence of the gut-lung axis during the development of neonatal lung injury, which could be leveraged to ameliorate the most severe and persistent pulmonary complication of preterm birth.

        "Validation of the DNA Damage Immune Response Signature in Patients With Triple-Negative Breast Cancer From the SWOG 9313c Trial. PURPOSE: To independently validate two biomarkers, a 44-gene DNA damage immune response (DDIR) signature and stromal tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (sTILs), as prognostic markers in patients with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) treated with adjuvant doxorubicin (A) and cyclophosphamide (C) in SWOG 9313. METHODS: Four hundred twenty-five centrally determined patient cases with TNBC from S9313 were identified. DDIR signature was performed on RNA isolated from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor tissue, and samples were classified as DDIR negative or positive using predefined cutoffs. Evaluation of sTILs was performed as described previously. Markers were tested for prognostic value for disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) using Cox regression models adjusted for treatment assignment, nodal status, and tumor size. RESULTS: Among 425 patients with TNBC, 33% were node positive. DDIR was tested successfully in 90% of patients (381 of 425), 62% of which were DDIR signature positive. DDIR signature positivity was associated with improved DFS (hazard ratio [HR], 0.67; 95% CI, 0.48 to 0.92; P = .015) and OS (HR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.43 to 0.89; P = .010). sTILs density assessment was available in 99% of patients and was associated with improved DFS (HR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.51 to 0.96; P = .026 for sTILs density \u2265 20% v < 20%) and OS (HR, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.41 to 0.85; P = .004 for sTILs density \u2265 20% v < 20%). DDIR signature score and sTILs density were moderately correlated (r = 0.60), which precluded statistical significance for DFS in a joint model. Three-year DFS and OS in a subgroup of patients with DDIR positivity and T1c/T2N0 disease were 88% and 94%, respectively. CONCLUSION: The prognostic role of sTILs and DDIR in early-stage TNBC was confirmed. DDIR signature conferred improved prognosis in two thirds of patients with TNBC treated with adjuvant AC. DDIR signature has the potential to stratify outcome and to identify patients with less projected benefit after AC chemotherapy. ",
        "In vivo fluorescence imaging of conjunctival goblet cells. Conjunctival goblet cells (GCs) are specialized epithelial cells that secrete mucins onto the ocular surface to maintain the wet environment. Assessment of GCs is important because various ocular surface diseases are associated with their loss. Although there are GC assessment methods available, the current methods are either invasive or difficult to use. In this report, we developed a simple and non-invasive GC assessment method based on fluorescence imaging. Moxifloxacin ophthalmic solution was used to label GCs via topical administration, and then various fluorescence microscopies could image GCs in high contrasts. Fluorescence imaging of GCs in the mouse conjunctiva was confirmed by both confocal reflection microscopy and histology with Periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) labeling. Real-time in-vivo conjunctival GC imaging was demonstrated in a rat model by using both confocal fluorescence microscopy and simple wide-field fluorescence microscopy. Different GC densities were observed in the forniceal and bulbar conjunctivas of the rat eye. Moxifloxacin based fluorescence imaging provides high-contrast images of conjunctival GCs non-invasively and could be useful for the study or diagnosis of GC related ocular surface diseases. ",
        "Sand fly synthetic sex-aggregation pheromone co-located with insecticide reduces the incidence of infection in the canine reservoir of visceral leishmaniasis: A stratified cluster randomised trial. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of a synthetic sex-aggregation pheromone of the sand fly vector Lu. longipalpis, co-located with residual insecticide, to reduce the infection incidence of Leishmania infantum in the canine reservoir. METHODS: A stratified cluster randomised trial was designed to detect a 50% reduction in canine incident infection after 24 months in 42 recruited clusters, randomly assigned to one of three intervention arms (14 cluster each): synthetic pheromone + insecticide, insecticide-impregnated dog collars, or placebo control. Infection incidence was measured by seroconversion to anti-Leishmania serum antibody, Leishmania parasite detection and canine tissue parasite loads. Changes in relative Lu. longipalpis abundance within households were measured by setting three CDC light traps per household. RESULTS: A total 1,454 seronegative dogs were followed-up for a median 15.2 (95% C.I.s: 14.6, 16.2) months per cluster. The pheromone + insecticide intervention provided 13% (95% C.I. 0%, 44.0%) protection against anti-Leishmania antibody seroconversion, 52% (95% C.I. 6.2%, 74\u00b79%) against parasite infection, reduced tissue parasite loads by 53% (95% C.I. 5.4%, 76.7%), and reduced household female sand fly abundance by 49% (95% C.I. 8.2%, 71.3%). Variation in the efficacy against seroconversion varied between trial strata. Equivalent protection attributed to the impregnated-collars were 36% (95% C.I. 14.4%, 51.8%), 23% (95% C.I. 0%, 57\u00b75%), 48% (95% C.I. 0%, 73.4%) and 43% (95% C.I. 0%, 67.9%), respectively. Comparison of the two interventions showed no statistically consistent differences in their efficacies; however, the errors were broad for all outcomes. Reductions in sand fly numbers were predominant where insecticide was located (chicken and dog sleeping sites), with no evidence of insecticide-induced repellence onto humans or dogs. CONCLUSION: The synthetic pheromone co-located with insecticide provides protection particularly against canine L. infantum parasite transmission and sand fly vector abundance. The effect estimates are not dissimilar to those of the insecticide-impregnated collars, which are documented to reduce canine infection incidence, human infection and clinical VL disease incidence, in different global regions. The trialled novel lure-and-kill approach is a low-cost potential vector control tool against ZVL in the Americas. ",
        "Injury Rate and Patterns in Group Strength-Endurance Training Classes. OBJECTIVE: To identify the injury rate during high-intensity functional training. PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS: Adults (N=100; 82 [82%] female) in group strength-endurance training at the Dan Abraham Healthy Living Center from January 9, 2017, through April 19, 2018, were recruited for the study. Participants were recruited before the class start date. Those who consented received a preclass survey and another survey 6 weeks after the class started to obtain data on demographic characteristics, baseline joint problems or pain, injuries in the preceding 6 weeks, class satisfaction, and exercise habits. Classes lasted 6 weeks and were led by a trainer for 60 minutes, once weekly. Participants were encouraged to perform similar exercise on 2 additional nonconsecutive days throughout the week. Injury was self-reported and defined as experiencing new pain or sustaining injury while exercising during the 6-week time frame. The primary outcome measure was the number of injuries per 1000 training hours. RESULTS: The injury rate was 9.0 injuries per 1000 training hours (95% CI, 5.8-13.4 injuries per 1000 training hours) during the 6-week training and 5.0 injuries per 1000 training hours (95% CI, 2.8-8.2 injuries per 1000 training hours) during the 6 weeks preceding enrollment (P=.08). Injury occurred in 18 (18%) of participants during the 6-week training, and 9 of 24 injuries (37.5%) occurred during a training class. The most commonly injured regions were knees (n=7) and back (n=6). Burpees and squats were the most common movements causing injury. CONCLUSION: The increased injury rate during the study was not statistically significant. It was higher than rates reported in previous retrospective studies of high-intensity functional training, weight lifting, or power lifting but comparable with rates reported in prospective studies of novice and recreational runners.

        "Usp9X Controls Ankyrin-Repeat Domain Protein Homeostasis during Dendritic Spine Development. Variants in the ANK3 gene encoding ankyrin-G are\u00a0associated with neurodevelopmental disorders, including intellectual disability, autism, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder. However, no upstream regulators of ankyrin-G at synapses are known. Here, we\u00a0show that ankyrin-G interacts with Usp9X, a neurodevelopmental-disorder-associated deubiquitinase (DUB). Usp9X phosphorylation enhances their interaction, decreases ankyrin-G polyubiquitination, and stabilizes ankyrin-G to maintain dendritic spine development. In forebrain-specific Usp9X knockout mice (Usp9X-/Y), ankyrin-G as well as multiple ankyrin-repeat domain (ANKRD)-containing proteins are transiently reduced at 2 but recovered at 12\u00a0weeks postnatally. However, reduced cortical spine density in knockouts persists into adulthood. Usp9X-/Y mice display increase of ankyrin-G ubiquitination and aggregation and hyperactivity. USP9X mutations in patients with intellectual disability and autism ablate its catalytic activity or ankyrin-G interaction. Our data reveal a DUB-dependent mechanism of ANKRD protein homeostasis, the impairment of which only transiently\u00a0affects ANKRD protein levels but leads to\u00a0persistent neuronal, behavioral, and clinical abnormalities.

        "Functional Outcomes, Quantitative Morphometry, and Aesthetic Analysis of Articulated Alar Rim Grafts in Septorhinoplasty. Importance: The design, use, and indications for the articulated alar rim graft (AARG) and the functional and aesthetic improvements that can be achieved have not been fully characterized. Objective: To analyze the functional and aesthetic outcomes of AARG placement on nasal airway function, nasal base shape change, and appearance. Design, Setting, and Participants: A case series study of patients who underwent septorhinoplasty with placement of AARG at University of California, Irvine Medical Center, from 2015 to 2018 was carried out. Surgical data recorded included stage of rhinoplasty (primary vs revision), use of spreader grafts, rim grafts (and dimensions), caudal septal extension graft (CSEG), lateral crural tensioning (LCT), and turbinate reductions. Main Outcomes and Measures: Preoperative and postoperative Nasal Obstruction Symptom Evaluation Survey (NOSE) surveys were analyzed and correlated with AARG geometry, use of CSEG, and the LCT maneuver. Preoperative and postoperative alar base views were evaluated by fitting base shape to a parametric numerical model to categorize each to 1 of 6 shape categories. Blinded reviewers rated alar furrow severity and the alar ridge presence using a Likert scale for both preoperative and postoperative images to subjectively gauge aesthetic outcomes. Results: Overall, 90 patients with both preoperative and postoperative NOSE scores who underwent septorhinoplasty and placement of an AARG were included. Of the 90 patients, 60 were women (mean age, 38.2 years). Patient NOSE scores (70.4 preoperatively to 25.1 postoperatively) significantly improved from preoperation to postoperation (P\u2009<\u2009.001), regardless of AARG size, CSEG, or LCT. Alar base shape parametric analysis showed preoperative to postoperative improvements were significant for anterior-to-posterior ratio mass distribution (95% CI, -0.16 to 0.02; P\u2009=\u2009.05) and vertical projection-to-horizontal base width ratio (95% CI, 0.01-0.32; P\u2009=\u2009.02) in flat noses and cloverleafing for narrow noses (95% CI, -0.05 to -0.01; P\u2009=\u2009.001); enhancement approached significance for reduction in lateral scalloping in cloverleaf noses (P\u2009=\u2009.06). Aesthetic analysis showed that there was a statistically significant improvement for the alar furrow (95% CI, -0.68 to -0.29 for rater 1; -0.54 to -0.27 for rater 2; and -0.59 to -0.27 for rater 3; P\u2009<\u2009.001) for all raters and for the alar ridge (95% CI, 0.16-0.48; P\u2009<\u2009.001) for 1 rater. Conclusions and Relevance: To our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate that AARG use is associated with statistically significant improvement in NOSE scores. Placement of AARGs may improve posterior mass ratios in flat noses and lateral cloverleafing in narrow noses as suggested by quantitative shape change parameter analysis. The placement of AARGs was associated with aesthetic and functional enhancement in the cloverleaf deformity, which is associated with a prominent alar furrow, and often external nasal valve collapse. Patient selection is key when placing AARGs. Level of Evidence: NA. ",
        "Comparative analysis of squamate brains unveils multi-level variation in cerebellar architecture associated with locomotor specialization. Ecomorphological studies evaluating the impact of environmental and biological factors on the brain have so far focused on morphology or size measurements, and the ecological relevance of potential multi-level variations in brain architecture remains unclear in vertebrates. Here, we exploit the extraordinary ecomorphological diversity of squamates to assess brain phenotypic diversification with respect to locomotor specialization, by integrating single-cell distribution and transcriptomic data along with geometric morphometric, phylogenetic, and volumetric analysis of high-definition 3D models. We reveal significant changes in cerebellar shape and size as well as alternative spatial layouts of cortical neurons and dynamic gene expression that all correlate with locomotor behaviours. These findings show that locomotor mode is a strong predictor of cerebellar structure and pattern, suggesting that major behavioural transitions in squamates are evolutionarily correlated with mosaic brain changes. Furthermore, our study amplifies the concept of 'cerebrotype', initially proposed for vertebrate brain proportions, towards additional shape characters. ",
        "Ten-Hour Time-Restricted Eating Reduces Weight, Blood Pressure, and Atherogenic Lipids in Patients with Metabolic Syndrome. In animal models, time-restricted feeding (TRF) can prevent and reverse aspects of metabolic diseases. Time-restricted eating (TRE) in human pilot studies reduces the risks of metabolic diseases in otherwise healthy individuals. However, patients with diagnosed metabolic syndrome often undergo pharmacotherapy, and it has never been tested whether TRE can act synergistically with pharmacotherapy in animal models or humans. In a single-arm, paired-sample trial, 19 participants with metabolic syndrome and a baseline mean daily eating window of \u226514 h, the majority of whom were on a statin and/or antihypertensive therapy, underwent 10\u00a0h of TRE (all dietary intake within a consistent self-selected 10\u00a0h window) for 12\u00a0weeks. We found this TRE intervention improves cardiometabolic health for patients with metabolic syndrome receiving standard medical care including high rates of statin and anti-hypertensive use. TRE is a potentially powerful lifestyle intervention that can be added to standard medical practice to treat metabolic syndrome. VIDEO ABSTRACT. ",
        "Early clinical markers of overweight/obesity onset and resolution by adolescence. OBJECTIVES: We examined how combinations of clinical indicators at various ages predict overweight/obesity development, as well as resolution, by 10-11 and 14-15 years of age. METHODS: Data were derived from Birth (N\u2009=\u20093469) and Kinder (N\u2009=\u20093276) cohorts of the Longitudinal Study of Australian Children, followed from ages 2-3 and 4-5 years, respectively. Every two years, 25 potential obesity-relevant clinical indicators were quantified. Overweight/obesity was defined using International Obesity Taskforce cutpoints at 10-11 years and 14-15 years. RESULTS: In both cohorts, three factors predicted both development and resolution of overweight/obesity in multivariable models. Among normal weight children, increased odds of developing overweight/obesity were associated with higher child (odd ratio (OR) 1.67-3.35 across different study waves) and maternal (OR 1.05-1.09) BMI, and inversely with higher maternal education (OR 0.60-0.62, when assessed at age 2-7 years). Lower odds of resolving existing overweight/obesity were related with higher child (OR 0.51-0.79) and maternal (OR 0.89-0.95) BMI, and inversely with higher maternal education (OR 1.62-1.92, when assessed at age 2-5 years). The prevalence of overweight/obesity at the age of 14-15 years was 13% among children with none of these risk factors at age 6-7 years, compared with 71% among those with all 3 risk factors (P\u2009<\u20090.001). CONCLUSIONS: From early childhood onwards, child and maternal BMI and maternal education predict overweight/obesity onset and resolution by adolescence. A simple risk score, easily available to child health clinicians, could help target treatment or prevention. ",
        "Are there primary intraocular lymphomas that do not develop into central nervous system lymphomas?. Primary intraocular lymphomas frequently develop into central nervous system lymphomas and vice versa. This study reviewed 22 consecutive patients with primary intraocular lymphoma diagnosed by immunostaining of vitrectomy cell blocks, and examined whether they developed central nervous system lymphoma. Seventeen patients developed central nervous system lymphoma: 3 patients developed intraocular and central nervous system lymphoma simultaneously, 9 patients developed central nervous system lymphoma 1 month to 5 years (median, 3 months) after intraocular lymphoma, and 5 patients developed central nervous system lymphoma preceding the diagnosis of intraocular lymphoma by 3 months to 9 years and 8 months (median, 1.5 years). In contrast, 5 patients did not develop central nervous system lymphoma: 2 patients did not develop local recurrence or central nervous system lymphoma in the follow-up period of 5 years and 11 years, respectively, after vitrectomy alone without additional local or systemic treatment. The remaining 3 patients with intraocular lymphoma had insufficient follow-up periods to determine the prognosis. The results of CD5 immunostaining of vitrectomy specimens were found in pathology reports of 8 patients: 3 patients with CD5-positive large cells and 4 patients with CD5-negative large cells developed central nervous system lymphoma. In summary, only a small number of patients did not develop central nervous system lymphoma based on long-term follow-up after vitrectomy alone. CD5 was not a marker of central nervous system involvement in this study population. ",
        "Effect of True and Sham Acupuncture on Radiation-Induced Xerostomia Among Patients With Head and Neck Cancer: A Randomized Clinical Trial. Importance: Radiation-induced xerostomia (RIX) is a common, often debilitating, adverse effect of radiation therapy among patients with head and neck cancer. Quality of life can be severely affected, and current treatments have limited benefit. Objective: To determine if acupuncture can prevent RIX in patients with head and neck cancer undergoing radiation therapy. Design, Setting, and Participants: This 2-center, phase 3, randomized clinical trial compared a standard care control (SCC) with true acupuncture (TA) and sham acupuncture (SA) among patients with oropharyngeal or nasopharyngeal carcinoma who were undergoing radiation therapy in comprehensive cancer centers in the United States and China. Patients were enrolled between December 16, 2011, and July 7, 2015. Final follow-up was August 15, 2016. Analyses were conducted February 1 through 28, 2019. Intervention: Either TA or SA using a validated acupuncture placebo device was performed 3 times per week during a 6- to 7-week course of radiation therapy. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary end point was RIX, as determined by the Xerostomia Questionnaire in which a higher score indicates worse RIX, for combined institutions 1 year after radiation therapy ended. Secondary outcomes included incidence of clinically significant xerostomia (score >30), salivary flow, quality of life, salivary constituents, and role of baseline expectancy related to acupuncture on outcomes. Results: Of 399 patients randomized, 339 were included in the final analysis (mean [SD] age, 51.3 [11.7] years; age range, 21-79 years; 258 [77.6%] men), including 112 patients in the TA group, 115 patients in the SA group, and 112 patients in the SCC group. For the primary aim, the adjusted least square mean (SD) xerostomia score in the TA group (26.6 [17.7]) was significantly lower than in the SCC group (34.8 [18.7]) (P\u2009=\u2009.001; effect size\u2009=\u2009-0.44) and marginally lower but not statistically significant different from the SA group (31.3 [18.6]) (P\u2009=\u2009.06; effect size\u2009=\u2009-0.26). Incidence of clinically significant xerostomia 1 year after radiation therapy ended followed a similar pattern, with 38 patients in the TA group (34.6%), 54 patients in the SA group (47.8%), and 60 patients in the SCC group (55.1%) experiencing clinically significant xerostomia (P\u2009=\u2009.009). Post hoc comparisons revealed a significant difference between the TA and SCC groups at both institutions, but TA was significantly different from SA only at Fudan University Cancer Center, Shanghai, China (estimated difference [SE]: TA vs SCC, -9.9 [2.5]; P\u2009<\u2009.001; SA vs SCC, -1.7 [2.5]; P\u2009=\u2009.50; TA vs SA, -8.2 [2.5]; P\u2009=\u2009.001), and SA was significantly different from SCC only at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas (estimated difference [SE]: TA vs SCC, -8.1 [3.4]; P\u2009=\u2009.016; SA vs SCC, -10.5 [3.3]; P\u2009=\u2009.002; TA vs SA, 2.4 [3.2]; P\u2009=\u2009.45). Conclusions and Relevance: This randomized clinical trial found that TA resulted in significantly fewer and less severe RIX symptoms 1 year after treatment vs SCC. However, further studies are needed to confirm clinical relevance and generalizability of this finding and to evaluate inconsistencies in response to sham acupuncture between patients in the United States and China.

        "Fluconazole Monotherapy Is a Suboptimal Option for Initial Treatment of Cryptococcal Meningitis Because of Emergence of Resistance. Cryptococcal meningitis is a lethal disease with few therapeutic options. Induction therapy with fluconazole has been consistently demonstrated to be associated with suboptimal microbiological and clinical outcomes. Exposure to fluconazole causes dynamic changes in antifungal susceptibility, which are associated with the development of aneuploidy. The implications of this phenomenon for pharmacodynamics of fluconazole for cryptococcal meningitis are poorly understood. The pharmacodynamics of fluconazole were studied using a hollow-fiber infection model (HFIM) and a well-characterized murine model of cryptococcal meningoencephalitis. The relationship between drug exposure and both antifungal killing and the emergence of resistance was quantified. The same relationships were further evaluated in a recently described group of patients with cryptococcal meningitis undergoing induction therapy with fluconazole at 800 to 1,200\u2009mg/day. The pattern of emergence of fluconazole resistance followed an \"inverted U.\" Resistance amplification was maximal and suppressed at ratios of the area under the concentration-time curve for the free, unbound fraction of the drug to the MIC (fAUC:MIC) of 34.5 to 138 and 305.6, respectively. Emergence of resistance was observed in vivo with an fAUC:MIC of 231.4. Aneuploidy with duplication of chromosome 1 was demonstrated to be the underlying mechanism in both experimental models. The pharmacokinetic (PK)-pharmacodynamic model accurately described the PK, antifungal killing, and emergence of resistance. Monte Carlo simulations from the clinical pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic model showed that only 12.8% of simulated patients receiving fluconazole at 1,200\u2009mg/day achieved sterilization of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) after 2\u2009weeks and that 83.4% had a persistent subpopulation that was resistant to fluconazole. Fluconazole is primarily ineffective due to the emergence of resistance. Treatment with 1,200\u2009mg/day leads to the killing of a susceptible subpopulation but is compromised by the emergence of resistance.IMPORTANCE Cryptococcal meningitis is a lethal disease with few treatment options. The incidence remains high and intricately linked with the HIV/AIDS epidemic. In many parts of the world, fluconazole is the only agent that is available for the initial treatment of cryptococcal meningitis despite considerable evidence that it is associated with suboptimal microbiological and clinical outcomes. Fluconazole has a fungistatic mode of action: it predominantly inhibits growth rather than causing fungal killing. Our work shows that the pattern of fluconazole activity is caused by the emergence of resistance in Cryptococcus not detected by standard susceptibility tests, with chromosomal duplication/aneuploidy as the main mechanism. Resistance emergence is related to drug exposure and occurs with the use of clinically relevant regimens. Hence, fluconazole (and potentially other agents that target 14-alpha-demethylase) is compromised by an intrinsic property that limits its effectiveness. However, this resistance may be potentially overcome by dosage escalation or the use of combination therapy. ",
        "How does reentry get under the skin? Cumulative reintegration barriers and health in a sample of recently incarcerated men. RATIONALE: Research demonstrates a significant link between incarceration history and poorer physical and mental health. Yet, few studies have examined how a formerly incarcerated person's barriers to reintegration in the months upon release influence health outcomes. METHOD: We use data on recently incarcerated men from the Serious and Violent Offender Reentry Initiative (SVORI) to examine how multiple barriers to reintegration related to employment, housing, childcare, and service needs accumulate to influence physical and mental health three, nine, and 15 months after release. RESULTS: A series of cross-lagged panel models indicate that a greater number of barriers to reintegration after release from prison (1) decreases self-rated health at all three waves and (2) increases symptoms of depression three and nine months after release. Moreover, both lower self-rated physical health and increased symptoms of depression are found to increase reintegration barriers. CONCLUSIONS: Enhanced policy to ease the burden of reintegration and provide comprehensive services upon release may not only bolster chances for successful community reintegration but also improve the health of those formerly incarcerated at a critical juncture in their lives.

        "Engineered E. coli Nissle 1917 for the delivery of matrix-tethered therapeutic domains to the gut. Mucosal healing plays a critical role in combatting the effects of inflammatory bowel disease, fistulae and ulcers. While most treatments for such diseases focus on systemically delivered anti-inflammatory drugs, often leading to detrimental side effects, mucosal healing agents that target the gut epithelium are underexplored. We genetically engineer Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 (EcN) to create fibrous matrices that promote gut epithelial integrity in situ. These matrices consist of curli nanofibers displaying trefoil factors (TFFs), known to promote intestinal barrier function and epithelial restitution. We confirm that engineered EcN can secrete the curli-fused TFFs in vitro and in vivo, and is non-pathogenic. We observe enhanced protective effects of engineered EcN against dextran sodium sulfate-induced colitis in mice, associated with mucosal healing and immunomodulation. This work lays a foundation for the development of a platform in which the in situ production of therapeutic protein matrices from beneficial bacteria can be exploited. ",
        "Impact of an incentive-based prenatal smoking cessation program for low-income women in Colorado. OBJECTIVE: To assess birth outcomes and cost-savings of an incentive-based prenatal smoking cessation program targeting low-income women in Colorado. DESIGN: Prospective observational cohort with nonequivalent population control groups. SAMPLE: Program participants (n\u00a0=\u00a02,231) linked to the birth certificate to ascertain birth outcomes compared to two reference populations from Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS) and Colorado live births based on the birth certificate. MEASUREMENTS: Tobacco cessation metrics in the third trimester of pregnancy, neonatal low birth weight (<2,500\u00a0g), preterm birth (birth at <37\u00a0weeks gestation), neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admission and maternal gestational hypertension. Cost-savings and return on investment (ROI) were projected using average Medicaid reimbursement. RESULTS: Infants of mothers enrolled in the program had a lower risk of low birthweight (RR\u00a0=\u00a00.86; 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a00.75, 0.97), preterm birth (PTB) (RR\u00a0=\u00a00.76; 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a00.65, 0.88) and neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admission (RR\u00a0=\u00a00.76; 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a00.66, 0.88) compared to the birth certificate population, corresponding to a ROI of $7.73 and an individual cost savings of $6,040. Compared to PRAMS, infants of enrolled mothers had a lower risk of PTB (RR\u00a0=\u00a00.72; 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a00.53, 0.99) and NICU admission (RR\u00a0=\u00a00.45; 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a00.32, 0.62), corresponding to an ROI of $2.79 and an individual cost savings of $2,182.

        "A multilocus sequence typing scheme of Pseudomonas putida for clinical and environmental isolates. Pseudomonas putida is a bacterium commonly found in soils, water and plants. Although P. putida group strains are considered to have low virulence, several nosocomial isolates with carbapenem- or multidrug-resistance have recently been reported. In the present study, we developed a multilocus sequence typing (MLST) scheme for P. putida. MLST loci and primers were selected and designed using the genomic information of 86 clinical isolates sequenced in this study as well as the sequences of 20 isolates previously reported. The genomes were categorised into 68 sequence types (STs). Significant linkage disequilibrium was detected for the 68 STs, indicating that the P. putida isolates are clonal. The MLST tree was similar to the haplotype network tree based on single nucleotide morphisms, demonstrating that our MLST scheme reflects the genetic diversity of P. putida group isolated from both clinical and environmental sites.

        "Molecular phenotyping and image-guided surgical treatment of melanoma using spectrally distinct ultrasmall core-shell silica nanoparticles. Accurate detection and quantification of metastases in regional lymph nodes remain a vital prognostic predictor for cancer staging and clinical outcomes. As intratumoral heterogeneity poses a major hurdle to effective treatment planning, more reliable image-guided, cancer-targeted optical multiplexing tools are critically needed in the operative suite. For sentinel lymph node mapping indications, accurately interrogating distinct molecular signatures on cancer cells in vivo with differential levels of sensitivity and specificity remains largely unexplored. To address these challenges and demonstrate sensitivity to detecting micrometastases, we developed batches of spectrally distinct 6-nm near-infrared fluorescent core-shell silica nanoparticles, each batch surface-functionalized with different melanoma targeting ligands. Along with PET imaging, particles accurately detected and molecularly phenotyped cancerous nodes in a spontaneous melanoma miniswine model using image-guided multiplexing tools. Information afforded from these tools offers the potential to not only improve the accuracy of targeted disease removal and patient safety, but to transform surgical decision-making for oncological patients.

Efficient cytosolic protein delivery is necessary to fully realize the potential of protein therapeutics. Current methods of protein delivery often suffer from low serum tolerance and limited in vivo efficacy. Here, we report the synthesis and validation of a previously unreported class of carboxylated branched poly(\u03b2-amino ester)s that can self-assemble into nanoparticles for efficient intracellular delivery of a variety of different proteins. In vitro, nanoparticles enabled rapid cellular uptake, efficient endosomal escape, and functional cytosolic protein release into cells in media containing 10% serum. Moreover, nanoparticles encapsulating CRISPR-Cas9 ribonucleoproteins (RNPs) induced robust levels of gene knock-in (4%) and gene knockout (>75%) in several cell types.

        "Bacterial variability in the mammalian gut captured by a single-cell synthetic oscillator. Synthetic gene oscillators have the potential to control timed functions and periodic gene expression in engineered cells. Such oscillators have been refined in bacteria in vitro, however, these systems have lacked the robustness and precision necessary for applications in complex in vivo environments, such as the mammalian gut. Here, we demonstrate the implementation of a synthetic oscillator capable of keeping robust time in the mouse gut over periods of days. The oscillations provide a marker of bacterial growth at a single-cell level enabling quantification of bacterial dynamics in response to inflammation and underlying variations in the gut microbiota. Our work directly detects increased bacterial growth heterogeneity during disease and differences between spatial niches in the gut, demonstrating the deployment of a precise engineered genetic oscillator in real-life settings.

        "The ADP/ATP translocase drives mitophagy independent of nucleotide exchange. Mitochondrial homeostasis depends on mitophagy, the programmed degradation of mitochondria. Only a few proteins are known to participate in mitophagy. Here we develop a multidimensional CRISPR-Cas9 genetic screen, using multiple mitophagy reporter systems and pro-mitophagy triggers, and identify numerous components of parkin-dependent mitophagy1. Unexpectedly, we find that the adenine nucleotide translocator (ANT) complex is required for mitophagy in several cell types. Whereas pharmacological inhibition of ANT-mediated ADP/ATP exchange promotes mitophagy, genetic ablation of ANT paradoxically suppresses mitophagy. Notably, ANT promotes mitophagy independently of its nucleotide translocase catalytic activity. Instead, the ANT complex is required for inhibition of the presequence translocase TIM23, which leads to stabilization of PINK1, in response to bioenergetic collapse. ANT modulates TIM23 indirectly via interaction with TIM44, which regulates peptide import through TIM232. Mice that lack ANT1 show blunted mitophagy and consequent profound accumulation of aberrant mitochondria. Disease-causing human mutations in ANT1 abrogate binding to TIM44 and TIM23 and inhibit mitophagy. Together, our findings show that ANT is an essential and fundamental mediator of mitophagy in health and disease. ",

Dynamic mapping of extracellular pH (pHe) at the single-cell level is critical for understanding the role of H+ in cellular and subcellular processes, with particular importance in cancer. While several pHe sensing techniques have been developed, accessing this information at the single-cell level requires improvement in sensitivity, spatial and temporal resolution. We report on a zwitterionic label-free pH nanoprobe that addresses these long-standing challenges. The probe has a sensitivity\u2009>\u20090.01 units, 2\u2009ms response time, and 50\u2009nm spatial resolution. The platform\u00a0was integrated into a double-barrel nanoprobe combining pH sensing with feedback-controlled distance dependance via Scanning Ion Conductance Microscopy. This allows for the simultaneous 3D topographical imaging and pHe monitoring of living cancer cells. These classes of nanoprobes were used for real-time high spatiotemporal resolution pHe mapping at the subcellular level and revealed tumour heterogeneity of the peri-cellular environments of melanoma and breast cancer cells.

        "Photoperiodic and clock regulation of the vitamin A pathway in the brain mediates seasonal responsiveness in the monarch butterfly. Seasonal adaptation to changes in light:dark regimes (i.e., photoperiod) allows organisms living at temperate latitudes to anticipate environmental changes. In nearly all animals studied so far, the circadian system has been implicated in measurement and response to the photoperiod. In insects, genetic evidence further supports the involvement of several clock genes in photoperiodic responses. Yet, the key molecular pathways linking clock genes or the circadian clock to insect photoperiodic responses remain largely unknown. Here, we show that inactivating the clock in the North American monarch butterfly using loss-of-function mutants for the circadian activators CLOCK and BMAL1 and the circadian repressor CRYPTOCHROME 2 abolishes photoperiodic responses in reproductive output. Transcriptomic approaches in the brain of monarchs raised in long and short photoperiods, summer monarchs, and fall migrants revealed a molecular signature of seasonal-specific rhythmic gene expression that included several genes belonging to the vitamin A pathway. We found that the rhythmic expression of these genes was abolished in clock-deficient mutants, suggesting that the vitamin A pathway operates downstream of the circadian clock. Importantly, we showed that a CRISPR/Cas9-mediated loss-of-function mutation in the gene encoding the pathway's rate-limiting enzyme, ninaB1, abolished photoperiod responsiveness independently of visual function in the compound eye and without affecting circadian rhythms. Together, these results provide genetic evidence that the clock-controlled vitamin A pathway mediates photoperiod responsiveness in an insect. Given previously reported seasonal changes associated with this pathway in the mammalian brain, our findings suggest an evolutionarily conserved function of vitamin A in animal photoperiodism. ",
        "A selective BCL-XL PROTAC degrader achieves safe and potent antitumor activity. B-cell lymphoma extra large (BCL-XL) is a well-validated cancer target. However, the on-target and dose-limiting thrombocytopenia limits the use of BCL-XL inhibitors, such as ABT263, as safe and effective anticancer agents. To reduce the toxicity of ABT263, we converted it into DT2216, a BCL-XL proteolysis-targeting chimera (PROTAC), that targets BCL-XL to the Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) E3 ligase for degradation. We found that DT2216 was more potent against various BCL-XL-dependent leukemia and cancer cells but considerably less toxic to platelets than ABT263 in vitro because VHL is poorly expressed in platelets. In vivo, DT2216 effectively inhibits the growth of several xenograft tumors as a single agent or in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents, without causing appreciable thrombocytopenia. These findings demonstrate the potential to use PROTAC technology to reduce on-target drug toxicities and rescue the therapeutic potential of previously undruggable targets. Furthermore, DT2216 may be developed as a safe first-in-class anticancer agent targeting BCL-XL. ",
        "Molecular profiling of single neurons of known identity in two ganglia from the crab Cancer borealis. Understanding circuit organization depends on identification of cell types. Recent advances in transcriptional profiling methods have enabled classification of cell types by their gene expression. While exceptionally powerful and high throughput, the ground-truth validation of these methods is difficult: If cell type is unknown, how does one assess whether a given analysis accurately captures neuronal identity? To shed light on the capabilities and limitations of solely using transcriptional profiling for cell-type classification, we performed 2 forms of transcriptional profiling-RNA-seq and quantitative RT-PCR, in single, unambiguously identified neurons from 2 small crustacean neuronal networks: The stomatogastric and cardiac ganglia. We then combined our knowledge of cell type with unbiased clustering analyses and supervised machine learning to determine how accurately functionally defined neuron types can be classified by expression profile alone. The results demonstrate that expression profile is able to capture neuronal identity most accurately when combined with multimodal information that allows for post hoc grouping, so analysis can proceed from a supervised perspective. Solely unsupervised clustering can lead to misidentification and an inability to distinguish between 2 or more cell types. Therefore, this study supports the general utility of cell identification by transcriptional profiling, but adds a caution: It is difficult or impossible to know under what conditions transcriptional profiling alone is capable of assigning cell identity. Only by combining multiple modalities of information such as physiology, morphology, or innervation target can neuronal identity be unambiguously determined. ",
        "Proteasome subunit RPT2a promotes PTGS through repressing RNA quality control in Arabidopsis. RNA quality control (RQC) and post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS) target and degrade aberrant endogenous RNAs and foreign RNAs, contributing to homeostasis of cellular RNAs. In plants, RQC and PTGS compete for foreign and selected endogenous RNAs; however, little is known about the mechanism interconnecting the two pathways. Using a reporter system designed for monitoring PTGS, we revealed that the 26S proteasome subunit RPT2a enhances transgene PTGS by promoting the accumulation of transgene-derived short interfering RNAs without affecting their biogenesis. RPT2a physically associated with a subset of RQC components and downregulated the protein level. Overexpression of the RQC components interfered with transgene silencing, and impairment of the RQC machinery reinforced transgene PTGS attenuated by rpt2a. Overall, we demonstrate that the 26S proteasome subunit RPT2a promotes PTGS by repressing the RQC machinery to control foreign RNAs. ",
        "Experiences of involuntary childlessness and treatment in the UK: what has changed in 20 years?. This study examined the financial, emotional and relationship impacts of involuntary childlessness and treatment, and the satisfaction with support from professionals. 796 participants in the UK completed an online survey based on a similar survey conducted in 1997. 55% of participants had to pay for at least part of their treatment. High levels of distress were experienced and 42% experienced suicidal feelings at least occasionally. Those most at risk of distress and suicidal feelings had experienced unsuccessful treatment outcomes, spent longer trying to conceive and reported some relationship strains. While 75% would like to have received counselling if it had been free, 45% only received such counselling and 54% of these had to fund some of it themselves. Although advances have been made in improving the availability of funded treatment and psychological support, involuntary childlessness and treatment continue to have financial, emotional and relationship consequences for many people. While counselling was generally reported to be useful, an approach involving all fertility clinic staff in the psychosocial care of clients is advisable. ",
        "Is half the world's population really below 'replacement-rate'?. A perennial activity of demographers is to estimate the percentage of the world's population which is above or below the 'replacement rate of fertility' [RRF]. However, most attempts to do so have been based upon, at best, oversimplified, or at worst, simply incorrect assumptions about what RRF actually is. The objective of this paper is to calculate the proportion of the world's population living in countries with observed period total fertility rates [TFR] below the respective calculated RRF, rather than the commonly used measure of 2.1. While the differences between comparing TFR to 2.1 or RRF are relatively modest in many periods when considering populations at the national level, a significant difference can be observed in the near future based upon India's fertility and mortality trajectories. Our exercise represents a means of 'correcting the record' using the most up-to-date evidence and using the correct protocol. ",
        "Modification of Synaptic-Input Clustering by Intrinsic Excitability Plasticity on Cerebellar Purkinje Cell Dendrites. The role of dendrites in the integration of widespread synaptic activity has been studied in experiments and theories (Johnston et al., 1996; Magee, 2007). However, whether the conduction of synaptic currents from dendrites to the soma depends on excitability of those dendritic branches is unclear. How modulation of the branch excitability affects the conduction of synaptic inputs and their selection on dendrites is also elusive. Here, I performed simultaneous voltage-clamp recordings from the soma and dendrites of single cerebellar Purkinje neurons in male Sprague-Dawley rats and analyzed the relationship between spontaneous EPSCs on both sides. I found that EPSCs on distal dendrites have a salient discordance in amplitude compared with those on the soma. Furthermore, individual ratios of the EPSC concurrently recorded on the soma and dendrites were not unique, but discrete, suggesting the occurrence of various attenuations in different paths of dendritic branches to the soma. The obtained data and simulations indicate several distinct groups (4.5 \u00b1 0.3, n = 22 somatodendritic recordings) of co-occurred synaptic inputs in Purkinje cell dendrites. This clustering of synaptic currents was suggested to emerge at farther distances than the secondary bifurcations. Finally, ratios of the co-EPSCs were uniformly distributed after either intrinsic plasticity induction or SK-channel blockade. Overall, results suggest that in Purkinje cells the excitability along the dendrite processes modulates the conduction of EPSCs and makes active inputs heterogeneous through SK channel activity, intrinsic plasticity, and dendritic branching. These properties of dendrites may confer branch-specific computational power to neurons.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT I have previously studied the \"non-synaptic\" plasticity of the intrinsic excitability in the cerebellar Purkinje cells (Belmeguenai et al., 2010), and branch-specific increase of intrinsic excitability of the dendrites (Ohtsuki et al., 2012b; Ohtsuki and Hansel, 2018) through the downregulation of SK (small conductance Ca2+-activated K+) channels. In this study, I show that a dendritic filtering of synaptic electroconductivity is heterogeneous among the branches on distal dendrites and that the increase in the dendritic excitability accompanied with the intrinsic plasticity alters a state with the heterogeneity to a globally excitable state in Purkinje neurons. My findings propose a new learning model relying on the intrinsic excitability plasticity of the dendritic branch fields. ",
        "Nongenic cancer-risk SNPs affect oncogenes, tumour-suppressor genes, and immune function. BACKGROUND: Genome-wide association studies (GWASes) have identified many noncoding germline single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that are associated with an increased risk of developing cancer. However, how these SNPs affect cancer risk is still largely unknown. METHODS: We used a systems biology approach to analyse the regulatory role of cancer-risk SNPs in thirteen tissues. By using data from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project, we performed an expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) analysis. We represented both significant cis- and trans-eQTLs as edges in tissue-specific eQTL bipartite networks. RESULTS: Each tissue-specific eQTL network is organised into communities that group sets of SNPs and functionally related genes. When mapping cancer-risk SNPs to these networks, we find that in each tissue, these SNPs are significantly overrepresented in communities enriched for immune response processes, as well as tissue-specific functions. Moreover, cancer-risk SNPs are more likely to be 'cores' of their communities, influencing the expression of many genes within the same biological processes. Finally, cancer-risk SNPs preferentially target oncogenes and tumour-suppressor genes, suggesting that they may alter the expression of these key cancer genes. CONCLUSIONS: This approach provides a new way of understanding genetic effects on cancer risk and provides a biological context for interpreting the results of GWAS cancer studies. ",
        "Weight Gain, Hypertension, and the Emergence of a Maladaptive Cardiovascular Phenotype Among US Football Players. Importance: Former US football athletes are at increased risk of cardiovascular (CV) morbidity and mortality compared with the general population and other professional athletes. However, responsible maladaptive CV phenotypes have not been fully characterized. Objective: To address the emergence and progression of multiple independent factors associated with CV risk across serial years of collegiate US football participation. Design, Setting, and Participants: Collegiate US football athletes from 2 National Collegiate Athletic Association Division I programs were recruited as freshmen between June 2014 and June 2017 and analyzed at multiple points throughout 3 complete years of collegiate US football participation (until January 2019). Excluded athletes were those who did not complete any season of US football training because of injury, illness, or leaving the team. Factors associated with CV risk assessed clinically, by transthoracic echocardiography, and by vascular applanation tonometry were recorded. Exposures: The exposure of interest was seasonal US football exposure, including training, competition, and the training environment. Main Outcomes and Measures: Primary outcome measures were left ventricular mass index and geometry (cardiac structure), early diastolic myocardial relaxation velocity (E'; diastolic function), and pulse-wave velocity (arterial stiffness). Results: Of 186 individuals recruited as freshmen, 126 athletes were included in analyzed data. Collegiate US football athletes (62 white individuals [49%]; 63 black individuals [50%]; 77 nonlinemen [61%]; 49 linemen [39%]; 126 male individuals [100%]) weighed a mean (SD) of 101.1 (21.0) kg, with a mean systolic blood pressure of 129.1 (11.6) mm Hg at baseline of the freshman season. Adjusting for race, height, and player position, there were significant increases in weight (mean [SE] \u0394, 4.74 [0.6] kg; P\u2009<\u2009.001), systolic blood pressure (mean [SE] \u0394, 11.6 [1.6] mm Hg; P\u2009<\u2009.001), and pulse-wave velocity (mean [SE] \u0394, 0.24 [0.09] m/s; P\u2009=\u2009.007), and significant declines in E' (mean [SE] \u0394, -1.7 [0.3] cm/s; P\u2009<\u2009.001) across 3 years of US football participation. Weight gain was associated with both arterial stiffening (increased pulse-wave velocity, \u03b2\u2009=\u20090.01 [SE, 0.004]; P\u2009=\u2009.003) and the development of concentric left ventricular hypertrophy (odds ratio, 1.09 [95% CI, 1.05-1.14]; P\u2009<\u2009.001); increased systolic blood pressure was also associated with arterial stiffening (\u03b2\u2009=\u20090.01 [SE, 0.003]; P\u2009=\u2009.007) and the development of concentric left ventricular hypertrophy (odds ratio, 1.04 [95% CI, 1.01-1.07]; P\u2009=\u2009.02). Conclusions and Relevance: Collegiate US football athletes who gain weight and develop increased systolic blood pressure levels are at risk for the development of a pathologic CV phenotype characterized by concentric left ventricular hypertrophy, arterial stiffening, and reduced left ventricular diastolic function. Future work aimed at optimizing CV health in this population, who are young but uniquely at risk, is warranted. ",
        "Scaffold-Free Bioprinter Utilizing Layer-By-Layer Printing of Cellular Spheroids. Free from the limitations posed by exogenous scaffolds or extracellular matrix-based materials, scaffold-free engineered tissues have immense clinical potential. Biomaterials may produce adverse responses, interfere with cell-cell interaction, or affect the extracellular matrix integrity of cells. The scaffold-free Kenzan method can generate complex tissues using spheroids on an array of needles but could be inefficient in terms of time, as it moves and places only a single spheroid at a time. We aimed to design and construct a novel scaffold-free bioprinter that can print an entire layer of spheroids at once, effectively reducing the printing time. The bioprinter was designed using computer-aided design software and constructed from machined, 3D printed, and commercially available parts. The printing efficiency and the operating precision were examined using Zirconia and alginate beads, which mimic spheroids. In less than a minute, the printer could efficiently pick and transfer the beads to the printing surface and assemble them onto the 4 \u00d7 4 needles. The average overlap coefficient between layers was measured and found to be 0.997. As a proof of concept using human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived spheroids, we confirmed the ability of the bioprinter to place cellular spheroids onto the needles efficiently to print an entire layer of tissue. This novel layer-by-layer, scaffold-free bioprinter is efficient and precise in operation and can be easily scaled to print large tissues. ",
        "Fluconazole Monotherapy Is a Suboptimal Option for Initial Treatment of Cryptococcal Meningitis Because of Emergence of Resistance. Cryptococcal meningitis is a lethal disease with few therapeutic options. Induction therapy with fluconazole has been consistently demonstrated to be associated with suboptimal microbiological and clinical outcomes. Exposure to fluconazole causes dynamic changes in antifungal susceptibility, which are associated with the development of aneuploidy. The implications of this phenomenon for pharmacodynamics of fluconazole for cryptococcal meningitis are poorly understood. The pharmacodynamics of fluconazole were studied using a hollow-fiber infection model (HFIM) and a well-characterized murine model of cryptococcal meningoencephalitis. The relationship between drug exposure and both antifungal killing and the emergence of resistance was quantified. The same relationships were further evaluated in a recently described group of patients with cryptococcal meningitis undergoing induction therapy with fluconazole at 800 to 1,200\u2009mg/day. The pattern of emergence of fluconazole resistance followed an \"inverted U.\" Resistance amplification was maximal and suppressed at ratios of the area under the concentration-time curve for the free, unbound fraction of the drug to the MIC (fAUC:MIC) of 34.5 to 138 and 305.6, respectively. Emergence of resistance was observed in vivo with an fAUC:MIC of 231.4. Aneuploidy with duplication of chromosome 1 was demonstrated to be the underlying mechanism in both experimental models. The pharmacokinetic (PK)-pharmacodynamic model accurately described the PK, antifungal killing, and emergence of resistance. Monte Carlo simulations from the clinical pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic model showed that only 12.8% of simulated patients receiving fluconazole at 1,200\u2009mg/day achieved sterilization of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) after 2\u2009weeks and that 83.4% had a persistent subpopulation that was resistant to fluconazole. Fluconazole is primarily ineffective due to the emergence of resistance. Treatment with 1,200\u2009mg/day leads to the killing of a susceptible subpopulation but is compromised by the emergence of resistance.IMPORTANCE Cryptococcal meningitis is a lethal disease with few treatment options. The incidence remains high and intricately linked with the HIV/AIDS epidemic. In many parts of the world, fluconazole is the only agent that is available for the initial treatment of cryptococcal meningitis despite considerable evidence that it is associated with suboptimal microbiological and clinical outcomes. Fluconazole has a fungistatic mode of action: it predominantly inhibits growth rather than causing fungal killing. Our work shows that the pattern of fluconazole activity is caused by the emergence of resistance in Cryptococcus not detected by standard susceptibility tests, with chromosomal duplication/aneuploidy as the main mechanism. Resistance emergence is related to drug exposure and occurs with the use of clinically relevant regimens. Hence, fluconazole (and potentially other agents that target 14-alpha-demethylase) is compromised by an intrinsic property that limits its effectiveness. However, this resistance may be potentially overcome by dosage escalation or the use of combination therapy. ",
        "Interferon-\u03b2-induced miR-1 alleviates toxic protein accumulation by controlling autophagy. Appropriate regulation of autophagy is crucial for clearing toxic proteins from cells. Defective autophagy results in accumulation of toxic protein aggregates that detrimentally affect cellular function and organismal survival. Here, we report that the microRNA miR-1 regulates the autophagy pathway through conserved targeting of the orthologous Tre-2/Bub2/CDC16 (TBC) Rab GTPase-activating proteins TBC-7 and TBC1D15 in Caenorhabditis elegans and mammalian cells, respectively. Loss of miR-1 causes TBC-7/TBC1D15 overexpression, leading to a block on autophagy. Further, we found that the cytokine interferon-\u03b2 (IFN-\u03b2) can induce miR-1 expression in mammalian cells, reducing TBC1D15 levels, and safeguarding against proteotoxic challenges. Therefore, this work provides a potential therapeutic strategy for protein aggregation disorders. ",
        "Antimicrobial sensing coupled with cell membrane remodeling mediates antibiotic resistance and virulence in Enterococcus faecalis. Bacteria have developed several evolutionary strategies to protect their cell membranes (CMs) from the attack of antibiotics and antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) produced by the innate immune system, including remodeling of phospholipid content and localization. Multidrug-resistant Enterococcus faecalis, an opportunistic human pathogen, evolves resistance to the lipopeptide daptomycin and AMPs by diverting the antibiotic away from critical septal targets using CM anionic phospholipid redistribution. The LiaFSR stress response system regulates this CM remodeling via the LiaR response regulator by a previously unknown mechanism. Here, we characterize a LiaR-regulated protein, LiaX, that senses daptomycin or AMPs and triggers protective CM remodeling. LiaX is surface exposed, and in daptomycin-resistant clinical strains, both LiaX and the N-terminal domain alone are released into the extracellular milieu. The N-terminal domain of LiaX binds daptomycin and AMPs (such as human LL-37) and functions as an extracellular sentinel that activates the cell envelope stress response. The C-terminal domain of LiaX plays a role in inhibiting the LiaFSR system, and when this domain is absent, it leads to activation of anionic phospholipid redistribution. Strains that exhibit LiaX-mediated CM remodeling and AMP resistance show enhanced virulence in the Caenorhabditis elegans model, an effect that is abolished in animals lacking an innate immune pathway crucial for producing AMPs. In conclusion, we report a mechanism of antibiotic and AMP resistance that couples bacterial stress sensing to major changes in CM architecture, ultimately also affecting host-pathogen interactions.

        "A comparison of contemporary versus older studies of aspirin for primary prevention. BACKGROUND: Recent aspirin trials have not shown similar benefits for primary prevention as older studies. OBJECTIVE: To compare benefits and harms of aspirin for primary prevention before and after widespread use of statins and colorectal cancer screening. METHODS: We compared studies of aspirin for primary prevention that recruited patients from 2005 onward with previous individual patient data (IPD) meta-analyses that recruited patients from 1978 to 2002. Data for contemporary studies were synthesized using random-effects models. We report vascular [major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke], bleeding, cancer and mortality outcomes. RESULTS: The IPD analyses of older studies included 95 456 patients for CV prevention and 25 270 for cancer mortality, while the four newer studies had 61 604 patients. Relative risks for vascular outcomes for older versus newer studies follow: MACE: 0.89 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.83-0.95] versus 0.93 (0.86-0.99); fatal haemorrhagic stroke: 1.73 (1.11-2.72) versus 1.06 (0.66-1.70); any ischaemic stroke: 0.86 (0.74-1.00) versus 0.86 (0.75-0.98); any MI: 0.84 (0.77-0.92) versus 0.88 (0.77-1.00); and non-fatal MI: 0.79 (0.71-0.88) versus 0.94 (0.83-1.08). Cancer death was not significantly decreased in newer studies (1.11, 0.92-1.34). Major haemorrhage was significantly increased (older studies RR 1.48, 95% CI 1.25-1.76 versus newer studies RR 1.37, 1.24-1.53). There was no effect on all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, fatal stroke or fatal MI. CONCLUSIONS: Per 1200 persons taking aspirin for primary prevention for 5 years, there will be 4 fewer MACEs, 3 fewer ischaemic strokes, 3 more intracranial haemorrhages and 8 more major bleeding events. Aspirin should no longer be recommended for primary prevention. ",
        "Lipoteichoic acid from the cell wall of a heat killed Lactobacillus paracasei D3-5 ameliorates aging-related leaky gut, inflammation and improves physical and cognitive functions: from C. elegans to mice. Increased inflammation associated with leaky gut is a major risk factor for morbidity and mortality in older adults; however, successful preventive and therapeutic strategies against these conditions are not available. In this study, we demonstrate that a human-origin Lactobacillus paracasei D3-5 strain (D3-5), even in the non-viable form, extends life span of Caenorhabditis elegans. In addition, feeding of heat-killed D3-5 to old mice (> 79 weeks) prevents high- fat diet-induced metabolic dysfunctions, decreases leaky gut and inflammation, and improves physical and cognitive functions. D3-5 feeding significantly increases mucin production, and proportionately, the abundance of mucin-degrading bacteria Akkermansia muciniphila also increases. Mechanistically, we show that the lipoteichoic acid (LTA), a cell wall component of D3-5, enhances mucin (Muc2) expression by modulating TLR-2/p38-MAPK/NF-kB pathway, which in turn reduces age-related leaky gut and inflammation. The findings indicate that the D3-5 and its LTA can prevent/treat age-related leaky gut and inflammation. ",
        "Lactobacillus rhamnosus Granules Dose-Dependently Balance Intestinal Microbiome Disorders and Ameliorate Chronic Alcohol-Induced Liver Injury. As the functions of Lactobacilli become better understood, there are increasing numbers of applications for Lactobacillus products. Previously, we have demonstrated that Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) can prevent alcoholic liver injury. LGG granules were produced by fluid bed granulation with a media composed of starch, skimmed milk powder, whey powder, microcrystalline cellulose and maltose, and LGG fermented liquid that comprised 30-50% of the total weight. We found LGG granules dose-dependently protected against chronic alcoholic liver disease. When alcohol was consumed for 8 weeks with LGG treatment during the last 2 weeks, we demonstrated that the dose dependence of LGG granules can improve alcohol-induced liver injury through decreasing the levels of lipopolysaccharide and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 in serum and prevent liver steatosis by suppressing triglyceride, free fatty acid, and malondialdehyde production in liver. Alcohol feeding caused a decline in the number of both Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium, with a proportional increase in the number of Clostridium perfringens in ileum, and expansion of the Gram-negative bacteria Proteobacteria, Campylobacterales, and Helicobacter in cecum. However, LGG granule treatment restored the content of these microorganisms. In conclusion, LGG granule supplementation can improve the intestinal microbiota, reduce the number of gram-negative bacteria, and ameliorate alcoholic liver injury. ",
        "Estimating heritability and genetic correlations from large health datasets in the absence of genetic data. Typically, estimating genetic parameters, such as disease heritability and between-disease genetic correlations, demands large datasets containing all relevant phenotypic measures and detailed knowledge of family relationships or, alternatively, genotypic and phenotypic data for numerous unrelated individuals. Here, we suggest an alternative, efficient estimation approach through the construction of two disease metrics from large health datasets: temporal disease prevalence curves and low-dimensional disease embeddings. We present eleven thousand heritability estimates corresponding to five study types: twins, traditional family studies, health records-based family studies, single nucleotide polymorphisms, and polygenic risk scores. We also compute over six hundred thousand estimates of genetic, environmental and phenotypic correlations. Furthermore, we find that: (1) disease curve shapes cluster into five general patterns; (2) early-onset diseases tend to have lower prevalence than late-onset diseases (Spearman's \u03c1\u2009=\u20090.32, p\u2009<\u200910-16); and (3) the disease onset age and heritability are negatively correlated (\u03c1\u2009=\u2009-0.46, p\u2009<\u200910-16).

        "Motility of Enzyme-Powered Vesicles. Autonomous nanovehicles powered by energy derived from chemical catalysis have potential applications as active delivery agents. For in vivo applications, it is necessary that the engine and its fuel, as well as the chassis itself, be biocompatible. Enzyme molecules have been shown to display enhanced motility through substrate turnover and are attractive candidates as engines; phospholipid vesicles are biocompatible and can serve as cargo containers. Herein, we describe the autonomous movement of vesicles with membrane-bound enzymes in the presence of the substrate. We find that the motility of the vesicles increases with increasing enzymatic turnover rate. The enhanced diffusion of these enzyme-powered systems was further substantiated in real time by tracking the motion of the vesicles using optical microscopy. The membrane-bound protocells that move by transducing chemical energy into mechanical motion serve as models for motile living cells and are key to the elucidation of the fundamental mechanisms governing active membrane dynamics and cellular movement.

        "Hydroxyapatite-binding micelles for the detection of vascular calcification in atherosclerosis. Atherosclerosis is a chronic disease characterized by the formation of calcified, arterial plaques. Microcalcifications (5 \u03bcm to 100 \u03bcm), mainly composed of hydroxyapatite (HA, Ca5(PO4)3(OH)), develop in the fibrous caps of atherosclerotic plaques and can trigger plaque rupture due to the loss of compliance and elasticity. Ultimately, plaque rupture can cause arterial occlusion and embolization and result in ischemic events such as strokes and myocardial infarctions. Unfortunately, current imaging technologies used to detect calcifications are limited by low signal-to-noise ratio or use invasive procedures that pose risk of arterial dissection. To mitigate these drawbacks, in our study, we developed a novel, fluorescently-labeled peptide amphiphile micelle (PAM) that uses a 12 amino acid HA-binding peptide (HABP) [SVSVGMKPSPRP] to target and detect atherosclerotic calcification (HA PAM). Our results show HA PAMs can successfully target HA microcrystals with a strong binding affinity (KD = 6.26 \u00b1 1.2 \u03bcM) in vitro. In addition, HA PAMs detected HA mineralization (HA PAM vs. non-targeting micelle, p\u2264 0.001; HA PAM vs. scrambled HABP PAM, p\u2264 0.01) formed by calcifying mouse aortic vascular smooth muscle cells (MOVAS). Moreover, HA PAMs successfully detected calcifications in atherosclerotic mouse models as well as in patient-derived arteries. Our studies show that HA PAMs show promise as calcium-targeting nanoparticles for the detection of calcifications in atherosclerosis. ",
        "Electrostatic shape control of a charged molecular membrane from ribbon to scroll. Bilayers of amphiphiles can organize into spherical vesicles, nanotubes, planar, undulating, and helical nanoribbons, and scroll-like cochleates. These bilayer-related architectures interconvert under suitable conditions. Here, a charged, chiral amphiphile (palmitoyl-lysine, C16-K1) is used to elucidate the pathway for planar nanoribbon to cochleate transition induced by salt (NaCl) concentration. In situ small- and wide-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS/WAXS), atomic force and cryogenic transmission electron microscopies (AFM and cryo-TEM) tracked these transformations over angstrom to micrometer length scales. AFM reveals that the large length (L) to width (W) ratio nanoribbons (L/W > 10) convert to sheets (L/W \u2192 1) before rolling into cochleates. A theoretical model based on electrostatic and surface energies shows that the nanoribbons convert to sheets via a first-order transition, at a critical Debye length, with 2 shallow minima of the order of thermal energy at L/W > 1 and at L/W = 1. SAXS shows that interbilayer spacing (D) in the cochleates scales linearly with the Debye length, and ranges from 13 to 35 nm for NaCl concentrations from 100 to 5 mM. Theoretical arguments that include electrostatic and elastic energies explain the membrane rolling and the bilayer separation-Debye length relationship. These models suggest that the salt-induced ribbon to cochleate transition should be common to all charged bilayers possessing an intrinsic curvature, which in the present case originates from molecular chirality. Our studies show how electrostatic interactions can be tuned to attain and control cochleate structures, which have potential for encapsulating, and releasing macromolecules in a size-selective manner.

BACKGROUND: The spatial distributions of different types of cells could reveal a cancer cell's growth pattern, its relationships with the tumor microenvironment and the immune response of the body, all of which represent key \"hallmarks of cancer\". However, the process by which pathologists manually recognize and localize all the cells in pathology slides is extremely labor intensive and error prone. METHODS: In this study, we developed an automated cell type classification pipeline, ConvPath, which includes nuclei segmentation, convolutional neural network-based tumor cell, stromal cell, and lymphocyte classification, and extraction of tumor microenvironment-related features for lung cancer pathology images. To facilitate users in leveraging this pipeline for their research, all source scripts for ConvPath software are available at https://qbrc.swmed.edu/projects/cnn/. FINDINGS: The overall classification accuracy was 92.9% and 90.1% in training and independent testing datasets, respectively. By identifying cells and classifying cell types, this pipeline can convert a pathology image into a \"spatial map\" of tumor, stromal and lymphocyte cells. From this spatial map, we can extract features that characterize the tumor micro-environment. Based on these features, we developed an image feature-based prognostic model and validated the model in two independent cohorts. The predicted risk group serves as an independent prognostic factor, after adjusting for clinical variables that include age, gender, smoking status, and stage. INTERPRETATION: The analysis pipeline developed in this study could convert the pathology image into a \"spatial map\" of tumor cells, stromal cells and lymphocytes. This could greatly facilitate and empower comprehensive analysis of the spatial organization of cells, as well as their roles in tumor progression and metastasis. ",
        "Instagram Users' Experiences of Miscarriage. OBJECTIVE: To explore the shared experiences of miscarriage using a qualitative analysis of social media posts on Instagram. METHODS: We performed this qualitative study by collecting text, photos, hashtags, and emoji from 200 Instagram posts on five arbitrarily selected days in 2019. Key eligibility criteria included posts that described a personal experience of miscarriage and that used the hashtag #ihadamiscarriage. Through directed content analysis, our multidisciplinary team conducted open coding to identify common topics in the data, developed a code book, and coded all posts. Twenty-five percent of posts were double-coded by two team members and analyzed for agreement. The codes were organized into overarching themes. RESULTS: Intercoder reliability was excellent (kappa 0.95). Themes included medical and physical experiences of miscarriage, social experiences of miscarriage, the emotional spectrum of experiencing a miscarriage, family identity and the effects of miscarriage, and mechanisms of processing and coping through a miscarriage. We observed complex and often conflicted emotional states and noted that the effects of miscarriage were felt for months and years by many Instagram users. Use of social media and disclosure of miscarriage was a source of coping for many users. CONCLUSION: Women post about their miscarriages on social media for a variety of reasons, especially to find support and community and to help break the silence around miscarriage. Health care providers may consider discussing use of this platform as a support and coping mechanism in the setting of pregnancy loss. ",
        "Identification of Functionally Distinct Mx1+\u03b1SMA+ Periosteal Skeletal Stem Cells. The periosteum is critical for bone maintenance and healing. However, the in\u00a0vivo identity and specific regulatory mechanisms of adult periosteum-resident skeletal stem cells are unknown. Here, we report animal models that selectively and durably label postnatal Mx1+\u03b1SMA+ periosteal stem cells (P-SSCs) and establish that P-SSCs are a long-term repopulating, functionally distinct SSC subset responsible for\u00a0lifelong generation of periosteal osteoblasts. P-SSCs rapidly migrate toward an injury site, supply osteoblasts and chondrocytes, and recover new periosteum. Notably, P-SSCs specifically express CCL5 receptors, CCR3 and CCR5. Real-time intravital imaging revealed that the treatment with CCL5 induces P-SSC migration in\u00a0vivo and bone healing, while CCL5/CCR5 deletion, CCR5 inhibition, or local P-SSC ablation reduces osteoblast number and delays bone healing. Human periosteal cells express CCR5 and undergo CCL5-mediated migration. Thus, the adult periosteum maintains genetically distinct SSC subsets with a CCL5-dependent migratory mechanism required for bone maintenance and injury repair. ",
        "Prediction of Sex-Specific Suicide Risk Using Machine Learning and Single-Payer Health Care Registry Data From Denmark. Importance: Suicide is a public health problem, with multiple causes that are poorly understood. The increased focus on combining health care data with machine-learning approaches in psychiatry may help advance the understanding of suicide risk. Objective: To examine sex-specific risk profiles for death from suicide using machine-learning methods and data from the population of Denmark. Design, Setting, and Participants: A case-cohort study nested within 8 national Danish health and social registries was conducted from January 1, 1995, through December 31, 2015. The source population was all persons born or residing in Denmark as of January 1, 1995. Data were analyzed from November 5, 2018, through May 13, 2019. Exposures: Exposures included 1339 variables spanning domains of suicide risk factors. Main Outcomes and Measures: Death from suicide from the Danish cause of death registry. Results: A total of 14\u202f103 individuals died by suicide between 1995 and 2015 (10 152 men [72.0%]; mean [SD] age, 43.5 [18.8] years and 3951 women [28.0%]; age, 47.6 [18.8] years). The comparison subcohort was a 5% random sample (n\u2009=\u2009265\u202f183) of living individuals in Denmark on January 1, 1995 (130 591 men [49.2%]; age, 37.4 [21.8] years and 134 592 women [50.8%]; age, 39.9 [23.4] years). With use of classification trees and random forests, sex-specific differences were noted in risk for suicide, with physical health more important to men's suicide risk than women's suicide risk. Psychiatric disorders and possibly associated medications were important to suicide risk, with specific results that may increase clarity in the literature. For example, stress disorders among unmarried men older than 30 years were important factors for suicide risk in the presence of depression (risk, 0.54). Generally, diagnoses and medications measured 48 months before suicide were more important indicators of suicide risk than when measured 6 months earlier. Individuals in the top 5% of predicted suicide risk appeared to account for 32.0% of all suicide cases in men and 53.4% of all cases in women. Conclusions and Relevance: Despite decades of research on suicide risk factors, understanding of suicide remains poor. In this study, the first to date to develop risk profiles for suicide based on data from a full population, apparent consistency with what is known about suicide risk was noted, as well as potentially important, understudied risk factors with evidence of unique suicide risk profiles among specific subpopulations.

        "Treatment Adherence Perception Questionnaire: Assessing patient perceptions regarding their adherence to medical treatment plans. The Treatment Adherence Perception Questionnaire (TAPQ) is a new, brief self-report instrument for assessing patient perceptions and attitudes regarding their own adherence to medical treatment plans. It includes 3 distinct scales: Perceived Behavior, Perceived Benefit, and Perceived Burden. In contrast with existing measures, the TAPQ was expected to have a clear factor structure; have good discrimination; and assess distinct types of perception, each of which has different patterns of association with interpersonal, personality, motivational, and emotional variables. Foundational work on the TAPQ (with 891 patients) included 5 quantitative scale development studies and 1 qualitative study. The present report focuses on results from a final validation study using 450 patients recruited via market research panels to complete online questionnaires. This study included a general medical sample and a sample of people with either diabetes or hypertension. A confirmatory factor analysis specifying strict measurement invariance across these groups produced a good fit. Analysis with item-response theory suggested that the scales on the TAPQ provide good discrimination across a wide range of experience levels. The 3 scales on the TAPQ each had distinct patterns of association with criterion variables regarding conscientiousness, health behavior, motivation, affect, type of diagnosis, and interpersonal communication with health-care professionals. These effects could not be explained by another existing measure of adherence or by a measure of response bias. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved). ",
        "Pediatric Perioperative Mortality in Kenya: A Prospective Cohort Study from 24 Hospitals. BACKGROUND: The global surgery access imbalance will have a dramatic impact on the growing population of the world's children. In regions of the world with pediatric surgery and anesthesia manpower deficits and pediatric surgery-specific infrastructure and supply chain gaps, this expanding population will present new challenges. Perioperative mortality rate is an established indicator of the quality and safety of surgical care. To establish a baseline pediatric perioperative mortality rate and factors associated with mortality in Kenya, the authors designed a prospective cohort study and measured 24-h, 48-h, and 7-day perioperative mortality. METHODS: The authors trained anesthesia providers to electronically collect 132 data elements for pediatric surgical cases in 24 government and nongovernment facilities at primary, secondary, and tertiary hospitals from January 2014 to December 2016. Data assistants tracked all patients to 7 days postoperative, even if they had been discharged. Adjusted analyses were performed to compare mortality among different hospital levels after adjusting for prespecified risk factors. RESULTS: Of 6,005 cases analyzed, there were 46 (0.8%) 24-h, 62 (1.1%) 48-h, and 77 (1.7%) 7-day cumulative mortalities reported. In the adjusted analysis, factors associated with a statistically significant increase in 7-day mortality were American Society of Anesthesiologists Physical Status of III or more, night or weekend surgery, and not having the Safe Surgery Checklist performed. The 7-day perioperative mortality rate is less in the secondary (1.4%) and tertiary (2.4%) hospitals when compared with the primary (3.7%) hospitals. CONCLUSIONS: The authors have established a baseline pediatric perioperative mortality rate that is greater than 100 times higher than in high-income countries. The authors have identified factors associated with an increased mortality, such as not using the Safe Surgery Checklist. This analysis may be helpful in establishing pediatric surgical care systems in low-middle income countries and develop research pathways addressing interventions that will assist in decreasing mortality rate.

        "QTc Interval-Prolonging Medications Among Patients With Lung Cancer: Implications for Clinical Trial Eligibility and Clinical Care. BACKGROUND: Concomitant medication use, including agents that prolong the corrected QT (QTc) interval, can result in the exclusion of patients with cancer from clinical trials. To estimate the potential effects on accrual, we determined the prevalence of QTc-prolonging medication prescriptions in a national patient cohort. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We identified adult patients in the Veterans Affairs system with a diagnosis of lung cancer from 2003 to 2016. The use of QTc interval-prolonging medications and risk category were obtained from CredibleMeds. We calculated the prevalence of prescriptions for QTc-prolonging medications with a known or possible risk of torsade de pointes in the 3 months up to and including the date of cancer diagnosis. The rates across patient groups were compared using \u03c72 test. RESULTS: A total of 280,068 patients were included in the present study. The mean age was 70 years, 98% were male, and 72% were white. Overall, 28.4% had been prescribed a QTc-prolonging medication, and 7.3% had been prescribed\u00a0\u22652 in the 3 months before the cancer diagnosis. The most commonly prescribed QTc-prolonging medications were antimicrobial agents (14.0%), psychiatric agents (10.2%), antiemetic agents (2.6%), and cardiac medications (1.7%). Excluding the antimicrobial agents, 18.4% of the patients had been prescribed a QTc-prolonging medication. CONCLUSIONS: A substantial proportion of individuals with lung cancer will be prescribed QTc-prolonging medications. These prescriptions can limit patients' eligibility for clinical trials and complicate the administration of standard cancer therapies. Further research into the actual clinical risks and optimal management of QTc-prolonging medications in cancer populations is warranted. ",
        "Polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) inhibition synergizes with taxanes in triple negative breast cancer. Within triple negative breast cancer, several molecular subtypes have been identified, underlying the heterogeneity of such an aggressive disease. The basal-like subtype is characterized by mutations in the TP53 gene, and is associated with a low pathologic complete response rate following neoadjuvant chemotherapy. In a genome-scale short hairpin RNA (shRNA) screen of breast cancer cells, polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) was a frequent and strong hit in the basal breast cancer cell lines indicating its importance for growth and survival of these breast cancer cells. Plk1 regulates progression of cells through the G2-M phase of the cell cycle. We assessed the activity of two ATP-competitive Plk1 inhibitors, GSK461364 and onvansertib, alone and with a taxane in a set of triple negative breast cancer cell lines and in vivo. GSK461364 showed synergism with docetaxel in SUM149 (Combination Index 0.70) and SUM159 (CI, 0.62). GSK461364 in combination with docetaxel decreased the clonogenic potential (interaction test for SUM149 and SUM159, p<0.001 and p = 0.01, respectively) and the tumorsphere formation of SUM149 and SUM159 (interaction test, p = 0.01 and p< 0.001). In the SUM159 xenograft model, onvansertib plus paclitaxel significantly decreased tumor volume compared to single agent paclitaxel (p<0.0001). Inhibition of Plk1 in combination with taxanes shows promising results in a subset of triple negative breast cancer intrinsically resistant to chemotherapy. Onvansertib showed significant tumor volume shrinkage when combined with paclitaxel in vivo and should be considered in clinical trials for the treatment of triple negative cancers. ",
        "Cinnarizine and sodium valproate as the preventive agents of pediatric migraine: A randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial. BACKGROUND: Few migraine preventive agents have been assessed in a pediatric population. We evaluated the safety and efficacy of cinnarizine and sodium valproate for migraine prophylaxis in children and adolescents. METHODS: We carried out a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial in the Children's Medical Center and Sina hospital, Tehran, Iran. Eligible participants were randomly assigned in 1:1:1 ratio via interactive web response system to receive either cinnarizine, sodium valproate, or placebo. The primary endpoints were the mean change in frequency and intensity of migraine attacks from baseline to the last 4 weeks of trial. The secondary endpoint was the efficacy of each drug in the prevention of migraine. The drug was considered effective if it decreased migraine frequency by more than 50% in the double-blind phase compared with the baseline. Safety endpoint was adverse effects that were reported by children or their parents. RESULTS: A total of 158 children participated. The frequency of migraine attacks significantly reduced compared to baseline in cinnarizine (difference: -8.0; 95% confidence interval (CI): -9.3 to -6.6), sodium valproate (difference: -8.3; 95% confidence interval: -9.3 to -7.2), and placebo (difference: -4.4; 95% confidence interval: -5.4 to -3.4) arms. The decrease was statistically greater in cinnarizine (difference: -3.6; 95% confidence interval: -5.5 to -1.6) and sodium valproate (difference: -3.9; 95% confidence interval: -5.8 to -1.9) arms, compared to placebo group. Children in all groups had significant reduction in intensity of episodes compared to baseline (cinnarizine: -4.6; 95% confidence interval: -5.2 to -4.0; sodium valproate: -4.0; 95% confidence interval: -4.8 to -3.3; placebo: -2.6; 95% confidence interval: -3.4 to -1.8). The decrease was statistically greater in cinnarizine (difference: -2.0; 95% confidence interval: -3.2 to -0.8) and sodium valproate (difference: -1.5; 95% confidence interval: -2.7 to -0.3) arms, compared to the placebo group. Seventy-one percent of individuals in the cinnarizine group, 66% of cases in the sodium valproate group, and 42% of people in the placebo arm reported more than 50% reduction in episodes at the end of the trial. The odds ratio for >50% responder rate was 3.5 (98.3% confidence interval: 1.3 to 9.3) for cinnarizine versus placebo and 2.7 (98.3% confidence interval: 1.0 to 6.9) for sodium valproate versus placebo. Nine individuals reported adverse effects (three in cinnarizine, five in sodium valproate, and one in the placebo group) and one case in the sodium valproate group discontinued the therapy due to severe sedation. CONCLUSION: Cinnarizine and sodium valproate could be useful in migraine prophylaxis in children and adolescents. Trial registration: IRCT201206306907N4. ",
        "Effect of Fresh vs Standard-issue Red Blood Cell Transfusions on Multiple Organ Dysfunction Syndrome in Critically Ill Pediatric Patients: A Randomized Clinical Trial. Importance: The clinical consequences of red blood cell storage age for critically ill pediatric patients have not been examined in a large, randomized clinical trial. Objective: To determine if the transfusion of fresh red blood cells (stored \u22647 days) reduced new or progressive multiple organ dysfunction syndrome compared with the use of standard-issue red blood cells in critically ill children. Design, Setting, and Participants: The Age of Transfused Blood in Critically-Ill Children trial was an international, multicenter, blinded, randomized clinical trial, performed between February 2014 and November 2018 in 50 tertiary care centers. Pediatric patients between the ages of 3 days and 16 years were eligible if the first red blood cell transfusion was administered within 7 days of intensive care unit admission. A total of 15\u202f568 patients were screened, and 13\u202f308 were excluded. Interventions: Patients were randomized to receive either fresh or standard-issue red blood cells. A total of 1538 patients were randomized with 768 patients in the fresh red blood cell group and 770 in the standard-issue group. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome measure was new or progressive multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, measured for 28 days or to discharge or death. Results: Among 1538 patients who were randomized, 1461 patients (95%) were included in the primary analysis (median age, 1.8 years; 47.3% girls), in which there were 728 patients randomized to the fresh red blood cell group and 733 to the standard-issue group. The median storage duration was 5 days (interquartile range [IQR], 4-6 days) in the fresh group vs 18 days (IQR, 12-25 days) in the standard-issue group (P\u2009<\u2009.001). There were no significant differences in new or progressive multiple organ dysfunction syndrome between fresh (147 of 728 [20.2%]) and standard-issue red blood cell groups (133 of 732 [18.2%]), with an unadjusted absolute risk difference of 2.0% (95% CI, -2.0% to 6.1%; P\u2009=\u2009.33). The prevalence of sepsis was 25.8% (160 of 619) in the fresh group and 25.3% (154 of 608) in the standard-issue group. The prevalence of acute respiratory distress syndrome was 6.6% (41 of 619) in the fresh group and 4.8% (29 of 608) in the standard-issue group. Intensive care unit mortality was 4.5% (33 of 728) in the fresh group vs 3.5 % (26 of 732) in the standard-issue group (P\u2009=\u2009.34). Conclusions and Relevance: Among critically ill pediatric patients, the use of fresh red blood cells did not reduce the incidence of new or progressive multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (including mortality) compared with standard-issue red blood cells.

        "HNF4\u03b1-Deficient Fatty Liver Provides a Permissive Environment for Sex-Independent Hepatocellular Carcinoma. The incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is on the rise worldwide. Although the incidence of HCC in males is considerably higher than in females, the projected rates of HCC incidence are increasing for both sexes. A recently appreciated risk factor for HCC is the growing problem of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, which is usually associated with obesity and the metabolic syndrome. In this study, we showed that under conditions of fatty liver, female mice were more likely to develop HCC than expected from previous models. Using an inducible knockout model of the tumor-suppressive isoform of hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 alpha (\"P1-HNF4\u03b1\") in the liver in combination with prolonged high fat (HF) diet, we found that HCC developed equally in male and female mice as early as 38 weeks of age. Similar sex-independent HCC occurred in the \"STAM\" model of mice, in which severe hyperglycemia and HF feeding results in rapid hepatic lipid deposition, fibrosis, and ultimately HCC. In both sexes, reduced P1-HNF4\u03b1 activity, which also occurs under chronic HF diet feeding, increased hepatic lipid deposition and produced a greatly augmented circadian rhythm in IL6, a factor previously linked with higher HCC incidence in males. Loss of HNF4\u03b1 combined with HF feeding induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition in an IL6-dependent manner. Collectively, these data provide a mechanism-based working hypothesis that could explain the rising incidence of aggressive HCC. SIGNIFICANCE: This study provides a mechanism for the growing incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma in both men and women, which is linked to nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. ",
        "Ketamine Restores Thalamic-Prefrontal Cortex Functional Connectivity in a Mouse Model of Neurodevelopmental Disorder-Associated 2p16.3 Deletion. 2p16.3 deletions, involving heterozygous NEUREXIN1 (NRXN1) deletion, dramatically increase the risk of developing neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism and schizophrenia. We have little understanding of how NRXN1 heterozygosity increases the risk of developing these disorders, particularly in terms of the impact on brain and neurotransmitter system function and brain network connectivity. Thus, here we characterize cerebral metabolism and functional brain network connectivity in Nrxn1\u03b1 heterozygous mice (Nrxn1\u03b1+/- mice), and assess the impact of ketamine and dextro-amphetamine on cerebral metabolism in these animals. We show that heterozygous Nrxn1\u03b1 deletion alters cerebral metabolism in neural systems implicated in autism and schizophrenia including the thalamus, mesolimbic system, and select cortical regions. Nrxn1\u03b1 heterozygosity also reduces the efficiency of functional brain networks, through lost thalamic \"rich club\" and prefrontal cortex (PFC) hub connectivity and through reduced thalamic-PFC and thalamic \"rich club\" regional interconnectivity. Subanesthetic ketamine administration normalizes the thalamic hypermetabolism and partially normalizes thalamic disconnectivity present in Nrxn1\u03b1+/- mice, while cerebral metabolic responses to dextro-amphetamine are unaltered. The data provide new insight into the systems-level impact of heterozygous Nrxn1\u03b1 deletion and how this increases the risk of developing neurodevelopmental disorders. The data also suggest that the thalamic dysfunction induced by heterozygous Nrxn1\u03b1 deletion may be NMDA receptor-dependent. ",
        "Positive Attitudes and Therapeutic Misconception Around Hypothetical Clinical Trial Participation in the Huntington's Disease Community. BACKGROUND: New therapies that could modify the disease course of Huntington's disease (HD) are entering clinical trials. However, conceptions about clinical research from the HD community are unknown. This knowledge could help inform patient-clinician discussions surrounding clinical trial participation. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to assess clinical trial attitudes and understanding in the HD community. METHODS: We developed a survey incorporating two measures of trial understanding and attitudes and the impact of therapeutic route of administration on hypothetical trial participation. The survey was distributed via emails, flyers, and social media through HD-related organizations. RESULTS: There were 73 responses. Individuals self-reported as clinically diagnosed with HD, gene positive but asymptomatic, or primary caregivers. Respondents viewed clinical trials positively and generally viewed trials as safe. Individuals with prior HD-related research experience were less likely to have negative expectations about trials than those without research experience (p\u200a=\u200a0.002), and women had higher information needs than men (p\u200a=\u200a0.001). Individuals with HD were more likely than the other groups to experience therapeutic misconception (p\u200a=\u200a0.002). All respondents were able to appraise risks and benefits of research but exhibited optimism about trial outcomes. Willingness to participate was highest when the route of administration was minimally invasive. CONCLUSIONS: While the HD community views clinical trials positively, patients with HD are at high risk for therapeutic misconception and all groups are optimistic about trial outcomes. Limitations of this study include a small sample that may be inclined to view research positively given past trial participation and interest in participating in HD surveys. However, the findings from this study can be used to strengthen informed consent during HD clinical trial recruitment. ",
        "Intersubject Synchronization of Late Adolescent Brain Responses to Violent Movies: A Virtue-Ethics Approach. Movies that involve violence increasingly attract large audiences, leading to concern that such entertainment will encourage imitation by youth, especially when the violence is seen as justified. To assess differences between brain responses to justified and unjustified film violence, we computed intersubject correlation (ISC) of fMRI BOLD time courses in a sample of late adolescents while they watched pairs of movie segments featuring violent characters prior to and during violent action. Based on a virtue-ethics approach that emphasizes motives in moral evaluation, we hypothesized significant ISC in lateral orbital frontal cortex (lOFC) and ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) in response to unjustified and justified scenes of movie violence, respectively. Our predictions were confirmed. In addition, unjustified violence elicited greater intersubject synchrony in insular cortex, consistent with an empathic response to the pain experienced by victims of this kind of violence. The results provide evidence supporting the notion that lOFC and vmPFC play unique roles in moral evaluation of violence, with lOFC becoming more synchronous in response to unacceptable violence and vmPFC becoming more synchronous in response to virtuous forms of self-defense, thereby expanding the purview of current models that only focus on vmPFC. The results suggest that justified violence in popular movies is acceptable to youth who are accustomed to viewing such entertainment. ",
        "Differences in Opinions About Marijuana Use and Prevalence of Use by State Legalization Status. OBJECTIVE: Beliefs about marijuana use and prevalence of use may be associated with the legalization status of the state of residence. We examined differences in views and rates of use of marijuana among residents in recreationally legal, medically legal, and nonlegal states. METHODS: We surveyed a nationally representative online panel of US adults (N\u200a=\u200a16,280) and stratified results by marijuana legalization status of states. We compared views of residents of recreational states on benefits and risks of marijuana use to residents in other states. RESULTS: The response rate was 56.3% (n\u200a=\u200a9003). Residents in recreationally legal states were more likely to believe marijuana could be beneficial for pain management (73% in recreationally legal states, 67% in medically legal states, 63% in nonlegal states; P value: <0.0001), provide relief from stress, anxiety or depression (52% in recreationally legal states, 47% in medically legal states, 46% in nonlegal states; P value: 0.01), and improve appetite (39% in recreationally legal states, 36% in medically legal states, 33% in nonlegal states; P value: <0.009). In addition, residents in recreational states were significantly more likely to believe that smoking 1 marijuana joint a day is somewhat or much safer than smoking 1 cigarette a day (40.8% in recreationally legal states, 39.1% in medically legal states, and 36.1% in nonlegal states; P value: <0.0001). Residents of recreationally and medically legal states were more likely to believe second-hand marijuana smoke was somewhat or much safer than second-hand tobacco smoke (38.3% in recreationally legal states, 38.3% in medically legal states, and 35.7% in nonlegal states; P value: 0.003). Past-year marijuana use in any form (20% in recreational, 14.1% in medical, 12% in nonlegal) and past-year marijuana use of multiple forms (11.1% in recreational, 6.1% in medical, 4.9% in nonlegal) were highest among residents of recreationally legal states. Overall, prevalence of past-year use of any form of marijuana use was more common among residents of recreationally legal states compared with other states (20.3%, confidence interval [CI] 19.5, 21.1 in recreationally legal states; 15.4%, CI 14.7, 16.2 in medically legal states; 11.9%, CI 11.2, 12.6 in nonlegal states). CONCLUSIONS: Residents in recreationally legal states were most likely to believe marijuana has benefits, marijuana smoke is safer than tobacco smoke, and have the highest rate of marijuana use. This is cause for concern, given the tide of commercialization, growing number of high-potency cannabis products, and favorable media coverage promoting use for health problems. ",
        "Meaning in Life and Its Relationship With Physical, Mental, and Cognitive Functioning: A Study of 1,042 Community-Dwelling Adults Across the Lifespan. OBJECTIVE: To examine the relationship of presence and search for meaning in life with age, physical and mental well-being, and cognitive functioning across the adult lifespan. METHODS: Cross-sectional data from 1,042 adults in the Successful AGing Evaluation (SAGE)-a multicohort study of adult community-dwelling residents of San Diego County, California-were analyzed. Presence of meaning (\"Presence\") and search for meaning in life (\"Search\") were assessed with the Meaning in Life Questionnaire. Physical and mental well-being were measured using the Short Form 36 Health Survey (SF-36). Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status-modified was employed to screen for overall cognitive function. Study data were collected from January 2013 to June 2014. RESULTS: Presence of meaning exhibited an inverted U-shaped relationship whereas Search showed a U-shaped relationship with age (with Presence peaking and Search reaching the lowest point around age 60). Statistical modeling using generalized estimating equations revealed that physical well-being (SF-36 physical composite score) correlated negatively with age (P < .001) and positively with Presence (P < .001), and there was an age group x Presence interaction (P = .018), such that the relationship was stronger in subjects over age 60. Mental well-being correlated positively with age (P < .001) and Presence (P < .001) and negatively with Search (P = .002). Cognitive function correlated inversely with age (P < .001) and with Search (P < .001). Significant covariates of Presence and Search had small effect sizes, except for a medium effect size for satisfaction with life and Presence in adults over age 60 (P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Presence and search for meaning in life are important for health and well-being, though the relationships differ in adults younger and older than 60 years. Better understanding of the longitudinal relationships of meaning of life with well-being is warranted to design interventions to increase meaning of life and improve health and functioning. ",
        "Chronic muscle weakness and mitochondrial dysfunction in the absence of sustained atrophy in a preclinical sepsis model. Chronic critical illness is a global clinical issue affecting millions of sepsis survivors annually. Survivors report chronic skeletal muscle weakness and development of new functional limitations that persist for years. To delineate mechanisms of sepsis-induced chronic weakness, we first surpassed a critical barrier by establishing a murine model of sepsis with ICU-like interventions that allows for the study of survivors. We show that sepsis survivors have profound weakness for at least 1 month, even after recovery of muscle mass. Abnormal mitochondrial ultrastructure, impaired respiration and electron transport chain activities, and persistent protein oxidative damage were evident in the muscle of survivors. Our data suggest that sustained mitochondrial dysfunction, rather than atrophy alone, underlies chronic sepsis-induced muscle weakness. This study emphasizes that conventional efforts that aim to recover muscle quantity will likely remain ineffective for regaining strength and improving quality of life after sepsis until deficiencies in muscle quality are addressed.

The MHC region is highly associated with autoimmune and infectious diseases. Here we conduct an in-depth interrogation of associations between genetic variation, gene expression and disease. We create a comprehensive map of regulatory variation in the MHC region using WGS from 419 individuals to call eight-digit HLA types and RNA-seq data from matched iPSCs. Building on this regulatory map, we explored GWAS signals for 4083 traits, detecting colocalization for 180 disease loci with eQTLs. We show that eQTL analyses taking HLA type haplotypes into account have substantially greater power compared with only using single variants. We examined the association between the 8.1 ancestral haplotype and delayed colonization in Cystic Fibrosis, postulating that downregulation of RNF5 expression is the likely causal mechanism. Our study provides insights into the genetic architecture of the MHC region and pinpoints disease associations that are due to differential expression of HLA genes and non-HLA genes. ",
        "Neural ensemble dynamics in dorsal motor cortex during speech in people with paralysis. Speaking is a sensorimotor behavior whose neural basis is difficult to study with single neuron resolution due to the scarcity of human intracortical measurements. We used electrode arrays to record from the motor cortex 'hand knob' in two people with tetraplegia, an area not previously implicated in speech. Neurons modulated during speaking and during non-speaking movements of the tongue, lips, and jaw. This challenges whether the conventional model of a 'motor homunculus' division by major body regions extends to the single-neuron scale. Spoken words and syllables could be decoded from single trials, demonstrating the potential of intracortical recordings for brain-computer interfaces to restore speech. Two neural population dynamics features previously reported for arm movements were also present during speaking: a component that was mostly invariant across initiating different words, followed by rotatory dynamics during speaking. This suggests that common neural dynamical motifs may underlie movement of arm and speech articulators. ",
        "The dynamic proteome of influenza A virus infection identifies M segment splicing as a host range determinant. Pandemic influenza A virus (IAV) outbreaks occur when strains from animal reservoirs acquire the ability to infect and spread among humans. The molecular basis of this species barrier is incompletely understood. Here we combine metabolic pulse labeling and quantitative proteomics to monitor protein synthesis upon infection of human cells with a human- and a bird-adapted IAV strain and observe striking differences in viral protein synthesis. Most importantly, the matrix protein M1 is inefficiently produced by the bird-adapted strain. We show that impaired production of M1 from bird-adapted strains is caused by increased splicing of the M segment RNA to alternative isoforms. Strain-specific M segment splicing is controlled by the 3' splice site and functionally important for permissive infection. In silico and biochemical evidence shows that avian-adapted M segments have evolved different conserved RNA structure features than human-adapted sequences. Thus, we identify M segment RNA splicing as a viral host range determinant. ",
        "Transient elastography for screening of liver fibrosis: Cost-effectiveness analysis from six prospective cohorts in Europe and Asia. BACKGROUND & AIMS: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and alcohol-related liver disease pose an important challenge to current clinical healthcare pathways because of the large number of at-risk patients. Therefore, we aimed to explore the cost-effectiveness of transient elastography (TE) as a screening method to detect liver fibrosis in a primary care pathway. METHODS: Cost-effectiveness analysis was performed using real-life individual patient data from 6 independent prospective cohorts (5 from Europe and 1 from Asia). A diagnostic algorithm with conditional inference trees was developed to explore the relationships between liver stiffness, socio-demographics, comorbidities, and hepatic fibrosis, the latter assessed by fibrosis scores (FIB-4, NFS) and liver biopsies in a subset of 352 patients. We compared the incremental cost-effectiveness of a screening strategy against standard of care alongside the numbers needed to screen to diagnose a patient with fibrosis stage \u2265F2. RESULTS: The data set encompassed 6,295 participants (mean age 55\u202f\u00b1\u202f12\u202fyears, BMI 27\u202f\u00b1\u202f5\u202fkg/m2, liver stiffness 5.6\u202f\u00b1\u202f5.0\u202fkPa). A 9.1\u202fkPa TE cut-off provided the best accuracy for the diagnosis of significant fibrosis (\u2265F2) in general population settings, whereas a threshold of 9.5\u202fkPa was optimal for populations at-risk of alcohol-related liver disease. TE with the proposed cut-offs outperformed fibrosis scores in terms of accuracy. Screening with TE was cost-effective with mean incremental cost-effectiveness ratios ranging from 2,570 \u20ac/QALY (95% CI 2,456-2,683) for a population at-risk of alcohol-related liver disease (age \u226545\u202fyears) to 6,217 \u20ac/QALY (95% CI 5,832-6,601) in the general population. Overall, there was a 12% chance of TE screening being cost saving across countries and populations. CONCLUSIONS: Screening for liver fibrosis with TE in primary care is a cost-effective intervention for European and Asian populations and may even be cost saving. LAY SUMMARY: The lack of optimized public health screening strategies for the detection of liver fibrosis in adults without known liver disease presents a major healthcare challenge. Analyses from 6 independent international cohorts, with transient elastography measurements, show that a community-based risk-stratification strategy for alcohol-related and non-alcoholic fatty liver diseases is cost-effective and potentially cost saving for our healthcare systems, as it leads to earlier identification of patients.

        "High-Resolution, Adaptive Optics Imaging of the Human Trabecular Meshwork In Vivo. Purpose: To image the human trabecular meshwork (TM) in vivo using adaptive optics gonioscopy (AOG) with approximately 2-\u03bcm lateral resolution. Methods: An existing Indiana University adaptive optics scanning laser ophthalmoscope was altered by adding a 12-mm button lens to a clinical gonioscopic lens allowing high-resolution imaging of the human iridocorneal angle. First an anatomic model eye was used to refine the imaging technique and then nine participants (7 controls and 2 participants with pigment dispersion syndrome) were imaged. Results: All nine participants were successfully imaged without adverse events. High-resolution imaging of the human TM was achieved allowing for visualization of the TM beams, and presumed endothelial cells. Uveal meshwork beams in controls averaged 25.5 \u03bcm (range, 15.2-44.7) in diameter with pores averaging 42.6 \u03bcm (range, 22.3-51.4) while the corneoscleral meshwork pores averaged 8.9 \u03bcm (range, 7.7-12.1). Differences in appearance of the uveal and corneoscleral meshwork were noted between the two participants with pigment dispersion syndrome and the controls. These included nearly absent spacing between the beams and enlarged endothelial cells with hyperreflective areas. Conclusions: AOG allows for near cellular level resolution of the human TM in vivo. This may allow for further understanding of age-related changes that occur as well as provide a deeper understanding of medical and surgical alterations for the treatment of glaucoma. Translational Relevance: Further development of this approach may allow for direct measurements at a micometer level in vivo of changes that occur in the human trabecular meshwork with glaucoma and therapeutic interventions.

        "Efficacy and Safety of Varenicline for Adolescent Smoking Cessation: A Randomized Clinical Trial. Importance: Cigarette smoking is the leading cause of preventable morbidity and mortality in the United States and worldwide, and most tobacco users begin smoking in adolescence. Although advances have yielded efficacious pharmacotherapies to complement smoking cessation counseling in adults, far less progress has been made in addressing tobacco use in adolescence. Objective: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of varenicline tartrate for smoking cessation in adolescents and young adults. Design, Setting, and Participants: This 2-group randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind intention-to-treat clinical trial enrolled a volunteer sample of treatment-seeking adolescent and young adult cigarette smokers (n\u2009=\u2009157) aged 14 to 21 years at an outpatient clinical site in Charleston, South Carolina, from August 15, 2012, to October 20, 2017. Follow-up was completed on January 25, 2018. Data were analyzed from March 19, 2018, to August 11, 2018, with further revisions completed April 10, 2019. Interventions: Participants were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to a 12-week course of varenicline (n\u2009=\u200977) or placebo (n\u2009=\u200980). All participants received weekly smoking cessation counseling. Main Outcomes and Measures: The preselected primary efficacy outcome was urine cotinine level-confirmed 7-day abstinence at the end of treatment. Secondary efficacy outcomes included weekly abstinence throughout active treatment, abstinence at posttreatment follow-up visits, and time to first 7-day abstinence. The primary safety outcome was the frequency of treatment-emergent adverse events. Results: A total of 157 participants were enrolled (94 male [59.9%]; mean [SD] age, 19.1 [1.5] years). The varenicline and placebo groups did not differ in the primary outcome of cotinine-confirmed self-reported 7-day abstinence at the end of treatment (varenicline group, 4 of 45 [8.9%]; placebo group, 4 of 45 [8.9%]; risk ratio [RR], 0.97; 95% CI, 0.29-2.99; P\u2009=\u2009.96). However, among secondary outcomes, the varenicline group achieved self-reported earlier abstinence of at least 7 days (hazard ratio, 1.91; 95% CI, 1.12-3.27) and demonstrated higher rates of self-reported weekly abstinence during the full course of treatment (RR, 1.81; 95% CI, 1.09-2.99; P\u2009=\u2009.02) and at posttreatment follow-up (RR, 1.82; 95% CI, 1.01-3.28; P\u2009=\u2009.02). Study medication was generally well tolerated, and treatment-emergent adverse events did not differ between groups (any adverse events, 55 [71.4%] in the varenicline group vs 60 [75.0%] in the placebo group; RR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.79-1.15; P\u2009=\u2009.61). Conclusions and Relevance: When added to weekly cessation counseling for adolescent cigarette smokers, varenicline, compared with placebo, was well tolerated but did not improve end-of-treatment abstinence. However, varenicline may hasten abstinence and yield improvements in posttreatment abstinence outcomes. Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01509547. ",
        "Persistent, bioaccumulative, and toxic properties of liquid crystal monomers and their detection in indoor residential dust. Liquid crystal monomers (LCMs) are used widely in liquid crystal displays (LCDs), which are dramatically changing the world due to the provision of convenient communication. However, there are essentially no published reports on the fate and/or effects of LCMs in the environment. Of 362 currently produced LCMs, 87 were identified as persistent and bioaccumulative (P&B) chemicals, which indicated that these chemicals would exhibit resistance to degradation and exhibit mobility after entering the environment. Following exposure to mixtures of LCM collected from 6 LCD devices, significant modulation of 5 genes, CYP1A4, PDK4, FGF19, LBFABP, and THRSP, was observed in vitro. Modulation of expressions of mRNAs coding for these genes has frequently been reported for toxic (T) persistent organic pollutants (POPs). In LCM mixtures, 33 individual LCMs were identified by use of mass spectrometry and screened for in 53 samples of dust from indoor environments. LCMs were detectable in 47% of analyzed samples, and 17 of the 33 LCMs were detectable in at least 1 sample of dust. Based on chemical properties, including P&B&T of LCMs and their ubiquitous detection in dust samples, the initial screening information suggests a need for studies to determine status and trends in concentrations of LCMs in various environmental matrices as well as tissues of humans and wildlife. There is also a need for more comprehensive in vivo studies to determine toxic effects and potencies of LCMs during chronic, sublethal exposures. ",
        "What Can You Achieve in 8 Years? A Case Study on Participation, Effectiveness, and Overall Impact of a Comprehensive Workplace Health Promotion Program. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate participation and effectiveness of a multiyear comprehensive workplace health promotion (WHP) program. METHODS: Participation and effectiveness data came from employer and vendor systems. Health data came from health risk assessments (HRA) and biometric screenings. Participation and effectiveness were analyzed using descriptive analyses, t tests, and Mann-Whitney U tests where appropriate. Overall impact was assessed using the PIPE Impact Metric. RESULTS: Eighty-six percent of employees completed the HRA and 80% the biometrical screenings. Annual participation rate was 24%, and total reach was 58%. The portion of successful participants was 23% in 2010 to 2013 and 18% in 2014 to 2017. PIPE Impact scores were 18% for 2010 to 2013 and 14% for the 2014 to 2017 study periods. CONCLUSION: Despite modest annual participation rates, overall 8-year reach was considered reasonable. Conservatively, we consider the overall program impact to be moderate. ",
        "Probiotic Yeasts Inhibit Virulence of Non-albicans Candida Species. Systemic infections of Candida species pose a significant threat to public health. Toxicity associated with current therapies and emergence of resistant strains present major therapeutic challenges. Here, we report exploitation of the probiotic properties of two novel, food-derived yeasts, Saccharomyces cerevisiae (strain KTP) and Issatchenkia occidentalis (strain ApC), as an alternative approach to combat widespread opportunistic fungal infections. Both yeasts inhibit virulence traits such as adhesion, filamentation, and biofilm formation of several non-albicans Candida species, including Candida tropicalis, Candida krusei, Candida glabrata, and Candida parapsilosis as well as the recently identified multidrug-resistant species Candida auris They inhibit adhesion to abiotic surfaces as well as cultured colon epithelial cells. Furthermore, probiotic treatment blocks the formation of biofilms of individual non-albicans Candida strains as well as mixed-culture biofilms of each non-albicans Candida strain in combination with Candida albicans The probiotic yeasts attenuated non-albicans Candida infections in a live animal. In vivo studies using Caenorhabditis elegans suggest that exposure to probiotic yeasts protects nematodes from infection with non-albicans Candida strains compared to worms that were not exposed to the probiotic yeasts. Furthermore, application of probiotic yeasts postinfection with non-albicans Candida alleviated pathogenic colonization of the nematode gut. The probiotic properties of these novel yeasts are better than or comparable to those of the commercially available probiotic yeast Saccharomyces boulardii, which was used as a reference strain throughout this study. These results indicate that yeasts derived from food sources could serve as an effective alternative to antifungal therapy against emerging pathogenic Candida species.IMPORTANCE Non-albicans Candida-associated infections have emerged as a major risk factor in the hospitalized and immunecompromised patients. Besides, antifungal-associated complications occur more frequently with these non-albicans Candida species than with C. albicans Therefore, as an alternative approach to combat these widespread non-albicans Candida-associated infections, here we showed the probiotic effect of two yeasts, Saccharomyces cerevisiae (strain KTP) and Issatchenkia occidentalis (ApC), in preventing adhesion and biofilm formation of five non-albicans Candida strains, Candida tropicalis, Candida krusei, Candida glabrata, Candida parapsilosis, and Candida auris The result would influence the current trend of the conversion of conventional antimicrobial therapy into beneficial probiotic microbe-associated antimicrobial treatment.

        "Pindolol Rescues Anxiety-Like Behavior and Neurogenic Maladaptations of Long-Term Binge Alcohol Intake in Mice. Long-term binge alcohol consumption alters the signaling of numerous neurotransmitters in the brain including noradrenaline (NE) and serotonin (5-HT). Alterations in the signaling of these neuronal pathways result in dysfunctional emotional states like anxiety and depression which are typically seen during alcohol withdrawal. Interestingly, studies have demonstrated that the development of alcohol-induced negative affective states is linked to disrupted neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus (DG) region of the hippocampus in alcohol-dependent animals. We have previously shown that modulation of NE and 5-HT activity by pharmacological targeting of \u03b2-adrenoreceptors (\u03b2-ARs) and 5-HT1A/1B receptors with pindolol reduces consumption in long-term alcohol-consuming mice. Since these receptors are also involved in emotional homeostasis and hippocampal neurogenesis, we investigated the effects of pindolol administration on emotional and neurogenic deficits in mice consuming long-term alcohol (18 weeks). We report that acute administration of pindolol (32 mg/kg) reduces anxiety-like behavior in mice at 24 h withdrawal in the marble-burying test (MBT) and the elevated plus-maze (EPM). We also show that chronic (2 weeks) pindolol treatment (32 mg/kg/day) attenuates alcohol-induced impairments in the density of immature neurons (DCX+) but not newborn cells (BrdU+) in the hippocampal DG. Pindolol treatment also restores the normal proportion of newborn proliferating cells (BrdU+/Ki67+/DCX-), newborn proliferating immature neurons (BrdU+/Ki67+/DCX+) and newborn non-proliferating immature neurons (BrdU+/Ki67-/DCX+) following long-term alcohol intake. These results suggest that pindolol, through its unique pharmacology may rescue some but not all deficits of long-term alcohol abuse on the brain, adding further value to its properties as a strong pharmaceutical option for alcohol use disorders (AUDs).

        "Rapid increase in the prevalence of cannabis use among people with depression in the United States, 2005-17: the role of differentially changing risk perceptions. AIMS: To estimate trends in the prevalence of cannabis use and risk perceptions of cannabis use from 2005 to 2017 among United States people with and without depression. DESIGN: Linear time trends of the prevalence of any, daily and non-daily past 30-day cannabis use and perceived great risk associated with regular cannabis use (outcome variables) among people with and without past-year depression were assessed using logistic regression with survey year as the predictor. All analyses were adjusted for gender, age, race/ethnicity and income; models assessing time trends of cannabis use prevalence were also adjusted for perceived risk. SETTING: The United States: National Survey on Drug Use and Health, an annual cross-sectional survey, 2005-17 public use data files. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 728\u2009691 people aged\u00a0\u2265\u00a012\u00a0years. MEASUREMENTS: Self-report of any, daily and non-daily past 30-day cannabis use and perceived great risk associated with regular cannabis use. FINDINGS: The prevalence of any, daily and non-daily cannabis use in the past month was higher among those with depression versus those without [e.g. 2017 for any use: 18.94 versus 8.67%; adjusted odds ratio (aOR)\u00a0=\u00a02.17 (95% confidence interval (CI)\u00a0=\u00a01.92, 2.45)]. Any, daily and non-daily cannabis use increased among people with and without depression from 2005 to 2017, yet the increase in any (aORs\u00a0=\u00a01.06 versus 1.05; P\u00a0=\u00a00.008) and daily (aORs\u00a0=\u00a01.10 versus 1.07; P\u00a0=\u00a00.021) cannabis use adjusted for socio-demographic characteristics was more rapid among those with depression. Perception of great risk associated with regular cannabis use was significantly lower among those with depression (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and decreased significantly more rapidly over the study period among people with depression, compared with those without (aORs\u00a0=\u00a00.89 versus 0.92; P\u00a0<\u00a00.001). CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of cannabis use in the United States increased from 2005 to 2017 among people with and without depression and was approximately twice as common among those with depression. People with depression experienced a more rapid decrease in perception of risk, which may be related to the more rapid increase in any and daily past-month cannabis use in this group. ",

        "Longitudinal changes in moderate-to-vigorous-intensity physical activity in children and adolescents: A systematic review and meta-analysis. Moderate-to-vigorous-intensity physical activity (MVPA) is important for childhood obesity prevention and treatment, yet declines with age. Timing and magnitude of the decline in MVPA in children and adolescents are unclear but important for informing effective obesity intervention development. This systematic review aimed to determine and compare the year-to-year changes in MVPA among children and adolescents. Longitudinal studies were identified by searching 10 relevant databases up to December 2018. Studies were eligible for inclusion if they reported accelerometer-assessed MVPA (min day-1 ) separately for boys and girls and had follow-up duration of at least 1 year. After screening 9,232 studies, 52 were included representing 22,091 aged 3 to 18 year olds (boys=8,857; girls=13,234). Pooled-analysis of the relative change in MVPA per year showed a decline of -3.4% (95% CI, -5.9 to -0.9) in boys and -5.3% (95% CI, -7.6 to -3.1) in girls, across all age groups. There were notable declines in MVPA at age 9 for both boys (-7.8%, 95% CI, -11.2 to -4.4) and girls (-10.2%, 95% CI, -14.2 to -6.3). The relative decline in MVPA affects both sexes from an early age; however, it is greater among girls. Interventions to promote MVPA should start before adolescence. ",
        "Development of an Alarm Algorithm, With Nanotechnology Multimodal Sensor, to Predict Impending Infusion Failure and Improve Safety of Peripheral Intravenous Catheters in Neonates. BACKGROUND: Peripheral intravenous catheters connected to an infusion pump are necessary for the delivery of fluids, nutrition, and medications to hospitalized neonates but are not without complications. These adverse events contribute to hospital-acquired patient harm. An artificial intelligence theory called fuzzy logic may allow the use of appropriate variables to predict infusion failure. PURPOSE: This innovative study aimed to develop an intravenous infusion nanotechnology monitoring system that would alert the nurse to impending peripheral intravenous infusion failure. METHODS: An intravenous infusion nanotechnology monitoring system, using predictor variables of pressure, pH, and oxygen saturation used in a fuzzy logic alarm algorithm was developed to alert the nurse to impending peripheral intravenous infusion failure. FINDINGS: The developed intravenous infusion nanotechnology monitoring system is composed of a peripheral intravenous catheter with nanotechnology multimodal sensor, an intravenous pump, a fuzzy logic algorithm, and alarm. For example, using this system, an elevated in-line pressure, a low pH, and a low venous oxygen level would generate an alarm for possible impending infusion failure. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: With further development, this technology may help nurses predict and prevent adverse outcomes from intravenous infusions. This work shows how nurses can be content experts and innovators of technology that they use to make clinical decisions. IMPLICATIONS FOR RESEARCH: After regulatory approval, a randomized controlled trial may be performed to investigate whether interventions at the time of an alarm would result in fewer adverse outcomes and improve safety.

        "Genetic and epigenetic study of an Alzheimer's disease family with monozygotic triplets. Age at onset of Alzheimer's disease is highly variable, and its modifiers (genetic or environmental) could act through epigenetic changes, such as DNA methylation at CpG sites. DNA methylation is also linked to ageing-the strongest Alzheimer's disease risk factor. DNA methylation age can be calculated using age-related CpGs and might reflect biological ageing. We conducted a clinical, genetic and epigenetic investigation of a unique Ashkenazi Jewish family with monozygotic triplets, two of whom developed Alzheimer's disease at ages 73 and 76, while the third at age 85 has no cognitive complaints or deficits in daily activities. One of their offspring developed Alzheimer's disease at age 50. Targeted sequencing of 80 genes associated with neurodegeneration revealed that the triplets and the affected offspring are heterozygous carriers of the risk APOE \u03b54 allele, as well as rare substitutions in APP (p.S198P), NOTCH3 (p.H1235L) and SORL1 (p.W1563C). In addition, we catalogued 52 possibly damaging rare variants detected by NeuroX array in affected individuals. Analysis of family members on a genome-wide DNA methylation chip revealed that the DNA methylation age of the triplets was 6-10 years younger than chronological age, while it was 9 years older in the offspring with early-onset Alzheimer's disease, suggesting accelerated ageing.

        "Resveratrol trimer enhances gene delivery to hematopoietic stem cells by reducing antiviral restriction at endosomes. Therapeutic gene delivery to hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) holds great potential as a life-saving treatment of monogenic, oncologic, and infectious diseases. However, clinical gene therapy is severely limited by intrinsic HSC resistance to modification with lentiviral vectors (LVs), thus requiring high doses or repeat LV administration to achieve therapeutic gene correction. Here we show that temporary coapplication of the cyclic resveratrol trimer caraphenol A enhances LV gene delivery efficiency to human and nonhuman primate hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells with integrating and nonintegrating LVs. Although significant ex vivo, this effect was most dramatically observed in human lineages derived from HSCs transplanted into immunodeficient mice. We further show that caraphenol A relieves restriction of LV transduction by altering the levels of interferon-induced transmembrane (IFITM) proteins IFITM2 and IFITM3 and their association with late endosomes, thus augmenting LV core endosomal escape. Caraphenol A-mediated IFITM downregulation did not alter the LV integration pattern or bias lineage differentiation. Taken together, these findings compellingly demonstrate that the pharmacologic modification of intrinsic immune restriction factors is a promising and nontoxic approach for improving LV-mediated gene therapy.

        "Trends in Prescription Analgesic Use Among Adults With Musculoskeletal Conditions in the United States, 1999-2016. Importance: Monitoring trends in prescription analgesic use among adults with musculoskeletal conditions provides insight into how changing prescribing practices, guidelines, and policy measures may affect those who need pain management. Objective: To evaluate trends in prescription opioid use and nonopioid analgesic use among adults with functional limitations attributable to musculoskeletal conditions. Design, Setting, and Participants: This repeated cross-sectional study uses data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Study from 1999 to 2016. Data were analyzed from January to July 2019. The participants were adults aged 30 to 79 years who reported functional limitations due to back or neck problems and/or arthritis or rheumatism. Main Outcomes and Measures: Any use of a prescription opioid or exclusive use of a prescription nonopioid analgesic. Results: In this population of 7256 adults with 1 or more functional limitations attributable to a musculoskeletal condition (4226 women [59.9%]; 3508 [74.4%] non-Hispanic white individuals; median [interquartile range] age, 63 [53-70] years), opioid use and exclusive nonopioid analgesic use exhibited approximately reciprocal patterns of change from 1999 to 2016. Opioid use increased significantly (difference in prevalence for 2015-2016 vs 1999-2000, 7.2%; 95% CI, 1.3% to 13%; P for trend\u2009=\u2009.002), and exclusive use of nonopioid analgesics decreased significantly (difference in prevalence for 2015-2016 vs 1999-2000, -13%; 95% CI, -19% to -7.5%; P for trend\u2009<\u2009.001) during this period. The increase in any opioid use was driven by long-term rather than short-term use. A crossover in the prevalence of opioid use and exclusive use of nonopioid analgesics occurred between 2003 and 2006, after which opioid use was more prevalent. Between 2013 and 2016, decreases in opioid use were observed among men (difference in prevalence for 2015-2016 vs 2013-2014, -11%; 95% CI, -21% to 1.8%) and participants with less than a high school education (difference, -15%; 95% CI, -24% to -6.1%). During this same period, exclusive nonopioid analgesic use also decreased markedly across the population (difference, -5.3%; 95% CI, -9.1% to -1.5%). Conclusions and Relevance: The substitution of opioids for nonopioid analgesics between 2003 and 2006 may have occurred as evidence emerged on the cardiovascular risks associated with nonopioid analgesics. Reductions in opioid use between 2013 and 2016 were most substantial among those with low socioeconomic status, who may encounter barriers in accessing alternatives. Despite those decreases, opioid use remained more prevalent in 2015 to 2016 than in 1999 to 2000, suggesting a potentially long tail for the opioid epidemic. ",
        "Exploring thematic structure and predicted functionality of 16S rRNA amplicon data. Analysis of microbiome data involves identifying co-occurring groups of taxa associated with sample features of interest (e.g., disease state). Elucidating such relations is often difficult as microbiome data are compositional, sparse, and have high dimensionality. Also, the configuration of co-occurring taxa may represent overlapping subcommunities that contribute to sample characteristics such as host status. Preserving the configuration of co-occurring microbes rather than detecting specific indicator species is more likely to facilitate biologically meaningful interpretations. Additionally, analyses that use taxonomic relative abundances to predict the abundances of different gene functions aggregate predicted functional profiles across taxa. This precludes straightforward identification of predicted functional components associated with subsets of co-occurring taxa. We provide an approach to explore co-occurring taxa using \"topics\" generated via a topic model and link these topics to specific sample features (e.g., disease state). Rather than inferring predicted functional content based on overall taxonomic relative abundances, we instead focus on inference of functional content within topics, which we parse by estimating interactions between topics and pathways through a multilevel, fully Bayesian regression model. We apply our methods to three publicly available 16S amplicon sequencing datasets: an inflammatory bowel disease dataset, an oral cancer dataset, and a time-series dataset. Using our topic model approach to uncover latent structure in 16S rRNA amplicon surveys, investigators can (1) capture groups of co-occurring taxa termed topics; (2) uncover within-topic functional potential; (3) link taxa co-occurrence, gene function, and environmental/host features; and (4) explore the way in which sets of co-occurring taxa behave and evolve over time. These methods have been implemented in a freely available R package: https://cran.r-project.org/package=themetagenomics, https://github.com/EESI/themetagenomics. ",
        "NmrLineGuru: Standalone and User-Friendly GUIs for Fast 1D NMR Lineshape Simulation and Analysis of Multi-State Equilibrium Binding Models. The ability of high-resolution NMR spectroscopy to readout the response of molecular interactions at multiple atomic sites presents a unique capability to define thermodynamic equilibrium constants and kinetic rate constants for complex, multiple-step biological interactions. Nonetheless, the extraction of the relevant equilibrium binding and rate constants requires the appropriate analysis of not only a readout that follows the equilibrium concentrations of typical binding titration curves, but also the lineshapes of NMR spectra. To best take advantage of NMR data for characterizing molecular interactions, we developed NmrLineGuru, a software tool with a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI) to model two-state, three-state, and four-state binding processes. Application of NmrLineGuru is through stand-alone GUIs, with no dependency on other software and no scripted input. NMR spectra can be fitted or simulated starting with user-specified input parameters and a chosen kinetic model. The ability to both simulate and fit NMR spectra provides the user the opportunity to not only determine the binding parameters that best reproduce the measured NMR spectra for the selected kinetic model, but to also query the possibility that alternative models agree with the data. NmrLineGuru is shown to provide an accurate, quantitative analysis of complex molecular interactions. ",
        "An intravital window to image the colon in real time. Intravital microscopy is a powerful technique to observe dynamic processes with single-cell resolution in live animals. No intravital window has been developed for imaging the colon due to its anatomic location and motility, although the colon is a key organ where the majority of microbiota reside and common diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease, functional gastrointestinal disorders, and colon cancer occur. Here we describe an intravital murine colonic window with a stabilizing ferromagnetic scaffold for chronic imaging, minimizing motion artifacts while maximizing long-term survival by preventing colonic obstruction. Using this setup, we image fluorescently-labeled stem cells, bacteria, and immune cells in live animal colons. Furthermore, we image nerve activity via calcium imaging in real time to demonstrate that electrical sacral nerve stimulation can activate colonic enteric neurons. The simple implantable apparatus enables visualization of live processes in the colon, which will open the window to a broad range of studies. ",
        "A Menin-MLL Inhibitor Induces Specific Chromatin Changes and Eradicates Disease in Models of MLL-Rearranged Leukemia. Inhibition of the Menin (MEN1) and MLL (MLL1, KMT2A) interaction is a potential therapeutic strategy for MLL-rearranged (MLL-r) leukemia. Structure-based design yielded the potent, highly selective, and orally bioavailable small-molecule inhibitor VTP50469. Cell lines carrying MLL rearrangements were selectively responsive to VTP50469. VTP50469 displaced Menin from protein complexes and inhibited chromatin occupancy of MLL at select genes. Loss of MLL binding led to changes in gene expression, differentiation, and apoptosis. Patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models derived from patients with either MLL-r acute myeloid leukemia or MLL-r acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) showed dramatic reductions of leukemia burden when treated with VTP50469. Multiple mice engrafted with MLL-r ALL remained disease free for more than 1 year after treatment. These data support rapid translation of this approach to clinical trials. ",
        "Nonpharmacological Treatment of Army Service Members with Chronic Pain Is Associated with Fewer Adverse Outcomes After Transition to the Veterans Health Administration. BACKGROUND: Potential protective effects of nonpharmacological treatments (NPT) against long-term pain-related adverse outcomes have not been examined. OBJECTIVE: To compare active duty U.S. Army service members with chronic pain who did/did not receive NPT in the Military Health System (MHS) and describe the association between receiving NPT and adverse outcomes after transitioning to the Veterans Health Administration (VHA). DESIGN AND PARTICIPANTS: A longitudinal cohort study of active duty Army service members whose MHS healthcare records indicated presence of chronic pain after an index deployment to Iraq or Afghanistan in the years 2008-2014 (N = 142,539). Propensity score-weighted multivariable Cox proportional hazard models tested for differences in adverse outcomes between the NPT group and No-NPT group. EXPOSURES: NPT received in the MHS included acupuncture/dry needling, biofeedback, chiropractic care, massage, exercise therapy, cold laser therapy, osteopathic spinal manipulation, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation and other electrical manipulation, ultrasonography, superficial heat treatment, traction, and lumbar supports. MAIN MEASURES: Primary outcomes were propensity score-weighted proportional hazards for the following adverse outcomes: (a) diagnoses of alcohol and/or drug disorders; (b) poisoning with opioids, related narcotics, barbiturates, or sedatives; (c) suicide ideation; and (d) self-inflicted injuries including suicide attempts. Outcomes were determined based on ICD-9 and ICD-10 diagnoses recorded in VHA healthcare records from the start of utilization until fiscal year 2018. KEY RESULTS: The propensity score-weighted proportional hazards for the NPT group compared to the No-NPT group were 0.92 (95% CI 0.90-0.94, P < 0.001) for alcohol and/or drug use disorders; 0.65 (95% CI 0.51-0.83, P < 0.001) for accidental poisoning with opioids, related narcotics, barbiturates, or sedatives; 0.88 (95% CI 0.84-0.91, P < 0.001) for suicide ideation; and 0.83 (95% CI 0.77-0.90, P < 0.001) for self-inflicted injuries including suicide attempts. CONCLUSIONS: NPT provided in the MHS to service members with chronic pain may reduce risk of long-term adverse outcomes. ",
        "Analysis of Powders Containing Illicit Drugs Using Magnetic Levitation. Magneto-Archimedes levitation (MagLev) enables the separation of powdered mixtures of illicit drugs (cocaine, methamphetamine, heroin, fentanyl, and its analogues), adulterants, and diluents based on density, and allows the presumptive identification of individual components. Small samples (mass <50\u2005mg), with low concentrations of illicit drugs, present a particular challenge to analysis for forensic chemists. The MagLev device, a cuvette containing a solution of paramagnetic gadolinium(III) chelate in a non-polar solvent, placed between two like-poles-facing NdFeB magnets, allowed separation of seven relevant compounds simultaneously. In particular, initial separation with MagLev, followed by characterization by FTIR-ATR, enabled identification of fentanyl in a sample of fentanyl-laced heroin (1.3\u2005wt\u2009% fentanyl, 2.6\u2005wt\u2009% heroin, and 96.1\u2005wt\u2009% lactose). MagLev allows identification of unknown powders in mixtures and enables confirmatory identification based on structure-specific techniques. ",
        "Bioelectronic Recordings of Cardiomyocytes with Accumulation Mode Electrolyte Gated Organic Field Effect Transistors. Organic electronic materials offer an untapped potential for novel tools for low-invasive electrophysiological recording and stimulation devices. Such materials combine semiconducting properties with tailored surface chemistry, elastic mechanical properties and chemical stability in water. In this work, we investigate solution processed Electrolyte Gated Organic Field Effect Transistors (EGOFETs) based on a small molecule semiconductor. We demonstrate that EGOFETs based on a blend of soluble organic semiconductor 2,8-Difluoro-5,11-bis(triethylsilylethynyl)anthradithiophene (diF-TES-ADT) combined with an insulating polymer show excellent sensitivity and long-term recording under electrophysiological applications. Our devices can stably record the extracellular potential of human pluripotent stem cell derived cardiomyocyte cells (hPSCs-CMs) for several weeks. In addition, cytotoxicity tests of pharmaceutical drugs, such as Norepinephrine and Verapamil was achieved with excellent sensitivity. This work demonstrates that organic transistors based on organic blends are excellent bioelectronics transducer for extracellular electrical recording of excitable cells and tissues thus providing a valid alternative to electrochemical transistors.

        "Real-Time Photoacoustic Thermometry Combined With Clinical Ultrasound Imaging and High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound. High-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) treatment is a promising non-invasive method for killing or destroying the diseased tissues by locally delivering thermal and mechanical energy without damaging surrounding normal tissues. In HIFU, measuring the temperature at the site of delivery is important for improving therapeutic efficacy, controlling safety, and appropriately planning a treatment. Several researchers have proposed photoacoustic thermometry for monitoring HIFU treatment, but they had many limitations, including the inability to image while the HIFU is on, inability to provide two-dimensional monitoring, and the inability to be used clinically. In this paper, we propose a novel integrated real-time photoacoustic thermometry system for HIFU treatment monitoring. The system provides ultrasound B-mode imaging, photoacoustic structural imaging, and photoacoustic thermometry during HIFU treatment in real-time for both in vitro and in vivo environments, without any interference from the strong therapeutic HIFU waves. We have successfully tested the real-time photoacoustic thermometry by investigating the relationship between the photoacoustic amplitude and the measured temperature with in vitro phantoms and in vivo tumor-bearing mice. The results show the feasibility of a real-time photoacoustic thermometry system for safe and effective monitoring of HIFU treatment. ",
        "Modeling Progressive Fibrosis with Pluripotent Stem Cells Identifies an Anti-fibrotic Small Molecule. Progressive organ fibrosis accounts for one-third of all deaths worldwide, yet preclinical models that mimic the complex, progressive nature of the disease are lacking, and hence, there are no curative therapies. Progressive fibrosis across organs shares common cellular and molecular pathways involving chronic injury, inflammation, and aberrant repair resulting in deposition of extracellular matrix, organ remodeling, and ultimately organ failure. We describe the generation and characterization of an in\u00a0vitro progressive fibrosis model that uses cell types derived from induced pluripotent stem cells. Our model produces endogenous activated transforming growth factor \u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) and contains activated fibroblastic aggregates that progressively increase in size and stiffness with activation of known fibrotic molecular and cellular changes. We used this model as a phenotypic drug discovery platform for modulators of fibrosis. We validated this platform by identifying a compound that promotes resolution of fibrosis in in\u00a0vivo and ex\u00a0vivo models of ocular and lung fibrosis. ",
        "Commonly Used Insect Repellents Hide Human Odors from Anopheles Mosquitoes. The mode of action for most mosquito repellents is unknown. This is primarily due to the difficulty in monitoring how the mosquito olfactory system responds to repellent odors. Here, we used the Q-system of binary expression to enable activity-dependent Ca2+ imaging in olfactory neurons of the African malaria mosquito Anopheles coluzzii. This system allows neuronal responses to common insect repellents to be directly visualized in living mosquitoes from all olfactory organs, including the antenna. The synthetic repellents N,N-diethyl-meta-toluamide (DEET) and IR3535 did not activate Anopheles odorant receptor co-receptor (Orco)-expressing olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) at any concentration, and picaridin weakly activated ORNs only at high concentrations. In contrast, natural repellents (i.e. lemongrass oil and eugenol) strongly activated small numbers of ORNs in the Anopheles mosquito antennae at low concentrations. We determined that DEET, IR3535, and picaridin decrease the response of Orco-expressing ORNs when these repellents are physically mixed with activating human-derived odorants. We present evidence that synthetic repellents may primarily exert their olfactory mode of action by decreasing the amount of volatile odorants reaching ORNs. These results suggest that synthetic repellents disruptively change the chemical profile of host scent signatures on the skin surface, rendering humans invisible to Anopheles mosquitoes. ",
        "Engineering geometrical 3-dimensional untethered in vitro neural tissue mimic. Formation of tissue models in 3 dimensions is more effective in recapitulating structure and function compared to their 2-dimensional (2D) counterparts. Formation of 3D engineered tissue to control shape and size can have important implications in biomedical research and in engineering applications such as biological soft robotics. While neural spheroids routinely are created during differentiation processes, further geometric control of in vitro neural models has not been demonstrated. Here, we present an approach to form functional in vitro neural tissue mimic (NTM) of different shapes using stem cells, a fibrin matrix, and 3D printed molds. We used murine-derived embryonic stem cells for optimizing cell-seeding protocols, characterization of the resulting internal structure of the construct, and remodeling of the extracellular matrix, as well as validation of electrophysiological activity. Then, we used these findings to biofabricate these constructs using neurons derived from human embryonic stem cells. This method can provide a large degree of design flexibility for development of in vitro functional neural tissue models of varying forms for therapeutic biomedical research, drug discovery, and disease modeling, and engineering applications.

        "The Efficacy of a Resilience Intervention Among Diverse, At-Risk, College Athletes: A Mixed-Methods Study. BACKGROUND: Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) have been associated with psychological and physiological disease, and risky health behaviors. A person's ability to be resilient may protect them from these negative health outcomes, as resilience has been associated with increased emotional awareness, coping, belonging, and greater likelihood of good health and well-being. AIMS: The purpose of this pilot study was to assess the efficacy of a strengths-based resilience intervention to improve access to internal and external resources that effect perceptions of stress, resilience, emotional awareness, and belonging among student-athletes. METHOD: A mixed-methods design was used to examine variables of interest between intervention and control groups. A sample of 56 college athletes completed surveys and engaged in expressive writing during a 5-week resilience intervention. RESULTS: Self-report data indicated that student-athletes in the intervention group improved decision making, lowered perceived stress, and increased resilience compared with controls. Of note, participants with ACEs showed greater increments of positive change in emotional awareness scales than participants without ACEs. Descriptions of emotion management, authentic connections, and increased ability to request support from others were identified in the qualitative data. CONCLUSIONS: A strengths-based course designed to increase resilience-offered as academic and athletic stress is mounting-provided a unique opportunity to promote student-athlete success. Participants gained skills key to victory on and off the field, including health-promoting behaviors, a sense of belonging, persistence, and the ability to negotiate external resources. ",
        "Increased Serotonin Transporter Expression in Huntington's Disease Patients Is Not Consistently Replicated in Murine Models. BACKGROUND: Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) target the serotonin transporter (SERT) and are commonly prescribed for depression in Huntington's disease (HD) patients. However, SERT expression in HD has not been carefully evaluated in patients or mouse models. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we investigated SERT levels in HD patients and HD mouse models. METHODS: We obtained HD patient brain striatal samples and matched controls, as well as brain tissue from CAG140 and R6/2 mice. SERT mRNA and protein levels were analyzed using quantitative RT-PCR and immunoblotting. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: We found that SERT protein, but not mRNA is markedly increased in grade 4 HD patient striatal tissue. These findings suggest posttranscriptional or translational SERT dysregulation as a possible etiologic factor modulating psychopathology in HD. Interestingly, SERT expression is variable in mouse models of the disease. Increased SERT levels are demonstrated in the brain of CAG140 mice, a full-length knock-in mouse model of the disease, but not in the striatum of the R6/2 fragment murine model of the disease. Based on this parameter, the CAG140 huntingtin knock-in mouse model is more suitable than the R6/2 model for the study of serotonergic pathway pathology in Huntington's disease. ",
        "Hypothalamus-hippocampus circuitry regulates impulsivity via melanin-concentrating hormone. Behavioral impulsivity is common in various psychiatric and metabolic disorders. Here we identify a hypothalamus to telencephalon neural pathway for regulating impulsivity involving communication from melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH)-expressing lateral hypothalamic neurons to the ventral hippocampus subregion (vHP). Results show that both site-specific upregulation (pharmacological or chemogenetic) and chronic downregulation (RNA interference) of MCH communication to the vHP increases impulsive responding in rats, indicating that perturbing this system in either direction elevates impulsivity. Furthermore, these effects are not secondary to either impaired timing accuracy, altered activity, or increased food motivation, consistent with a specific role for vHP MCH signaling in the regulation of impulse control. Results from additional functional connectivity and neural pathway tracing analyses implicate the nucleus accumbens as a putative downstream target of vHP MCH1 receptor-expressing neurons. Collectively, these data reveal a specific neural circuit that regulates impulsivity and provide evidence of a novel function for MCH on behavior. ",
        "Gamma Entrainment: Impact on Neurocircuits, Glia, and Therapeutic Opportunities. Studies have shown that gamma oscillations (30-100\u00a0Hz) are relevant for neurocircuit function, behavior, and memory. To examine a possible causal contribution of gamma oscillations to cognitive function, recent studies have employed various types of brain stimulation to induce gamma oscillations. Techniques such as optogenetics or sensory stimulation appear to engage canonical neurocircuits that encompass excitatory and inhibitory interneurons, similarly to those driven by sensory experience, to induce gamma entrainment. Sensory evoked gamma entrainment improves cognitive function in mouse models. Oscillations have traditionally been studied at the neurophysiological level; however, sensory evoked gamma entrainment is able to induce gene expression changes in multiple cell types including neurons and microglia. Furthermore, evidence suggests that chronic gamma entrainment offers neuroprotective effects. ",
        "Stathmin levels alter PTPN14 expression and impact neuroblastoma cell migration. BACKGROUND: Stathmin mediates cell migration and invasion in vitro, and metastasis in vivo. To investigate stathmin's role on the metastatic process, we performed integrated mRNA-miRNA expression analysis to identify pathways regulated by stathmin. METHODS: MiRNA and gene arrays followed by miRNA-target-gene integration were performed on stathmin-depleted neuroblastoma cells (CtrlshRNA vs. Stmn Seq2shRNA). The expression of the predicted target PTPN14 was evaluated by RT-qPCR, western blot and immunohistochemistry. Gene-silencing technology was used to assess the role of PTPN14 on proliferation, migration, invasion and signalling pathway. RESULTS: Stathmin levels modulated the expression of genes and miRNA in neuroblastoma cells, leading to a deregulation of migration and invasion pathways. Consistent with gene array data, PTPN14 mRNA and protein expression were downregulated in stathmin- depleted neuroblastoma cells and xenografts. In two independent neuroblastoma cells, suppression of PTPN14 expression led to an increase in cell migration and invasion. PTPN14 and stathmin expression did not act in a feedback regulatory loop in PTPN14- depleted cells, suggesting a complex interplay of signalling pathways. The effect of PTPN14 on YAP pathway activation was cell-type dependent. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate that stathmin levels can regulate PTPN14 expression, which can modulate neuroblastoma cell migration and invasion. ",
        "Video Discharge Instructions for Acute Otitis Media in Children: A Randomized Controlled Open-label Trial. BACKGROUND: Thirty percent of children with acute otitis media (AOM) experience symptoms\u00a0<\u00a07 days after initiating treatment, highlighting the importance of comprehensive discharge instructions. METHODS: We randomized caregivers of children 6 months to 17 years presenting to the emergency department (ED) with AOM to discharge instructions using a video on management of pain and fever to a paper handout. The primary outcome was the AOM Severity of Symptom (AOM-SOS) score at 72 hours postdischarge. Secondary outcomes included caregiver knowledge (10-item survey), absenteeism, recidivism, and satisfaction (5-item Likert scale). RESULTS: A total of 219 caregivers were randomized and 149 completed the 72-hour follow-up (72 paper and 77 video). The median (IQR) AOM-SOS score for the video was significantly lower than paper, even after adjusting for preintervention AOM-SOS score and medication at home (8 [7-11] vs. 10 [7-13], respectively; p\u00a0=\u00a00.004). There were no significant differences between video and paper in mean (\u00b1SD) knowledge score (9.2 [\u00b11.3] vs. 8.8 [\u00b11.8], respectively; p\u00a0=\u00a00.07), mean (\u00b1SD) number of children that returned to a health care provider (8/77 vs. 10/72, respectively; p\u00a0=\u00a00.49), mean (\u00b1SD) number of daycare/school days missed by child (1.2 [\u00b11.5] vs. 1.1 [\u00b12.1], respectively; p\u00a0=\u00a00.62), mean (\u00b1SD) number of workdays missed by caregiver (0.5 [\u00b11] vs. 0.8 [\u00b12], respectively; p\u00a0=\u00a00.05), or median (IQR) satisfaction score (5 [4-5] vs. 5 [4-5], respectively; p\u00a0=\u00a00.3). CONCLUSIONS: Video discharge instructions in the ED are associated with less perceived AOM symptomatology compared to a paper handout. ",
        "Diet patterns and the incidence of age-related macular degeneration in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study. BACKGROUND: Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of irreversible vision loss among the elderly. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to determine the association between dietary patterns and food groups (used to make them) with the 18-year incidence of AMD. METHODS: ARIC (Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities) participants who showed change in AMD lesions between retinal photographs taken at visit 3 and visit 5 were graded side by side to determine incident AMD (any=144; early=117; late=27). A 66-line item food frequency questionnaire, administered at visit 1 and visit 3, was used to identify 29 food groups. Principal component analysis was used to derive dietary patterns from average food group servings. Logistic regression was used to estimate ORs and 95% CIs for incident AMD (any, early and late) by tertiles of dietary pattern scores, adjusted for age, race, education, total calories and smoking status. P-trend was estimated using continuous scores. RESULTS: Western (unhealthy) and Prudent (healthy) dietary patterns were identified. No significant associations were observed between either dietary pattern and incident any or incident early AMD. However, a threefold higher incidence of late AMD was observed among participants with a Western pattern score above, as compared with below, the median (OR=3.44 (95% CI 1.33 to 8.87), p-trend=0.014). The risk of developing late AMD was decreased, but not statistically significant, among participants with a Prudent pattern score above, as compared with below, the median (OR=0.51 (95% CI 0.22 to 1.18), p-trend=0.054). CONCLUSIONS: Diet patterns were not significantly associated with incident any or incident early AMD. However, consumption of a Western pattern diet may be a risk factor for development of late AMD.

        "Tucatinib, Trastuzumab, and Capecitabine for HER2-Positive Metastatic Breast Cancer. BACKGROUND: Patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive metastatic breast cancer who have disease progression after therapy with multiple HER2-targeted agents have limited treatment options. Tucatinib is an investigational, oral, highly selective inhibitor of the HER2 tyrosine kinase. METHODS: We randomly assigned patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer previously treated with trastuzumab, pertuzumab, and trastuzumab emtansine, who had or did not have brain metastases, to receive either tucatinib or placebo, in combination with trastuzumab and capecitabine. The primary end point was progression-free survival among the first 480 patients who underwent randomization. Secondary end points, assessed in the total population (612 patients), included overall survival, progression-free survival among patients with brain metastases, confirmed objective response rate, and safety. RESULTS: Progression-free survival at 1 year was 33.1% in the tucatinib-combination group and 12.3% in the placebo-combination group (hazard ratio for disease progression or death, 0.54; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.42 to 0.71; P<0.001), and the median duration of progression-free survival was 7.8 months and 5.6 months, respectively. Overall survival at 2 years was 44.9% in the tucatinib-combination group and 26.6% in the placebo-combination group (hazard ratio for death, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.50 to 0.88; P\u2009=\u20090.005), and the median overall survival was 21.9 months and 17.4 months, respectively. Among the patients with brain metastases, progression-free survival at 1 year was 24.9% in the tucatinib-combination group and 0% in the placebo-combination group (hazard ratio, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.34 to 0.69; P<0.001), and the median progression-free survival was 7.6 months and 5.4 months, respectively. Common adverse events in the tucatinib group included diarrhea, palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome, nausea, fatigue, and vomiting. Diarrhea and elevated aminotransferase levels of grade 3 or higher were more common in the tucatinib-combination group than in the placebo-combination group. CONCLUSIONS: In heavily pretreated patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer, including those with brain metastases, adding tucatinib to trastuzumab and capecitabine resulted in better progression-free survival and overall survival outcomes than adding placebo; the risks of diarrhea and elevated aminotransferase levels were higher with tucatinib.

        "Rigid-bar loading on pregnant uterus and development of pregnant abdominal response corridor based on finite element biomechanical model. During pregnancy, traumas can threaten maternal and fetal health. Various trauma effects on a pregnant uterus are little investigated. In the present study, a finite element model of a uterus along with a fetus, placenta, amniotic fluid, and two most effective ligament sets is developed. This model allows numerical evaluation of various loading on a pregnant uterus. The model geometry is developed based on CT-scan data and validated using anthropometric data. Applying Ogden hyper-elastic theory, material properties of uterine wall and placenta are developed. After simulating the \"rigid-bar\" abdominal loading, the impact force and abdominal penetration are investigated. Findings are compared with the experimental abdominal response corridor, previously developed for a nonpregnant abdomen. \"Response corridor\" denotes a bounded envelope in response space, within which the system responses usually lie. Results show that at low abdominal penetrations (less than 45 mm), the pregnant abdomen response is highly compatible with the nonpregnant case. While, at large penetrations, the pregnant abdomen demonstrates stiffer behavior. The reason must be the existence of a fetus in the model. This reveals that the existing response corridors would not be reliable to be extended for a pregnant abdomen. Hence, response corridor development for a pregnant abdomen is a crucial task. In this study, a new fixed-back rigid-bar loading response corridor is proposed for a pregnant abdomen using the load-penetration behavior of the developed model. This model and response corridor can help to study the pregnant uterus response to environmental loading and investigate the injury risk to the uterus and fetus. ",
        "Predicting the Impact of Transforming the Medicaid Program on Health Centers' Revenues and Capacity to Serve Medically Underserved Communities. Policy Points Recent federal proposals to use block grants or per capita caps to fund Medicaid would likely lead to cuts in Medicaid funding for health centers, which are an important source of care for Medicaid enrollees. Recent Medicaid \u00a71115 waivers are seeking to change state-level enrollment and eligibility requirements in ways that are expected to adversely affect health center revenues. Proposed Medicaid funding cuts are expected to lead to reductions in service capacity across all health centers over the long term. State policymakers should understand the likely impacts of proposed Medicaid program changes on health centers in their states and allocate funding to help offset lost federal financing. In 2017, Congress considered implementing block grants or per capita caps to significantly reduce federal financing of the Medicaid program. Medicaid plays a key role in supporting health centers in their provision of care to patients with Medicaid coverage. Consequently, changes to the program could have serious implications for health centers and their ability to fulfill their mission. We used a mixed-methods approach to (a) test a model simulating the effect of block grants and per capita caps on health centers' total revenues and general service capacity, and (b) augment model assumptions by using information collected from official Medicaid documents and interviews with health center leadership staff. Data came from the Uniform Data Systems (UDS), state- and county-level population projections, structured analyses of waiver documents, and interviews with health center leaders in seven states with approved or pending Medicaid \u00a71115 waivers. By 2024, in states where Medicaid coverage was expanded under the Affordable Care Act, block grant funding for Medicaid would decrease total health center revenues for the expansion population by 92%, and by 58% for traditional enrollees. In nonexpansion states, block grants would decrease health center revenues for traditional Medicaid enrollees by 38%. In expansion states, a per capita cap would, by 2024, decrease health center revenues for the expansion population by 78%, and for traditional Medicaid enrollees by 3%. The per capita cap would reduce health center revenues for traditional Medicaid enrollees in nonexpansion states by 2%. Eliminating the Medicaid expansion population would not fully compensate for health center revenue deficits in expansion states. Health center executives in all sample states expressed significant uncertainty around federal plans to reduce Medicaid funding as well as the financial implications of \u00a71115 waiver requirements. Many interviewees anticipate cutting back on services and/or staff as a result. Both block grants and per capita caps would have a detrimental effect on health centers. Although health center leaders anticipate a reduction in services and/or staff, the uncertainty around federal and state proposals hinders health centers from making concrete strategic plans. States should prioritize communicating changes to health centers in a timely manner and be prepared to set aside dedicated funding to address anticipated shortfalls. ",
        "Parent-of-origin differences in DNA methylation of X chromosome genes in T lymphocytes. Many autoimmune diseases are more frequent in females than in males in humans and their mouse models, and sex differences in immune responses have been shown. Despite extensive studies of sex hormones, mechanisms underlying these sex differences remain unclear. Here, we focused on sex chromosomes using the \"four core genotypes\" model in C57BL/6 mice and discovered that the transcriptomes of both autoantigen and anti-CD3/CD28 stimulated CD4+ T lymphocytes showed higher expression of a cluster of 5 X genes when derived from XY as compared to XX mice. We next determined if higher expression of an X gene in XY compared to XX could be due to parent-of-origin differences in DNA methylation of the X chromosome. We found a global increase in DNA methylation on the X chromosome of paternal as compared to maternal origin. Since DNA methylation usually suppresses gene expression, this result was consistent with higher expression of X genes in XY cells because XY cells always express from the maternal X chromosome. In addition, gene expression analysis of F1 hybrid mice from CAST \u00d7 FVB reciprocal crosses showed preferential gene expression from the maternal X compared to paternal X chromosome, revealing that these parent-of-origin effects are not strain-specific. SJL mice also showed a parent-of-origin effect on DNA methylation and X gene expression; however, which X genes were affected differed from those in C57BL/6. Together, this demonstrates how parent-of-origin differences in DNA methylation of the X chromosome can lead to sex differences in gene expression during immune responses. ",
        "Use of anastrozole for breast cancer prevention (IBIS-II): long-term results of a randomised controlled trial. BACKGROUND: Two large clinical trials have shown a reduced rate of breast cancer development in high-risk women in the initial 5 years of follow-up after use of aromatase inhibitors (MAP.3 and International Breast Cancer Intervention Study II [IBIS-II]). Here, we report blinded long-term follow-up results for the IBIS-II trial, which compared anastrozole with placebo, with the objective of determining the efficacy of anastrozole for preventing breast cancer (both invasive and ductal carcinoma in situ) in the post-treatment period. METHODS: IBIS-II is an international, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Postmenopausal women at increased risk of developing breast cancer were recruited and were randomly assigned (1:1) to either anastrozole (1 mg per day, oral) or matching placebo daily for 5 years. After treatment completion, women were followed on a yearly basis to collect data on breast cancer incidence, death, other cancers, and major adverse events (cardiovascular events and fractures). The primary outcome was all breast cancer. FINDINGS: 3864 women were recruited between Feb 2, 2003, and Jan 31, 2012. 1920 women were randomly assigned to 5 years anastrozole and 1944 to placebo. After a median follow-up of 131 months (IQR 105-156), a 49% reduction in breast cancer was observed for anastrozole (85 vs 165 cases, hazard ratio [HR] 0\u00b751, 95% CI 0\u00b739-0\u00b766, p<0\u00b70001). The reduction was larger in the first 5 years (35 vs 89, 0\u00b739, 0\u00b727-0\u00b758, p<0\u00b70001), but still significant after 5 years (50 vs 76 new cases, 0\u00b764, 0\u00b745-0\u00b791, p=0\u00b7014), and not significantly different from the first 5 years (p=0\u00b7087). Invasive oestrogen receptor-positive breast cancer was reduced by 54% (HR 0\u00b746, 95% CI 0\u00b733-0\u00b765, p<0\u00b70001), with a continued significant effect in the period after treatment. A 59% reduction in ductal carcinoma in situ was observed (0\u00b741, 0\u00b722-0\u00b779, p=0\u00b70081), especially in participants known to be oestrogen receptor-positive (0\u00b722, 0\u00b778-0\u00b765, p<0\u00b70001). No significant difference in deaths was observed overall (69 vs 70, HR 0\u00b796, 95% CI 0\u00b769-1\u00b734, p=0\u00b782) or for breast cancer (two anastrozole vs three placebo). A significant decrease in non-breast cancers was observed for anastrozole (147 vs 200, odds ratio 0\u00b772, 95% CI 0\u00b757-0\u00b791, p=0\u00b70042), owing primarily to non-melanoma skin cancer. No excess of fractures or cardiovascular disease was observed. INTERPRETATION: This analysis has identified a significant continuing reduction in breast cancer with anastrozole in the post-treatment follow-up period, with no evidence of new late side-effects. Further follow-up is needed to assess the effect on breast cancer mortality.

        "Computerised cognitive-behavioural therapy for depression in adolescents: 12-month outcomes of a UK randomised controlled trial pilot study. BACKGROUND: Computerised cognitive-behavioural therapy (CCBT) in the care pathway has the potential to improve access to psychological therapies and reduce waiting lists within Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services, however, more randomised controlled trials (RCTs) are needed to assess this. AIMS: This single-centre RCT pilot study compared a CCBT program (Stressbusters) with an attention control (self-help websites) for adolescent depression at referral to evaluate the clinical and cost-effectiveness of CCBT (trial registration: ISRCTN31219579). METHOD: The trial ran within community and clinical settings. Adolescents (aged 12-18) presenting to their primary mental health worker service for low mood/depression support were assessed for eligibility at their initial appointment, 139 met inclusion criteria (a 33-item Mood and Feelings Questionnaire score of \u226520) and were randomised to Stressbusters (n = 70) or self-help websites (n = 69) using remote computerised single allocation. Participants completed mood, quality of life (QoL) and resource-use measures at intervention completion, and 4 and 12 months post-intervention. Changes in self-reported measures and completion rates were assessed by group. RESULTS: There was no significant difference between CCBT and the website group at 12 months. Both showed improvements on all measures. QoL measures in the intervention group showed earlier improvement compared with the website group. Costs were lower in the intervention group but the difference was not statistically significant. The cost-effectiveness analysis found just over a 65% chance of Stressbusters being cost-effective compared with websites. The 4-month follow-up results from the initial feasibility study are reported separately. CONCLUSIONS: CCBT and self-help websites may both have a place in the care pathway for adolescents with depression. ",
        "Life on holidays: study protocol for a 3-year longitudinal study tracking changes in children's fitness and fatness during the in-school versus summer holiday period. BACKGROUND: Emerging evidence suggests that children become fatter and less fit over the summer holidays but get leaner and fitter during the in-school period. This could be due to differences in diet and time use between these distinct periods. Few studies have tracked diet and time use across the summer holidays. This study will measure rates of change in fatness and fitness of children, initially in Grade 4 (age 9\u2009years) across three successive years and relate these changes to changes in diet and time use between in-school and summer holiday periods. METHODS: Grade 4 Children attending Australian Government, Catholic and Independent schools in the Adelaide metropolitan area will be invited to participate, with the aim of recruiting 300 students in total. Diet will be reported by parents using the Automated Self-Administered 24-h Dietary Assessment Tool. Time use will be measured using 24-h wrist-worn accelerometry (GENEActiv) and self-reported by children using the Multimedia Activity Recall for Children and Adults (e.g. chores, reading, sport). Measurement of diet and time use will occur at the beginning (Term 1) and end (Term 4) of each school year and during the summer holiday period. Fitness (20-m shuttle run and standing broad jump) and fatness (body mass index z-score, waist circumference, %body fat) will be measured at the beginning and end of each school year. Differences in rates of change in fitness and fatness during in-school and summer holiday periods will be calculated using model parameter estimate contrasts from linear mixed effects model. Model parameter estimate contrasts will be used to calculate differences in rates of change in outcomes by socioeconomic position (SEP), sex and weight status. Differences in rates of change of outcomes will be regressed against differences between in-school and summer holiday period diet and time use, using compositional data analysis. Analyses will adjust for age, sex, SEP, parenting style, weight status, and pubertal status, where appropriate. DISCUSSION: Findings from this project may inform new, potent avenues for intervention efforts aimed at addressing childhood fitness and fatness. Interventions focused on the home environment, or alternatively extension of the school environment may be warranted.

        "Epigenetic stabilization of DC and DC precursor classical activation by TNF\u03b1 contributes to protective T cell polarization. Epigenetic modifications play critical roles in inducing long-lasting immunological memory in innate immune cells, termed trained immunity. Whether similar epigenetic mechanisms regulate dendtritic cell (DC) function to orchestrate development of adaptive immunity remains unknown. We report that DCs matured with IFN\u03b3 and TNF\u03b1 or matured in the lungs during invasive fungal infection with endogenous TNF\u03b1 acquired a stable TNF\u03b1-dependent DC1 program, rendering them resistant to both antigen- and cytokine-induced alternative activation. TNF\u03b1-programmed DC1 had increased association of H3K4me3 with DC1 gene promoter regions. Furthermore, MLL1 inhibition blocked TNF\u03b1-mediated DC1 phenotype stabilization. During IFI, TNF\u03b1-programmed DC1s were required for the development of sustained TH1/TH17 protective immunity, and bone marrow pre-DCs exhibited TNF\u03b1-dependent preprogramming, supporting continuous generation of programmed DC1 throughout the infection. TNF\u03b1 signaling, associated with epigenetic activation of DC1 genes particularly via H3K4me3, critically contributes to generation and sustenance of type 1/17 adaptive immunity and the immune protection against persistent infection.

        "2019 Endocrine Society Measures Set for Older Adults With Type 2 Diabetes Who Are at Risk for Hypoglycemia. CONTEXT: Hypoglycemia in the outpatient setting has a significant financial impact on the health care system and negative impact on a person's quality of life. Primary care physicians must address a multitude of issues in a visit with a person with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), often leaving little time to ask about hypoglycemia. OBJECTIVE: To develop quality measures that focus on outpatient hypoglycemia episodes for patients 65 and older with T2DM, which facilitate a clinician's ability to identify opportunities to improve the quality of care and reduce hypoglycemic episodes. PARTICIPANTS AND PROCESS: A technical expert panel established by the Endocrine Society in March 2019, which includes endocrinologists, primary care physicians, a diabetes care and education specialist/pharmacist, and a patient, developed 3 outpatient hypoglycemia quality measures. The measure set is intended to improve quality of care for patients with T2DM who are at greatest risk for hypoglycemia. The measures were available for public comment in July 2019. A fourth measure on shared decision-making was removed from the final measure set based on public feedback. CONCLUSION: A lack of outpatient hypoglycemia measures focusing on older adults with T2DM is a barrier to improving care of people with diabetes and reducing hypoglycemic episodes. This paper provides measure specifications for 3 measures that may be used to focus quality improvement efforts on patients at greatest risk for hypoglycemia. ",
        "Herpesviral lytic gene functions render the viral genome susceptible to novel editing by CRISPR/Cas9. Herpes simplex virus (HSV) establishes lifelong latent infection and can cause serious human disease, but current antiviral therapies target lytic but not latent infection. We screened for sgRNAs that cleave HSV-1 DNA sequences efficiently in vitro and used these sgRNAs to observe the first editing of quiescent HSV-1 DNA. The sgRNAs targeted lytic replicating viral DNA genomes more efficiently than quiescent genomes, consistent with the open structure of lytic chromatin. Editing of latent genomes caused short indels while editing of replicating genomes produced indels, linear molecules, and large genomic sequence loss around the gRNA target site. The HSV ICP0 protein and viral DNA replication increased the loss of DNA sequences around the gRNA target site. We conclude that HSV, by promoting open chromatin needed for viral gene expression and by inhibiting the DNA damage response, makes the genome vulnerable to a novel form of editing by CRISPR-Cas9 during lytic replication.

        "Molecular Nanomachines Disrupt Bacterial Cell Wall, Increasing Sensitivity of Extensively Drug-Resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae to Meropenem. Multidrug resistance in pathogenic bacteria is an increasing problem in patient care and public health. Molecular nanomachines (MNMs) have the ability to open cell membranes using nanomechanical action. We hypothesized that MNMs could be used as antibacterial agents by drilling into bacterial cell walls and increasing susceptibility of drug-resistant bacteria to recently ineffective antibiotics. We exposed extensively drug-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae to light-activated MNMs and found that MNMs increase the susceptibility to Meropenem. MNMs with Meropenem can effectively kill K. pneumoniae that are considered Meropenem-resistant. We examined the mechanisms of MNM action using permeability assays and transmission electron microscopy, finding that MNMs disrupt the cell wall of extensively drug-resistant K. pneumoniae, exposing the bacteria to Meropenem. These observations suggest that MNMs could be used to make conventional antibiotics more efficacious against multi-drug-resistant pathogens. ",
        "Enantiomeric glycosylated cationic block co-beta-peptides eradicate Staphylococcus aureus biofilms and antibiotic-tolerant persisters. The treatment of bacterial infections is hindered by the presence of biofilms and metabolically inactive persisters. Here, we report the synthesis of an enantiomeric block co-beta-peptide, poly(amido-D-glucose)-block-poly(beta-L-lysine), with high yield and purity by one-shot one-pot anionic-ring opening (co)polymerization. The co-beta-peptide is bactericidal against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), including replicating, biofilm and persister bacterial cells, and also disperses biofilm biomass. It is active towards community-acquired and hospital-associated MRSA strains which are resistant to multiple drugs including vancomycin and daptomycin. Its antibacterial activity is superior to that of vancomycin in MRSA mouse and human ex vivo skin infection models, with no acute in vivo toxicity in repeated dosing in mice at above therapeutic levels. The copolymer displays bacteria-activated surfactant-like properties, resulting from contact with the bacterial envelope. Our results indicate that this class of non-toxic molecule, effective against different bacterial sub-populations, has promising potential for the treatment of S. aureus infections. ",
        "What are the Benefits and Risks Associated with Changing Foot Strike Pattern During Running? A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of Injury, Running Economy, and Biomechanics. BACKGROUND: Running participation continues to increase. The ideal strike pattern during running is a controversial topic. Many coaches and therapists promote non-rearfoot strike (NRFS) running with a belief that it can treat and prevent injury, and improve running economy. OBJECTIVE: The aims of this review were to synthesise the evidence comparing NRFS with rearfoot strike (RFS) running patterns in relation to injury and running economy (primary aim), and biomechanics (secondary aim). DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis. Consideration was given to within participant, between participant, retrospective, and prospective study designs. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and SPORTDiscus. RESULTS: Fifty-three studies were included. Limited evidence indicated that NRFS running is retrospectively associated with lower reported rates of mild (standard mean difference (SMD), 95% CI 3.25, 2.37-4.12), moderate (3.65, 2.71-4.59) and severe (0.93, 0.32-1.55) repetitive stress injury. Studies\u00a0prospectively comparing injury risk between strike patterns are lacking. Limited evidence indicated that running economy did not differ between habitual RFS and habitual NRFS runners at slow (10.8-11.0\u00a0km/h), moderate (12.6-13.5\u00a0km/h), and fast (14.0-15.0\u00a0km/h) speeds, and was reduced in the immediate term when an NRFS-running pattern was imposed on habitual RFS runners at slow (10.8\u00a0km/h; SMD\u2009=\u2009-\u20091.67, -\u20092.82 to - 0.52) and moderate (12.6\u00a0km/h; -\u20091.26, -\u20092.42 to -\u20090.10) speeds. Key biomechanical findings, consistently including both comparison between habitual strike patterns and following immediate transition from RFS to NRFS running, indicated that NRFS running was associated with lower average and peak vertical loading rate (limited-moderate evidence; SMDs\u2009=\u20090.72-2.15); lower knee flexion range of motion (moderate-strong evidence; SMDs\u2009=\u20090.76-0.88); reduced patellofemoral joint stress (limited evidence; SMDs\u2009=\u20090.63-0.68); and greater peak internal ankle plantar flexor moment (limited evidence; SMDs\u2009=\u20090.73-1.33). CONCLUSION: The relationship between strike pattern and injury risk could not be determined, as current evidence is limited to retrospective findings. Considering the lack of evidence to support any improvements in running economy, combined with the associated shift in loading profile (i.e., greater ankle and plantarflexor loading) found in this review, changing strike pattern cannot be recommended for an uninjured RFS runner.

        "Neural correlates of individual differences in affective benefit of real-life urban green space exposure. Psychiatric morbidity is high in cities, so identifying potential modifiable urban protective factors is important. We show that exposure to urban green space improves well-being in naturally behaving male and female city dwellers, particularly in districts with higher psychiatric incidence and fewer green resources. Higher green-related affective benefit was related to lower prefrontal activity during negative-emotion processing, which suggests that urban green space exposure may compensate for reduced neural regulatory capacity.

        "Nurses' sleep, work hours, and patient care quality, and safety. OBJECTIVES: To describe sleep duration and work characteristics among registered nurses (\"nurses\") across health care settings and unit types and determine the association between sleep duration and quality of care and patient safety. DESIGN: We used an observational, retrospective design. Survey data were collected from two cohorts of nurses in 2015 and\u00a02016. SETTING: Health care and community settings across the United States, primarily acute care hospitals. PARTICIPANTS: Nurses working in a staff or general duty position (N=1,568). MEASUREMENTS: The independent variable was nurses' sleep duration before work and nonwork days. The two dependent variables were nurse reported quality of care (single item rating) and overall patient safety, measured by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) Hospital Survey on Patient Safety Culture. RESULTS: Nurses reported an average of 414 minutes, or just less than 7 hours, of sleep before a work day and 497 minutes, or just over 8 hours, before a nonwork day. Short sleep duration was statistically significantly associated with lower ratings of quality of care (p=.002) and patient safety (p=.000). CONCLUSIONS: Nurses are sleeping, on average, less than recommended amounts before work, which may be impacting their health and performance on the job. Health care managers may consider interventions to support nurses' sleep to improve patient care. Further research is warranted. ",
        "Mevalonate Pathway Provides Ubiquinone to Maintain Pyrimidine Synthesis and Survival in p53-Deficient Cancer Cells Exposed to Metabolic Stress. Oncogene activation and loss of tumor suppressor function changes the metabolic activity of cancer cells to drive unrestricted proliferation. Moreover, cancer cells adapt their metabolism to sustain growth and survival when access to oxygen and nutrients is restricted, such as in poorly vascularized tumor areas. We show here that p53-deficient colon cancer cells exposed to tumor-like metabolic stress in spheroid culture activated the mevalonate pathway to promote the synthesis of ubiquinone. This was essential to maintain mitochondrial electron transport for respiration and pyrimidine synthesis in metabolically compromised environments. Induction of mevalonate pathway enzyme expression in the absence of p53 was mediated by accumulation and stabilization of mature SREBP2. Mevalonate pathway inhibition by statins blocked pyrimidine nucleotide biosynthesis and induced oxidative stress and apoptosis in p53-deficient cancer cells in spheroid culture. Moreover, ubiquinone produced by the mevalonate pathway was essential for the growth of p53-deficient tumor organoids. In contrast, inhibition of intestinal hyperproliferation by statins in an Apc/KrasG12D-mutant mouse model was independent of de novo pyrimidine synthesis. Our results highlight the importance of the mevalonate pathway for maintaining mitochondrial electron transfer and biosynthetic activity in cancer cells exposed to metabolic stress. They also demonstrate that the metabolic output of this pathway depends on both genetic and environmental context. SIGNIFICANCE: These findings suggest that p53-deficient cancer cells activate the mevalonate pathway via SREBP2 and promote the synthesis of ubiquinone that plays an essential role in reducing oxidative stress and supports the synthesis of pyrimidine nucleotide.

        "Proteome-Wide Survey of Cysteine Oxidation by Using a Norbornene Probe. Rapid detection of cysteine oxidation in living cells is critical in advancing our understanding of responses to reactive oxygen species (ROS) and oxidative stress. Accordingly, there is a need to develop chemical probes that facilitate proteome-wide detection of cysteine's many oxidation states. Herein, we report the first whole-cell proteomics analysis using a norbornene probe to detect the initial product of cysteine oxidation: cysteine sulfenic acid. The oxidised proteins identified in the HeLa cell model represent the first targets of the ROS hydrogen peroxide. The panel of protein hits provides new and important information about the targets of oxidative stress, including 148 new protein members of the sulfenome. These findings provide new leads for the study and understanding of redox signalling and diseases associated with oxidative stress. ",
        "Elucidating the correlations between cancer initiation times and lifetime cancer risks. Cancer is a genetic disease that results from accumulation of unfavorable mutations. As soon as genetic and epigenetic modifications associated with these mutations become strong enough, the uncontrolled tumor cell growth is initiated, eventually spreading through healthy tissues. Clarifying the dynamics of cancer initiation is thus critically important for understanding the molecular mechanisms of tumorigenesis. Here we present a new theoretical method to evaluate the dynamic processes associated with the cancer initiation. It is based on a discrete-state stochastic description of the formation of tumors as a fixation of cancerous mutations in tissues. Using a first-passage analysis the probabilities for the cancer to appear and the times before it happens, which are viewed as fixation probabilities and fixation times, respectively, are explicitly calculated. It is predicted that the slowest cancer initiation dynamics is observed for neutral mutations, while it is fast for both advantageous and, surprisingly, disadvantageous mutations. The method is applied for estimating the cancer initiation times from experimentally available lifetime cancer risks for different types of cancer. It is found that the higher probability of the cancer to occur does not necessary lead to the faster times of starting the cancer. Our theoretical analysis helps to clarify microscopic aspects of cancer initiation processes. ",
        "Manipulations of Central Amygdala Neurotensin Neurons Alter the Consumption of Ethanol and Sweet Fluids in Mice. The central nucleus of the amygdala plays a significant role in alcohol use and other affective disorders; however, the genetically-defined neuronal subtypes and projections that govern these behaviors are not well known. Here we show that neurotensin neurons in the central nucleus of the amygdala of male mice are activated by in vivo ethanol consumption and that genetic ablation of these neurons decreases ethanol consumption and preference in non-ethanol-dependent animals. This ablation did not impact preference for sucrose, saccharin, or quinine. We found that the most robust projection of the central amygdala neurotensin neurons was to the parabrachial nucleus, a brain region known to be important in feeding behaviors, conditioned taste aversion, and alarm. Optogenetic stimulation of projections from these neurons to the parabrachial nucleus is reinforcing, and increases ethanol drinking as well as consumption of sucrose and saccharin solutions. These data suggest that this central amygdala to parabrachial nucleus projection influences the expression of reward-related phenotypes and is a novel circuit promoting consumption of ethanol and palatable fluids.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is a major health burden worldwide. Although ethanol consumption is required for the development of AUD, much remains unknown regarding the underlying neural circuits that govern initial ethanol intake. Here we show that ablation of a population of neurotensin-expressing neurons in the central amygdala decreases intake of and preference for ethanol in non-dependent animals, whereas the projection of these neurons to the parabrachial nucleus promotes consumption of ethanol as well as other palatable fluids.

        "Structural Basis of Poxvirus Transcription: Vaccinia RNA Polymerase Complexes. Poxviruses encode a multisubunit DNA-dependent RNA polymerase (vRNAP) that carries out viral gene expression in the host cytoplasm. We report cryo-EM structures of core and complete vRNAP enzymes from Vaccinia virus at 2.8\u00a0\u00c5 resolution. The vRNAP core enzyme resembles eukaryotic RNA polymerase II (Pol II) but also reveals many virus-specific features, including the transcription factor Rap94. The complete enzyme additionally contains the transcription factor VETF, the mRNA processing factors VTF/CE and NPH-I, the viral core protein E11, and host tRNAGln. This complex can carry out the entire early transcription cycle. The structures show that Rap94 partially resembles the Pol II initiation factor TFIIB, that the vRNAP subunit Rpo30 resembles the Pol II elongation factor TFIIS, and that NPH-I resembles chromatin remodeling enzymes. Together with the accompanying paper (Hillen et\u00a0al., 2019), these results provide the basis for unraveling the mechanisms of poxvirus transcription and RNA processing. ",
        "Maternal vaccination and protective immunity against Zika virus vertical transmission. An important goal of the\u00a0Zika virus (ZIKV) vaccine is to prevent\u00a0a congenital syndrome in fetuses of pregnant women, but studies directly evaluating maternal vaccination for ZIKV are lacking. Here we report maternal vaccination using a live-attenuated ZIKV vaccine (3'UTR-\u220610-LAV) in a pregnant mouse model. Maternal immunization with 3'UTR-\u220610-LAV does not cause any adverse effects on pregnancy, fetal development, or offspring behavior. One maternal immunization fully protects dams against ZIKV infection and in utero transmission. Although neutralizing antibody alone is sufficient to prevent in utero transmission, a higher neutralizing titer is required to protect pregnant mice against in utero transmission than that required to protect non-pregnant mice against viral infection. The immunized dams transfer maternal antibodies to pups, which protect neonates against ZIKV infection. Notably, pregnancy weakens maternal T cell response to 3'UTR-\u220610-LAV vaccination. Our results suggest that, besides vaccinating non-pregnant individuals, 3'UTR-\u220610-LAV may also be considered for maternal vaccination. ",

        "Antibiotic prescribing without documented indication in ambulatory care clinics: national cross sectional study. OBJECTIVES: To identify the frequency with which antibiotics are prescribed in the absence of a documented indication in the ambulatory care setting, to quantify the potential effect on assessments of appropriateness of antibiotics, and to understand patient, provider, and visit level characteristics associated with antibiotic prescribing without a documented indication. DESIGN: Cross sectional study. SETTING: 2015 National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey. PARTICIPANTS: 28\u2009332 sample visits representing 990.9 million ambulatory care visits nationwide. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Overall antibiotic prescribing and whether each antibiotic prescription was accompanied by appropriate, inappropriate, or no documented indication as identified through ICD-9-CM (international classification of diseases, 9th revision, clinical modification) codes. Survey weighted multivariable logistic regression was used to evaluate potential risk factors for receipt of an antibiotic prescription without a documented indication. RESULTS: Antibiotics were prescribed during 13.2% (95% confidence interval 11.6% to 13.7%) of the estimated 990.8 million ambulatory care visits in 2015. According to the criteria, 57% (52% to 62%) of the 130.5 million prescriptions were for appropriate indications, 25% (21% to 29%) were inappropriate, and 18% (15% to 22%) had no documented indication. This corresponds to an estimated 24 million prescriptions without a documented indication. Being an adult male, spending more time with the provider, and seeing a non-primary care specialist were significantly positively associated with antibiotic prescribing without an indication. Sulfonamides and urinary anti-infective agents were the antibiotic classes most likely to be prescribed without documentation. CONCLUSIONS: This nationally representative study of ambulatory visits identified a large number of prescriptions for antibiotics without a documented indication. Antibiotic prescribing in the absence of a documented indication may severely bias national estimates of appropriate antibiotic use in this setting. This study identified a wide range of factors associated with antibiotic prescribing without a documented indication, which may be useful in directing initiatives aimed at supporting better documentation.

        "Metabolic stress is a primary pathogenic event in transgenic Caenorhabditis elegans expressing pan-neuronal human amyloid beta. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disease affecting the elderly worldwide. Mitochondrial dysfunction has been proposed as a key event in the etiology of AD. We have previously modeled amyloid-beta (A\u03b2)-induced mitochondrial dysfunction in a transgenic Caenorhabditis elegans strain by expressing human A\u03b2 peptide specifically in neurons (GRU102). Here, we focus on the deeper metabolic changes associated with this A\u03b2-induced mitochondrial dysfunction. Integrating metabolomics, transcriptomics and computational modeling, we identify alterations in Tricarboxylic Acid (TCA) cycle metabolism following even low-level A\u03b2 expression. In particular, GRU102 showed reduced activity of a rate-limiting TCA cycle enzyme, alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase. These defects were associated with elevation of protein carbonyl content specifically in mitochondria. Importantly, metabolic failure occurred before any significant increase in global protein aggregate was detectable. Treatment with an anti-diabetes drug, Metformin, reversed A\u03b2-induced metabolic defects, reduced protein aggregation and normalized lifespan of GRU102. Our results point to metabolic dysfunction as an early and causative event in A\u03b2-induced pathology and a promising target for intervention. ",
        "Influenza Vaccine Requirements in United States Child Care Centers. BACKGROUND: Influenza vaccine is the most effective means to prevent influenza for the high-risk population of child care attendees. This national survey assessed child care center directors' reports of seasonal influenza vaccine requirements for children and adult caregivers. METHODS: This was a 2016 telephone-based survey of child care center directors randomly selected from a national database of licensed United States child care centers and queried about influenza vaccine requirements. Conceptually related items were grouped into 4 indexes: general infection control, use of health consultants, quality of child care, and pandemic influenza preparedness. These indexes, along with other center and director characteristics, were used to predict director-reported influenza vaccine requirements. RESULTS: Of 518 child care center directors, only 24.5% and 13.1% reported an influenza vaccine requirement for children and adult caregivers, respectively. Center and director characteristics and the indexes were not associated with a director-reported influenza vaccine requirement. After adjusting for covariates, only having a state influenza vaccine law for children and an adult influenza vaccine requirement predicted having a child influenza vaccine requirement. Only having a child influenza vaccine requirement predicted having an adult vaccine requirement. CONCLUSIONS: Director-reported influenza vaccine requirements for children and adult caregivers were influenced primarily by state influenza vaccine laws. Given the high risk of children in child care and low director-reported influenza vaccine requirements, more states should pass laws requiring influenza vaccine for children and adult caregivers at child care programs.

        "The short-term dynamics of posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms during the acute posttrauma period. BACKGROUND: The manner in which posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) develops remains largely unknown. PTSD is comprised of 20 symptoms across 4 clusters. These clusters were hypothesized to reflect a failure of recovery model in which intrusive symptoms appear first. Intrusive symptoms led to avoidance of trauma-related stimuli, which resulted in sustained arousal. The sustained arousal ultimately led to dysphoria. METHODS: This hypothesized symptom progression was evaluated during the acute posttrauma period (the first 30 days postevent). Participants (N\u2009=\u200980) reported their PTSD symptoms for 30 days via mobile devices. Using a short-term dynamic modeling framework, a temporal and contemporaneous model of PTSD symptoms was obtained. RESULTS: In the temporal network, a fear-conditioning component was identified that supported the hypothesized set of relations among symptom clusters. The contemporaneous network was classified by two subnetworks. The first corresponded to a fear-conditioning model that included symptoms of intrusions and avoidance. The second included symptoms of dysphoria and arousal. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that, after a trauma, there may be a fear-conditioning process that involves intrusions, avoidance, and arousal symptoms. Dysphoric symptoms were also present but developed as a partially distinct component. ",
        "Cognitive performance in relation to hydration status and water intake among older adults, NHANES 2011-2014. PURPOSE: Risks of dehydration and cognitive decline increase with advancing age, yet the relation between dehydration, water intake, and cognitive performance among older adults remains understudied. METHODS: Using data from the 2011-2014 cycles of the Nutrition and Health Examination Survey (NHANES), we tested if calculated serum osmolarity (Sosm) and adequate intake (AI) of water among women (n\u2009=\u20091271) and men (n\u2009=\u20091235)\u2009\u2265\u200960\u00a0years old were associated with scores of immediate and delayed recall, verbal fluency, and attention/processing speed. Sosm was categorized as\u2009<\u2009285 (hyperhydrated), 285-289, 290-294, 295-300, or\u2009>\u2009300 (dehydrated) mmol/L. AI of water was defined as\u2009\u2265\u20092\u00a0L/day for women and\u2009\u2265\u20092.5 L/day for men. RESULTS: Women with Sosm between 285 and 289\u00a0mmol/L scored 3.2-5.1 points higher on the Digit Symbol Substitution test (DSST) of attention/processing speed than women in other Sosm categories (P values\u2009<\u20090.05). There was evidence of a curvilinear relationship between DSST scores and Sosm among women and men (P values for quadratic terms\u2009<\u20090.02). Meeting an alternative AI on water intake of\u2009\u2265\u20091\u00a0mL/kcal and\u2009\u2265\u20091500\u00a0mL, but not the sex-specific AI, was associated with scoring one point higher on a verbal fluency test (P\u2009=\u20090.02) and two points higher on the DSST (P\u2009=\u20090.03) among women. Significant negative associations between dehydration or inadequate water intake and test scores were not observed among men. CONCLUSION: Hydration status and water intake were moderately associated with attention/processing speed among females. Future work should consider the effects of both dehydration and overhydration on cognitive function and investigate potential sex differences in cognitive responses to hydration status. ",
        "Towards a fuller assessment of the economic benefits of reducing air pollution from fossil fuel combustion: Per-case monetary estimates for children's health outcomes. BACKGROUND: Impacts on children's health are under-represented in benefits assessments of policies related to ambient air quality and climate change. To complement our previous compilation of concentration-response (C-R) functions for a number of children's health outcomes associated with air pollution, we provide per-case monetary estimates of the same health outcomes. OBJECTIVES: Our goal was to establish per-case monetary estimates for a suite of prevalent children's health outcomes (preterm birth, low birth weight, asthma, autism spectrum disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and IQ reduction) that can be incorporated into benefits assessments of air pollution regulations and climate change mitigation policies. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of the literature published between January 1, 2000 and June 30, 2018 to identify relevant economic costs for these six adverse health outcomes in children. We restricted our literature search to studies published in the U.S., with a supplemental consideration of studies from the U.K. and prioritized literature reviews with summary cost estimates and papers that provided lifetime cost of illness estimates. RESULTS: Our literature search and evaluation process reviewed 1065 papers and identified 12 most relevant papers on per-case monetary estimates for preterm birth, low birth weight, asthma, autism spectrum disorder, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Details are presented in full. We separately identified estimates of the lost lifetime earnings associated with the loss of a single IQ point. The final per-case cost estimates for each outcome were selected based on the most robust evidence. These estimates range from $23,573 for childhood asthma not persisting into adulthood to $3,109,096 for a case of autism with a concurrent intellectual disability. CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this is the first time that the child-specific health outcomes of preterm birth, low birth weight, asthma, autism spectrum disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and IQ reduction have been systematically valued and presented in one place. This is an important addition to the body of health-related valuation literature as these outcomes have substantial economic costs that are not considered in most assessments of the benefits of air pollution and climate mitigation policies. In general, however, the available per-case estimates presented here did not incorporate the broad societal and long-term costs and are likely underestimates. Although our context has been air pollution and climate policies, the per-case monetary estimates presented here can be applied to other environmental exposures. Fuller assessments of health benefits to children and their corresponding economic gains will improve decision-making on environmental policy. ",
        "Endocytosis of very low-density lipoproteins: an unexpected mechanism for lipid acquisition by breast cancer cells. We previously described the expression of CD36 and LPL by breast cancer (BC) cells and tissues and the growth-promoting effect of VLDL observed only in the presence of LPL. We now report a model in which LPL is bound to a heparan sulfate proteoglycan motif on the BC cell surface and acts in concert with the VLDL receptor to internalize VLDLs via receptor-mediated endocytosis. We also demonstrate that gene-expression programs for lipid synthesis versus uptake respond robustly to triglyceride-rich lipoprotein availability. The literature emphasizes de novo FA synthesis and exogenous free FA uptake using CD36 as paramount mechanisms for lipid acquisition by cancer cells. We find that the uptake of intact lipoproteins is also an important mechanism for lipid acquisition and that the relative reliance on lipid synthesis versus uptake varies among BC cell lines and in response to VLDL availability. This metabolic plasticity has important implications for the development of therapies aimed at the lipid dependence of many types of cancer, in that the inhibition of FA synthesis may elicit compensatory upregulation of lipid uptake. Moreover, the mechanism that we have elucidated provides a direct connection between dietary fat and tumor biology.-. ",
        "A genomic predictor of lifespan in vertebrates. Biological ageing and its mechanistic underpinnings are of immense biomedical and ecological significance. Ageing involves the decline of diverse biological functions and places a limit on a species' maximum lifespan. Ageing is associated with epigenetic changes involving DNA methylation. Furthermore, an analysis of mammals showed that the density of CpG sites in gene promoters, which are targets for DNA methylation, is correlated with lifespan. Using 252 whole genomes and databases of animal age and promotor sequences, we show a pattern across vertebrates. We also derive a predictive lifespan clock based on CpG density in a selected set of promoters. The lifespan clock accurately predicts maximum lifespan in vertebrates (R2\u2009=\u20090.76) from the density of CpG sites within only 42 selected promoters. Our lifespan clock provides a wholly new method for accurately estimating lifespan using genome sequences alone and enables estimation of this challenging parameter for both poorly understood and extinct species.

        "Lamb as a potential source of Toxoplasma gondii infection for Australians. OBJECTIVE: Toxoplasmosis may follow consumption of undercooked meat containing Toxoplasma gondii cysts. Lamb is considered to pose the highest risk for contamination across meats. Red meat is often served undercooked, yet there are no current data on T. gondii contamination of Australian sourced and retailed lamb. We sought to address this gap in public health knowledge. METHODS: Lamb mincemeat was purchased at the supermarket counter three times weekly for six months. T. gondii was detected by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of DNA extracted from the meat following homogenisation. Purchases were also tested for common foodborne bacterial pathogens. RESULTS: Conservative interpretation of PCR testing (i.e. parasite DNA detected in three of four tests) gave a probability of 43% (95% confidence interval, 32%-54%) that lamb mincemeat was contaminated with T. gondii. None of the purchases were contaminated with Campylobacter jejuni, Salmonella species or S. enterica serovar Typhimurium, indicating sanitary meat processing. CONCLUSIONS: Australian lamb is commonly contaminated with T. gondii. Future studies should be directed at testing a range of red meats and meat cuts. Implications for public health: Consuming undercooked Australian lamb has potential to result in toxoplasmosis. There may be value in health education around this risk. ",
        "89Zr-Immuno-PET: Toward a Noninvasive Clinical Tool to Measure Target Engagement of Therapeutic Antibodies In Vivo. 89Zr-immuno-PET is a promising noninvasive clinical tool that measures target engagement of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to predict toxicity in normal tissues and efficacy in tumors. Quantification of 89Zr-immuno-PET will need to move beyond SUVs, since total uptake may contain a significant non-target-specific contribution. Nonspecific uptake is reversible (e.g., blood volume) or irreversible (due to 89Zr-residualization after mAb degradation). The aim of this study was to assess nonspecific uptake in normal tissues as a first critical step toward quantification of target engagement in normal tissues and tumors using 89Zr-immuno-PET. Methods: Data from clinical studies with 4 89Zr-labeled intact IgG1 antibodies were collected, resulting in a total of 128 PET scans (1-7 d after injection from 36 patients: 89Zr-obinutuzumab [n = 9], 89Zr-cetuximab [n = 7], 89Zr-huJ591 [n = 10], and 89Zr-trastuzumab [n = 10] [denoted as 89Zr-anti-CD20, 89Zr-anti-EGFR, 89Zr-anti-PSMA and 89Zr-anti-HER2, respectively]). Nonspecific uptake was defined as uptake measured in tissues without known target expression. Patlak graphical evaluation of transfer constants was used to estimate the reversible (V.                         t.                      ) and irreversible (K.                         i.                      ) contributions to the total measured uptake for the kidney, liver, lung, and spleen. Baseline values were calculated per tissue combining all mAbs without target expression (kidney: 89Zr-anti-CD20, 89Zr-anti-EGFR, and 89Zr-anti-HER2; liver: 89Zr-anti-CD20; lung: 89Zr-anti-CD20, 89Zr-anti-EGFR, and 89Zr-anti-PSMA; spleen: 89Zr-anti-EGFR and 89Zr-anti-HER2). Results: For the kidney, liver, lung, and spleen, baseline V.                         t.                      was 0.20, 0.24, 0.09, and 0.24 mL\u22c5cm-3, respectively, and baseline K.                         i.                      was 0.7, 1.1, 0.2 and 0.5 \u03bcL\u22c5g-1\u22c5h-1, respectively. For 89Zr-anti-PSMA, a 4-fold higher K.                         i.                      was observed for the kidney, indicating target engagement. In this case, nonspecific uptake accounted for 66%, 34%, and 22% of the total signal in the kidney at 1, 3, and 7 d after injection, respectively. Conclusion: This study shows that nonspecific uptake of mAbs for tissues without target expression can be quantified using 89Zr-immuno-PET at multiple time points. These results form a crucial base for measurement of target engagement by therapeutic antibodies in vivo with 89Zr-immuno-PET. For future studies, a pilot phase including at least 3 scans at 1 or more days after injection is required to assess nonspecific uptake as a function of time, to optimize study design for detection of target engagement.

        "Are drug targets with genetic support twice as likely to be approved? Revised estimates of the impact of genetic support for drug mechanisms on the probability of drug approval. Despite strong vetting for disease activity, only 10% of candidate new molecular entities in early stage clinical trials are eventually approved. Analyzing historical pipeline data, Nelson et al. 2015 (Nat. Genet.) concluded pipeline drug targets with human genetic evidence of disease association are twice as likely to lead to approved drugs. Taking advantage of recent clinical development advances and rapid growth in GWAS datasets, we extend the original work using updated data, test whether genetic evidence predicts future successes and introduce statistical models adjusting for target and indication-level properties. Our work confirms drugs with genetically supported targets were more likely to be successful in Phases II and III. When causal genes are clear (Mendelian traits and GWAS associations linked to coding variants), we find the use of human genetic evidence increases approval by greater than two-fold, and, for Mendelian associations, the positive association holds prospectively. Our findings suggest investments into genomics and genetics are likely to be beneficial to companies deploying this strategy. ",
        "Primary Care Prescriptions of Potentially Nephrotoxic Medications in Children with CKD. BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Pediatric CKD management focuses on limiting kidney injury, including avoiding nephrotoxic medications. Nephrotoxic medication prescription practices for children with CKD are unknown. Our objective was to determine the prevalence and rates of primary care prescriptions for potentially nephrotoxic medications in children with CKD versus without CKD. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: We conducted a retrospective, matched population-based cohort study of patients aged <18 years, registered at a general practice participating in the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) from 1997 to 2017. Children with a clinical code indicating an incident diagnosis of CKD were matched 1:4 to patients without CKD on CKD diagnosis date, sex, age, CPRD practice, and number of general practitioner visits in the year before cohort entry. We calculated the prevalence and the rate of potentially nephrotoxic medication prescriptions throughout the follow-up period in patients with versus without CKD. Primary analyses included the following medication classes: aminoglycosides, antivirals, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, salicylates, proton pump inhibitors, and immunomodulators. Secondary analyses used an expanded nephrotoxicity definition that also included, among others, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers. Adjusted prescription rates were calculated using multivariable binomial regression. RESULTS: From 1,535,816 eligible patients, we identified 1018 incident CKD and 4072 non-CKD matches (mean age, 9.8 years [range, 1.1-17.9 years]; 52% male; mean follow-up time, 3.3 years). Overall, 26% of patients with and 15% of patients without CKD were prescribed one or more potentially nephrotoxic medication during follow-up. The overall rate of nephrotoxic medication prescriptions was 71 (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 55 to 93) prescriptions per 100 person-years in patients with CKD and eight (95% CI, 7 to 9) prescriptions per 100 person-years in patients without CKD (adjusted rate ratio, 4.1; 95% CI, 2.7 to 6.1). CONCLUSIONS: Potentially nephrotoxic medications are prescribed at high rates to children with CKD. ",
        "Contribution of retrotransposition to developmental disorders. Mobile genetic Elements (MEs) are segments of DNA which can copy themselves and other transcribed sequences through the process of retrotransposition (RT). In humans several disorders have been attributed to RT, but the role of RT in severe developmental disorders (DD) has not yet been explored. Here we identify RT-derived events in 9738 exome sequenced trios with DD-affected probands. We ascertain 9 de novo MEs, 4 of which are likely causative of the patient's symptoms (0.04%), as well as 2 de novo gene retroduplications. Beyond identifying likely diagnostic RT events, we estimate genome-wide germline ME mutation rate and selective constraint and demonstrate that coding RT events have signatures of purifying selection equivalent to those of truncating mutations. Overall, our analysis represents a comprehensive interrogation of the impact of retrotransposition on protein coding genes and a framework for future evolutionary and disease studies. ",
        "Therapeutic Modulation of the Immune Response in Arrhythmogenic Cardiomyopathy. BACKGROUND: Inflammation is a prominent feature of arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy (ACM), but whether it contributes to the disease phenotype is not known. METHODS: To define the role of inflammation in the pathogenesis of ACM, we characterized nuclear factor-\u03baB signaling in ACM models in vitro and in vivo and in cardiac myocytes from patient induced pluripotent stem cells. RESULTS: Activation of nuclear factor-\u03baB signaling, indicated by increased expression and nuclear accumulation of phospho-RelA/p65, occurred in both an in vitro model of ACM (expression of JUP2157del2 in neonatal rat ventricular myocytes) and a robust murine model of ACM (homozygous knock-in of mutant desmoglein-2 [Dsg2mut/mut]) that recapitulates the cardiac manifestations seen in patients with ACM. Bay 11-7082, a small-molecule inhibitor of nuclear factor-\u03baB signaling, prevented the development of ACM disease features in vitro (abnormal redistribution of intercalated disk proteins, myocyte apoptosis, release of inflammatory cytokines) and in vivo (myocardial necrosis and fibrosis, left ventricular contractile dysfunction, electrocardiographic abnormalities). Hearts of Dsg2mut/mut mice expressed markedly increased levels of inflammatory cytokines and chemotactic molecules that were attenuated by Bay 11-7082. Salutary effects of Bay 11-7082 correlated with the extent to which production of selected cytokines had been blocked. Nuclear factor-\u03baB signaling was also activated in cardiac myocytes derived from a patient with ACM. These cells produced and secreted abundant inflammatory cytokines under basal conditions, and this was also greatly reduced by Bay 11-7082. CONCLUSIONS: Inflammatory signaling is activated in ACM and drives key features of the disease. Targeting inflammatory pathways may be an effective new mechanism-based therapy for ACM. ",
        "A systematic capsid evolution approach performed in vivo for the design of AAV vectors with tailored properties and tropism. Adeno-associated virus (AAV) capsid modification enables the generation of recombinant vectors with tailored properties and tropism. Most approaches to date depend on random screening, enrichment, and serendipity. The approach explored here, called BRAVE (barcoded rational AAV vector evolution), enables efficient selection of engineered capsid structures on a large scale using only a single screening round in vivo. The approach stands in contrast to previous methods that require multiple generations of enrichment. With the BRAVE approach, each virus particle displays a peptide, derived from a protein, of known function on the AAV capsid surface, and a unique molecular barcode in the packaged genome. The sequencing of RNA-expressed barcodes from a single-generation in vivo screen allows the mapping of putative binding sequences from hundreds of proteins simultaneously. Using the BRAVE approach and hidden Markov model-based clustering, we present 25 synthetic capsid variants with refined properties, such as retrograde axonal transport in specific subtypes of neurons, as shown for both rodent and human dopaminergic neurons.

        "Rat liver epigenome programing by perinatal exposure to 2,2',4'4'-tetrabromodiphenyl ether. Perinatal exposures to polybrominated diphenyl ethers permanently reprogram liver metabolism and induce a nonalcoholic fatty liver disease-like phenotype and insulin resistance in rodents. Aim: To test if these changes are associated with altered liver epigenome. Materials\u00a0& methods: Expression of small RNA and changes in DNA methylation in livers of adult rats were analyzed following perinatal exposure to 2,2',4,4'-tetrabromodiphenyl ether, the polybrominated diphenyl ether congener most prevalent in human tissues. Results: We identified 33 differentially methylated DNA regions and 15 differentially expressed miRNAs. These changes were enriched for terms related to lipid and carbohydrate metabolism, insulin signaling, Type-2 diabetes and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Conclusion: Changes in the liver epigenome are a likely candidate mechanism of long-term maintenance of an aberrant metabolic phenotype. ",
        "In vivo epigenetic editing of Sema6a promoter reverses transcallosal dysconnectivity caused by C11orf46/Arl14ep risk gene. Many neuropsychiatric risk genes contribute to epigenetic regulation but little is known about specific chromatin-associated mechanisms governing the formation of neuronal connectivity. Here we show that transcallosal connectivity is critically dependent on C11orf46, a nuclear protein encoded in the chromosome 11p13 WAGR risk locus. C11orf46 haploinsufficiency was associated with hypoplasia of the corpus callosum. C11orf46 knockdown disrupted transcallosal projections and was rescued by wild type C11orf46 but not the C11orf46R236H mutant associated with intellectual disability. Multiple genes encoding key regulators of axonal development, including Sema6a, were hyperexpressed in C11orf46-knockdown neurons. RNA-guided epigenetic editing of Sema6a gene promoters via a dCas9-SunTag system with C11orf46 binding normalized SEMA6A expression and rescued transcallosal dysconnectivity via repressive chromatin remodeling by the SETDB1 repressor complex. Our study demonstrates that interhemispheric communication is sensitive to locus-specific remodeling of neuronal chromatin, revealing the therapeutic potential for shaping the brain's connectome via gene-targeted designer activators and repressor proteins.

        "Rectal Microbiome Composition Correlates with Humoral Immunity to HIV-1 in Vaccinated Rhesus Macaques. The microbiome is an integral and dynamic component of the host and is emerging as a critical determinant of immune responses; however, its influence on vaccine immunogenicity is largely not well understood. Here, we examined the pivotal relationship between the mucosal microbiome and vaccine-induced immune responses by assessing longitudinal changes in vaginal and rectal microbiome profiles after intradermal immunization with a human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) DNA vaccine in adult rhesus macaques that received two prior DNA primes. We report that both vaginal and rectal microbiomes were dominated by Firmicutes but were composed of distinct genera, denoting microbiome specialization across mucosal tissues. Following immunization, the vaginal microbiome was resilient, except for a transient decrease in Streptococcus In contrast, the rectal microbiome was far more responsive to vaccination, exhibiting an increase in the ratio of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes Within Bacteroidetes, multiple genera were significantly decreased, including Prevotella, Alloprevotella, Bacteroides, Acetobacteroides, Falsiporphyromonas, and Anaerocella. Decreased abundance of Prevotella correlated with induction of gut-homing \u03b14\u03b27+ effector CD4 T cells. Prevotella abundance also negatively correlated with rectal HIV-1 specific IgG levels. While rectal Lactobacillus was unaltered following DNA vaccination, baseline Lactobacillus abundance showed strong associations with higher rectal HIV-1 gp140 IgA induced following a protein boost. Similarly, the abundance of Clostridium in cluster IV was associated with higher rectal HIV-1 gp140 IgG responses. Collectively, these data reveal that the temporal stability of bacterial communities following DNA immunization is site dependent and highlight the importance of host-microbiome interactions in shaping HIV-1 vaccine responses. Our findings have significant implications for microbial manipulation as a strategy to enhance HIV vaccine-induced mucosal immunity.IMPORTANCE There is considerable effort directed toward evaluating HIV-1 vaccine platforms to select the most promising candidates for enhancing mucosal HIV-1 antibody. The most successful thus far, the RV144 trial provided partial protection due to waning HIV-1 antibody titers. In order to develop an effective HIV vaccine, it may therefore be important to understand how biological factors, such as the microbiome, modulate host immune responses. Furthermore, as intestinal microbiota antigens may generate antibodies cross-reactive to the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein, understanding the relationship between gut microbiota composition and HIV-1 envelope antibody responses after vaccination is important. Here, we demonstrate for the first time in rhesus macaques that the rectal microbiome composition can influence HIV-1 vaccine immunogenicity, and we report temporal changes in the mucosal microbiome profile following HIV-1 vaccination. Our results could inform findings from the HIV Vaccine Trials Network (HVTN) vaccine studies and contribute to an understanding of how the microbiome influences HIV-1 antibody responses. ",
        "A community-based lung cancer rapid tissue donation protocol provides high-quality drug-resistant specimens for proteogenomic analyses. BACKGROUND: For the advancement of cancer research, the collection of tissue specimens from drug-resistant tumors after targeted therapy is crucial. Although patients with lung cancer are often provided targeted therapy, post-therapy specimens are not routinely collected due to the risks of collection, limiting the study of targeted therapy resistance mechanisms. Posthumous rapid tissue donation (RTD) is an expedient collection process that provides an opportunity to understand treatment-resistant lung cancers. METHODS: Consent to participate in the thoracic RTD protocol was obtained during patient care. When death occurred, tumor and paired non-tumor, cytology, and blood specimens were collected within 48\u00a0hours and preserved as formalin-fixed and frozen specimens. Tissue sections were evaluated with hematoxylin and eosin staining and immunohistochemistry (IHC) against multiple biomarkers, including various programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) clones. Next-generation sequencing was performed on 13 specimens from 5 patients. RESULTS: Postmortem specimens (N\u00a0=\u00a0180) were well preserved from 9 patients with lung cancer. PD-L1 IHC revealed heterogeneity within and between tumors. An AGK-BRAF fusion was newly identified in tumor from a donor with a known echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4 to anaplastic lymphoma kinase (EML4-ALK) fusion and history of anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) inhibitor therapy. RNA expression analysis revealed a clonal genetic origin of metastatic cancer cells. CONCLUSIONS: Post-therapy specimens demonstrated PD-L1 heterogeneity and an acyl glycerol kinase to B-rapidly accelerated fibrosarcoma (AGK-BRAF) fusion in a patient with an EML4-ALK-positive lung adenocarcinoma\u00a0as a potential resistance mechanism to ALK inhibitor therapy. Rapid tissue donation collection of postmortem tissue from lung cancer patients is a novel approach to cancer research that enables studies of molecular evolution and drug resistance. ",
        "Factors Associated With Opiate Use Among Psychiatric Inpatients: A Population-Based Study of Hospital Admissions in Ontario, Canada. Background: Use of opiates, including synthetic opioids, is associated with a number of negative consequences, including increased risk of opioid use disorders and other mental health conditions. However, studies are limited in examining patterns of opiate use among persons in inpatient psychiatry, particularly those that consider the relationship between pain and opiate use. Objective: This study examined the prevalence in the prior 12\u2009months to admission and patterns of opiate use and pain in a population-based study of persons admitted to inpatient psychiatry in Ontario, Canada. Methods: We conducted retrospective cross-sectional study of 165\u2009434 persons admitted to inpatient psychiatry between January 1, 2006 and December 31, 2017. Using data from the Resident Assessment Instrument for Mental Health, we examined prevalence and factors associated with opiate use in the prior 12\u2009months by a number of patient characteristics, including demographics, mental and physical health status, concurrent substance use, pain severity and frequency, and health region of residence. Results: The prevalence of opiate use within 12\u2009months of admission was 7.5%, between 17% and 22% among those experiencing daily pain, and 27% among persons with a primary substance use disorder. Multivariable analyses revealed strong associations among demographic and clinical variables with opiate use (c\u2009=\u20090.91), including being of younger age, use of other substances, greater frequency and severity of pain, and health region of residence. Conclusion: The strong relationship between pain and opiate use in this population, and the regional variation in this pattern, supports the need for integrated care for mental illness and substance use, and therapeutic approaches to pain management that reduce risks of problems associated with substance use for persons with mental health conditions.

        "Clinical Parameters Outperform Molecular Subtypes for Predicting Outcome in Bladder Cancer: Results from Multiple Cohorts, Including TCGA. PURPOSE: Studies indicate that molecular subtypes in muscle invasive bladder cancer predict the clinical outcome. We evaluated whether subtyping by a simplified method and established classifications could predict the clinical outcome. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We subtyped institutional cohort 1 of 52 patients, including 39 with muscle invasive bladder cancer, an Oncomine\u2122 data set of 151 with muscle invasive bladder cancer and TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas) data set of 402 with muscle invasive bladder cancer. Subtyping was done using simplified panels (MCG-1 and MCG-Ext) which included only transcripts common in published studies and were analyzed for predicting metastasis, and cancer specific, overall and recurrence-free survival. TCGA data set was further analyzed using the Lund taxonomy, the Bladder Cancer Molecular Taxonomy Group Consensus and TCGA 2017 mRNA subtype classifications. RESULTS: Muscle invasive bladder cancer specimens from cohort 1 and the Oncomine data set showed intratumor heterogeneity for transcript and protein expression. MCG-1 subtypes did not predict the outcome on univariate or Kaplan-Meier analysis. On multivariate analysis N stage (p \u22640.007), T stage (p \u22640.04), M stage (p=0.007) and/or patient age (p=0.01) predicted metastasis, cancer specific and overall survival, and/or the cisplatin based adjuvant chemotherapy response. In TCGA data set publications showed that subtypes risk stratified patients for overall survival. Consistently the MCG-1 and MCG-Ext subtypes were associated with overall but not recurrence-free survival on univariate and Kaplan-Meier analyses. TCGA data set included 21 low grade specimens of the total of 402 and subtypes associated with tumor grade (p=0.005). However, less than 1% of muscle invasive bladder cancer cases are low grade. In only high grade specimens the MCG-1 and MCG-Ext subtypes could not predict overall survival. On univariate analysis subtypes according to the Bladder Cancer Molecular Taxonomy Group Consensus, TCGA 2017 and the Lund taxonomy were associated with tumor grade (p <0.0001) and overall survival (p=0.01 to <0.0001). Regardless of classification, subtypes had about 50% to 60% sensitivity and specificity to predict overall and recurrence-free survival. On multivariate analyses N stage and lymphovascular invasion consistently predicted recurrence-free and overall survival (p=0.039 and 0.003, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Molecular subtypes reflect bladder tumor heterogeneity and are associated with tumor grade.

Herein, biomaterial-assisted sequestration of small molecules is described to localize pro-regenerative signaling at the injury site. Specifically, a synthetic biomaterial containing boronate molecules is designed to sequester adenosine, a small molecule ubiquitously present in the human body. The biomaterial-assisted sequestration of adenosine leverages the transient surge of extracellular adenosine following injury to prolong local adenosine signaling. It is demonstrated that implantation of the biomaterial patch following injury establishes an in situ stockpile of adenosine, resulting in accelerated healing by promoting both osteoblastogenesis and angiogenesis. The adenosine content within the patch recedes to the physiological level as the tissue regenerates. In addition to sequestering endogenous adenosine, the biomaterial is also able to deliver exogenous adenosine to the site of injury, offering a versatile solution to utilizing adenosine as a potential therapeutic for tissue repair.

        "Mathematical determination of the HIV-1 matrix shell structure and its impact on the biology of HIV-1. Since its discovery in the early 1980s, there has been significant progress in understanding the biology of type 1 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1). Structural biologists have made tremendous contributions to this challenge, guiding the development of current therapeutic strategies. Despite our efforts, there are unresolved structural features of the virus and consequently, significant knowledge gaps in our understanding. The superstructure of the HIV-1 matrix (MA) shell has not been elucidated. Evidence by various high-resolution microscopy techniques support a model composed of MA trimers arranged in a hexameric configuration consisting of 6 MA trimers forming a hexagon. In this manuscript we review the mathematical limitations of this model and propose a new model consisting of a 6-lune hosohedra structure, which aligns with available structural evidence. We used geometric and rotational matrix computation methods to construct our model and predict a new mechanism for viral entry that explains the increase in particle size observed during CD4 receptor engagement and the most common HIV-1 ellipsoidal shapes observed in cryo-EM tomograms. A better understanding of the HIV-1 MA shell structure is a key step towards better models for viral assembly, maturation and entry. Our new model will facilitate efforts to improve understanding of the biology of HIV-1. ",
        "Regulation of \u03b1-synuclein by chaperones in mammalian cells. Neurodegeneration in patients with Parkinson's disease is correlated with the occurrence of Lewy bodies-intracellular inclusions that contain aggregates of the intrinsically disordered protein \u03b1-synuclein1. The aggregation propensity of \u03b1-synuclein in cells is modulated by specific factors that include post-translational modifications2,3, Abelson-kinase-mediated phosphorylation4,5 and interactions with intracellular machineries such as molecular chaperones, although the underlying mechanisms are unclear6-8. Here we systematically characterize the interaction of molecular chaperones with \u03b1-synuclein in vitro as well as in cells at the atomic level. We find that six highly divergent molecular chaperones commonly recognize a canonical motif in \u03b1-synuclein, consisting of the N terminus and a segment around Tyr39, and hinder the aggregation of \u03b1-synuclein. NMR experiments9 in cells show that the same transient interaction pattern is preserved inside living mammalian cells. Specific inhibition of the interactions between \u03b1-synuclein and the chaperone HSC70 and members of the HSP90 family, including HSP90\u03b2, results in transient membrane binding and triggers a remarkable re-localization of \u03b1-synuclein to the mitochondria and concomitant formation of aggregates. Phosphorylation of \u03b1-synuclein at Tyr39 directly impairs the interaction of \u03b1-synuclein with chaperones, thus providing a functional explanation for the role of Abelson kinase in Parkinson's disease. Our results establish a master regulatory mechanism of \u03b1-synuclein function and aggregation in mammalian cells, extending the functional repertoire of molecular chaperones and highlighting new perspectives for therapeutic interventions for Parkinson's disease.

        "American College of Sports Medicine Roundtable Report on Physical Activity, Sedentary Behavior, and Cancer Prevention and Control. INTRODUCTION: The American College of Sports Medicine convened an International Multidisciplinary Roundtable on Exercise and Cancer in March 2018 to evaluate and translate the evidence linking physical activity and cancer prevention, treatment, and control. This article discusses findings from the Roundtable in relation to the biologic and epidemiologic evidence for the role of physical activity in cancer prevention and survival. RESULTS: The evidence supports that there are a number of biologically plausible mechanisms, whereby physical activity can influence cancer risk, and that physical activity is beneficial for the prevention of several types of cancer including breast, colon, endometrial, kidney, bladder, esophageal, and stomach. Minimizing time spent in sedentary behavior may also lower risk of endometrial, colon and lung cancers. Conversely, physical activity is associated with higher risk of melanoma, a serious form of skin cancer. Further, physical activity before and after a cancer diagnosis is also likely to be relevant for improved survival for those diagnosed with breast and colon cancer; with data suggesting that postdiagnosis physical activity provides greater mortality benefits than prediagnosis physical activity. CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, there is consistent, compelling evidence that physical activity plays a role in preventing many types of cancer and for improving longevity among cancer survivors, although the evidence related to higher risk of melanoma demonstrates the importance of sun safe practices while being physically active. Together, these findings underscore the importance of physical activity in cancer prevention and control. Fitness and public health professionals and health care providers worldwide are encouraged to spread the message to the general population and cancer survivors to be physically active as their age, abilities, and cancer status will allow.

        "Ultrafast Two-Photon Imaging of a High-Gain Voltage Indicator in Awake Behaving Mice. Optical interrogation of voltage in deep brain locations with cellular resolution would be immensely useful for understanding how neuronal circuits process information. Here, we report ASAP3, a genetically encoded voltage indicator with 51% fluorescence modulation by physiological voltages, submillisecond activation kinetics, and full responsivity under two-photon excitation. We also introduce an ultrafast local volume excitation (ULoVE) method for kilohertz-rate two-photon sampling in\u00a0vivo with increased stability and sensitivity. Combining a soma-targeted ASAP3 variant and ULoVE, we show single-trial tracking of\u00a0spikes and subthreshold events for minutes in deep locations, with subcellular resolution and with repeated sampling over days. In the visual cortex, we use soma-targeted ASAP3 to illustrate cell-type-dependent subthreshold modulation by locomotion. Thus, ASAP3 and ULoVE enable high-speed optical recording of electrical activity in genetically defined neurons at deep locations during awake behavior. ",
        "NS1 DNA vaccination protects against Zika infection through T cell-mediated immunity in immunocompetent mice. The causal association of Zika virus (ZIKV) with microcephaly, congenital malformations in infants, and Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome in adults highlights the need for effective vaccines. Thus far, efforts to develop ZIKV vaccines have focused on the viral envelope. ZIKV NS1 as a vaccine immunogen has not been fully explored, although it can circumvent the risk of antibody-dependent enhancement of ZIKV infection, associated with envelope antibodies. Here, we describe a novel DNA vaccine encoding a secreted ZIKV NS1, that confers rapid protection from systemic ZIKV infection in immunocompetent mice. We identify novel NS1 T cell epitopes in vivo and show that functional NS1-specific T cell responses are critical for protection against ZIKV infection. We demonstrate that vaccine-induced anti-NS1 antibodies fail to confer protection in the absence of a functional T cell response. This highlights the importance of using NS1 as a target for T cell-based ZIKV vaccines. ",
        "Decoding speech from spike-based neural population recordings in secondary auditory cortex of non-human primates. Direct electronic communication with sensory areas of the neocortex is a challenging ambition for brain-computer interfaces. Here, we report the first successful neural decoding of English words with high intelligibility from intracortical spike-based neural population activity recorded from the secondary auditory cortex of macaques. We acquired 96-channel full-broadband population recordings using intracortical microelectrode arrays in the rostral and caudal parabelt regions of the superior temporal gyrus (STG). We leveraged a new neural processing toolkit to investigate the choice of decoding algorithm, neural preprocessing, audio representation, channel count, and array location on neural decoding performance. The presented spike-based machine learning neural decoding approach may further be useful in informing future encoding strategies to deliver direct auditory percepts to the brain as specific patterns of microstimulation.

        "Resolving titin's lifecycle and the spatial organization of protein turnover in mouse cardiomyocytes. Cardiac protein homeostasis, sarcomere assembly, and integration of titin as the sarcomeric backbone are tightly regulated to facilitate adaptation and repair. Very little is known on how the >3-MDa titin protein is synthesized, moved, inserted into sarcomeres, detached, and degraded. Here, we generated a bifluorescently labeled knockin mouse to simultaneously visualize both ends of the molecule and follow titin's life cycle in vivo. We find titin mRNA, protein synthesis and degradation compartmentalized toward the Z-disk in adult, but not embryonic cardiomyocytes. Originating at the Z-disk, titin contributes to a soluble protein pool (>15% of total titin) before it is integrated into the sarcomere lattice. Titin integration, disintegration, and reintegration are stochastic and do not proceed sequentially from Z-disk to M-band, as suggested previously. Exchange between soluble and integrated titin depends on titin protein composition and differs between individual cardiomyocytes. Thus, titin dynamics facilitate embryonic vs. adult sarcomere remodeling with implications for cardiac development and disease. ",
        "Computational Fluid Dynamics Reveals a Unique Net Unidirectional Pattern of Pulmonary Airflow in the Savannah Monitor Lizard (Varanus exanthematicus). This report models pulmonary airflow in the savannah monitor (Varanus exanthematicus) using computational fluid dynamics simulations, which are based on computed tomography data. Simulations were validated by visualizing the flow of aerosolized lipids in excised lungs with good but not perfect agreement. The lung of this lizard has numerous successive bronchi branching off a long intrapulmonary bronchus, which are interconnected by intercameral perforations. Unidirectional flow has been documented in the lateral secondary bronchi of the savannah monitor, but patterns of airflow in the rest of the lung remain unknown, hindering our understanding of the evolution of pulmonary patterns of airflow in tetrapods. These results indicate that the lung contains a unique net unidirectional flow, where the overall flow scheme is similar during expiration and late inspiration, but dissimilar during early inspiration. Air is transported net caudally through the intrapulmonary bronchus and net craniad through secondary bronchi, much like the pattern of flow in birds. The simulations show that many chambers feature flow in multiple directions during parts of the respiratory cycle, but some regions also show robust unidirectional airflow. Air moves craniad through secondary bronchi and between adjacent secondary bronchi through intercameral perforations. The first secondary bronchus, the hilar-cranial bronchus, contains tidal flow that may improve ventilation of the central and dorsal lung parenchyma. These results expand our understanding of flow patterns in varanid lungs and suggest lungs with net unidirectional flow as an evolutionary pathway between tidal flow and complete unidirectional flow in multicameral lungs.

        "Healing The Past By Nurturing The Future: A\u00a0qualitative systematic review and meta-synthesis of pregnancy, birth and early postpartum experiences and views of parents with a history of childhood maltreatment. BACKGROUND: Child maltreatment can have serious effects on development and physical, social and emotional wellbeing. Any long-lasting relational effects can impede the capacity to nurture children, potentially leading to 'intergenerational trauma'. Conversely, the transition to parenthood during pregnancy, birth and the early postpartum period offers a unique life-course opportunity for healing. This systematic review aims to understand the pregnancy, birth and early postpartum experiences of parents who reported maltreatment in their own childhood. METHODS: A protocol, based on the ENTREQ statement, was registered with PROSPERO. We searched Medline, PsycINFO, CINAHL, EMBASE, NHS Evidence and key Web of Science databases from date of inception to June 2018 to identify qualitative studies exploring perinatal experiences of parents who were maltreated in their own childhood. Two reviewers independently screened articles for inclusion and extracted data. Data were synthesised using grounded theory and thematic analysis approaches. FINDINGS: The search yielded 18329 articles, 568 full text articles were reviewed, and 50 studies (60 articles) met inclusion criteria for this review. Due to the large number of studies across the whole perinatal period (pregnancy to two years postpartum), this paper reports findings for experiences during pregnancy, birth and early postpartum (27 studies). Parents described positive experiences and strategies to help them achieve their hopes and dreams of providing safe, loving and nurturing care for their children. However, many parents experienced serious challenges. Seven core analytic themes encapsulated these diverse and dynamic experiences: New beginnings; Changing roles and identities; Feeling connected; Compassionate care; Empowerment; Creating safety; and Reweaving a future. CONCLUSIONS: Pregnancy birth and the early postpartum period is a unique life-course healing opportunity for parents with a history of maltreatment. Understanding parent's experiences and views of perinatal care and early parenting is critical for informing the development of acceptable and effective support strategies. ",
        "Design and Impact of a Novel Surgery-Specific Second Victim Peer Support Program. BACKGROUND: Surgeons are prone to feelings of sadness, guilt, and anxiety when involved in major adverse events. We aimed to create and evaluate a second victim peer support program for surgeons and surgical trainees. STUDY DESIGN: The second victim peer-support program was an intervention performed in the Department of Surgery at a tertiary care academic medical center. Surgical attendings and trainees participated as peer supporters or affected peers. In this work, we describe the design of the program and its one-year impact. The program's impact was evaluated through 1) the number of interventions attempted and realized, and 2) feedback received from all participants using an anonymous qualitative and quantitative survey. RESULTS: The program was established using 5 steps: 1) creation of a conceptual framework, 2) choice of peer supporters, 3) training of peer supporters, 4) multi-faceted identification of major adverse events, and 5) design of a systematic intervention plan. In one year, the program had 47 interventions distributed evenly between attendings and trainees; 19% of affected peers opted out of receiving support. Most participants expressed satisfaction with the program's confidentiality, the safe/trusting environment it provided, and the timeliness of the intervention (89%, 73%, and 83%, respectively); 81% suggested that the program had a positive impact on the department's \"safety and support\" culture and would recommend the program to a colleague. Several areas for improvement were identified, including the need to improve identification of events requiring outreach, and the desire for increased awareness of the program throughout the department. CONCLUSIONS: We successfully designed, implemented, and assessed the impact of the first surgery-specific peer support program in the US. Our one-year experience suggests that the program is highly utilized and well-received, albeit with opportunities for improvement. ",
        "Black Patients Experience Highest Rates of Cancer-associated Venous Thromboembolism. PURPOSE: Cancer patients are at a higher risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) than the general population. In the general population, blacks are at a higher risk of VTE compared with whites. The influence of race on cancer-associated VTE remains unexplored. We examined whether black cancer patients are at a higher risk of VTE and whether these differences are present in specific cancer types. DESIGN: A retrospective study was performed in the largest safety net hospital of New England using a cohort of cancer patients characterized by a substantial number of nonwhites. RESULTS: We identified 16,498 subjects with solid organ and hematologic malignancies from 2004 to 2018. Among them, we found 186 unique incident VTE events, of which the majority of the events accrued within the first 2 years of cancer diagnosis. Overall, blacks showed a 3-fold higher incidence of VTE (1.8%) compared with whites (0.6%; P<0.001). This difference was observed in certain cancer types such as lung, gastric and colorectal. In lung cancer, the odds of developing VTE in blacks was 2.77-times greater than those in white patients (confidence interval, 1.33-5.91; P=0.007). Despite the greater incidence of cancer-associated VTE in blacks, their Khorana risk score of VTE was not higher. CONCLUSIONS: In a diverse cancer cohort, we observed a higher incidence of cancer-associated VTE in blacks compared with patients from other races. This study indicates the consideration of race in the risk assessment of cancer-associated VTE. It could also lead to future mechanistic studies aiming at identifying reasons for differential VTE risk depending on cancer type. ",
        "Chemical functionality of multidomain peptide hydrogels governs early host immune response. Multidomain Peptide (MDP) hydrogels are nanofibrous materials with many potential biomedical applications. The peptide sequence design of these materials offers high versatility and allows for the incorporation of various chemical functionalities into the nanofibrous scaffold. It is known that host response to biomaterials is strongly affected by factors such as size, shape, stiffness, and chemistry. However, there is a lack of fundamental understanding of the host response to different MDP hydrogels. In particular, it is unknown what effect the chemical functionality displayed on the nanofiber has on biological activity. Here we evaluated the early inflammatory host response to four MDP hydrogels displaying amines, guanidinium ions, and carboxylates in a subcutaneous injection model. While all the studied peptide materials possess similar nanostructure and physical properties, they trigger markedly different inflammatory responses. These were characterized by immunophenotyping of the cellular infiltrate using multi-color flow cytometry. The negatively-charged peptides elicit minimal inflammation characterized by tissue-resident macrophage infiltration, fast remodeling, and no collagen deposition or blood vessel formation within the implants. In contrast, the positively-charged peptides are highly infiltrated by immune cells, are remodeled at a slower rate, promote angiogenesis, and result in a high degree of collagen deposition. The presence of dynamic cell phenotypes characterizes the inflammation caused by the lysine-based peptide, including inflammatory monocytes, macrophages, and lymphoid cells, which is seen to be resolving over time. The arginine-based hydrogel shows higher inflammatory response with a persistent and significant infiltration of polymorphonuclear myeloid-derived cells, even ten days after implantation. This understanding of the immune response to peptide biomaterials improves our ability to design effective materials and to tailor their use for specific biomedical applications. ",
        "Oncogenes, tumor suppressor and differentiation genes represent the oldest human gene classes and evolve concurrently. Earlier we showed that human genome contains many evolutionarily young or novel genes with tumor-specific or tumor-predominant expression. We suggest calling such genes Tumor Specifically Expressed, Evolutionarily New (TSEEN) genes. In this paper we performed a study of the evolutionary ages of different classes of human genes, using homology searches in genomes of different taxa in human lineage. We discovered that different classes of human genes have different evolutionary ages and confirmed the existence of TSEEN gene classes. On the other hand, we found that oncogenes, tumor-suppressor genes and differentiation genes are among the oldest gene classes in humans and their evolution occurs concurrently. These findings confirm non-trivial predictions made by our hypothesis of the possible evolutionary role of hereditary tumors. The results may be important for better understanding of tumor biology. TSEEN genes may become the best tumor markers. ",
        "Daily blue-light exposure shortens lifespan and causes brain neurodegeneration in Drosophila. Light is necessary for life, but prolonged exposure to artificial light is a matter of increasing health concern. Humans are exposed to increased amounts of light in the blue spectrum produced by light-emitting diodes (LEDs), which can interfere with normal sleep cycles. The LED technologies are relatively new; therefore, the long-term effects of exposure to blue light across the lifespan are not understood. We investigated the effects of light in the model organism, Drosophila melanogaster, and determined that flies maintained in daily cycles of 12-h blue LED and 12-h darkness had significantly reduced longevity compared with flies maintained in constant darkness or in white light with blue wavelengths blocked. Exposure of adult flies to 12\u2009h of blue light per day accelerated aging phenotypes causing damage to retinal cells, brain neurodegeneration, and impaired locomotion. We report that brain damage and locomotor impairments do not depend on the degeneration in the retina, as these phenotypes were evident under blue light in flies with genetically ablated eyes. Blue light induces expression of stress-responsive genes in old flies but not in young, suggesting that cumulative light exposure acts as a stressor during aging. We also determined that several known blue-light-sensitive proteins are not acting in pathways mediating detrimental light effects. Our study reveals the unexpected effects of blue light on fly brain and establishes Drosophila as a model in which to investigate long-term effects of blue light at the cellular and organismal level.

        "Personalized monitoring of electrical remodelling during atrial fibrillation progression via remote transmissions from implantable devices. AIMS: Atrial electrical remodelling (AER) is a transitional period associated with the progression and long-term maintenance of atrial fibrillation (AF). We aimed to study the progression of AER in individual patients with implantable devices and AF episodes. METHODS AND RESULTS: Observational multicentre study (51 centres) including 4618 patients with implantable cardioverter-defibrillator +/-resynchronization therapy (ICD/CRT-D) and 352 patients (2 centres) with pacemakers (median follow-up: 3.4\u2009years). Atrial activation rate (AAR) was quantified as the frequency of the dominant peak in the signal spectrum of AF episodes with atrial bipolar electrograms. Patients with complete progression of AER, from paroxysmal AF episodes to electrically remodelled persistent AF, were used to depict patient-specific AER slopes. A total of 34\u00a0712 AF tracings from 830 patients (87 with pacemakers) were suitable for the study. Complete progression of AER was documented in 216 patients (16 with pacemakers). Patients with persistent AF after completion of AER showed \u223c30% faster AAR than patients with paroxysmal AF. The slope of AAR changes during AF progression revealed patient-specific patterns that correlated with the time-to-completion of AER (R2 = 0.85). Pacemaker patients were older than patients with ICD/CRT-Ds (78.3 vs. 67.2\u2009year olds, respectively, P\u2009<\u20090.001) and had a shorter median time-to-completion of AER (24.9 vs. 93.5\u2009days, respectively, P\u2009=\u20090.016). Remote transmissions in patients with ICD/CRT-D devices enabled the estimation of the time-to-completion of AER using the predicted slope of AAR changes from initiation to completion of electrical remodelling (R2 = 0.45). CONCLUSION: The AF progression shows patient-specific patterns of AER, which can be estimated using available remote-monitoring technology. ",
        "Dietary Cholesterol and Cardiovascular Risk: A Science Advisory From the American Heart Association. The elimination of specific dietary cholesterol target recommendations in recent guidelines has raised questions about its role with respect to cardiovascular disease. This advisory was developed after a review of human studies on the relationship of dietary cholesterol with blood lipids, lipoproteins, and cardiovascular disease risk to address questions about the relevance of dietary cholesterol guidance for heart health. Evidence from observational studies conducted in several countries generally does not indicate a significant association with cardiovascular disease risk. Although meta-analyses of intervention studies differ in their findings, most associate intakes of cholesterol that exceed current average levels with elevated total or low-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations. Dietary guidance should focus on healthy dietary patterns (eg, Mediterranean-style and DASH [Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension]-style diets) that are inherently relatively low in cholesterol with typical levels similar to the current US intake. These patterns emphasize fruits, vegetables, whole grains, low-fat or fat-free dairy products, lean protein sources, nuts, seeds, and liquid vegetable oils. A recommendation that gives a specific dietary cholesterol target within the context of food-based advice is challenging for clinicians and consumers to implement; hence, guidance focused on dietary patterns is more likely to improve diet quality and to promote cardiovascular health.

        "Epidemic dynamics of respiratory syncytial virus in current and future climates. A key question for infectious disease dynamics is the impact of the climate on future burden. Here, we evaluate the climate drivers of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), an important determinant of disease in young children. We combine a dataset of county-level observations from the US with state-level observations from Mexico, spanning much of the global range of climatological conditions. Using a combination of nonlinear epidemic models with statistical techniques, we find consistent patterns of climate drivers at a continental scale explaining latitudinal differences in the dynamics and timing of local epidemics. Strikingly, estimated effects of precipitation and humidity on transmission mirror prior results for influenza. We couple our model with projections for future climate, to show that temperature-driven increases to humidity may lead to a northward shift in the dynamic patterns observed and that the likelihood of severe outbreaks of RSV hinges on projections for extreme rainfall.

        "Imatinib revives the therapeutic potential of metformin on ewing sarcoma by attenuating tumor hypoxic response and inhibiting convergent signaling pathways. Ewing sarcoma (EwS) is an aggressive pediatric tumor treated with intensive cytotoxic chemotherapies. Overall survival for metastatic or relapsed disease is only 20-30%. Metformin has long been an attractive therapeutic option for EwS, but hypoxia limits its efficacy. Through a systematic integration of drug combination screening, bioinformatics analyses, functional and in vivo studies, and correlation with clinical outcome, we identified another known drug, imatinib that could augment the in vivo anti-tumor capacity of metformin by attenuating tumor hypoxic response. This drug combination regimen widely suppressed multiple dominant mechanisms in EwS genesis, growth, and metastasis, including key EWS-FLI1 downstream targets that converge into the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway. In addition, the combination significantly enhanced inhibition on tumor cell proliferation by standard EwS chemotherapy drugs, including cyclophosphamide and ifosfamide. This suggests a potential clinical benefit of the metformin/imatinib combination by allowing the reduction in dose intensity of standard chemotherapy without compromising survival outcome and represents a potential faster track application for EwS patients.

        "Too Many Don'ts and Not Enough Do's? A Survey of Hospitals About Their Portal Instructions for Patients. BACKGROUND: Patient portals present the opportunity to expand patients' access to their clinicians and health information. Yet patients and clinicians have expressed the need for more guidance on portal and secure messaging procedures to avoid misuse. Little information is currently available concerning whether and how expectations of portal and messaging usage are communicated to patients. OBJECTIVE: To identify the information made available to patients about patient portal use, and to assess ease in accessing such information. DESIGN: A national survey of publicly available portal information from hospital websites. The study team followed up with phone calls to each hospital to request any additional patient-directed materials (e.g., pamphlets) not located in the web search. PARTICIPANTS: A random sample of 200 acute-care hospitals, 50 from each of four US Census regions, selected from the US Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Hospital Compare dataset. MAIN MEASURES: Availability of patient portals, secure messaging, and related functionality; the content and ease of access to patient-directed information about portals. KEY RESULTS: Of the hospitals sampled, 177 (89%) had a patient portal; 116 (66%) of these included secure messaging functionality. Most portals with secure messaging (N\u2009=\u200965, 58%) did not describe appropriate patient messaging conduct. Although many included disclaimers that the service is not for emergencies, 23 hospitals only included this within the fine prints of their \"Terms and Conditions\" section. Content analysis of additional patient-directed materials revealed a focus on logistical content, features of the portals, and parameters of use. Of the three categories, logistical content (e.g., creating an account) was the most thorough. CONCLUSIONS: Although most of the sampled hospitals had patient portals, many fail to educate patients fully and set expectations for secure messaging. To improve patient engagement and minimize harm, hospitals and clinicians need to provide more information and set clearer guidelines for patients. ",
        "Minority stress adds an additional layer to fear of childbirth in lesbian and bisexual women, and transgender people. OBJECTIVE: To explore and describe thoughts about and experiences of pregnancy, childbirth and reproductive healthcare in lesbian and bisexual women and transgender people (LBT) with an expressed fear of childbirth (FOC). DESIGN: Data were collected through semi-structured interviews with self-identified LBTs with an expressed FOC. PARTICIPANTS: 17 self-identified LBTs participated. 15 had an expressed FOC, and two were non-afraid partners. FINDINGS: Participants' fears were similar to those previously described in research on FOC, e.g., fear of pain, injury, blood, death of the child or of the parent. However, minority stress, including fear and experiences of prejudicial treatment, in maternity care and at delivery wards add an additional layer to the fear of childbirth. KEY CONCLUSIONS: LBTs with FOC are a particularly vulnerable group of patients, whose needs must be addressed in healthcare. IMPLICATION FOR PRACTICE: The findings call attention to the need for LBT-competent treatment prior to, and throughout pregnancy and childbirth. In the most vulnerable patients, caregivers must work extensively to build trust, in order to explore and reduce FOC. ",
        "An in-depth multi-omics analysis in RLE-6TN rat alveolar epithelial cells allows for nanomaterial categorization. BACKGROUND: Nanomaterials (NMs) can be fine-tuned in their properties resulting in a high number of variants, each requiring a thorough safety assessment. Grouping and categorization approaches that would reduce the amount of testing are in principle existing for NMs but are still mostly conceptual. One drawback is the limited mechanistic understanding of NM toxicity. Thus, we conducted a multi-omics in vitro study in RLE-6TN rat alveolar epithelial cells involving 12 NMs covering different materials and including a systematic variation of particle size, surface charge and hydrophobicity for SiO2 NMs. Cellular responses were analyzed by global proteomics, targeted metabolomics and SH2 profiling. Results were integrated using Weighted Gene Correlation Network Analysis (WGCNA). RESULTS: Cluster analyses involving all data sets separated Graphene Oxide, TiO2_NM105, SiO2_40 and Phthalocyanine Blue from the other NMs as their cellular responses showed a high degree of similarities, although apical in vivo results may differ. SiO2_7 behaved differently but still induced significant changes. In contrast, the remaining NMs were more similar to untreated controls. WGCNA revealed correlations of specific physico-chemical properties such as agglomerate size and redox potential to cellular responses. A key driver analysis could identify biomolecules being highly correlated to the observed effects, which might be representative biomarker candidates. Key drivers in our study were mainly related to oxidative stress responses and apoptosis. CONCLUSIONS: Our multi-omics approach involving proteomics, metabolomics and SH2 profiling proved useful to obtain insights into NMs Mode of Actions. Integrating results allowed for a more robust NM categorization. Moreover, key physico-chemical properties strongly correlating with NM toxicity were identified. Finally, we suggest several key drivers of toxicity that bear the potential to improve future testing and assessment approaches. ",
        "Causes of death after breast cancer diagnosis: A US population-based analysis. BACKGROUND: The focus on noncancer causes of death in patients with breast cancer (BC) remains superficial. The objective of the current study was to assess and quantify causes of death after BC diagnosis. METHODS: In total, 754,270 women with BC in the United States who were diagnosed during 2000 through 2015 and retrieved from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program were studied. Standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) for causes of death were calculated. RESULTS: Of the included patients, 183,002 (24.3%) died during the follow-up period. The greatest proportion of deaths (46.2%) occurred within 1 to 5\u00a0years after diagnosis. Most deaths occurred from BC itself or from other cancers, and the number of BC deaths decreased as more years passed after diagnosis. The most common noncancer causes of death within <10\u00a0years after diagnosis were heart diseases followed by cerebrovascular diseases. However, >10\u00a0years after diagnosis, the most common noncancer causes of death were heart diseases followed by Alzheimer disease. Patients had a statistically significant higher risk of death from chronic liver diseases within 5 to 10\u00a0years after diagnosis compared with the general population (SMR, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.09-1.38) and had statistically significant higher risks of death from Alzheimer disease (SMR, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.14-1.29) and from diseases of the heart (SMR, 1.06; 95% CI, 1.02-1.09) >10\u00a0years after diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: Although BC remains the most common cause of death after BC diagnosis, other non-BC causes of death (mainly heart and cerebrovascular diseases) represent a significant number of deaths among patients with BC. These findings provide important insight into how BC survivors should be counselled regarding future health risks. ",

        "Interaction kinetics with transcriptomic and secretory responses of CD19-CAR natural killer-cell therapy in CD20 resistant non-hodgkin lymphoma. We investigated the cytolytic and mechanistic activity of anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor natural killer (CD19.CAR.NK92) therapy in lymphoma cell lines (diffuse large B-cell, follicular, and Burkitt lymphoma), including rituximab- and obinutuzumab-resistant cells, patient-derived cells, and a human xenograft model. CD19.CAR.NK92 therapy significantly increased cytolytic activity at E:T ratios (1:1-10:1) via LDH release and prominent induction of apoptosis in all cell lines, including in anti-CD20 resistant lymphoma cells. The kinetics of CD19.CAR.NK92 cell death measured via droplet-based single cell microfluidics analysis showed that most lymphoma cells were killed by single contact, with anti-CD20 resistant cell lines requiring significantly longer contact duration with NK cells. In addition, systems biology transcriptomic analyses of flow-sorted lymphoma cells co-cultured with CD19.CAR.NK92 revealed conserved activation of IFN\u03b3 signaling, execution of apoptosis, ligand binding, and immunoregulatory and chemokine signaling pathways. Furthermore, a 92-plex cytokine panel analysis showed increased secretion of granzymes, increased secretion of FASL, CCL3, and IL10 in anti-CD20 resistant SUDHL4 cells with induction of genes relevant to mTOR and G2/M checkpoint activation, which were noted in all anti-CD20 resistant cells co-cultured with CD19.CAR.NK92 cells. Collectively, CD19.CAR.NK92 was associated with potent anti-lymphoma activity across a host of sensitive and resistant lymphoma cells that involved distinct immuno-biologic mechanisms\u00a0of cell death.

        "Rapamycin for longevity: opinion article. From the dawn of civilization, humanity has dreamed of immortality. So why didn't the discovery of the anti-aging properties of mTOR inhibitors change the world forever? I will discuss several reasons, including fear of the actual and fictional side effects of rapamycin, everolimus and other clinically-approved drugs, arguing that no real side effects preclude their use as anti-aging drugs today. Furthermore, the alternative to the reversible (and avoidable) side effects of rapamycin/everolimus are the irreversible (and inevitable) effects of aging: cancer, stroke, infarction, blindness and premature death. I will also discuss why it is more dangerous not to use anti-aging drugs than to use them and how rapamycin-based drug combinations have already been implemented for potential life extension in humans. If you read this article from the very beginning to its end, you may realize that the time is now. ",
        "Polyaromatic hydrocarbons in pollution: a heart-breaking matter. Air pollution is associated with detrimental effects on human health, including decreased cardiovascular function. However, the causative mechanisms behind these effects have yet to be fully elucidated. Here we review the current epidemiological, clinical and experimental evidence linking pollution with cardiovascular dysfunction. Our focus is on particulate matter (PM) and the associated low molecular weight polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) as key mediators of cardiotoxicity. We begin by reviewing the growing epidemiological evidence linking air pollution to cardiovascular dysfunction in humans. We next address the pollution-based cardiotoxic mechanisms first identified in fish following the release of large quantities of PAHs into the marine environment from point oil spills (e.g. Deepwater Horizon). We finish by discussing the current state of mechanistic knowledge linking PM and PAH exposure to mammalian cardiovascular patho-physiologies such as atherosclerosis, cardiac hypertrophy, arrhythmias, contractile dysfunction and the underlying alterations in gene regulation. Our aim is to show conservation of toxicant pathways and cellular targets across vertebrate hearts to allow a broad framework of the global problem of cardiotoxic pollution to be established.

        "Primary Cilia Signaling Promotes Axonal Tract Development and Is Disrupted in Joubert Syndrome-Related Disorders Models. Appropriate axonal growth and connectivity are essential for functional wiring of the brain. Joubert syndrome-related disorders (JSRD), a group of ciliopathies in which mutations disrupt primary cilia function, are characterized by axonal tract malformations. However, little is known about how cilia-driven signaling regulates axonal growth and connectivity. We demonstrate that the deletion of related JSRD genes, Arl13b and Inpp5e, in projection neurons leads to de-fasciculated and misoriented axonal tracts. Arl13b deletion disrupts the function of its\u00a0downstream effector, Inpp5e, and deregulates ciliary-PI3K/AKT signaling. Chemogenetic activation of ciliary GPCR signaling and cilia-specific optogenetic modulation of downstream second messenger cascades (PI3K, AKT, and AC3) commonly regulated by ciliary signaling receptors induce rapid changes in axonal dynamics. Further, Arl13b deletion leads to changes in transcriptional landscape associated with dysregulated PI3K/AKT signaling. These data suggest that ciliary signaling acts to modulate axonal connectivity and that impaired primary cilia signaling underlies axonal tract defects in JSRD. ",
        "Identification and targeted management of a neurodegenerative disorder caused by biallelic mutations in SLC5A6. We describe a sibling pair displaying an early infantile-onset, progressive neurodegenerative phenotype, with symptoms of developmental delay and epileptic encephalopathy developing from 12 to 14 months of age. Using whole exome sequencing, compound heterozygous variants were identified in SLC5A6, which encodes the sodium-dependent multivitamin transporter (SMVT) protein. SMVT is an important transporter of the B-group vitamins biotin, pantothenate, and lipoate. The protein is ubiquitously expressed and has major roles in vitamin uptake in the digestive system, as well as transport of these vitamins across the blood-brain barrier. Pathogenicity of the identified variants was demonstrated by impaired biotin uptake of mutant SMVT. Identification of this vitamin transporter as the genetic basis of this disorder guided targeted therapeutic intervention, resulting clinically in improvement of the patient's neurocognitive and neuromotor function. This is the second report of biallelic mutations in SLC5A6 leading to a neurodegenerative disorder due to impaired biotin, pantothenate and lipoate uptake. The genetic and phenotypic overlap of these cases confirms mutations in SLC5A6 as the genetic cause of this disease phenotype. Recognition of the genetic disorder caused by SLC5A6 mutations is essential for early diagnosis and to facilitate timely intervention by triple vitamin (biotin, pantothenate, and lipoate) replacement therapy.

        "Repurposing human kinase inhibitors to create an antibiotic active against drug-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, persisters and biofilms. New drugs are desperately needed to combat methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections. Here, we report screening commercial kinase inhibitors for antibacterial activity and found the anticancer drug sorafenib as major hit that effectively kills MRSA strains. Varying the key structural features led to the identification of a potent analogue, PK150, that showed antibacterial activity against several pathogenic strains at submicromolar concentrations. Furthermore, this antibiotic eliminated challenging persisters as well as established biofilms. PK150 holds promising therapeutic potential as it did not induce in vitro resistance, and shows oral bioavailability and in vivo efficacy. Analysis of the mode of action using chemical proteomics revealed several targets, which included interference with menaquinone biosynthesis by inhibiting demethylmenaquinone methyltransferase and the stimulation of protein secretion by altering the activity of signal peptidase IB. Reduced endogenous menaquinone levels along with enhanced levels of extracellular proteins of PK150-treated bacteria support this target hypothesis. The associated antibiotic effects, especially the lack of resistance development, probably stem from the compound's polypharmacology. ",
        "Point-of-Use Detection of Environmental Fluoride via a Cell-Free Riboswitch-Based Biosensor. Advances in biosensor engineering have enabled the design of programmable molecular systems to detect a range of pathogens, nucleic acids, and chemicals. Here, we engineer and field-test a biosensor for fluoride, a major groundwater contaminant of global concern. The sensor consists of a cell-free system containing a DNA template that encodes a fluoride-responsive riboswitch regulating genes that produce a fluorescent or colorimetric output. Individual reactions can be lyophilized for long-term storage and detect fluoride at levels above 2 ppm, the Environmental Protection Agency's most stringent regulatory standard, in both laboratory and field conditions. Through onsite detection of fluoride in a real-world water source, this work provides a critical proof-of-principle for the future engineering of riboswitches and other biosensors to address challenges for global health and the environment.

        "Child and adolescent benzodiazepine exposure and overdose in the United States: 16 years of poison center data. Background: Recently, there has been an increase in prescription drug abuse and related fatalities. Although opioid analgesics are commonly implicated, there have been significant increases in the prevalence of benzodiazepine exposures and overdoses. Objective: To describe national trends in pediatric benzodiazepine exposures from 2000 to 2015. Methods: A retrospective database analysis was conducted. Data regarding benzodiazepine exposures in children ages 0 to <18 years reported to participating United States poison centers from January 2000 through December 2015 were obtained from the National Poison Data System. Population data were obtained from the US Census Bureau to determine annual population estimates. Data were analyzed using chi-square tests. Results: A total of 296,838 pediatric benzodiazepine exposures were identified during the study period. The rate of pediatric benzodiazepine exposure increased 54% between 2000 and 2015. The severity of medical outcomes also increased, as did the prevalence of co-ingestion of multiple drugs, especially in children ages 12 to <18 years. Nearly half of all reported exposures in 2015 were documented as intentional abuse, misuse, or attempted suicide, reflecting a change from prior years. The most commonly identified pediatric benzodiazepines of exposures were alprazolam, clonazepam, and lorazepam. Conclusions: The rate and severity of reported pediatric benzodiazepine exposure is increasing over time. Adolescent exposures are of specific concern, as co-ingestion and intentional abuse were found to be more common in this group. Medical providers and caretakers should be cognizant of this growing epidemic to avoid preventable harm to adolescents, young children, and infants. ",
        "Long-term Changes in Cognitive Functioning in Individuals With Psychotic Disorders: Findings From the Suffolk County Mental Health Project. Importance: It remains uncertain whether people with psychotic disorders experience progressive cognitive decline or normal cognitive aging after first hospitalization. This information is essential for prognostication in clinical settings, deployment of cognitive remediation, and public health policy. Objective: To examine long-term cognitive changes in individuals with psychotic disorders and to compare age-related differences in cognitive performance between people with psychotic disorders and matched control individuals (ie, individuals who had never had psychotic disorders). Design, Setting, and Participants: The Suffolk County Mental Health Project is an inception cohort study of first-admission patients with psychosis. Cognitive functioning was assessed 2 and 20 years later. Patients were recruited from the 12 inpatient facilities of Suffolk County, New York. At year 20, the control group was recruited by random digit dialing and matched to the clinical cohort on zip code and demographics. Data were collected between September 1991 and July 2015. Analysis began January 2016. Main Outcomes and Measures: Change in cognitive functioning in 6 domains: verbal knowledge (Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised vocabulary test), verbal declarative memory (Verbal Paired Associates test I and II), visual declarative memory (Visual Reproduction test I and II), attention and processing speed (Symbol Digit Modalities Test-written and oral; Trail Making Test [TMT]-A), abstraction-executive function (Trenerry Stroop Color Word Test; TMT-B), and verbal fluency (Controlled Oral Word Association Test). Results: A total of 705 participants were included in the analyses (mean [SD] age at year 20, 49.4 [10.1] years): 445 individuals (63.1%) had psychotic disorders (211 with schizophrenia spectrum [138 (65%) male]; 164 with affective psychoses [76 (46%) male]; 70 with other psychoses [43 (61%) male]); and 260 individuals (36.9%) in the control group (50.5 [9.0] years; 134 [51.5%] male). Cognition in individuals with a psychotic disorder declined on all but 2 tests (average decline: d\u2009=\u20090.31; range, 0.17-0.54; all P\u2009<\u2009.001). Cognitive declines were associated with worsening vocational functioning (Visual Reproduction test II: r\u2009=\u20090.20; Symbol Digit Modalities Test-written: r\u2009=\u20090.25; Stroop: r\u2009=\u20090.24; P\u2009<\u2009.009) and worsening negative symptoms (avolition: Symbol Digit Modalities Test-written: r\u2009=\u2009-0.24; TMT-A: r\u2009=\u2009-0.21; Stroop: r\u2009=\u2009-0.21; all P\u2009<\u2009.009; inexpressivity: Stroop: r\u2009=\u2009-0.22; P\u2009<\u2009.009). Compared with control individuals, people with psychotic disrders showed age-dependent deficits in verbal knowledge, fluency, and abstraction-executive function (vocabulary: \u03b2\u2009=\u2009-0.32; Controlled Oral Word Association Test: \u03b2\u2009=\u2009-0.32; TMT-B: \u03b2\u2009=\u20090.23; all P\u2009<\u2009.05), with the largest gap among participants 50 years or older. Conclusions and Relevance: In individuals with psychotic disorders, most cognitive functions declined over 2 decades after first hospitalization. Observed declines were clinically significant. Some declines were larger than expected due to normal aging, suggesting that cognitive aging in some domains may be accelerated in this population. If confirmed, these findings would highlight cognition as an important target for research and treatment during later phases of psychotic illness. ",
        "Super-resolution localization photoacoustic microscopy using intrinsic red blood cells as contrast absorbers. Photoacoustic microscopy (PAM) has become a premier microscopy tool that can provide the anatomical, functional, and molecular information of animals and humans in vivo. However, conventional PAM systems suffer from limited temporal and/or spatial resolution. Here, we present a fast PAM system and an agent-free localization method based on a stable and commercial galvanometer scanner with a custom-made scanning mirror (L-PAM-GS). This novel hardware implementation enhances the temporal resolution significantly while maintaining a high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). These improvements allow us to photoacoustically and noninvasively observe the microvasculatures of small animals and humans in vivo. Furthermore, the functional hemodynamics, namely, the blood flow rate in the microvasculature, is successfully monitored and quantified in vivo. More importantly, thanks to the high SNR and fast B-mode rate (500\u2009Hz), by localizing photoacoustic signals from captured red blood cells without any contrast agent, unresolved microvessels are clearly distinguished, and the spatial resolution is improved by a factor of 2.5 in vivo. L-PAM-GS has great potential in various fields, such as neurology, oncology, and pathology. ",
        "The Sympathetic Nervous System Mitigates CNS Autoimmunity via \u03b22-Adrenergic Receptor Signaling in Immune Cells. Noradrenaline (NE), the main neurotransmitter released by sympathetic nerve terminals, is known to modulate the immune response. However, the role of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) on the development of autoimmune diseases is still unclear. Here, we report that the SNS limits the generation of pathogenic T\u00a0cells and disease development in the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model of multiple sclerosis (MS). \u03b22-Adrenergic receptor (Adrb2) signaling limits T\u00a0cell autoimmunity in EAE through a mechanism mediated by the suppression of IL-2, IFN-\u03b3, and GM-CSF production via inducible cAMP early repressor (ICER). Accordingly, the lack of Adrb2 signaling in immune cells is sufficient to abrogate the suppressive effects of SNS activity, resulting in increased pathogenic T\u00a0cell responses and EAE development. Collectively, these results uncover a suppressive role for the SNS in CNS autoimmunity while they identify potential targets for therapeutic intervention. ",
        "Pregnancy preferences and contraceptive use among US women. OBJECTIVES: An understanding of the relationship between individuals' pregnancy preferences and contraceptive use is essential for appropriate patient-centered counseling and care. We examined the relationship between women's pregnancy preferences and contraceptive use using a new prospective measure, the Desire to Avoid Pregnancy (DAP) scale. STUDY DESIGN: As part of a study examining women's suspicion and confirmation of new pregnancies, we recruited patients aged 15 - 45 from seven reproductive health and primary health facilities in Arizona, New Jersey, New Mexico, South Carolina, and Texas in 2016-2017. We used multivariable logistic, multinomial logistic, and linear regression models to examine the associations among DAP scores (range: 0 - 4) and contraceptive use outcomes and identify factors associated with discordance between DAP and use of contraception. RESULTS: Participants with a greater preference to avoid pregnancy had higher odds of contraceptive use (aOR\u202f=\u202f1.63, 95% CI: 1.31, 2.04) and used contraceptives more consistently (a\u03b2\u202f=\u202f8.9 percentage points, 95% CI: 5.2, 12.7). Nevertheless, 63% of women with low preference to avoid pregnancy reported using a contraceptive method. Higher preference to avoid pregnancy was not associated with type of contraceptive method used: women with the full range of pregnancy preferences reported using all method types. CONCLUSION: When measured using a rigorously developed instrument, pregnancy preferences were associated with contraceptive use and consistency of use. However, our findings challenge assumptions that women with the highest preference against pregnancy use more effective methods and that women who might welcome pregnancy do not use contraception. IMPLICATIONS: Women's preferences about pregnancy contribute significantly to their use of contraception. However, health care providers and researchers should consider that contraceptive features besides effectiveness in preventing pregnancy shape contraceptive decision-making and use. ",
        "Alternative pathway androgen biosynthesis and human fetal female virilization. Androgen biosynthesis in the human fetus proceeds through the adrenal sex steroid precursor dehydroepiandrosterone, which is converted to testosterone in the gonads, followed by further activation to 5\u03b1-dihydrotestosterone in genital skin, thereby facilitating male external genital differentiation. Congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to P450 oxidoreductase deficiency results in disrupted dehydroepiandrosterone biosynthesis, explaining undervirilization in affected boys. However, many affected girls are born virilized, despite low circulating androgens. We hypothesized that this is due to a prenatally active, alternative androgen biosynthesis pathway from 17\u03b1-hydroxyprogesterone to 5\u03b1-dihydrotestosterone, which bypasses dehydroepiandrosterone and testosterone, with increased activity in congenital adrenal hyperplasia variants associated with 17\u03b1-hydroxyprogesterone accumulation. Here we employ explant cultures of human fetal organs (adrenals, gonads, genital skin) from the major period of sexual differentiation and show that alternative pathway androgen biosynthesis is active in the fetus, as assessed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. We found androgen receptor expression in male and female genital skin using immunohistochemistry and demonstrated that both 5\u03b1-dihydrotestosterone and adrenal explant culture supernatant induce nuclear translocation of the androgen receptor in female genital skin primary cultures. Analyzing urinary steroid excretion by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, we show that neonates with P450 oxidoreductase deficiency produce androgens through the alternative androgen pathway during the first weeks of life. We provide quantitative in vitro evidence that the corresponding P450 oxidoreductase mutations predominantly support alternative pathway androgen biosynthesis. These results indicate a key role of alternative pathway androgen biosynthesis in the prenatal virilization of girls affected by congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to P450 oxidoreductase deficiency.

        "Disrupting coupling within mycobacterial F-ATP synthases subunit \u03b5 causes dysregulated energy production and cell wall biosynthesis. The dynamic interaction of the N- and C-terminal domains of mycobacterial F-ATP synthase subunit \u03b5 is proposed to contribute to efficient coupling of H+-translocation and ATP synthesis. Here, we investigate crosstalk between both subunit \u03b5 domains by introducing chromosomal atpC missense mutations in the C-terminal helix 2 of \u03b5 predicted to disrupt inter domain and subunit \u03b5-\u03b1 crosstalk and therefore coupling. The \u03b5 mutant \u03b5R105A,R111A,R113A,R115A (\u03b54A) showed decreased intracellular ATP, slower growth rates and lower molar growth yields on non-fermentable carbon sources. Cellular respiration and metabolism were all accelerated in the mutant strain indicative of dysregulated oxidative phosphorylation. The \u03b54A mutant exhibited an altered colony morphology and was hypersusceptible to cell wall-acting antimicrobials suggesting defective cell wall biosynthesis. In silico screening identified a novel mycobacterial F-ATP synthase inhibitor disrupting \u03b5's coupling activity demonstrating the potential to advance this regulation as a new area for mycobacterial F-ATP synthase inhibitor development.

        "Non-nutritive Sweeteners and Glycaemic Control. PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The consumption of foods and beverages containing non-nutritive sweeteners (NNS) has increased worldwide over the last three decades. Consumers' choice of NNS rather than sugar or other nutritive sweeteners may be attributable to their potential to reduce weight gain. RECENT FINDINGS: It is not clear what the effects of NNS consumption are on glycaemic control and the incidence of type 2 diabetes. This review aims to examine this question in epidemiological, human intervention and animal studies. It is not clear that NNS consumption has an effect on the incidence of type 2 diabetes or on glycaemic control even though there is some evidence for the modification of the microbiome and for interaction with sweet taste receptors in the oral cavity and the intestines' modification of secretion of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), peptide YY (PYY), ghrelin and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), which may affect glycaemia following consumption of NNS. In conclusion, long-term studies of NNS consumption are required to draw a firm conclusion about the role of NNS consumption on glycaemic control. ",
        "Inhibition of Plasmepsin V Activity Blocks Plasmodium falciparum Gametocytogenesis and Transmission to Mosquitoes. Plasmodium falciparum gametocytes infect mosquitoes and are responsible for malaria transmission. New interventions that block transmission could accelerate malaria elimination. Gametocytes develop within erythrocytes and activate protein export pathways that remodel the host cell. Plasmepsin V (PMV) is an aspartyl protease that is required for protein export in asexual parasites, but its function and essentiality in gametocytes has not been definitively proven, nor has PMV been assessed as a transmission-blocking drug target. Here, we show that PMV is expressed and can be inhibited specifically in P.\u00a0falciparum stage I-II gametocytes. PMV inhibitors block processing and export of gametocyte effector proteins and inhibit development of stage II-V gametocytes. Gametocytogenesis in the presence of sublethal inhibitor concentrations results in stage V gametocytes that fail to infect mosquitoes. Therefore, PMV primes gametocyte effectors for export, which is essential for the development and fitness of gametocytes for transmission to mosquitoes. ",
        "3D bioprinting of liver spheroids derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells sustain liver function and viability in vitro. The liver is responsible for many metabolic, endocrine and exocrine functions. Approximately 2 million deaths per year are associated with liver failure. Modern 3D bioprinting technologies allied with autologous induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS)-derived grafts could represent a relevant tissue engineering approach to treat end stage liver disease patients. However, protocols that accurately recapitulates liver's epithelial parenchyma through bioprinting are still underdeveloped. Here we evaluated the impacts of using single cell dispersion (i.e. obtained from conventional bidimensional differentiation) of iPS-derived parenchymal (i.e. hepatocyte-like cells) versus using iPS-derived hepatocyte-like cells spheroids (i.e. three-dimensional cell culture), both in combination with non-parenchymal cells (e.g. mesenchymal and endothelial cells), into final liver tissue functionality. Single cell constructs showed reduced cell survival and hepatic function and unbalanced protein/amino acid metabolism when compared to spheroid printed constructs after 18 days in culture. In addition, single cell printed constructs revealed epithelial-mesenchymal transition, resulting in rapid loss of hepatocyte phenotype. These results indicates the advantage of using spheroid-based bioprinting, contributing to improve current liver bioprinting technology towards future regenerative medicine applications and liver physiology and disease modeling.

        "Nilotinib Effects on Safety, Tolerability, and Potential Biomarkers in Parkinson Disease: A Phase 2 Randomized Clinical Trial. Importance: This study evaluated nilotinib safety and its effects on biomarkers as a potential disease-modifying drug in Parkinson disease. Objectives: To assess nilotinib effects on safety and pharmacokinetics and measure the change in exploratory biomarkers in patients with moderately severe Parkinson disease. Design, Setting, and Participants: This was a single-center, phase 2, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial with 300 patients approached in clinic; of these, 200 declined to participate, 100 were screened, 25 were excluded, and 75 were randomized 1:1:1 into placebo; nilotinib, 150-mg; or nilotinib, 300-mg groups. Recruitment started on May 17, 2017, and ended April 28, 2018, and follow-up ended August 10, 2019. Parkinson disease was confirmed according to the UK Brain Bank diagnostic criteria and symptoms were stabilized with use of optimal levodopa and/or dopamine agonists and other medications used in Parkinson disease. Interventions: Nilotinib vs placebo, administered orally once daily for 12 months followed by a 3-month washout period. Main Outcomes and Measures: It was hypothesized that nilotinib is safe and can be detected in the cerebrospinal fluid, where it alters exploratory biomarkers via inhibition of Abelson tyrosine kinase and potentially improves clinical outcomes. Results: Of the 75 patients included in the study, 55 were men (73.3%); mean (SD) age was 68.4 (8.2) years. Doses of 150 or 300 mg of nilotinib were reasonably safe, although more serious adverse events were detected in the nilotinib (150 mg: 6 [24%]; 300 mg: 12 [48%]) vs placebo (4 [16%]) groups. The 150-mg nilotinib group showed an increase in cerebrospinal fluid levels of the dopamine metabolites homovanillic acid (159.80nM; 90% CI, 7.04-312.60nM; P\u2009=\u2009.04) and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (4.87nM; 90% CI, 1.51-8.23nM; P\u2009=\u2009.01), and the 300-mg nilotinib group showed an increase in 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (7.52nM; 90% CI, 2.35-12.69nM; P\u2009=\u2009.01). The nilotinib 150-mg but not the nilotinib 300-mg group demonstrated a reduction of \u03b1-synuclein oligomers (-0.04 pg/mL; 90% CI, -0.08 to 0.01 pg/mL; P\u2009=\u2009.03). A significant reduction of hyperphosphorylated tau levels was seen in the nilotinib 150-mg (-10.04 pg/mL; 90% CI, -17.41 to -2.67 pg/mL; P\u2009=\u2009.01) and nilotinib 300-mg (-12.05 pg/mL; 90% CI, -19.21 to -4.90 pg/mL; P\u2009=\u2009.01) groups. Conclusions and Relevance: In this study, nilotinib appeared to be reasonably safe and detectable in the cerebrospinal fluid. Exploratory biomarkers were altered in response to nilotinib. Taken together, these data will guide the development of a phase 3 study to investigate the effects of nilotinib therapy in patients with Parkinson disease.

        "Isoniazid and Rifapentine Treatment Eradicates Persistent Mycobacterium tuberculosis in Macaques. Rationale: Direct evidence for persistence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) during asymptomatic latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) in humans is currently lacking. Moreover, although a 12-week regimen of once-weekly isoniazid and rifapentine (3HP) is currently recommended by the CDC as treatment for LTBI, experimental evidence for 3HP-mediated clearance of persistent Mtb infection in human lungs has not been established.Objectives: Using a nonhuman primate (NHP) model of TB, we sought to assess 3HP treatment-mediated clearance of Mtb infection in latently infected macaques.Methods: Sixteen NHPs were infected via inhalation with \u223c10 cfu of Mtb CDC1551, after which asymptomatic animals were either treated with 3HP or left untreated. Pharmacokinetics of the 3HP regimen were measured. Following treatment, animals were coinfected with simian immunodeficiency virus to assess reactivation of LTBI and development of active TB disease.Measurements and Main Results: Fourteen NHPs remained free of clinical signs or microbiological evidence of active TB following infection with Mtb and were subsequently either treated with 3HP (n\u2009=\u20097) or left untreated (n\u2009=\u20097). Untreated NHPs were asymptomatic for 7 months but harbored persistent Mtb infection, as shown by reactivation of latent infection following simian immunodeficiency virus coinfection. However, none of the treated animals developed TB reactivation disease, and they remained without clinical or microbiological evidence of persistent bacilli, suggesting treatment-mediated clearance of bacteria.Conclusions:Mtb can persist in asymptomatic macaques for at least 7 months. Furthermore, 3HP treatment effectively cleared bacteria and prevented reactivation of TB in latently infected macaques. ",
        "High fat diet induces microbiota-dependent silencing of enteroendocrine cells. Enteroendocrine cells (EECs) are specialized sensory cells in the intestinal epithelium that sense and transduce nutrient information. Consumption of dietary fat contributes to metabolic disorders, but EEC adaptations to high fat feeding were unknown. Here, we established a new experimental system to directly investigate EEC activity in vivo using a zebrafish reporter of EEC calcium signaling. Our results reveal that high fat feeding alters EEC morphology and converts them into a nutrient insensitive state that is coupled to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. We called this novel adaptation 'EEC silencing'. Gnotobiotic studies revealed that germ-free zebrafish are resistant to high fat diet induced EEC silencing. High fat feeding altered gut microbiota composition including enrichment of Acinetobacter bacteria, and we identified an Acinetobacter strain sufficient to induce EEC silencing. These results establish a new mechanism by which dietary fat and gut microbiota modulate EEC nutrient sensing and signaling. ",
        "Aging-related changes in fluid intelligence, muscle and adipose mass, and sex-specific immunologic mediation: A longitudinal UK Biobank study. BACKGROUND: Obesity in midlife and early late-life is associated with worse normal cognitive aging. Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) suggests that visceral adipose mass (VAM) plays a predominant role, whereas non-visceral adipose mass (NVAM) and lean muscle mass (LMM) have shown conflicting relationships. It is unknown how longitudinal, cognitive changes in age-sensitive domains like fluid intelligence (FI) correspond to VAM, NVAM, and LMM in women and men. Furthermore, changes over time in blood leukocyte sub-populations may partially or fully account for sex-specific associations. METHODS: Data on 4431 late middle-aged, cognitively unimpaired adults (mean\u202f=\u202f64.5\u202fy) was obtained from the UK Biobank prospective cohort across 22 centers. FI scores, blood leukocyte counts, and covariates (age, social class, education) were measured at three 2-year intervals over 6\u202fyears. DEXA collection overlapped with these intervals. Sex-stratified growth curves, structural equations, and Preacher-Hayes mediation were used to estimate direct and indirect effects. \u03b2-weights were standardized. RESULTS: More LMM predicted gains in FI scores among women (\u03b2\u202f=\u202f0.130, p\u202f<\u202f.001) and men (\u03b2\u202f=\u202f0.089, p\u202f<\u202f.001). Conversely, more VAM and NVAM independently predicted FI decline equally among sexes (e.g., NVAM: women: \u03b2\u202f=\u202f-0.082, p\u202f<\u202f.001; men: \u03b2\u202f=\u202f-0.076, p\u202f<\u202f.001). Among women, FI associations were fully mediated by higher eosinophil counts via VAM (\u03bb\u202f=\u202f30.8%, p\u202f=\u202f.028) and lower lymphocyte counts via LMM (\u03bb\u202f=\u202f69.2%, p\u202f=\u202f.021). Among men, FI associations were partially mediated by lower basophils counts via LMM (\u03bb\u202f=\u202f4.5%, p\u202f=\u202f.042) and higher counts via VAM (\u03bb\u202f=\u202f50%, p\u202f=\u202f.037). CONCLUSION: The proportion of LMM and VAM equally influenced male FI changes over 6\u202fyears, whereas higher LMM among women appeared to more strongly influence. FI changes. Leukocyte counts strongly mediated VAM- and LMM-related FI changes in a sex-specific manner, but not for NVAM. For clinical translation, exercise studies in older adults may benefit from assessing sex-specific values of DEXA-based tissue mass, FI, and leukocyte sub-populations to gauge potential cognitive benefits of less VAM and more LMM.

        "Plasma Lipidome and Prediction of Type 2 Diabetes in the Population-Based Malm\u00f6 Diet and Cancer Cohort. OBJECTIVE: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is associated with dyslipidemia, but the detailed alterations in lipid species preceding the disease are largely unknown. We aimed to identify plasma lipids associated with development of T2DM and investigate their associations with lifestyle. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: At baseline, 178 lipids were measured by mass spectrometry in 3,668 participants without diabetes from the Malm\u00f6 Diet and Cancer Study. The population was randomly split into discovery (n = 1,868, including 257 incident cases) and replication (n = 1,800, including 249 incident cases) sets. We used orthogonal projections to latent structures discriminant analyses, extracted a predictive component for T2DM incidence (lipid-PCDM), and assessed its association with T2DM incidence using Cox regression and lifestyle factors using general linear models. RESULTS: A T2DM-predictive lipid-PCDM derived from the discovery set was independently associated with T2DM incidence in the replication set, with hazard ratio (HR) among subjects in the fifth versus first quintile of lipid-PCDM of 3.7 (95% CI 2.2-6.5). In comparison, the HR of T2DM among obese versus normal weight subjects was 1.8 (95% CI 1.2-2.6). Clinical lipids did not improve T2DM risk prediction, but adding the lipid-PCDM to all conventional T2DM risk factors increased the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve by 3%. The lipid-PCDM was also associated with a dietary risk score for T2DM incidence and lower level of physical activity. CONCLUSIONS: A lifestyle-related lipidomic profile strongly predicts T2DM development beyond current risk factors. Further studies are warranted to test if lifestyle interventions modifying this lipidomic profile can prevent T2DM. ",
        "A Versatile ES Cell-Based Melanoma Mouse Modeling Platform. The cumbersome and time-consuming process of generating new mouse strains and multiallelic experimental animals often hinders the use of genetically engineered mouse models (GEMM) in cancer research. Here, we describe the development and validation of an embryonic stem cell (ESC)-GEMM platform for rapid modeling of melanoma in mice. The platform incorporates 12 clinically relevant genotypes composed of combinations of four driver alleles (LSL-BrafV600E, LSL-NrasQ61R, PtenFlox, and Cdkn2aFlox) and regulatory alleles to spatiotemporally control the perturbation of genes of interest. The ESCs produce high-contribution chimeras, which recapitulate the melanoma phenotypes of conventionally bred mice. Using the ESC-GEMM platform to modulate Pten expression in melanocytes in vivo, we highlighted the utility and advantages of gene depletion by CRISPR-Cas9, RNAi, or conditional knockout for melanoma modeling. Moreover, complementary genetic methods demonstrated the impact of Pten restoration on the prevention and maintenance of Pten-deficient melanomas. Finally, we showed that chimera-derived melanoma cell lines retain regulatory allele competency and are a powerful resource to complement ESC-GEMM chimera experiments in vitro and in syngeneic grafts in vivo Thus, when combined with sophisticated genetic tools, the ESC-GEMM platform enables rapid, high-throughput, and versatile studies aimed at addressing outstanding questions in melanoma biology.Significance: This study presents a high-throughput and versatile ES cell-based mouse modeling platform that can be combined with state-of-the-art genetic tools to address unanswered questions in melanoma in vivoSee related commentary by Thorkelsson et al., p. 655.

        "Multi-input Synapses, but Not LTP-Strengthened Synapses, Correlate with Hippocampal Memory Storage in Aged Mice. Long-lasting changes at synapses enable memory storage in the brain. Although aging is associated with impaired memory formation, it is not known whether the synaptic underpinnings of memory storage differ with age. Using a training schedule that results in the same behavioral memory formation in young and aged mice, we examined synapse ultrastructure and molecular signaling in the hippocampus after contextual fear conditioning. Only in young, but not old mice, contextual fear memory formation was associated with synaptic changes that characterize well-known, long-term potentiation, a strengthening of existing synapses with one input. Instead, old-age memory was correlated with generation of multi-innervated dendritic spines (MISs), which are predominantly two-input synapses formed by the attraction of an additional excitatory, presynaptic terminal onto an existing synapse. Accordingly, a blocker used to inhibit MIS generation impaired contextual fear memory only in old mice. Our results reveal how the synaptic basis of hippocampal memory storage changes with age and suggest that these distinct memory-storing mechanisms may explain impaired updating in old age. ",
        "Appropriate medical management of chronic rhinosinusitis reduces use of antibiotics and oral corticosteroids. OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: Antibiotics and oral corticosteroids are used in the treatment of acute exacerbations of chronic rhinosinusitis (AECRS) and reflect poor disease control. We sought to characterize utilization of these systemic medications after appropriate medical management of chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS). STUDY DESIGN: Prospective observational study. METHODS: One hundred fifty patients undergoing medical management for CRS were studied. Data were collected at enrollment and follow-up 3 to 12 months later. All patients were asked to report the number of CRS-related antibiotics and oral corticosteroids used in the last 3 months. CRS symptom burden was measured using the 22-item Sino-Nasal Outcome Test (SNOT-22). Associations were sought between CRS-related antibiotics and oral corticosteroids use at follow-up compared to enrollment. RESULTS: From enrollment to follow-up, the mean number of CRS-related antibiotics courses used decreased by 0.2 courses (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.1-0.4, P =\u2009.012), and the mean number of CRS-related oral corticosteroid courses used also decreased by 0.2 courses (95% CI: 0.1-0.3, P =\u2009.029). The number of CRS-related antibiotics used at follow-up was associated with CRS-related antibiotic use at enrollment (adjusted rate ratio [RR] = 1.58, 95% CI: 1.17-2.13, P =\u2009.003). The number of CRS-related oral corticosteroids used at follow-up was associated with reported CRS-related oral corticosteroid use at enrollment (adjusted RR = 3.20, 95% CI: 1.69-6.07, P <\u2009.001). SNOT-22 results at enrollment were also not predictive of future systemic medication use. CONCLUSIONS: Appropriate medical management of CRS is associated with decreased use of oral antibiotics and corticosteroids. Previous utilization of antibiotics and oral corticosteroids for CRS is associated with future use of these medications. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 2c Laryngoscope, 2019. ",
        "Physiological Signature of Memory Age in the Prefrontal-Hippocampal Circuit. The long-term storage of episodic memory requires communication between prefrontal cortex and hippocampus. However, how consolidation alters dynamic interactions between these regions during subsequent recall remains unexplored. Here we perform simultaneous electrophysiological recordings from anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and hippocampal CA1 in mice during recall of recent and remote contextual fear memory. We find that, in contrast to recent memory, remote memory recall is accompanied by increased ACC-CA1 synchronization at multiple frequency bands. The augmented ACC-CA1 interaction is associated with strengthened coupling among distally spaced CA1 neurons, suggesting an ACC-driven organization of a sparse code. This robust shift in physiology permits a support vector machine classifier to accurately determine memory age on the basis of the ACC-CA1 synchronization pattern. Our findings reveal that memory consolidation alters the dynamic coupling of the prefrontal-hippocampal circuit and results in a physiological signature of memory age. ",
        "Designing and Disseminating Metrics to Support Jurisdictional Efforts to End the Public Health Threat Posed by HIV Epidemics. The US Department of Health and Human Services has launched a large-scale plan that aims to \"End the HIV Epidemic\" (EtHE) in America, including ambitious goals and targets over the next 5 to 10 years.To be successful, the EtHE Plan will require timely dissemination of relevant metrics to inform the broad array of stakeholders who are in a position to act in support of the plan's goals. Metrics should include both population health outcome metrics and implementation metrics that track the deployment and uptake of specific intervention delivery strategies. In addition to the usual HIV care continuum metrics that include all people living with HIV in the denominator, metrics dedicated to those not yet reached (i.e., as the denominator) are essential to help target EtHE implementation efforts. Special attention is required around metrics and targets that inform and drive action on HIV-related health disparities.Well-chosen metrics and a well-designed dissemination system can serve as important tools to assess the progress of the EtHE Plan, and to identify and disseminate lessons learned quickly within and across jurisdictions aiming to end HIV as a local public health threat.

        "Suggestions for improving the design of clinical trials in multiple sclerosis-results of a systematic analysis of completed phase III trials. This manuscript reviews the primary and secondary endpoints of pivotal phase III trials with immunomodulatory drugs in multiple sclerosis (MS). Considering the limitations of previous trial designs, we propose new standards for the planning of clinical trials, taking into account latest insights into MS pathophysiology and patient-relevant aspects. Using a systematic overview of published phase III (pivotal) trials performed as part of application for drug market approval, we evaluate the following characteristics: trial duration, number of trial participants, comparators, and endpoints (primary, secondary, magnetic resonance imaging outcome, and patient-reported outcomes). From a patient perspective, the primary and secondary endpoints of clinical trials are only partially relevant. High-quality trial data pertaining to efficacy and safety that stretch beyond the time frame of pivotal trials are almost non-existent. Understanding of long-term benefits and risks of disease-modifying MS therapy is largely lacking. Concrete proposals for the trial designs of relapsing (remitting) multiple sclerosis/clinically isolated syndrome, primary progressive multiple sclerosis, and secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (e.g., study duration, mechanism of action, and choice of endpoints) are presented based on the results of the systematic overview. Given the increasing number of available immunotherapies, the therapeutic strategy in MS has shifted from a mere \"relapse-prevention\" approach to a personalized provision of medical care as to the choice of the appropriate drugs and their sequential application over the course of the disease. This personalized provision takes patient preferences as well as disease-related factors into consideration such as objective clinical and radiographic findings but also very burdensome symptoms such as fatigue, depression, and cognitive impairment. Future trial designs in MS will have to assign higher relevance to these patient-reported outcomes and will also have to implement surrogate measures that can serve as predictive markers for individual treatment response to new and investigational immunotherapies. This is an indispensable prerequisite to maximize the benefit of individual patients when participating in clinical trials. Moreover, such appropriate trial designs and suitable enrolment criteria that correspond to the mode of action of the study drug will facilitate targeted prevention of adverse events, thus mitigating risks for individual study participants.

        "Genicular Artery Embolization for the Treatment of Knee Pain Secondary to Osteoarthritis. PURPOSE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of embolization of hyperemic synovial tissue for the treatment of knee pain secondary to osteoarthritis (OA). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty patients with radiographic knee OA and moderate-to-severe pain refractory to conservative therapy were enrolled in a prospective, 2-site pilot study. Genicular artery embolization (GAE) was performed with 75- or 100-\u03bcm spherical particles. Patients were assessed with magnetic resonance imaging at baseline and at 1 month and with the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) and the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) at baseline and at 1, 3, and 6 months. Adverse events were recorded at all timepoints. RESULTS: Embolization of at least 1 genicular artery was achieved in 20/20 (100%) patients. Mean VAS improved from 76 mm \u00b1 14 at baseline to 29 mm \u00b1 27 at 6-month follow-up (P < .01). Mean WOMAC score improved from 61 \u00b1 12 at baseline to 29 \u00b1 27 at 6-month follow-up (P < .01). Self-limiting skin discoloration occurred in 13/20 (65%) patients. Two of 20 (10%) patients developed plantar sensory paresthesia that resolved within 14 days. CONCLUSIONS: GAE to treat knee pain secondary to OA can be performed safely and demonstrates potential efficacy. Further randomized comparative studies are needed to determine true treatment effect versus placebo effect. ",
        "The E3\u00a0Ubiquitin Ligase Mind Bomb 1 Controls Adenovirus Genome Release at the Nuclear Pore Complex. Adenoviruses (AdVs) cause respiratory, ocular, and gastrointestinal tract infection and inflammation in\u00a0immunocompetent people and life-threatening disease upon immunosuppression. AdV vectors are\u00a0widely used in gene therapy and vaccination. Incoming particles attach to nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) of post-mitotic cells, then rupture and deliver viral DNA (vDNA) to the nucleus or misdeliver to the cytosol. Our genome-wide RNAi screen in AdV-infected cells identified the RING-type E3 ubiquitin ligase Mind bomb 1 (Mib1) as a proviral host factor for AdV infection. Mib1 is implicated in Notch-Delta signaling, ciliary biogenesis, and RNA innate immunity. Mib1 depletion arrested incoming AdVs at NPCs. Induced expression of full-length but not ligase-defective Mib1 in knockout cells triggered vDNA uncoating from NPC-tethered virions, nuclear import, misdelivery of vDNA, and vDNA expression. Mib1 is an essential host factor for AdV uncoating in human cells, and it provides a new concept for licensing virion DNA delivery through the NPC. ",
        "Mechanism of synergistic actin filament pointed end depolymerization by cyclase-associated protein and cofilin. The ability of cells to generate forces through actin filament turnover was an early adaptation in evolution. While much is known about how actin filaments grow, mechanisms of their disassembly are incompletely understood. The best-characterized actin disassembly factors are the cofilin family proteins, which increase cytoskeletal dynamics by severing actin filaments. However, the mechanism by which severed actin filaments are recycled back to monomeric form has remained enigmatic. We report that cyclase-associated-protein (CAP) works in synergy with cofilin to accelerate actin filament depolymerization by nearly 100-fold. Structural work uncovers the molecular mechanism by which CAP interacts with actin filament pointed end to destabilize the interface between terminal actin subunits, and subsequently recycles the newly-depolymerized actin monomer for the\u00a0next round of filament assembly. These findings establish CAP as a molecular machine promoting rapid actin filament depolymerization and monomer recycling, and explain why CAP is critical for actin-dependent processes in all eukaryotes.

        "A transcriptome-based signature of pathological angiogenesis predicts breast cancer patient survival. The specific genes and molecules that drive physiological angiogenesis differ from those involved in pathological angiogenesis, suggesting distinct mechanisms for these seemingly related processes. Unveiling genes and pathways preferentially associated with pathologic angiogenesis is key to understanding its mechanisms, thereby facilitating development of novel approaches to managing angiogenesis-dependent diseases. To better understand these different processes, we elucidated the transcriptome of the mouse retina in the well-accepted oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR) model of pathological angiogenesis. We identified 153 genes changed between normal and OIR retinas, which represent a molecular signature relevant to other angiogenesis-dependent processes such as cancer. These genes robustly predict the survival of breast cancer patients, which was validated in an independent 1,000-patient test cohort (40% difference in 15-year survival; p = 2.56 x 10-21). These results suggest that the OIR model reveals key genes involved in pathological angiogenesis, and these may find important applications in stratifying tumors for treatment intensification or for angiogenesis-targeted therapies.

        "Confirmation bias in the utilization of others' opinion strength. Humans tend to discount information that undermines past choices and judgments. This confirmation bias has significant impact on domains ranging from politics to science and education. Little is known about the mechanisms underlying this fundamental characteristic of belief formation. Here we report a mechanism underlying the confirmation bias. Specifically, we provide evidence for a failure to use the strength of others' disconfirming opinions to alter confidence in judgments, but adequate use when opinions are confirmatory. This bias is related to reduced neural sensitivity to the strength of others' opinions in the posterior medial prefrontal cortex when opinions are disconfirming. Our results demonstrate that existing judgments alter the neural representation of information strength, leaving the individual less likely to alter opinions in the face of disagreement. ",

        "A rotifer-derived paralytic compound prevents transmission of schistosomiasis to a mammalian host. Schistosomes are parasitic flatworms that infect over 200 million people, causing the neglected tropical disease, schistosomiasis. A single drug, praziquantel, is used to treat schistosome infection. Limitations in mass drug administration programs and the emergence of schistosomiasis in nontropical areas indicate the need for new strategies to prevent infection. It has been known for several decades that rotifers colonizing the schistosome's snail intermediate host produce a water-soluble factor that paralyzes cercariae, the life cycle stage infecting humans. In spite of its potential for preventing infection, the nature of this factor has remained obscure. Here, we report the purification and chemical characterization of Schistosome Paralysis Factor (SPF), a novel tetracyclic alkaloid produced by the rotifer Rotaria rotatoria. We show that this compound paralyzes schistosome cercariae and prevents infection and does so more effectively than analogous compounds. This molecule provides new directions for understanding cercariae motility and new strategies for preventing schistosome infection. ",

The strengths and pitfalls of each approach are discussed and criticized. Future perspective with relation to the information and communication era is presented and discussed. ",
        "Default mode-visual network hypoconnectivity in an autism subtype with pronounced social visual engagement difficulties. Social visual engagement difficulties are hallmark early signs of autism (ASD) and are easily quantified using eye tracking methods. However, it is unclear how these difficulties are linked to atypical early functional brain organization in ASD. With resting state fMRI data in a large sample of ASD toddlers and other non-ASD comparison groups, we find ASD-related functional hypoconnnectivity between 'social brain' circuitry such as the default mode network (DMN) and visual and attention networks. An eye tracking-identified ASD subtype with pronounced early social visual engagement difficulties (GeoPref ASD) is characterized by marked DMN-occipito-temporal cortex (OTC) hypoconnectivity. Increased DMN-OTC hypoconnectivity is also related to increased severity of social-communication difficulties, but only in GeoPref ASD. Early and pronounced social-visual circuit hypoconnectivity is a key underlying neurobiological feature describing GeoPref ASD and may be critical for future social-communicative development and represent new treatment targets for early intervention in these individuals.

        "Tissue-type plasminogen activator-primed human iPSC-derived neural progenitor cells promote motor recovery after severe spinal cord injury. The goal of stem cell therapy for spinal cord injury (SCI) is to restore motor function without exacerbating pain. Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) may be administered by autologous transplantation, avoiding immunologic challenges. Identifying strategies to optimize iPSC-derived neural progenitor cells (hiNPC) for cell transplantation is an important objective. Herein, we report a method that takes advantage of the growth factor-like and anti-inflammatory activities of the fibrinolysis protease, tissue plasminogen activator tPA, without effects on hemostasis. We demonstrate that conditioning hiNPC with enzymatically-inactive tissue-type plasminogen activator (EI-tPA), prior to grafting into a T3 lesion site in a clinically relevant severe SCI model, significantly improves motor outcomes. EI-tPA-primed hiNPC grafted into lesion sites survived, differentiated, acquired markers of motor neuron maturation, and extended \u03b2III-tubulin-positive axons several spinal segments below the lesion. Importantly, only SCI rats that received EI-tPA primed hiNPC demonstrated significantly improved motor function, without exacerbating pain. When hiNPC were treated with EI-tPA in culture, NMDA-R-dependent cell signaling was initiated, expression of genes associated with stemness (Nestin, Sox2) was regulated, and thrombin-induced cell death was prevented. EI-tPA emerges as a novel agent capable of improving the efficacy of stem cell therapy in SCI. ",
        "Connections between viewing media about President Trump's dietary habits and fast food consumption intentions: Political differences and implications for public health. A nationally representative sample (N\u00a0=\u00a01050) responded to a survey testing possible connections between Americans' attention to media about President Donald J. Trump's preference for fast food, their perceptions of Trump, and public perceptions and behavioral intentions regarding fast food consumption. This survey utilized measures aimed at integrating theory about audience responses to celebrity health issues with the Theory of Planned Behavior and found a significant positive relationship between attention to media about Trump's diet and perceptions that fast food is socially acceptable, as well as intentions to consume it. Some, but not all, media-related variables in the analyses were positively associated with fast food perceptions and intentions, even after controlling for demographic and psychosocial factors. Attention to media specifically about Trump's dietary habits was more often associated with fast food-related perceptions and outcomes than were other types of media attention. Additionally, having a positive parasocial relationship with Trump was positively associated with increased perceived acceptability of fast food. There were also differences in the connections between attention to media about Trump's diet, parasocial relationships with Trump, and fast food perceptions and consumption intentions for audiences with different political affiliations. For instance, attention to media about Trump in general was positively associated with more positive attitudes toward fast food for Republicans, but not for Democrats are those unaffiliated with either political party. Attention to media specifically about Trump's diet was positively related to fast food attitudes for both Republicans and Democrats but not unaffiliated individuals. This study demonstrates the important role of social, political, and media influences in shaping fast food related perceptions and preferences and offers many potential avenues for future research in this area.

        "T cells instruct myeloid cells to produce inflammasome-independent IL-1\u03b2 and cause autoimmunity. The cytokine interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2 is a key mediator of antimicrobial immunity as well as autoimmune inflammation. Production of IL-1\u03b2 requires transcription by innate immune receptor signaling and maturational cleavage by inflammasomes. Whether this mechanism applies to IL-1\u03b2 production seen in T cell-driven autoimmune diseases remains unclear. Here, we describe an inflammasome-independent pathway of IL-1\u03b2 production that was triggered upon cognate interactions between effector CD4+ T cells and mononuclear phagocytes (MPs). The cytokine TNF produced by activated CD4+ T cells engaged its receptor TNFR on MPs, leading to pro-IL-1\u03b2 synthesis. Membrane-bound FasL, expressed by CD4+ T cells, activated death receptor Fas signaling in MPs, resulting in caspase-8-dependent pro-IL-1\u03b2 cleavage. The T cell-instructed IL-1\u03b2 resulted in systemic inflammation, whereas absence of TNFR or Fas signaling protected mice from CD4+ T cell-driven autoimmunity. The TNFR-Fas-caspase-8-dependent pathway provides a mechanistic explanation for IL-1\u03b2 production and its consequences in CD4+ T cell-driven autoimmune pathology. ",
        "Toll-like Receptor Signaling Rewires Macrophage Metabolism and Promotes Histone Acetylation via ATP-Citrate Lyase. Toll-like receptor (TLR) activation induces inflammatory responses in macrophages by activating temporally defined transcriptional cascades. Whether concurrent changes in the cellular metabolism that occur upon TLR activation influence the quality of the transcriptional responses remains unknown. Here, we investigated how macrophages adopt their metabolism early after activation to regulate TLR-inducible gene induction. Shortly after TLR4 activation, macrophages increased glycolysis and tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle volume. Metabolic tracing studies revealed that TLR signaling redirected metabolic fluxes to generate acetyl-Coenzyme A (CoA) from glucose resulting in augmented histone acetylation. Signaling through the adaptor proteins MyD88 and TRIF resulted in activation of ATP-citrate lyase, which in turn facilitated the induction of distinct LPS-inducible gene sets. We postulate that metabolic licensing of histone acetylation provides another layer of control that serves to fine-tune transcriptional responses downstream of TLR activation. Our work highlights the potential of targeting the metabolic-epigenetic axis in inflammatory settings. ",
        "Sustained weight loss and risk of breast cancer in women \u226550 years: a pooled analysis of prospective data. BACKGROUND: Excess body weight is an established cause of postmenopausal breast cancer, but it is unknown if weight loss reduces risk. METHODS: Associations between weight change and risk of breast cancer were examined among women aged \u226550 years in the Pooling Project of Prospective Studies of Diet and Cancer. In 10 cohorts, weight assessed on three surveys was used to examine weight change patterns over approximately 10 years (Interval 1 median= 5.2 years; Interval 2 median = 4.0 years). Sustained weight loss was defined as\u2009\u2265\u20092kg lost in Interval 1 that was not regained in Interval 2. Among 180,885 women, 6,930 invasive breast cancers were identified during follow-up. RESULTS: Compared with women with stable weight (\u00b1 2kg), women with sustained weight loss had a lower risk of breast cancer. This risk reduction was linear and specific to women not using postmenopausal hormones (>2-4.5kg lost: Hazard Ratio (HR)= 0.82, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.70-0.96; >4.5-<9kg lost: HR\u2009=\u20090.75, 95% CI: 0.63-0.90; \u22659kg lost: HR\u2009=\u20090.68, 95% CI: 0.50-0.93). Women who lost \u22659kg and gained some (but not all) of it back were also at a lower risk of breast cancer. Other patterns of weight loss and gain over the two intervals had a similar risk of breast cancer to women with stable weight. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that sustained weight loss, even modest amounts, is associated with lower breast cancer risk for women aged \u226550 years. Breast cancer prevention may be a strong weight loss motivator for the two-thirds of American women who are overweight or obese. ",
        "Disease-specific alteration of karyopherin-\u03b1 subtype establishes feed-forward oncogenic signaling in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. Nuclear import, mediated in part by karyopherin-\u03b1 (KPNA)/importin-\u03b1 subtypes, regulates transcription factor access to the genome and determines cell fate. However, the cancer-specific changes of KPNA subtypes and the relevancy in cancer biology remain largely unknown. Here, we report that KPNA4, encoding karyopherin-\u03b14 (KPNA4), is exclusively amplified and overexpressed in head and neck of squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Depletion of KPNA4 attenuated nuclear localization signal-dependent transport activity and suppressed malignant phenotypes and induced epidermal differentiation. Mechanistically, KPNA4-mediated nuclear transport of Ras-responsive element-binding protein (RREB1), which sustains Ras/ERK pathway signaling through repressing miR-143/145 expression. Notably, MAPK signaling enhanced trafficking activity of KPNA4 via phosphorylation of KPNA4 at Ser60. These data reveal that KPNA4 establishes a feed-forward cascade that potentiates Ras/ERK signaling in HNSCC. ",
        "Towards the application of Tc toxins as a universal protein translocation system. Tc toxins are bacterial protein complexes that inject cytotoxic enzymes into target cells using a syringe-like mechanism. Tc toxins are composed of a membrane translocator and a cocoon that encapsulates a toxic enzyme. The toxic enzyme varies between Tc toxins from different species and is not conserved. Here, we investigate whether the toxic enzyme can be replaced by other small proteins of different origin and properties, namely Cdc42, herpes simplex virus ICP47, Arabidopsis thaliana iLOV, Escherichia coli DHFR, Ras-binding domain of CRAF kinase, and TEV protease. Using a combination of electron microscopy, X-ray crystallography and in vitro translocation assays, we demonstrate that it is possible to turn Tc toxins into customizable molecular syringes for delivering proteins of interest across membranes. We also infer the guidelines that protein cargos must obey in terms of size, charge, and fold in order to apply Tc toxins as a universal protein translocation system. ",
        "Green spaces, excess weight and obesity in Spain. BACKGROUND: The epidemiological evidence on green spaces and obesity is inconsistent. OBJECTIVES: To study the association of access to green spaces and surrounding greenness with obesity in Spain. METHODS: We enrolled 2354 individuals 20-85 years from urban areas of seven provinces of Spain between 2008-13. Subjects were randomly selected population controls of the MCC-Spain case-control study. We geocoded current residences and defined exposures in a buffer of 300\u202fm around them: i) access to green space, identified using Urban Atlas, and ii) levels of surrounding greenness, measured by the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index. We examined excess weight/obesity as binary outcomes based on body mass index and waist-hip ratio. We examined effect modification by genetic factors, sex and individual socio-economic status and mediation by physical activity and concentrations of PM2.5 and NO2. To assess potential effect modification by genetic factors, we used a polygenic risk score based on obesity polymorphisms detected in genome-wide association studies. We used logistic mixed-effects models with a random effect for catchment area adjusted for potential confounders. RESULTS: Access to green space was associated with a reduced risk of excess weight/obesity after adjusting for confounders [excess weight: OR (95%CI)\u202f=\u202f0.82 (0.63, 1.07), p-value\u202f=\u202f0.143; abdominal obesity: OR (95%CI)\u202f=\u202f0.68 (0.45, 1.01), p-value\u202f=\u202f0.057]. In the stratified analysis, this association was only observed in women. Associations between surrounding greenness and excess weight/obesity were null or modest based on a 1 IQR increase in NDVI [excess weight: OR (95%CI)\u202f=\u202f0.99 (0.88, 1.11), p-value\u202f=\u202f0.875; abdominal obesity: OR (95%CI)\u202f=\u202f0.91 (0.79, 1.05), p-value\u202f=\u202f0.186]. The observed associations were not mediated by physical activity or air pollution. DISCUSSION: Access to green space may be associated with decreased risk of excess weight/obesity among women in Spain. Mechanisms explaining this association remain unclear. ",
        "Values-Based Interventions in Patient Engagement for Those with Complex Needs. The objective was to evaluate a novel intervention that integrates a psychological, values-based approach with coordinated care management. This paper describes an integrated comprehensive health record system to enhance engagement with a subset of those with complex needs; those who are high-needs, high-cost (HNHC). Patients are selected after conducting data analysis on the most costly and complex patients of a payer system that works with HNHC patients. Specifically, the Patient Care Intervention Center in Houston TX, applies the values-based intervention to HNHC patients. This pilot study reports data from 18 HNHC patients over 6 months; specifically, outcomes related to daily functioning, depression, working alliance, stages of change, and overall well-being. Additionally, this paper reports preliminary findings from qualitative monitoring of provider experiences implementing the values-based approach and integrated evaluation. HNHC patients improved their daily functioning over 4 months but no other significant changes were found over time. Patients self-reported mild depression, strong working alliances with their provider, being in the contemplation phase of change, and moderate well-being. There also was variation when patients completed the assessments and data points were collected. Although this is a small sample and short time frame, preliminary results suggest that the intervention has a positive impact on HNHC patient daily functioning. Provider accounts of the implementation describe using the evaluation items to inform their interactions with patients, and also suggest that patient literacy level impacts when data can be collected. Other changes to the approach are suggested. ",
        "Developments in zebrafish avatars as radiotherapy sensitivity reporters - towards personalized medicine. BACKGROUND: Whereas the role of neoadjuvant radiotherapy in rectal cancer is well-established, the ability to discriminate between radioresistant and radiosensitive tumors before starting treatment is still a crucial unmet need. Here we aimed to develop an in vivo test to directly challenge living cancer cells to radiotherapy, using zebrafish xenografts. METHODS: We generated zebrafish xenografts using colorectal cancer cell lines and patient biopsies without in vitro passaging, and developed a fast radiotherapy protocol consisting of a single dose of 25\u00a0Gy. As readouts of the impact of radiotherapy we analyzed proliferation, apoptosis, tumor size and DNA damage. FINDINGS: By directly comparing isogenic cells that only differ in the KRASG13D allele, we show that it is possible to distinguish radiosensitive from radioresistant tumors in zebrafish xenografts, even in polyclonal tumors, in just 4 days. Most importantly, we performed proof-of-concept experiments using primary rectum biopsies, where clinical response to neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy correlates with induction of apoptosis in their matching zebrafish Patient-Derived Xenografts-Avatars. INTERPRETATION: Our work opens the possibility to predict tumor responses to radiotherapy using the zebrafish Avatar model, sparing valuable therapeutic time and unnecessary toxicity. ",
        "Digital-resolution detection of microRNA with single-base selectivity by photonic resonator absorption microscopy. Circulating exosomal microRNA (miR) represents a new class of blood-based biomarkers for cancer liquid biopsy. The detection of miR at a very low concentration and with single-base discrimination without the need for sophisticated equipment, large volumes, or elaborate sample processing is a challenge. To address this, we present an approach that is highly specific for a target miR sequence and has the ability to provide \"digital\" resolution of individual target molecules with high signal-to-noise ratio. Gold nanoparticle tags are prepared with thermodynamically optimized nucleic acid toehold probes that, when binding to a target miR sequence, displace a probe-protecting oligonucleotide and reveal a capture sequence that is used to selectively pull down the target-probe-nanoparticle complex to a photonic crystal (PC) biosensor surface. By matching the surface plasmon-resonant wavelength of the nanoparticle tag to the resonant wavelength of the PC nanostructure, the reflected light intensity from the PC is dramatically and locally quenched by the presence of each individual nanoparticle, enabling a form of biosensor microscopy that we call Photonic Resonator Absorption Microscopy (PRAM). Dynamic PRAM imaging of nanoparticle tag capture enables direct 100-aM limit of detection and single-base mismatch selectivity in a 2-h kinetic discrimination assay. The PRAM assay demonstrates that ultrasensitivity (<1 pM) and high selectivity can be achieved on a direct readout diagnostic. ",
        "Automated acquisition of explainable knowledge from unannotated histopathology images. Deep learning algorithms have been successfully used in medical image classification. In the next stage, the technology of acquiring explainable knowledge from medical images is highly desired. Here we show that deep learning algorithm enables automated acquisition of explainable features from diagnostic annotation-free histopathology images. We compare the prediction accuracy of prostate cancer recurrence using our algorithm-generated features with that of diagnosis by expert pathologists using established criteria on 13,188 whole-mount pathology images consisting of over 86 billion image patches. Our method not only reveals findings established by humans but also features that have not been recognized, showing higher accuracy than human in prognostic prediction. Combining both our algorithm-generated features and human-established criteria predicts the recurrence more accurately than using either method alone. We confirm robustness of our method using external validation datasets including 2276 pathology images. This study opens up fields of machine learning analysis for discovering uncharted knowledge. ",
        "Exposure to household pet cats and dogs in childhood and risk of subsequent diagnosis of schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. BACKGROUND: Serious psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder have been associated with environmental exposures in early life. Contact with household pets such as cats and dogs can serve as a source of environmental exposure during these time periods. METHODS: We investigated the relationship between exposure to a household pet cat or dog during the first 12 years of life and having a subsequent diagnosis of schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. These studies were performed in a cohort of 396 individuals with schizophrenia, 381 with bipolar disorder, and 594 controls. The hazards of developing schizophrenia or bipolar disorder associated with first exposure to a household pet cat or dog were calculated using Cox Proportional Hazard and multivariate logistic regression models including socio-demographic covariates. RESULTS: We found that exposure to a household pet dog was associated with a significantly decreased hazard of having a subsequent diagnosis of schizophrenia (Hazard Ratio .75, p < .002) Furthermore, a significant decreased relative risk of schizophrenia was detected following exposure at birth and during the first years of life. There was no significant relationship between household exposure to a pet dog and bipolar disorder. There were no significant associations between exposure to a household pet cat and subsequent risk of either a schizophrenia or bipolar disorder diagnosis. However, there were trends towards an increased risk of both disorders at defined periods of exposure. CONCLUSIONS: Exposure to household pets during infancy and childhood may be associated with altered rates of development of psychiatric disorders in later life. ",
        "Combined mTORC1/mTORC2 inhibition blocks growth and induces catastrophic macropinocytosis in cancer cells. The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway, which plays a critical role in regulating cellular growth and metabolism, is aberrantly regulated in the pathogenesis of a variety of neoplasms. Here we demonstrate that dual mTORC1/mTORC2 inhibitors OSI-027 and PP242 cause catastrophic macropinocytosis in rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) cells and cancers of the skin, breast, lung, and cervix, whereas the effects are much less pronounced in immortalized human keratinocytes. Using RMS as a model, we characterize in detail the mechanism of macropinocytosis induction. Macropinosomes are distinct from endocytic vesicles and autophagosomes in that they are single-membrane bound vacuoles formed by projection, ruffling, and contraction of plasma membranes. They are positive for EEA-1 and LAMP-1 and contain watery fluid but not organelles. The vacuoles then merge and rupture, killing the cells. We confirmed the inhibition of mTORC1/mTORC2 as the underpinning mechanism for macropinocytosis. Exposure to rapamycin, an mTORC1 inhibitor, or mTORC2 knockdown alone had little or reduced effect relative to the combination. We further demonstrate that macropinocytosis depends on MKK4 activated by elevated reactive oxygen species. In a murine xenograft model, OSI-027 reduced RMS tumor growth. Molecular characterization of the residual tumors was consistent with the induction of macropinocytosis. Furthermore, relative to the control xenograft tumors, the residual tumors manifested reduced expression of cell proliferation markers and proteins that drive the epithelial mesenchymal transition. These data indicate a role of mTORC2 in regulating tumor growth by macropinocytosis and suggest that dual inhibitors could help block refractory or recurrent RMS and perhaps other neoplasms and other cancer as well.

        "Associations Among Body Mass Index, Cortical Thickness, and Executive Function in Children. Importance: A total of 25.7 million children in the United States are classified as overweight or obese. Obesity is associated with deficits in executive function, which may contribute to poor dietary decision-making. Less is known about the associations between being overweight or obese and brain development. Objective: To examine whether body mass index (BMI) is associated with thickness of the cerebral cortex and whether cortical thickness mediates the association between BMI and executive function in children. Design, Setting, and Participants: In this cross-sectional study, cortical thickness maps were derived from T1-weighted structural magnetic resonance images of a large, diverse sample of 9 and 10-year-old children from 21 US sites. List sorting, flanker, matrix reasoning, and Wisconsin card sorting tasks were used to assess executive function. Main Outcomes and Measures: A 10-fold nested cross-validation general linear model was used to assess mean cortical thickness from BMI across cortical brain regions. Associations between BMI and executive function were explored with Pearson partial correlations. Mediation analysis examined whether mean prefrontal cortex thickness mediated the association between BMI and executive function. Results: Among 3190 individuals (mean [SD] age, 10.0 [0.61] years; 1627 [51.0%] male), those with higher BMI exhibited lower cortical thickness. Eighteen cortical regions were significantly inversely associated with BMI. The greatest correlations were observed in the prefrontal cortex. The BMI was inversely correlated with dimensional card sorting (r\u2009=\u2009-0.088, P\u2009<\u2009.001), list sorting (r\u2009=\u2009-0.061, P\u2009<\u2009.003), and matrix reasoning (r\u2009=\u2009-0.095, P\u2009<\u2009.001) but not the flanker task. Mean prefrontal cortex thickness mediated the association between BMI and list sorting (mean [SE] indirect effect, 0.014 [0.008]; 95%\u2009CI, 0.001-0.031) but not the matrix reasoning or card sorting task. Conclusions and Relevance: These results suggest that BMI is associated with prefrontal cortex development and diminished executive functions, such as working memory. ",
        "Effectiveness of Breast-Conserving Surgery and 3-Dimensional Conformal Partial Breast Reirradiation for Recurrence of Breast Cancer in the Ipsilateral Breast: The NRG Oncology/RTOG 1014 Phase 2 Clinical Trial. Importance: Mastectomy is standard for recurrence of breast cancer after breast conservation therapy with whole breast irradiation. The emergence of partial breast irradiation led to consideration of its application for reirradiation after a second lumpectomy for treatment of recurrence of breast cancer in the ipsilateral breast. Objectives: To assess the effectiveness and adverse effects of partial breast reirradiation after a second lumpectomy and whether the treatment is an acceptable alternative to mastectomy. Design, Setting, and Participants: The NRG Oncology/Radiation Therapy Oncology Group 1014 trial is a phase 2, single-arm, prospective clinical trial of 3-dimensional, conformal, external beam partial breast reirradiation after a second lumpectomy for recurrence of breast cancer in the ipsilateral breast after previous whole breast irradiation. The study opened on June 4, 2010, and closed June 18, 2013. Median follow-up was 5.5 years. This analysis used all data received at NRG Oncology through November 18, 2018. Eligible patients experienced a recurrence of breast tumor that was less than 3 cm and unifocal in the ipsilateral breast more than 1 year after breast-conserving therapy with whole breast irradiation and who had undergone excision with negative margins. Interventions: Adjuvant partial breast reirradiation, 1.5 Gy twice daily for 30 treatments during 15 days (45 Gy), using a 3-dimensional conformal technique. Main Outcomes and Measures: The main outcomes of the present study were the predefined secondary study objectives of recurrence of breast cancer in the ipsilateral breast, late adverse events (>1 year after treatment), mastectomy incidence, distant metastasis-free survival, overall survival, and circulating tumor cell incidence. Results: A total of 65 women were enrolled, with 58 evaluable for analysis (mean [SD] age, 65.12 [9.95] years; 48 [83%] white). Of the recurrences of breast cancer in the ipsilateral breast, 23 (40%) were noninvasive and 35 (60%) were invasive. In all 58 patients, 53 (91%) had tumors 2 cm or smaller. All tumors were clinically node negative. A total of 44 patients (76%) tested positive for estrogen receptor, 33 (57%) for progesterone receptor, and 10 (17%) for ERBB2 (formerly HER2 or HER2/neu) overexpression. Four patients had breast cancer recurrence, with a 5-year cumulative incidence of 5% (95% CI, 1%-13%). Seven patients underwent ipsilateral mastectomies for a 5-year cumulative incidence of 10% (95% CI, 4%-20%). Both distant metastasis-free survival and overall survival rates were 95% (95% CI, 85%-98%). Four patients (7%) had grade 3 and none had grade 4 or higher late treatment adverse events. Conclusions and Relevance: For patients experiencing recurrence of breast cancer in the ipsilateral breast after lumpectomy and whole breast irradiation, a second breast conservation was achievable in 90%, with a low risk of re-recurrence of cancer in the ipsilateral breast using adjuvant partial breast reirradiation. This finding suggests that this treatment approach is an effective alternative to mastectomy. ",
        "Trends of Suicidal Behaviors Among High School Students in the United States: 1991-2017. OBJECTIVES: To determine if racial and ethnic subgroups of adolescents are at high risk for engagement in suicidal behaviors. METHODS: Using the nationally representative school-based Youth Risk Behavior Survey from the years 1991 to 2017, we conducted logistic regression analyses to examine trends by different racial and ethnic groups, with each suicide indicator serving as a dichotomous outcome. Participants included 198\u2009540 high school students. RESULTS: Across all sex and race and ethnic groups, there were significant linear decreases in self-reported suicidal ideation and suicide plans from 1991 to 2017. Female adolescents (odds ratio [OR], 0.98; P < .001) had significant decreases in attempts over time. Black adolescents had positive linear trends for suicide attempts among both boys (OR, 1.04; P < .001) and girls (OR, 1.02; P = .003). Black adolescent boys (OR, 1.04; P = .048) had a significant linear increase in injury by attempt. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that, over time, black youth have experienced an increase in suicide attempts, which is troubling because attempts are the most prominent risk factor associated with suicide death. For black boys, a significant increase in injury by attempt occurred, which suggests that black boys may be engaging in increasingly lethal means when attempting suicide. Examining trends of suicidal thoughts and behaviors over time by sex and race and ethnicity allow us to determine where to focus prevention and intervention efforts. Future research should examine the underlying reasons for these changes observed in US high school students. "
