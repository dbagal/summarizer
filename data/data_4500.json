        "Association of Alcohol Consumption After Development of Heart Failure With Survival Among Older Adults in the Cardiovascular Health Study. Importance: More than 1 million older adults develop heart failure annually. The association of alcohol consumption with survival among these individuals after diagnosis is unknown. Objective: To determine whether alcohol use is associated with increased survival among older adults with incident heart failure. Design, Setting, and Participants: This prospective cohort study included 5888 community-dwelling adults aged 65 years or older who were recruited to participate in the Cardiovascular Health Study between June 12, 1989, and June 1993, from 4 US sites. Of the total participants, 393 individuals had a new diagnosis of heart failure within the first 9 years of follow-up through June 2013. The study analysis was performed between January 19, 2016, and September 22, 2016. Exposures: Alcohol consumption was divided into 4 categories: abstainers (never drinkers), former drinkers, 7 or fewer alcoholic drinks per week, and more than 7 drinks per week. Primary Outcomes and Measures: Participant survival after the diagnosis of incident heart failure. Results: Among the 393 adults diagnosed with incident heart failure, 213 (54.2%) were female, 339 (86.3%) were white, and the mean (SD) age was 78.7 (6.0) years. Alcohol consumption after diagnosis was reported in 129 (32.8%) of the participants. Across alcohol consumption categories of long-term abstainers, former drinkers, consumers of 1-7 drinks weekly and consumers of more than 7 drinks weekly, the percentage of men (32.1%, 49.0%, 58.0%, and 82.4%, respectively; P\u2009<\u2009.001 for trend), white individuals (78.0%, 92.7%, 92.0%, and 94.1%, respectively, P\u2009<.\u2009001 for trend), and high-income participants (22.0%, 43.8%, 47.3%, and 64.7%, respectively; P\u2009<\u2009.001 for trend) increased with increasing alcohol consumption. Across the 4 categories, participants who consumed more alcohol had more years of education (mean, 12 years [interquartile range (IQR), 8.0-10.0 years], 12 years [IQR, 11.0-14.0 years], 13 years [IQR, 12.0-15.0 years], and 13 years [IQR, 12.0-14.0 years]; P\u2009<\u2009.001 for trend). Diabetes was less common across the alcohol consumption categories (32.1%, 26.0%, 22.3%, and 5.9%, respectively; P\u2009=\u2009.01 for trend). Across alcohol consumption categories, there were fewer never smokers (58.3%, 44.8%, 35.7%, and 29.4%, respectively; P\u2009<\u2009.001 for trend) and more former smokers (34.5%, 38.5%, 50.0%, and 52.9%, respectively; P\u2009=\u2009.006 for trend). After controlling for other factors, consumption of 7 or fewer alcoholic drinks per week was associated with additional mean survival of 383 days (95% CI, 17-748 days; P\u2009=\u2009.04) compared with abstinence from alcohol. Although the robustness was limited by the small number of individuals who consumed more than 7 drinks per week, a significant inverted U-shaped association between alcohol consumption and survival was observed. Multivariable model estimates of mean time from heart failure diagnosis to death were 2640 days (95% CI, 1967-3313 days) for never drinkers, 3046 days (95% CI, 2372-3719 days) for consumers of 0 to 7 drinks per week, and 2806 (95% CI, 1879-3734 days) for consumers of more than 7 drinks per week (P\u2009=\u2009.02). Consumption of 10 drinks per week was associated with the longest survival, a mean of 3381 days (95% CI, 2806-3956 days) after heart failure diagnosis. Conclusions and Relevance: These findings suggest that limited alcohol consumption among older adults with incident heart failure is associated with survival benefit compared with long-term abstinence. These findings suggest that older adults who develop heart failure may not need to abstain from moderate levels of alcohol consumption. ",
        "Proportion of Cancer Cases Attributable to Excess Body Weight by US State, 2011-2015. Importance: Excess body weight (EBW) is an established cause of cancer. Despite variations in the prevalence of EBW among US states, there is little information on the EBW-related cancer burden by state; this information would be useful for setting priorities for cancer-control initiatives. Objective: To calculate the population attributable fraction (PAF) of incident cancer cases attributable to EBW among adults 30 years or older in 2011 to 2015 in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. Design, Setting, and Participants: State-level, self-reported body mass index (BMI [calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared]) data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System were adjusted by sex, age, race/ethnicity, and education using objectively measured BMI values from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Age- and sex-specific cancer incidence data by state were obtained from the US Cancer Statistics database. All analyses were performed between February 15, 2018, and July 17, 2018. Main Outcomes and Measures: Sex-, age-, and state-specific adjusted prevalence estimates for 4 high BMI categories and corresponding relative risks from large-scale pooled analyses or meta-analyses were used to compute the PAFs for each US state for esophageal adenocarcinoma, multiple myeloma, and cancers of the gastric cardia, colorectum, liver, gallbladder, pancreas, female breast, corpus uteri, ovary, kidney and renal pelvis, and thyroid. Results: Each year, an estimated 37\u202f670 cancer cases in men (4.7% of all cancer cases excluding nonmelanoma skin cancers) and 74\u202f690 cancer cases in women (9.6%) 30 years or older in the United States were attributable to EBW from 2011 to 2015. In both men and women, there was at least a 1.5-fold difference in the proportions of cancers attributable to EBW between states with the highest and lowest PAFs. Among men, the PAF ranged from 3.9% (95% CI, 3.6%-4.3%) in Montana to 6.0% (95% CI, 5.6%-6.4%) in Texas. The PAF for women was approximately twice as high as for men, ranging from 7.1% (95% CI, 6.7%-7.6%) in Hawaii to 11.4% (95% CI, 10.7%-12.2%) in the District of Columbia. The largest PAFs were found mostly in southern and midwestern states, as well as Alaska and the District of Columbia. Conclusions and Relevance: The proportion of cancers attributable to EBW varies among states, but EBW accounts for at least 1 in 17 of all incident cancers in each state. Broad implementation of known community- and individual-level interventions is needed to reduce access to and marketing of unhealthy foods (eg, through a tax on sugary drinks) and to promote and increase access to healthy foods and physical activity, as well as preventive care.

        "Association between intake of non-sugar sweeteners and health outcomes: systematic review and meta-analyses of randomised and non-randomised controlled trials and observational studies. OBJECTIVE: To assess the association between intake of non-sugar sweeteners (NSS) and important health outcomes in generally healthy or overweight/obese adults and children. DESIGN: Systematic review following standard Cochrane review methodology. DATA SOURCES: Medline (Ovid), Embase, Cochrane CENTRAL, WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, Clinicaltrials.gov, and reference lists of relevant publications. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR SELECTING STUDIES: Studies including generally healthy adults or children with or without overweight or obesity were eligible. Included study designs allowed for a direct comparison of no intake or lower intake of NSS with higher NSS intake. NSSs had to be clearly named, the dose had to be within the acceptable daily intake, and the intervention duration had to be at least seven days. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Body weight or body mass index, glycaemic control, oral health, eating behaviour, preference for sweet taste, cancer, cardiovascular disease, kidney disease, mood, behaviour, neurocognition, and adverse effects. RESULTS: The search resulted in 13\u2009941 unique records. Of 56 individual studies that provided data for this review, 35 were observational studies. In adults, evidence of very low and low certainty from a limited number of small studies indicated a small beneficial effect of NSSs on body mass index (mean difference -0.6, 95% confidence interval -1.19 to -0.01; two studies, n=174) and fasting blood glucose (-0.16 mmol/L, -0.26 to -0.06; two, n=52). Lower doses of NSSs were associated with lower weight gain (-0.09 kg, -0.13 to -0.05; one, n=17\u2009934) compared with higher doses of NSSs (very low certainty of evidence). For all other outcomes, no differences were detected between the use and non-use of NSSs, or between different doses of NSSs. No evidence of any effect of NSSs was seen on overweight or obese adults or children actively trying to lose weight (very low to moderate certainty). In children, a smaller increase in body mass index z score was observed with NSS intake compared with sugar intake (-0.15, -0.17 to -0.12; two, n=528, moderate certainty of evidence), but no significant differences were observed in body weight (-0.60 kg, -1.33 to 0.14; two, n=467, low certainty of evidence), or between different doses of NSSs (very low to moderate certainty). CONCLUSIONS: Most health outcomes did not seem to have differences between the NSS exposed and unexposed groups. Of the few studies identified for each outcome, most had few participants, were of short duration, and their methodological and reporting quality was limited; therefore, confidence in the reported results is limited. Future studies should assess the effects of NSSs with an appropriate intervention duration. Detailed descriptions of interventions, comparators, and outcomes should be included in all reports.

        "Comparison of Wait Times for New Patients Between the Private Sector and United States Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Centers. Importance: Concerns have been raised about the adequacy of health care access among patients cared for within the United States Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) health care system. Objectives: To determine wait times for new patients receiving care at VA medical centers and compare wait times in the VA medical centers with wait times in the private sector (PS). Design, Setting, and Participants: A retrospective, repeated cross-sectional study was conducted of new appointment wait times for primary care, dermatology, cardiology, or orthopedics at VA medical centers in 15 major metropolitan areas in 2014 and 2017. Comparison data from the PS came from a published survey that used a secret shopper survey approach. Secondary analyses evaluated the change in overall and unique patients seen in the entire VA system and patient satisfaction survey measures of care access between 2014 and 2017. Main Outcomes and Measures: The outcome of interest was patient wait time. Wait times in the VA were determined directly from patient scheduling. Wait times in the PS were as reported in Merritt Hawkins surveys using the secret shopper method. Results: Compared with the PS, overall mean VA wait times for new appointments in 2014 were similar (mean [SD] wait time, 18.7 [7.9] days PS vs 22.5 [7.3] days VA; P\u2009=\u2009.20). Department of Veterans Affairs wait times in 2014 were similar to those in the PS across specialties and regions. In 2017, overall wait times for new appointments in the VA were shorter than in the PS (mean [SD], 17.7 [5.9] vs 29.8 [16.6] days; P\u2009<\u2009.001). This was true in primary care (mean [SD], 20.0 [10.4] vs 40.7 [35.0] days; P = .005), dermatology (mean [SD], 15.6 [12.2] vs 32.6 [16.5] days; P < .001), and cardiology (mean [SD], 15.3 [12.6] vs 22.8 [10.1] days; P = .04). Wait times for orthopedics remained longer in the VA than the PS (mean [SD], 20.9 [13.3] vs 12.4 [5.5] days; P = .01), although wait time improved significantly between 2014 and 2017 in the VA for orthopedics while wait times in the PS did not change (change in mean wait times, increased 1.5 days vs decreased 5.4 days; P = .02). Secondary analysis demonstrated an increase in the number of unique patients seen and appointment encounters in the VA between 2014 and 2017 (4\u202f996\u202f564 to 5\u202f118\u202f446, and 16\u202f476\u202f461 to 17\u202f331\u202f538, respectively), and patient satisfaction measures of access also improved (satisfaction scores increased by 1.4%, 3.0%, and 4.0% for specialty care, routine primary care, and urgent primary care, P\u2009<\u2009.05). Conclusions and Relevance: Although wait times in the VA and PS appeared to be similar in 2014, there have been interval improvements in VA wait times since then, while wait times in the PS appear to be static. These findings suggest that access to care within the VA has improved over time. ",
        "Association of peripheral blood pressure with gray matter volume in 19- to 40-year-old adults. OBJECTIVE: To test whether elevated blood pressure (BP) relates to gray matter (GM) volume (GMV) changes in young adults who had not previously been diagnosed with hypertension (systolic BP [SBP]/diastolic BP [DBP] \u2265140/90 mm Hg). METHODS: We associated BP with GMV from structural 3T T1-weighted MRI of 423 healthy adults between 19 and 40 years of age (mean age 27.7 \u00b1 5.3 years, 177 women, SBP/DBP 123.2/73.4 \u00b1 12.2/8.5 mm Hg). Data originated from 4 previously unpublished cross-sectional studies conducted in Leipzig, Germany. We performed voxel-based morphometry on each study separately and combined results in image-based meta-analyses (IBMA) to assess cumulative effects across studies. Resting BP was assigned to 1 of 4 categories: (1) SBP <120 and DBP <80 mm Hg, (2) SBP 120-129 or DBP 80-84 mm Hg, (3) SBP 130-139 or DBP 85-89 mm Hg, (4) SBP \u2265140 or DBP \u226590 mm Hg. RESULTS: IBMA yielded the following results: (1) lower regional GMV was correlated with higher peripheral BP; (2) lower GMV was found with higher BP when comparing individuals in subhypertensive categories 3 and 2, respectively, to those in category 1; (3) lower BP-related GMV was found in regions including hippocampus, amygdala, thalamus, frontal, and parietal structures (e.g., precuneus). CONCLUSION: BP \u2265120/80 mm Hg was associated with lower GMV in regions that have previously been related to GM decline in older individuals with manifest hypertension. Our study shows that BP-associated GM alterations emerge continuously across the range of BP and earlier in adulthood than previously assumed. This suggests that treating hypertension or maintaining lower BP in early adulthood might be essential for preventing the pathophysiologic cascade of asymptomatic cerebrovascular disease to symptomatic end-organ damage, such as stroke or dementia.

        "The abuse potential of medical psilocybin according to the 8 factors of the Controlled Substances Act. This review assesses the abuse potential of medically-administered psilocybin, following the structure of the 8 factors of the US Controlled Substances Act (CSA). Research suggests the potential safety and efficacy of psilocybin in treating cancer-related psychiatric distress and substance use disorders, setting the occasion for this review. A more extensive assessment of abuse potential according to an 8-factor analysis would eventually be required to guide appropriate schedule placement. Psilocybin, like other 5-HT2A agonist classic psychedelics, has limited reinforcing effects, supporting marginal, transient non-human self-administration. Nonetheless, mushrooms with variable psilocybin content are used illicitly, with a few lifetime use occasions being normative among users. Potential harms include dangerous behavior in unprepared, unsupervised users, and exacerbation of mental illness in those with or predisposed to psychotic disorders. However, scope of use and associated harms are low compared to prototypical abused drugs, and the medical model addresses these concerns with dose control, patient screening, preparation and follow-up, and session supervision in a medical facility. CONCLUSIONS: (1) psilocybin has an abuse potential appropriate for CSA scheduling if approved as medicine; (2) psilocybin can provide therapeutic benefits that may support the development of an approvable New Drug Application (NDA) but further studies are required which this review describes; (3) adverse effects of medical psilocybin are manageable when administered according to risk management approaches; and (4) although further study is required, this review suggests that placement in Schedule IV may be appropriate if a psilocybin-containing medicine is approved. This article is part of the Special Issue entitled 'Psychedelics: New Doors, Altered Perceptions'. ",
        "Consumption of red and processed meat and breast cancer incidence: A systematic review and meta-analysis of prospective studies. Prior studies on red and processed meat consumption with breast cancer risk have generated inconsistent results. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of prospective studies to summarize the evidence regarding the relation of red meat and processed meat consumption with breast cancer incidence. We searched in MEDLINE and EMBASE databases through January 2018 for prospective studies that reported the association between red meat and processed meat consumption with incident breast cancer. The multivariable-adjusted relative risk (RR) was combined comparing the highest with the lowest category of red meat (unprocessed) and processed meat consumption using a random-effect meta-analysis. We identified 13 cohort, 3 nested case-control and two clinical trial studies. Comparing the highest to the lowest category, red meat (unprocessed) consumption was associated with a 6% higher breast cancer risk (pooled RR,1.06; 95% confidence intervals (95%CI):0.99-1.14; I2 = 56.3%), and processed meat consumption was associated with a 9% higher breast cancer risk (pooled RR, 1.09; 95%CI, 1.03-1.16; I2 = 44.4%). In addition, we identified two nested case-control studies evaluating the association between red meat and breast cancer stratified by N-acetyltransferase 2 acetylator genotype. We did not observe any association among those with either fast (per 25 g/day pooled odds ratio (OR), 1.18; 95%CI, 0.93-1.50) or slow N-acetyltransferase 2 acetylators (per 25 g/day pooled OR, 0.99; 95%CI, 0.91-1.08). In the prospective observational studies, high processed meat consumption was associated with increased breast cancer risk. ",
        "Association Between Ultraprocessed Food Consumption and Risk of Mortality Among Middle-aged Adults in France. Importance: Growing evidence indicates that higher intake of ultraprocessed foods is associated with higher incidence of noncommunicable diseases. However, to date, the association between ultraprocessed foods consumption and mortality risk has never been investigated. Objective: To assess the association between ultraprocessed foods consumption and all-cause mortality risk. Design, Setting, and Participants: This observational prospective cohort study selected adults, 45 years or older, from the French NutriNet-Sant\u00e9 Study, an ongoing cohort study that launched on May 11, 2009, and performed a follow-up through December 15, 2017 (a median of 7.1 years). Participants were selected if they completed at least 1 set of 3 web-based 24-hour dietary records during their first 2 years of follow-up. Self-reported data were collected at baseline, including sociodemographic, lifestyle, physical activity, weight and height, and anthropometrics. Exposures: The ultraprocessed foods group (from the NOVA food classification system), characterized as ready-to-eat or -heat formulations made mostly from ingredients usually combined with additives. Proportion (in weight) of ultraprocessed foods in the diet was computed for each participant. Main Outcomes and Measures: The association between proportion of ultraprocessed foods and overall mortality was the main outcome. Mean dietary intakes from all of the 24-hour dietary records available during the first 2 years of follow-up were calculated and considered as the baseline usual food-and-drink intakes. Mortality was assessed using C\u00e9piDC, the French national registry of specific mortality causes. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs were determined for all-cause mortality, using multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression models, with age as the underlying time metric. Results: A total of 44\u202f551 participants were included, of whom 32\u202f549 (73.1%) were women, with a mean (SD) age at baseline of 56.7 (7.5) years. Ultraprocessed foods accounted for a mean (SD) proportion of 14.4% (7.6%) of the weight of total food consumed, corresponding to a mean (SD) proportion of 29.1% (10.9%) of total energy intake. Ultraprocessed foods consumption was associated with younger age (45-64 years, mean [SE] proportion of food in weight, 14.50% [0.04%]; P\u2009<\u2009.001), lower income (<\u20ac1200/mo, 15.58% [0.11%]; P\u2009<\u2009.001), lower educational level (no diploma or primary school, 15.50% [0.16%]; P\u2009<\u2009.001), living alone (15.02% [0.07%]; P\u2009<\u2009.001), higher body mass index (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared; \u226530, 15.98% [0.11%]; P\u2009<\u2009.001), and lower physical activity level (15.56% [0.08%]; P\u2009<\u2009.001). A total of 602 deaths (1.4%) occurred during follow-up. After adjustment for a range of confounding factors, an increase in the proportion of ultraprocessed foods consumed was associated with a higher risk of all-cause mortality (HR per 10% increment, 1.14; 95% CI, 1.04-1.27; P\u2009=\u2009.008). Conclusions and Relevance: An increase in ultraprocessed foods consumption appears to be associated with an overall higher mortality risk among this adult population; further prospective studies are needed to confirm these findings and to disentangle the various mechanisms by which ultraprocessed foods may affect health.

        "Association of Behavior in Boys From Low Socioeconomic Neighborhoods With Employment Earnings in Adulthood. Importance: Identifying early childhood behavioral problems associated with economic success/failure is essential for the development of targeted interventions that enhance economic prosperity through improved educational attainment and social integration. Objective: To test the association between kindergarten teacher-rated assessments of inattention, hyperactivity, opposition, aggression, and prosociality in boys with their employment earnings at age 35 to 36 years as measured by government tax return data. Design, Setting, and Participants: A 30-year prospective follow-up study analyzing low socioeconomic neighborhoods in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. Boys aged 5 to 6 years attending kindergarten in low socioeconomic neighborhoods were recruited. Teacher-rated behavioral assessments were obtained for 1040 boys. Data were collected from April 1984 to December 2015. Analysis began January 2017. Main Outcomes and Measures: Mixed-effects linear regression models were used to examine the association between teacher ratings of inattention, hyperactivity, opposition, aggression, and prosociality at age 6 years and individual earnings obtained from government tax returns at age 35 to 36 years. The IQ of the child and family adversity were adjusted for in the analysis. Results: Complete data were available for 920 study participants (mean age at follow-up was 36.3 years). Mean (SD) personal earnings at follow-up were $28\u202f865.53 ($24\u202f103.45) (range, $0-$142\u202f267.84). A 1-unit increase in inattention (mean\u2009[SD], 2.66\u2009[2.34]; range, 0-8) at age 6 years was associated with decrease in earnings at age 35 to 36 years of $1295.13 (95% CI, -$2051.65 to -$538.62), while a unit increase in prosociality (mean [SD], 8.0\u2009[4.96]; range, 0-20) was associated with an increase in earnings of $406.15 (95% CI, $172.54-$639.77). Hyperactivity, opposition, and aggression were not significantly associated with earnings. Child IQ was associated with higher earnings and family adversity with lower earnings in all models. A 1-SD reduction in inattention at age 6 years was associated with a theoretical increase in annual earnings of $3040.41, a similar magnitude to an equivalent increase in IQ. Conclusions and Relevance: Teacher ratings of inattention and prosociality in kindergarten boys from low socioeconomic neighborhoods are associated with earnings in adulthood after adjustment for hyperactivity, aggression, and opposition, which were not associated with earnings. Interventions beginning in kindergarten that target boys' inattention and enhance prosociality could positively impact workforce integration and earnings. ",
        "Assessment of Bidirectional Relationships Between Physical Activity and Depression Among Adults: A 2-Sample Mendelian Randomization Study. Importance: Increasing evidence shows that physical activity is associated with reduced risk for depression, pointing to a potential modifiable target for prevention. However, the causality and direction of this association are not clear; physical activity may protect against depression, and/or depression may result in decreased physical activity. Objective: To examine bidirectional relationships between physical activity and depression using a genetically informed method for assessing potential causal inference. Design, Setting, and Participants: This 2-sample mendelian randomization (MR) used independent top genetic variants associated with 2 physical activity phenotypes-self-reported (n\u2009=\u2009377\u202f234) and objective accelerometer-based (n\u2009=\u200991\u202f084)-and with major depressive disorder (MDD) (n\u2009=\u2009143\u202f265) as genetic instruments from the largest available, nonoverlapping genome-wide association studies (GWAS). GWAS were previously conducted in diverse observational cohorts, including the UK Biobank (for physical activity) and participating studies in the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (for MDD) among adults of European ancestry. Mendelian randomization estimates from each genetic instrument were combined using inverse variance weighted meta-analysis, with alternate methods (eg, weighted median, MR Egger, MR-Pleiotropy Residual Sum and Outlier [PRESSO]) and multiple sensitivity analyses to assess horizontal pleiotropy and remove outliers. Data were analyzed from May 10 through July 31, 2018. Main Outcomes and Measures: MDD and physical activity. Results: GWAS summary data were available for a combined sample size of 611\u202f583 adult participants. Mendelian randomization evidence suggested a protective relationship between accelerometer-based activity and MDD (odds ratio [OR],\u20090.74 for MDD per 1-SD increase in mean acceleration; 95% CI, 0.59-0.92; P\u2009=\u2009.006). In contrast, there was no statistically significant relationship between MDD and accelerometer-based activity (\u03b2\u2009=\u2009-0.08 in mean acceleration per MDD vs control status; 95% CI, -0.47 to 0.32; P\u2009=\u2009.70). Furthermore, there was no significant relationship between self-reported activity and MDD (OR, 1.28 for MDD per 1-SD increase in metabolic-equivalent minutes of reported moderate-to-vigorous activity; 95% CI, 0.57-3.37; P\u2009=\u2009.48), or between MDD and self-reported activity (\u03b2\u2009=\u20090.02 per MDD in standardized metabolic-equivalent minutes of reported moderate-to-vigorous activity per MDD vs control status; 95% CI, -0.008 to 0.05; P\u2009=\u2009.15). Conclusions and Relevance: Using genetic instruments identified from large-scale GWAS, robust evidence supports a protective relationship between objectively assessed-but not self-reported-physical activity and the risk for MDD. Findings point to the importance of objective measurement of physical activity in epidemiologic studies of mental health and support the hypothesis that enhancing physical activity may be an effective prevention strategy for depression.

        "Association of Analgesic Use With Risk of Ovarian Cancer in the Nurses' Health Studies. Importance: Ovarian cancer is a highly fatal malignant neoplasm with few modifiable risk factors. Case-control studies have reported a modest reduced risk of ovarian cancer among women who frequently use aspirin or regularly use low-dose aspirin. Objective: To evaluate whether regular aspirin or nonaspirin nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) use and patterns of use are associated with lower ovarian cancer risk. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study analyzed NSAID use and ovarian cancer diagnosis data from 2 prospective cohorts, 93\u202f664 women in the Nurses' Health Study (NHS), who were followed up from 1980 to 2014, and 111 834 in the Nurses' Health Study II (NHSII), who were followed up from 1989 to 2015. Follow-up was completed on June 30, 2014, for the NHS and June 30, 2015, for NHSII. Data were analyzed from June 13, 2016, to September 18, 2017. Exposures: For each analgesic type (aspirin, low-dose aspirin, nonaspirin NSAIDs, and acetaminophen), timing, duration, frequency, and number of tablets used were evaluated; exposure information was updated every 2 to 4 years. Main Outcomes and Measures: Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs for associations of aspirin, nonaspirin NSAIDs, and acetaminophen with risk of epithelial ovarian cancer. All statistical tests were 2-sided, with a significance level of .05. Results: In the NHS, the mean (SD) age at baseline (1980) was 45.9 (7.2) years, and 93% of participants identified as non-Hispanic white. In the NHSII, the mean age at baseline (1989) was 34.2 (4.7) years, and 92% identified as non-Hispanic white. Among the 205\u202f498 women in both cohorts, there were 1054 cases of incident epithelial ovarian cancer. Significant associations between aspirin and ovarian cancer risk were not observed when current vs nonuse of any aspirin was evaluated regardless of dose (HR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.83-1.19). However, when low-dose (\u2264100-mg) and standard-dose (325-mg) aspirin were evaluated separately, an inverse association for low-dose aspirin (HR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.61-0.96), but no association for standard-dose aspirin (HR, 1.17; 95% CI, 0.92-1.49) was observed. Current use of nonaspirin NSAIDs was positively associated with risk of ovarian cancer compared with nonuse (HR, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.00-1.41), and significant positive trends for duration of use (P\u2009=\u2009.02 for trend) and cumulative average tablets per week (P\u2009=\u2009.03 for trend) were observed. There were no clear associations for the use of acetaminophen. Conclusions and Relevance: These results appear to be consistent with case-control studies that show a reduced risk of ovarian cancer among regular users of low-dose aspirin. An increased risk of ovarian cancer with long-term high-quantity use of other analgesics, particularly nonaspirin NSAIDs, was observed, although this finding requires confirmation. ",
        "Association of Adolescent Hypertension With Future End-stage Renal Disease. Importance: Hypertension is a leading risk factor of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. The role of nonmalignant hypertension as the sole initiating factor of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in non-African American populations has recently been questioned. Objective: To investigate the association between hypertension and future ESRD in otherwise healthy adolescents. Design, Setting, and Participants: This retrospective cohort study examined the data of 16- to 19-year-old healthy candidates for military service in the Israel Defense Forces between January 1, 1967, and December 31, 2013. Data were obtained from the central conscription registry of the Israel Defense Forces and the ESRD registry of the Israel Ministry of Health. Participants underwent a comprehensive medical assessment prior to their military service. Individuals with evidence of renal damage or kidney-related risk factors were excluded. The data analysis was conducted from February 12, 2017, to October 16, 2018. Main Outcomes and Measures: End-stage renal disease as recorded by the Israeli ESRD registry, including hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis, renal transplant diagnosed between January 1, 1990, and December 31, 2014. Results: The cohort included 2\u202f658\u202f238 adolescents (1 596 709 [60.1%] male with a mean [SD] age of 17.4 [0.5] years), of whom 7997 (0.3%) had an established hypertension diagnosis. Half of the individuals in the hypertensive group were overweight (1559 [20.1%]) or obese (2243 [28.9%]), and most (7235 [90.5%]) were male. During a median follow-up of 19.6 years (52\u202f287\u202f945 person-years), 2189 individuals developed ESRD, with an incidence rate of 3.9 per 100\u202f000 person-years. Adolescent hypertension was found to be associated with future ESRD (crude hazard ratio [HR], 5.07; 95% CI, 3.73-6.88). In a multivariable model adjusted for sex, age, years of education, body mass index, and other sociodemographic variables, the HR was 1.98 (95% CI, 1.42-2.77). When excluding participants with severe hypertension, the association with ESRD remained statistically significant (HR, 1.93; 95% CI, 1.37-2.70). In the subanalysis of nonoverweight adolescents, the association between hypertension and ESRD was statistically significant as well (HR, 2.11; 95% CI, 1.05-4.24). Conclusions and Relevance: Hypertension appears to be associated with a doubling of the risk of future ESRD in an otherwise healthy adolescent population. ",
        "Secondhand Smoke and CKD. BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Active smoking is associated with higher risk of various diseases. However, the risk of CKD development in nonsmokers exposed to secondhand smoke is not well elucidated. We aimed to investigate the association between secondhand smoke exposure and the risk of CKD development among never-smokers. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: A total of 131,196 never-smokers with normal kidney function, who participated in the Korean Genome and Epidemiology Study from 2001 to 2014, were analyzed. The participants were classified into three groups on the basis of frequency of secondhand smoke exposure, assessed with survey questionnaires; no exposure, <3 days per week, and \u22653 days per week. The association between secondhand smoke and CKD, defined as eGFR<60 ml/min per 1.73 m2, was examined in the cross-sectional analysis. In addition, the risk of incident CKD development was analyzed in a longitudinal cohort of 1948 participants without CKD at baseline, which was a subset of the main cohort. RESULTS: The mean age of participants was 53 years, and 75% were women. Prevalent CKD was observed in 231 (1.8%), 64 (1.7%), and 2280 (2.0%) participants in the \u22653 days per week, <3 days per week, and no exposure groups. The odds ratio (OR) of prevalent CKD was significantly higher in the groups exposed to secondhand smoke than the no exposure group (<3 days per week: OR, 1.72; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.30 to 2.27; and \u22653 days per week: OR, 1.44; 95% CI, 1.22 to 1.70). During a mean follow-up of 104 months, CKD occurred in 319 (16%) participants. Multivariable Cox analysis revealed that the risk for CKD development was higher in participants exposed to secondhand smoke than the no exposure group (<3 days per week: hazard ratio, 1.59; 95% CI, 0.96 to 2.65; and \u22653 days per week: hazard ratio, 1.66; 95% CI, 1.03 to 2.67). CONCLUSIONS: Exposure to secondhand smoke was associated with a higher prevalence of CKD as well as development of incident CKD. ",
        "How does exercise treatment compare with antihypertensive medications? A network meta-analysis of 391 randomised controlled trials assessing exercise and medication effects on systolic blood pressure. OBJECTIVE: To compare the effect of exercise regimens and medications on systolic blood pressure (SBP). DATA SOURCES: Medline (via PubMed) and the Cochrane Library. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I), angiotensin-2 receptor blockers (ARBs), \u03b2-blockers, calcium channel blockers (CCBs) and diuretics were identified from existing Cochrane reviews. A previously published meta-analysis of exercise interventions was updated to identify recent RCTs that tested the SBP-lowering effects of endurance, dynamic resistance, isometric resistance, and combined endurance and resistance exercise interventions (up to September 2018). DESIGN: Random-effects network meta-analysis. OUTCOME: Difference in mean change from baseline SBP between comparator treatments (change from baseline in one group minus that in the other group) and its 95% credible interval (95% CrI), measured in mmHg. RESULTS: We included a total of 391 RCTs, 197 of which evaluated exercise interventions (10\u2009461 participants) and 194 evaluated antihypertensive medications (29\u2009281 participants). No RCTs compared directly exercise against medications. While all medication trials included hypertensive populations, only 56 exercise trials included hypertensive participants (\u2265140\u2009mmHg), corresponding to 3508 individuals. In a 10% random sample, risk of bias was higher in exercise RCTs, primarily due to lack of blinding and incomplete outcome data. In analyses that combined all populations, antihypertensive medications achieved higher reductions in baseline SBP compared with exercise interventions (mean difference -3.96\u2009mmHg, 95% CrI -5.02 to -2.91). Compared with control, all types of exercise (including combination of endurance and resistance) and all classes of antihypertensive medications were effective in lowering baseline SBP. Among hypertensive populations, there were no detectable differences in the SBP-lowering effects of ACE-I, ARB, \u03b2-blocker and diuretic medications when compared with endurance or dynamic resistance exercise. There was no detectable inconsistency between direct and indirect comparisons. Although there was evidence of small-study effects, this affected both medication and exercise trials. CONCLUSIONS: The effect of exercise interventions on SBP remains under-studied, especially among hypertensive populations. Our findings confirm modest but consistent reductions in SBP in many studied exercise interventions across all populations but individuals receiving medications generally achieved greater reductions than those following structured exercise regimens. Assuming equally reliable estimates, the SBP-lowering effect of exercise among hypertensive populations appears similar to that of commonly used antihypertensive medications. Generalisability of these findings to real-world clinical settings should be further evaluated. ",
        "Long-Term Consumption of Sugar-Sweetened and Artificially Sweetened Beverages and Risk of Mortality in US Adults. BACKGROUND: Whether consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) or artificially sweetened beverages (ASBs) is associated with risk of mortality is of public health interest. METHODS: We examined associations between consumption of SSBs and ASBs with risk of total and cause-specific mortality among 37 716 men from the Health Professional's Follow-up study (from 1986 to 2014) and 80 647 women from the Nurses' Health study (from 1980 to 2014) who were free from chronic diseases at baseline. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to estimate hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals. RESULTS: We documented 36 436 deaths (7896 cardiovascular disease [CVD] and 12 380 cancer deaths) during 3 415 564 person-years of follow-up. After adjusting for major diet and lifestyle factors, consumption of SSBs was associated with a higher risk of total mortality; pooled hazard ratios (95% confidence intervals) across categories (<1/mo, 1-4/mo, 2-6/week, 1-<2/d, and \u22652/d) were 1.00 (reference), 1.01 (0.98, 1.04), 1.06 (1.03, 1.09), 1.14 (1.09, 1.19), and 1.21 (1.13, 1.28; P trend <0.0001). The association was observed for CVD mortality (hazard ratio comparing extreme categories was 1.31 [95% confidence interval, 1.15, 1.50], P trend <0.0001) and cancer mortality (1.16 [1.04, 1.29], P trend =0.0004). ASBs were associated with total and CVD mortality in the highest intake category only; pooled hazard ratios (95% confidence interval) across categories were 1.00 (reference), 0.96 (0.93, 0.99), 0.97 (0.95, 1.00), 0.98 (0.94, 1.03), and 1.04 (1.02, 1.12; P trend = 0.01) for total mortality and 1.00 (reference), 0.93 (0.87, 1.00), 0.95 (0.89, 1.00), 1.02 (0.94, 1.12), and 1.13 (1.02, 1.25; P trend = 0.02) for CVD mortality. In cohort-specific analysis, ASBs were associated with mortality in NHS (Nurses' Health Study) but not in HPFS (Health Professionals Follow-up Study) ( P interaction, 0.01). ASBs were not associated with cancer mortality in either cohort. CONCLUSIONS: Consumption of SSBs was positively associated with mortality primarily through CVD mortality and showed a graded association with dose. The positive association between high intake levels of ASBs and total and CVD mortality observed among women requires further confirmation. ",
        "Pharmacologic and Nonpharmacologic Treatments for Urinary Incontinence in Women: A Systematic Review and Network Meta-analysis of Clinical Outcomes. Background: Urinary incontinence (UI), a common malady in women, most often is classified as stress, urgency, or mixed. Purpose: To compare the effectiveness of pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic interventions to improve or cure stress, urgency, or mixed UI in nonpregnant women. Data Sources: MEDLINE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (Wiley), Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (Wiley), EMBASE (Elsevier), CINAHL (EBSCO), and PsycINFO (American Psychological Association) from inception through 10 August 2018. Study Selection: 84 randomized trials that evaluated 14 categories of interventions and reported categorical cure or improvement outcomes. Data Extraction: 1 researcher extracted study characteristics, results, and study-level risk of bias, with verification by another independent researcher. The research team collaborated to assess strength of evidence (SoE) across studies. Data Synthesis: 84 studies reported cure or improvement outcomes (32 in stress UI, 16 in urgency UI, 4 in mixed UI, and 32 in any or unspecified UI type). The most commonly evaluated active intervention types included behavioral therapies, anticholinergics, and neuromodulation. Network meta-analysis showed that all interventions, except hormones and periurethral bulking agents (variable SoE), were more effective than no treatment in achieving at least 1 favorable UI outcome. Among treatments used specifically for stress UI, behavioral therapy was more effective than either \u03b1-agonists or hormones in achieving cure or improvement (moderate SoE); \u03b1-agonists were more effective than hormones in achieving improvement (moderate SoE); and neuromodulation was more effective than no treatment for cure, improvement, and satisfaction (high SoE). Among treatments used specifically for urgency UI, behavioral therapy was statistically significantly more effective than anticholinergics in achieving cure or improvement (high SoE), both neuromodulation and onabotulinum toxin A (BTX) were more effective than no treatment (high SoE), and BTX may have been more effective than neuromodulation in achieving cure (low SoE). Limitation: Scarce direct (head-to-head trial) evidence and population heterogeneity based on UI type, UI severity, and history of prior treatment. Conclusion: Most nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic interventions are more likely than no treatment to improve UI outcomes. Behavioral therapy, alone or in combination with other interventions, is generally more effective than pharmacologic therapies alone in treating both stress and urgency UI.

        "Acute Illness Associated With Cannabis Use, by Route of Exposure: An Observational Study. Background: Little is known about the relative harms of edible and inhalable cannabis products. . Objective: To describe and compare adult emergency department (ED) visits related to edible and inhaled cannabis exposure. . Design: Chart review of ED visits between 1 January 2012 and 31 December 2016. . Setting: A large urban academic hospital in Colorado. . Participants: Adults with ED visits with a cannabis-related International Classification of Diseases, Ninth or 10th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM or ICD-10-CM), code. . Measurements: Patient demographic characteristics, route of exposure, dose, symptoms, length of stay, disposition, discharge diagnoses, and attribution of visit to cannabis. . Results: There were 9973 visits with an ICD-9-CM or ICD-10-CM code for cannabis use. Of these, 2567 (25.7%) visits were at least partially attributable to cannabis, and 238 of those (9.3%) were related to edible cannabis. Visits attributable to inhaled cannabis were more likely to be for cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome (18.0% vs. 8.4%), and visits attributable to edible cannabis were more likely to be due to acute psychiatric symptoms (18.0% vs. 10.9%), intoxication (48% vs. 28%), and cardiovascular symptoms (8.0% vs. 3.1%). Edible products accounted for 10.7% of cannabis-attributable visits between 2014 and 2016 but represented only 0.32% of total cannabis sales in Colorado (in kilograms of tetrahydrocannabinol) during that period. . Limitation: Retrospective study design, single academic center, self-reported exposure data, and limited availability of dose data. . Conclusion: Visits attributable to inhaled cannabis are more frequent than those attributable to edible cannabis, although the latter is associated with more acute psychiatric visits and more ED visits than expected.

        "Association of Air Pollution Exposure With Psychotic Experiences During Adolescence. Importance: Urbanicity is a well-established risk factor for clinical (eg, schizophrenia) and subclinical (eg, hearing voices and paranoia) expressions of psychosis. To our knowledge, no studies have examined the association of air pollution with adolescent psychotic experiences, despite air pollution being a major environmental problem in cities. Objectives: To examine the association between exposure to air pollution and adolescent psychotic experiences and test whether exposure mediates the association between urban residency and adolescent psychotic experiences. Design, Setting, and Participants: The Environmental-Risk Longitudinal Twin Study is a population-based cohort study of 2232 children born during the period from January 1, 1994, through December 4, 1995, in England and Wales and followed up from birth through 18 years of age. The cohort represents the geographic and socioeconomic composition of UK households. Of the original cohort, 2066 (92.6%) participated in assessments at 18 years of age, of whom 2063 (99.9%) provided data on psychotic experiences. Generation of the pollution data was completed on October 4, 2017, and data were analyzed from May 4 to November 21, 2018. Exposures: High-resolution annualized estimates of exposure to 4 air pollutants-nitrogen dioxide (NO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and particulate matter with aerodynamic diameters of less than 2.5 (PM2.5) and less than 10 \u03bcm (PM10)-were modeled for 2012 and linked to the home addresses of the sample plus 2 commonly visited locations when the participants were 18 years old. Main Outcomes and Measures: At 18 years of age, participants were privately interviewed regarding adolescent psychotic experiences. Urbanicity was estimated using 2011 census data. Results: Among the 2063 participants who provided data on psychotic experiences, sex was evenly distributed (52.5% female). Six hundred twenty-three participants (30.2%) had at least 1 psychotic experience from 12 to 18 years of age. Psychotic experiences were significantly more common among adolescents with the highest (top quartile) level of annual exposure to NO2 (odds ratio [OR], 1.71; 95% CI, 1.28-2.28), NOx (OR, 1.72; 95% CI, 1.30-2.29), and PM2.5 (OR, 1.45; 95% CI, 1.11-1.90). Together NO2 and NOx statistically explained 60% of the association between urbanicity and adolescent psychotic experiences. No evidence of confounding by family socioeconomic status, family psychiatric history, maternal psychosis, childhood psychotic symptoms, adolescent smoking and substance dependence, or neighborhood socioeconomic status, crime, and social conditions occurred. Conclusions and Relevance: In this study, air pollution exposure-particularly NO2 and NOx-was associated with increased odds of adolescent psychotic experiences, which partly explained the association between urban residency and adolescent psychotic experiences. Biological (eg, neuroinflammation) and psychosocial (eg, stress) mechanisms are plausible. ",
        "Lipid levels and the risk of hemorrhagic stroke among women. OBJECTIVE: To examine the association between lipid levels and hemorrhagic stroke risk among women. METHODS: We performed a prospective cohort study among 27,937 women enrolled in the Women's Health Study with measured total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), as well as triglycerides. Strokes were confirmed by medical record review. We used Cox proportional hazards models to analyze associations between lipid categories and hemorrhagic stroke risk. RESULTS: During a mean of 19.3 years of follow-up, 137 hemorrhagic strokes occurred. Compared to those with LDL-C levels 100-129.9 mg/dL, after multivariable adjustment, those with LDL-C levels <70 mg/dL had 2.17 times the risk (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.05, 4.48) of experiencing a hemorrhagic stroke. No significant increase in risk was seen for those with LDL-C levels 130-159.9 mg/dL (relative risk [RR] 1.14; 95% CI 0.72, 1.80) or 70-99.9 mg/dL (RR 1.25; 95% CI 0.76, 2.04). There was a suggestion, although not significant, of increased risk for those with LDL-C levels \u2265160 mg/dL (RR 1.53; 95% CI 0.92, 2.52). Women in the lowest quartile of triglycerides had a significantly increased risk of hemorrhagic stroke compared to women in the top quartile after multivariable adjustment (RR 2.00; 95% CI 1.18, 3.39). We observed no significant associations between total cholesterol or HDL-C levels and hemorrhagic stroke risk. CONCLUSION: LDL-C levels <70 mg/dL and low triglyceride levels were associated with increased risk of hemorrhagic stroke among women. ",
        "Inactivity induces resistance to the metabolic benefits following acute exercise. Acute exercise improves postprandial lipemia, glucose tolerance, and insulin sensitivity, all of which are risk factors for cardiovascular disease. However, recent research suggests that prolonged sedentary behavior might abolish these healthy metabolic benefits. Accordingly, this study aimed to elucidate the impact of an acute bout of exercise on postprandial plasma triglyceride, glucose, and insulin concentrations after 4 days of prolonged sitting (~13.5 h/day). Ten untrained to recreationally active men (n = 5) and women (n = 5) completed a counterbalanced, crossover study. Four days of prolonged sitting without exercise (SIT) were compared with 4 days of prolonged sitting with a 1-h bout of treadmill exercise (SIT + EX; 63.1\u2009\u00b1\u20095.2% V\u0307o2max) on the evening of the fourth day. The following morning, participants completed a high-fat/glucose tolerance test (HFGTT), during which plasma was collected over a 6-h period and analyzed for triglycerides, glucose, and insulin. No differences between trials (P > 0.05) were found in the overall plasma triglyceride, glucose, or insulin responses during the HFGTT. This lack of difference between trials comes with similarly low physical activity (~3,500-4,000 steps/day) on each day except for the 1-h bout of exercise during SIT + EX the day before the HFGTT. These data indicate that physical inactivity (e.g., sitting ~13.5 h/day and <4,000 steps/day) creates a condition whereby people become \"resistant\" to the metabolic improvements that are typically derived from an acute bout of aerobic exercise (i.e., exercise resistance). NEW & NOTEWORTHY In people who are physically inactive and sitting for a majority of the day, a 1-h bout of vigorous exercise failed to improve lipid, glucose, and insulin metabolism measured the next day. It seems that something inherent to inactivity and/or prolonged sitting makes the body resistant to the 1 h of exercise preventing the normally derived metabolic improvements following exercise. ",
        "Effect of a Workplace Wellness Program on Employee Health and Economic Outcomes: A Randomized Clinical Trial. Importance: Employers have increasingly invested in workplace wellness programs to improve employee health and decrease health care costs. However, there is little experimental evidence on the effects of these programs. Objective: To evaluate a multicomponent workplace wellness program resembling programs offered by US employers. Design, Setting, and Participants: This clustered randomized trial was implemented at 160 worksites from January 2015 through June 2016. Administrative claims and employment data were gathered continuously through June 30, 2016; data from surveys and biometrics were collected from July 1, 2016, through August 31, 2016. Interventions: There were 20 randomly selected treatment worksites (4037 employees) and 140 randomly selected control worksites (28\u202f937 employees, including 20 primary control worksites [4106 employees]). Control worksites received no wellness programming. The program comprised 8 modules focused on nutrition, physical activity, stress reduction, and related topics implemented by registered dietitians at the treatment worksites. Main Outcomes and Measures: Four outcome domains were assessed. Self-reported health and behaviors via surveys (29 outcomes) and clinical measures of health via screenings (10 outcomes) were compared among 20 intervention and 20 primary control sites; health care spending and utilization (38 outcomes) and employment outcomes (3 outcomes) from administrative data were compared among 20 intervention and 140 control sites. Results: Among 32\u202f974 employees (mean [SD] age, 38.6 [15.2] years; 15\u202f272 [45.9%] women), the mean participation rate in surveys and screenings at intervention sites was 36.2% to 44.6% (n\u2009=\u20094037 employees) and at primary control sites was 34.4% to 43.0% (n\u2009=\u20094106 employees) (mean of 1.3 program modules completed). After 18 months, the rates for 2 self-reported outcomes were higher in the intervention group than in the control group: for engaging in regular exercise (69.8% vs 61.9%; adjusted difference, 8.3 percentage points [95% CI, 3.9-12.8]; adjusted P\u2009=\u2009.03) and for actively managing weight (69.2% vs 54.7%; adjusted difference, 13.6 percentage points [95% CI, 7.1-20.2]; adjusted P\u2009=\u2009.02). The program had no significant effects on other prespecified outcomes: 27 self-reported health outcomes and behaviors (including self-reported health, sleep quality, and food choices), 10 clinical markers of health (including cholesterol, blood pressure, and body mass index), 38 medical and pharmaceutical spending and utilization measures, and 3 employment outcomes (absenteeism, job tenure, and job performance). Conclusions and Relevance: Among employees of a large US warehouse retail company, a workplace wellness program resulted in significantly greater rates of some positive self-reported health behaviors among those exposed compared with employees who were not exposed, but there were no significant differences in clinical measures of health, health care spending and utilization, and employment outcomes after 18 months. Although limited by incomplete data on some outcomes, these findings may temper expectations about the financial return on investment that wellness programs can deliver in the short term.

        "Restoration of brain circulation and cellular functions hours post-mortem. The brains of humans and other mammals are highly vulnerable to interruptions in blood flow and decreases in oxygen levels. Here we describe the restoration and maintenance of microcirculation and molecular and cellular functions of the intact pig brain under ex vivo normothermic conditions up to four hours post-mortem. We have developed an extracorporeal pulsatile-perfusion system and a haemoglobin-based, acellular, non-coagulative, echogenic, and cytoprotective perfusate that promotes recovery from anoxia, reduces reperfusion injury, prevents oedema, and metabolically supports the energy requirements of the brain. With this system, we observed preservation of cytoarchitecture; attenuation of cell death; and restoration of vascular dilatory and glial inflammatory responses, spontaneous synaptic activity, and active cerebral metabolism in the absence of global electrocorticographic activity. These findings demonstrate that under appropriate conditions the isolated, intact large mammalian brain possesses an underappreciated capacity for restoration of microcirculation and molecular and cellular activity after a prolonged post-mortem interval.

        "Engineered nanoparticles bind elapid snake venom toxins and inhibit venom-induced dermonecrosis. Envenomings by snakebites constitute a serious and challenging global health issue. The mainstay in the therapy of snakebite envenomings is the parenteral administration of animal-derived antivenoms. Significantly, antivenoms are only partially effective in the control of local tissue damage. A novel approach to mitigate the progression of local tissue damage that could complement the antivenom therapy of envenomings is proposed. We describe an abiotic hydrogel nanoparticle engineered to bind to and modulate the activity of a diverse array of PLA2 and 3FTX isoforms found in Elapidae snake venoms. These two families of protein toxins share features that are associated with their common (membrane) targets, allowing for nanoparticle sequestration by a mechanism that differs from immunological (epitope) selection. The nanoparticles are non-toxic in mice and inhibit dose-dependently the dermonecrotic activity of Naja nigricollis venom. ",
        "Preterm birth and risk of chronic kidney disease from childhood into mid-adulthood: national cohort study. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relation between preterm birth (gestational age <37 weeks) and risk of CKD from childhood into mid-adulthood. DESIGN: National cohort study. SETTING: Sweden. PARTICIPANTS: 4\u2009186\u2009615 singleton live births in Sweden during 1973-2014. EXPOSURES: Gestational age at birth, identified from nationwide birth records in the Swedish birth registry. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: CKD, identified from nationwide inpatient and outpatient diagnoses through 2015 (maximum age 43 years). Cox regression was used to examine gestational age at birth and risk of CKD while adjusting for potential confounders, and co-sibling analyses assessed the influence of unmeasured shared familial (genetic or environmental) factors. RESULTS: 4305 (0.1%) participants had a diagnosis of CKD during 87.0 million person years of follow-up. Preterm birth and extremely preterm birth (<28 weeks) were associated with nearly twofold and threefold risks of CKD, respectively, from birth into mid-adulthood (adjusted hazard ratio 1.94, 95% confidence interval 1.74 to 2.16; P<0.001; 3.01, 1.67 to 5.45; P<0.001). An increased risk was observed even among those born at early term (37-38 weeks) (1.30, 1.20 to 1.40; P<0.001). The association between preterm birth and CKD was strongest at ages 0-9 years (5.09, 4.11 to 6.31; P<0.001), then weakened but remained increased at ages 10-19 years (1.97, 1.57 to 2.49; P<0.001) and 20-43 years (1.34, 1.15 to 1.57; P<0.001). These associations affected both males and females and did not seem to be related to shared genetic or environmental factors in families. CONCLUSIONS: Preterm and early term birth are strong risk factors for the development of CKD from childhood into mid-adulthood. People born prematurely need long term follow-up for monitoring and preventive actions to preserve renal function across the life course. ",
        "Association of Exposure to Infections in Childhood With Risk of Eating Disorders in Adolescent Girls. Importance: Infections are recognized as playing a critical role in the risk of psychiatric disorders and suicidal behavior; however, few studies have evaluated the risk of eating disorders. Objective: To evaluate the association of hospitalization for infections and treatment with anti-infective agents with the risk of an eating disorder diagnosis. Design, Setting, and Participants: A nationwide, population-based, prospective cohort study of 525\u202f643 girls born from January 1, 1989, to December 31, 2006, and followed up until December 31, 2012, was conducted using individual-level data drawn from Danish longitudinal registers. Data were analyzed from January 15 to June 15, 2018, using survival analysis models and adjusted for age, calendar period, parental educational level, and parental history of psychiatric illness. Exposures: Hospital admission for infections and prescribed anti-infective agents for infections. Main Outcomes and Measures: The main outcome of interest was diagnosis of an eating disorder (anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, or eating disorder not otherwise specified) in a hospital, outpatient clinic, or emergency department setting. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and accompanying 95% CIs. Results: The study population consisted of 525\u202f643 adolescent girls: 2131 received a diagnosis of anorexia nervosa (median [range] age, 15.2 [8.6-21.3] years), 711 received a diagnosis of bulimia nervosa (median [range] age, 17.9 [13.4-22.7] years), and 1398 received a diagnosis of an eating disorder not otherwise specified (median [range] age, 15.6 [8.6-21.6] years). A total of 525\u202f643 adolescent girls were followed up for 4\u202f601\u202f720.4 person-years until a mean age of 16.2 years (range, 10.5-22.7 years). Severe infections that required hospitalization were associated with an increased risk of a subsequent diagnosis of anorexia nervosa by 22% (HR, 1.22; 95% CI, 1.10-1.35), bulimia nervosa by 35% (HR, 1.35; 95% CI, 1.13-1.60), and eating disorder not otherwise specified by 39% (HR, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.23-1.57) compared with adolescent girls without hospitalizations for infections. Infections treated with anti-infective agents were associated with an increased risk of a subsequent diagnosis of anorexia nervosa by 23% (HR, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.10-1.37), bulimia nervosa by 63% (HR, 1.63; 95% CI, 1.32-2.02), and eating disorder not otherwise specified by 45% (HR, 1.45; 95% CI, 1.25-1.67) compared with adolescent girls without infections treated with anti-infective agents. Conclusions and Relevance: The findings suggest that hospital-treated infections and less severe infections treated with anti-infective agents are associated with increased risk of subsequent anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and eating disorders not otherwise specified and that future studies should investigate whether these associations are causal and identify the exact mechanisms between infections and subsequent inflammatory processes with eating disorders.

        "Association of High Intakes of Vitamins B6 and B12 From Food and Supplements With Risk of Hip Fracture Among Postmenopausal Women in the Nurses' Health Study. Importance: Vitamin supplementation far exceeding recommended doses is popular in segments of the population. However, adverse effects can occur. In a previous secondary analysis of combined data from 2 double-blind randomized clinical trials (RCTs), an unexpected increased risk of hip fracture was found among those treated with high doses of vitamin B6 in combination with vitamin B12. Objectives: To study if high intakes of vitamins B6 and B12 from food and supplements were associated with a risk of hip fracture in the Nurses' Health Study and to investigate whether combined high intakes of both vitamins conferred a particularly increased fracture risk. Design, Setting, and Participants: In this prospective cohort study, 75\u202f864 postmenopausal women in the United States were followed up from June 1984 through May 2014. The dates of analysis were July 2016 to June 2018. Information on hip fracture and a wide range of potential confounders was collected at baseline and with biennial follow-up questionnaires. Extensive dietary information was collected approximately every 4 years with a semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire. Relative risks (RRs) were calculated by Cox proportional hazards regression, with cumulative average intakes of vitamins B6 and B12 as main exposures, adjusting for potential confounders. Main Outcome and Measure: Hip fracture. Results: During follow-up, 2304 of 75\u202f864 women had a hip fracture. Among the women with hip fractures, the median (range) age at hip fracture was 75.8 (46.7-93.0) years and the mean (SD) body mass index (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) was 24.3 (4.6). Median (interquartile range) cumulative average intakes of total vitamins B6 and B12 were 3.6 (4.8) mg/d and 12.1 (11.7) \u03bcg/d, respectively. Both vitamin B6 (RR, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.04-1.59 for an intake of \u226535 vs <2 mg/d; P\u2009=\u2009.06 for linear trend) and vitamin B12 (RR, 1.25; 95% CI, 0.98-1.58 for an intake of \u226530 vs <5 \u03bcg/d; P\u2009=\u2009.02 for linear trend) were associated with increased fracture risk. Risk was highest in women with a combined high intake of both vitamins (B6 \u226535 mg/d and B12 \u226520 \u03bcg/d), exhibiting an almost 50% increased risk of hip fracture (RR, 1.47; 95% CI, 1.15-1.89) compared with women with a low intake of both vitamins (B6 <2 mg/d and B12 <10 \u03bcg/d). Conclusions and Relevance: In this cohort study, a combined high intake of vitamins B6 and B12 was associated with an increased risk of hip fracture. The intakes were far higher than the recommended dietary allowances. These findings add to previous studies suggesting that vitamin supplements should be used cautiously because adverse effects can occur. ",
        "The association between in-utero exposure to stressful life events during pregnancy and male reproductive function in a cohort of 20-year-old offspring: The Raine Study. STUDY QUESTION: Is exposure to gestational stress in the critical time window for the normal differentiation and growth of male reproductive tissue associated with male reproductive function in offspring in later life?. SUMMARY ANSWER: Exposure to stressful life events (SLEs) in early, but not late gestation, are associated with reduced adult male reproductive function, consistent with the hypothesis that events during early prenatal life programme adult male reproductive function. WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN: Animal studies suggest that gestational stress may impact on the reproductive function of male offspring, but human evidence is sparse. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: Using a prospective longitudinal cohort, we examined the association between number and type of maternal stressors during pregnancy in both early and late gestation and reproductive function in 643 male Generation 2 (offspring) at age 20 years. Mothers and their male Generation 2 (offspring) from The Raine Study participated. Mothers prospectively reported SLEs during pregnancy recorded at gestational weeks 18 and 34 using a standardized 10-point questionnaire. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: The 643 male Generation 2 (offspring) underwent testicular ultrasound examination and semen analysis and provided serum for reproductive hormone analysis. Multivariate linear regression analysis was used to examine associations. MAIN RESULTS AND ROLE OF CHANCE: Of 643 recruited males, 407 (63%) were exposed to at least one SLE in early gestation. Fewer SLEs were reported in late gestation (n\u2009=\u2009343, 53%). Maternal SLE exposure in early gestation was negatively associated with total sperm count (\u03b2\u2009=\u2009-0.31, 95% CI -0.58; -0.03), number of progressive motile sperm (\u03b2\u2009=\u2009-0.15, 95% CI -0.31; 0.00) and morning serum testosterone concentration (\u03b2\u2009=\u2009-0.04, 95% CI -0.09; -0.00). No similar effects of maternal SLE exposure in late pregnancy were detected. The large sample size and an objective detailed direct assessment of adult male reproductive function with strict external quality control for sperm quality, as well as detailed prospectively collected information on prenatal SLEs in two distinct time windows of pregnancy reported by the women in early and late gestation along with other risk factors, imply minimal possibility of recall, information bias and selection bias. When assessing our results, we adjusted for a priori chosen confounders, but residual confounding or confounding by factors unbeknown to us cannot be ruled out. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: It is not possible to measure how SLEs impacted differently on the mother's experience or perception of stress. Resilience (coping) gradients may alter cortisol levels and thus modify the associations we observed and the mothers' own perception of stress severity may have provided a more precise estimate of her exposure. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: Our findings suggest that exposure to SLEs in early, but not late gestation, are associated with reduced adult male reproductive function. Improved support for women with exposure to SLEs during pregnancy, particularly during the first trimester, may improve the reproductive health of their male offspring in later life. Intervention studies of improved pregnancy support could provide more insight into this association and more information is needed about the potential specific epigenetic mechanisms underlying this association.

        "Association of Caffeine Intake and Caffeinated Coffee Consumption With Risk of Incident Rosacea in Women. Importance: Caffeine is known to decrease vasodilation and have immunosuppressant effects, which may potentially decrease the risk of rosacea. However, the heat from coffee may be a trigger for rosacea flares. The relationship between the risk of rosacea and caffeine intake, including coffee consumption, is poorly understood. Objective: To determine the association between the risk of incident rosacea and caffeine intake, including coffee consumption. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study included 82\u202f737 women in the Nurses' Health Study II (NHS II), a prospective cohort established in 1989, with follow-up conducted biennially between 1991 and 2005. All analysis took place between June 2017 and June 2018. Exposures: Data on coffee, tea, soda, and chocolate consumption were collected every 4 years during follow-up. Main Outcomes and Measures: Information on history of clinician-diagnosed rosacea and year of diagnosis was collected in 2005. Results: A total of 82\u202f737 women responded to the question regarding a diagnosis of rosacea in 2005 in NHS II and were included in the final analysis (mean [SD] age at study entry, 50.5 [4.6] years). During 1\u202f120\u202f051 person-years of follow-up, we identified 4945 incident cases of rosacea. After adjustment for other risk factors, we found an inverse association between increased caffeine intake and risk of rosacea (hazard ratio for the highest quintile of caffeine intake vs the lowest, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.69-0.84; P\u2009<\u2009.001 for trend). A significant inverse association with risk of rosacea was also observed for caffeinated coffee consumption (HR, 0.77 for those who consumed \u22654 servings/d vs those who consumed <1/mo; 95% CI, 0.69-0.87; P\u2009<\u2009.001 for trend), but not for decaffeinated coffee (HR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.56-1.14; P\u2009=\u2009.39 for trend). Further analyses found that increased caffeine intake from foods other than coffee (tea, soda, and chocolate) was not significantly associated with decreased risk of rosacea. Conclusions and Relevance: Increased caffeine intake from coffee was inversely associated with the risk of incident rosacea. Our findings do not support limiting caffeine intake as a means to prevent rosacea. Further studies are required to explain the mechanisms of action of these associations, to replicate our findings in other populations, and to explore the relationship of caffeine with different rosacea subtypes.

        "Serial circulating omega 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids and healthy ageing among older adults in the Cardiovascular Health Study: prospective cohort study. OBJECTIVE: To determine the longitudinal association between serial biomarker measures of circulating omega 3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (n3-PUFA) levels and healthy ageing. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: Four communities in the United States (Cardiovascular Health Study) from 1992 to 2015. PARTICIPANTS: 2622 adults with a mean (SD) age of 74.4 (4.8) and with successful healthy ageing at baseline in 1992-93. EXPOSURE: Cumulative levels of plasma phospholipid n3-PUFAs were measured using gas chromatography in 1992-93, 1998-99, and 2005-06, expressed as percentage of total fatty acids, including \u03b1-linolenic acid from plants and eicosapentaenoic acid, docosapentaenoic acid, and docosahexaenoic acid from seafoood. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Healthy ageing defined as survival without chronic diseases (ie, cardiovascular disease, cancer, lung disease, and severe chronic kidney disease), the absence of cognitive and physical dysfunction, or death from other causes not part of the healthy ageing outcome after age 65. Events were centrally adjudicated or determined from medical records and diagnostic tests. RESULTS: Higher levels of long chain n3-PUFAs were associated with an 18% lower risk (95% confidence interval 7% to 28%) of unhealthy ageing per interquintile range after multivariable adjustments with time-varying exposure and covariates. Individually, higher eicosapentaenoic acid and docosapentaenoic acid (but not docosahexaenoic acid) levels were associated with a lower risk: 15% (6% to 23%) and 16% (6% to 25%), respectively. \u03b1-linolenic acid from plants was not noticeably associated with unhealthy ageing (hazard ratio 0.92, 95% confidence interval 0.83 to 1.02). CONCLUSIONS: In older adults, a higher cumulative level of serially measured circulating n3-PUFAs from seafood (eicosapentaenoic acid, docosapentaenoic acid, and docosahexaenoic acid), eicosapentaenoic acid, and docosapentaenoic acid (but not docosahexaenoic acid from seafood or \u03b1-linolenic acid from plants) was associated with a higher likelihood of healthy ageing. These findings support guidelines for increased dietary consumption of n3-PUFAs in older adults. ",
        "Incidence of Herpes Zoster Among Children: 2003-2014. BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: After the 1996 introduction of routine varicella vaccination in the United States, most studies evaluating pediatric herpes zoster (HZ) incidence reported lower incidence over time, with varying degrees of decline. Using the combined databases of 6 integrated health care organizations, we examined HZ incidence in children over a 12-year period in the varicella vaccine era. METHODS: This study included children aged 0 through 17 years from 2003 through 2014. Using electronic medical records, we identified HZ cases through International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision diagnosis code 053. We calculated HZ incidence rates per 100\u2009000 person years of health plan membership for all children and among children who were vaccinated versus unvaccinated. We calculated rates for the 12-year period and examined temporal trends. Among children who were vaccinated, we compared HZ rates by month and year of age at vaccination. RESULTS: The study included 6\u2009372\u2009067 children with \u22651 month of health plan membership. For the 12-year period, the crude HZ incidence rate for all subjects was 74 per 100\u2009000 person years, and the rate among children who were vaccinated was 38 per 100\u2009000 person years, which was 78% lower than that among children who were unvaccinated (170 per 100\u2009000 person years; P < .0001). Overall HZ incidence declined by 72% (P < .0001) from 2003 through 2014. Annual rates in children who were vaccinated were consistently lower than in children who were unvaccinated. CONCLUSIONS: With this population-based study, we confirm the decline in pediatric HZ incidence and the significantly lower incidence among children who are vaccinated, reinforcing the benefit of routine varicella vaccination to prevent pediatric HZ.

        "Shifting Age of Peak Binge Drinking Prevalence: Historical Changes in Normative Trajectories Among Young Adults Aged 18 to 30. BACKGROUND: This study examined the extent to which the developmental pattern of prevalence of binge drinking in the past 2\u00a0weeks from ages 18 through 30 has changed across 29 cohorts of U.S. young adults, and whether the changes differed by gender. METHODS: Analyses used national longitudinal data from 58,019 12th-grade students (from graduating high school classes 1976 to 2004) participating in the Monitoring the Future study followed through modal age 30 (with age 29/30 data collected from 1987 to 2016). Weighted time-varying effect modeling was used to model cohort group differences in age-related patterns of binge drinking. RESULTS: The age of peak binge drinking prevalence increased across cohorts (from age 20 in 1976 to 1985 to 22 in 1996 to 2004 for women, and from 21 in 1976 to 1985 to 23 in 1996 to 2004 for men). Historical change in the developmental pattern of binge drinking across all ages of young adulthood differed for men and women. Even after controlling for key covariates, women in the more recent cohort group reported significantly higher binge drinking prevalence than women in earlier cohorts from ages 21 through 30. Men in the more recent cohort group reported higher binge drinking prevalence at ages 25 to 26, but prevalence levels then converged to those seen in earlier cohort groups by age 30. CONCLUSIONS: An older age of peak binge drinking and a decreased rate of decline in the prevalence of binge drinking in later young adulthood among more recent cohorts have resulted in an extension of individual and societal risks associated with binge drinking, particularly for women, across young adulthood. High-risk alcohol use prevention efforts are needed throughout at least the third decade of life. ",
        "Effect of aerobic exercise on cognition in younger adults: A randomized clinical trial. OBJECTIVE: To determine efficacy of aerobic exercise for cognitive function in younger healthy adults. METHODS: In a randomized, parallel-group, observer-masked, community-based clinical trial, 132 cognitively normal individuals aged 20-67 with below median aerobic capacity were randomly assigned to one of two 6-month, 4-times-weekly conditions: aerobic exercise and stretching/toning. Efficacy measures included aerobic capacity; cognitive function in several domains (executive function, episodic memory, processing speed, language, and attention), everyday function, body mass index (BMI), and cortical thickness. RESULTS: Aerobic capacity increased significantly (\u03b2 = 2.718; p = 0.003), and BMI decreased significantly (\u03b2 = -0.596; p = 0.013) in the aerobic exercise but not in the stretching/toning condition. Executive function improved significantly in the aerobic exercise condition; this effect was moderated by age (\u03b2 = 0.018 SD/y; p = 0.028). At age 40, the executive function measure increased by 0.228 SD (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.007-0.448), and by 0.596 SD (95% CI 0.219-0.973) at age 60. Cortical thickness increased significantly in the aerobic exercise group in a left frontal region and did not interact with age. Controlling for age and baseline performance, individuals with at least one APOE \u03b54 allele showed less improvement in executive function with aerobic exercise (\u03b2 = 0.5129, 95% CI 0.0381-0.988; p = 0.0346). CONCLUSIONS: This randomized clinical trial demonstrates the efficacy of aerobic exercise for cognition in adults age 20-67. The effect of aerobic exercise on executive function was more pronounced as age increased, suggesting that it may mitigate age-related declines. Increased cortical thickness suggests that aerobic exercise contributes to brain health in individuals as young as age 20. CLINICALTRIALSGOV IDENTIFIER: NCT01179958. CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE: This study provides Class II evidence that for adults age 20-67 with below median aerobic capacity, aerobic exercise significantly improves executive function but not other measures of cognitive function.

        "Vertebral Fractures in Individuals With Type 2 Diabetes: More Than Skeletal Complications Alone. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to assess whether individuals with type 2 diabetes (T2D) have increased risk of vertebral fractures (VFs) and to estimate nonvertebral fracture and mortality risk among individuals with both prevalent T2D and VFs. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A systematic PubMed search was performed to identify studies that investigated the relationship between T2D and VFs. Cohorts providing individual participant data (IPD) were also included. Estimates from published summary data and IPD cohorts were pooled in a random-effects meta-analysis. Multivariate Cox regression models were used to estimate nonvertebral fracture and mortality risk among individuals with T2D and VFs. RESULTS: Across 15 studies comprising 852,705 men and women, individuals with T2D had lower risk of prevalent (odds ratio [OR] 0.84 [95% CI 0.74-0.95]; I.                         2.                      = 0.0%; Phet = 0.54) but increased risk of incident VFs (OR 1.35 [95% CI 1.27-1.44]; I.                         2.                      = 0.6%; Phet = 0.43). In the IPD cohorts (N = 19,820), risk of nonvertebral fractures was higher in those with both T2D and VFs compared with those without T2D or VFs (hazard ratio [HR] 2.42 [95% CI 1.86-3.15]) or with VFs (HR 1.73 [95% CI 1.32-2.27]) or T2D (HR 1.94 [95% CI 1.46-2.59]) alone. Individuals with both T2D and VFs had increased mortality compared with individuals without T2D and VFs (HR 2.11 [95% CI 1.72-2.59]) or with VFs alone (HR 1.84 [95% CI 1.49-2.28]) and borderline increased compared with individuals with T2D alone (HR 1.23 [95% CI 0.99-1.52]). CONCLUSIONS: Based on our findings, individuals with T2D should be systematically assessed for presence of VFs, and, as in individuals without T2D, their presence constitutes an indication to start osteoporosis treatment for the prevention of future fractures.

        "How are different levels of knowledge about physical activity associated with physical activity behaviour in Australian adults?. People with knowledge of the benefits of physical activity tend to be more active; however, such knowledge is typically operationalized as a basic understanding that physical activity is 'good' for health. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate whether there are differences in how detailed a person's knowledge is about the benefits of physical activity. Participants (N = 615) completed an online survey to measure their current physical activity behaviour, as well as their level of knowledge of the benefits and risks of physical (in)activity. The majority of participants (99.6%) strongly agreed that physical activity is good for health, however on average, participants only identified 13.8 out of 22 diseases associated with physical inactivity and over half of participants (55.6%) could not identify how much physical activity is recommended for health benefits. Furthermore, 45% of the participants overestimated, 9% underestimated and 27% did not know the increased risk of disease resulting from inactivity as indicated by the Australian Department of Health. Participants were significantly more active when they correctly identified more diseases associated with physical inactivity and when they overestimated the risks associated with inactivity. Therefore, health promotion initiatives should increase knowledge of the types of diseases associated with inactivity. Low knowledge of physical activity guidelines suggest they should be promoted more, as this knowledge provides guidance on frequency, types and duration of physical activity needed for health. ",
        "How well do activity monitors estimate energy expenditure? A systematic review and meta-analysis of the validity of current technologies. OBJECTIVE: To determine the accuracy of wrist and arm-worn activity monitors' estimates of energy expenditure (EE). DATA SOURCES: SportDISCUS (EBSCOHost), PubMed, MEDLINE (Ovid), PsycINFO (EBSCOHost), Embase (Ovid) and CINAHL (EBSCOHost). DESIGN: A random effects meta-analysis was performed to evaluate the difference in EE estimates between activity monitors and criterion measurements. Moderator analyses were conducted to determine the benefit of additional sensors and to compare the accuracy of devices used for research purposes with commercially available devices. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: We included studies validating EE estimates from wrist-worn or arm-worn activity monitors against criterion measures (indirect calorimetry, room calorimeters and doubly labelled water) in healthy adult populations. RESULTS: 60 studies (104 effect sizes) were included in the meta-analysis. Devices showed variable accuracy depending on activity type. Large and significant heterogeneity was observed for many devices (I2 >75%). Combining heart rate or heat sensing technology with accelerometry decreased the error in most activity types. Research-grade devices were statistically more accurate for comparisons of total EE but less accurate than commercial devices during ambulatory activity and sedentary tasks. CONCLUSIONS: EE estimates from wrist and arm-worn devices differ in accuracy depending on activity type. Addition of physiological sensors improves estimates of EE, and research-grade devices are superior for total EE. These data highlight the need to improve estimates of EE from wearable devices, and one way this can be achieved is with the addition of heart rate to accelerometry.

        "Assessing the performance of genome-wide association studies for predicting disease risk. To date more than 3700 genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been published that look at the genetic contributions of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to human conditions or human phenotypes. Through these studies many highly significant SNPs have been identified for hundreds of diseases or medical conditions. However, the extent to which GWAS-identified SNPs or combinations of SNP biomarkers can predict disease risk is not well known. One of the most commonly used approaches to assess the performance of predictive biomarkers is to determine the area under the receiver-operator characteristic curve (AUROC). We have developed an R package called G-WIZ to generate ROC curves and calculate the AUROC using summary-level GWAS data. We first tested the performance of G-WIZ by using AUROC values derived from patient-level SNP data, as well as literature-reported AUROC values. We found that G-WIZ predicts the AUROC with <3% error. Next, we used the summary level GWAS data from GWAS Central to determine the ROC curves and AUROC values for 569 different GWA studies spanning 219 different conditions. Using these data we found a small number of GWA studies with SNP-derived risk predictors that have very high AUROCs (>0.75). On the other hand, the average GWA study produces a multi-SNP risk predictor with an AUROC of 0.55. Detailed AUROC comparisons indicate that most SNP-derived risk predictions are not as good as clinically based disease risk predictors. All our calculations (ROC curves, AUROCs, explained heritability) are in a publicly accessible database called GWAS-ROCS (http://gwasrocs.ca). The G-WIZ code is freely available for download at https://github.com/jonaspatronjp/GWIZ-Rscript/. ",
        "2018 International Consensus Statement on Golf and Health to guide action by people, policymakers and the golf industry. Scientific and public interest relating to golf and health has increased recently. Players, potential players, the golf industry and facilities, and decision makers will benefit from a better understanding of how to realise potential health benefits and minimise health issues related to golf. We outline an International Consensus on Golf and Health. A systematic literature review informed the development of a survey. Utilising modified Delphi methods, an expert panel of 25 persons including public health and golf industry leaders, took part in serial surveys providing feedback on suggested items, and proposing new items. Predefined criteria for agreement determined whether each item was included within each survey round and in the final consensus. The working group identi\ufb01ed 79 scientifically supportable statement items from literature review and discussions. Twenty-five experts (100%) completed all three rounds of surveys, rating each item, and suggesting modifications and/or new items for inclusion in subsequent surveys. After three rounds, 83 items achieved consensus with each with >75%\u2009agreement and <10%\u2009disagreement. These items are included in the final International Consensus on Golf and Health. The final consensus presented here can inform scientific knowledge, and action plans for (1) golfers and potential golfers, (2) golf facilities and the golf industry, and (3) policy and decision makers external to golf. These outputs, if widely adopted, will contribute to an improved understanding of golf and health, and aid these groups in making evidence-informed decisions to improve health and well-being. ",
        "Population Impact Attributable to Modifiable Risk Factors for Hyperuricemia. OBJECTIVE: To examine modifiable risk factors in relation to the presence of hyperuricemia and to estimate the proportion of hyperuricemia cases in the general population that could be prevented by risk factor modification, along with estimates of the variance explained. METHODS: Using data obtained from 14,624 adults representative of the US civilian noninstitutionalized population, we calculated adjusted prevalence ratios for hyperuricemia, population attributable risks (PARs), and the variance explained according to the following 4 factors: body mass index (BMI; \u226525 kg/m2 ), alcohol intake, nonadherence to a Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet, and diuretic use. RESULTS: BMI, alcohol intake, adherence to a DASH-style diet, and diuretic use were all associated with serum urate levels and the presence of hyperuricemia in a dose-dependent manner. The corresponding PARs of hyperuricemia cases for overweight/obesity (prevalence 60%), nonadherence to a DASH-style diet (prevalence 82%), alcohol use (prevalence 48%), and diuretic use (prevalence 8%) were 44% (95% confidence interval [95% CI] 41%, 48%), 9% (95% CI 3%, 16%), 8% (95% CI 5%, 11%), and 12% (95% CI 11%, 14%), respectively, whereas the corresponding variances explained were 8.9%, 0.1%, 0.5%, and 5.0%. Our simulation study showed the variance nearing 0% as exposure prevalence neared 100%. CONCLUSION: In this nationally representative study, 4 modifiable risk factors (BMI, the DASH diet, alcohol use, and diuretic use) could be used to individually account for a notable proportion of hyperuricemia cases. However, the corresponding serum urate variance explained by these risk factors was very small and paradoxically masked their high prevalences, providing real-life empirical evidence for its limitations in assessing common risk factors.

        "Association between pubic hair grooming and prevalent sexually transmitted infection among female university students. Recent findings have suggested an association between pubic hair grooming and self-reported history of sexually transmitted infection (STI), specifically gonococcal infection (GC), chlamydial infection (CT), or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). We evaluated the association between self-reported extreme grooming and laboratory-confirmed prevalence of GC/CT. Between April 2017 and April 2018, we enrolled English-speaking, adult, female students at a large, Midwestern university who presented on-campus for STI testing. Participants completed a questionnaire on demographics and sexual and grooming behaviors, which was linked to their GC/CT test results based on nucleic acid amplification testing. We defined extreme grooming as removal of all pubic hair either at least weekly in the past 12 months or \u22656 times in the past 30 days. We used two separate logistic regression models to determine whether odds of GC/CT varied by extreme groomer status for either time interval. In the study sample of 214 women, prevalence of GC/CT was 9.8%. Nearly all participants (98.1%) reported ever grooming; 53.6% were extreme groomers in the past year and 18% in the past month. Extreme grooming was not associated with prevalent GC/CT in the past year (odds ratio [OR] = 0.8; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.3-1.9; adjusted OR = 0.7; 95% CI: 0.3-2.0) or in the past month (OR = 0.5; 95% CI: 0.1-2.0; aOR = 0.4; 95% CI: 0.1-1.9). Pubic hair grooming was common among female university students attending for STI testing. Findings do not support pubic hair grooming as an STI risk factor in this population. ",
        "Increasing adolescent firearm homicides and racial disparities following Florida's 'Stand Your Ground' self-defence law. Establishing whether specific laws impact rates of firearm homicide in adolescents is critical for identifying opportunities to reduce preventable adolescent death. We evaluated Florida's Stand Your Ground law, enacted October 2005, using an interrupted time series design from 1999 to 2017. We used segmented quasi-Poisson regression to model underlying trends in quarterly rates of adolescent (15-19 years) firearm homicide in Florida and disaggregated by race (Black/White). We used synthetic and negative controls (firearm suicide) to address time-varying confounding. Before Florida's Stand Your Ground law, the mean quarterly rate was 1.53 firearm homicides per 100 000 adolescents. Black adolescents comprised 63.5% of all adolescent firearm homicides before and 71.8% after the law. After adjusting for trends, the law was associated with a 44.6% increase in adolescent firearm homicide. Our analysis indicates that Florida's Stand Your Ground is associated with a significant increase in firearm homicide and may also exacerbate racial disparities. ",
        "Relationship of Consistency in Timing of Exercise Performance and Exercise Levels Among Successful Weight Loss Maintainers. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate whether consistency in time of day that moderate- to vigorous-intensity physical activity (MVPA) is performed relates to MVPA levels among successful weight loss maintainers in the National Weight Control Registry. METHODS: Participants (n\u2009=\u2009375) reporting MVPA on\u2009\u2265\u20092 d/wk completed measures of temporal consistency in physical activity (PA) (>\u200950% of MVPA sessions per week occurring during the same time window: early/late morning, afternoon, or evening), PA levels, PA automaticity, and consistency in cues underlying PA habit formation (e.g., location). RESULTS: Most (68.0%) participants reported temporally consistent MVPA. These individuals reported higher MVPA frequency (4.8\u2009\u00b1\u20091.6 vs. 4.4\u2009\u00b1\u20091.5 d/wk; P\u2009=\u20090.007) and duration (median [IQR]: 350.0 [200.0-510.0] vs. 285.0 [140.0-460.0] min/wk; P\u2009=\u20090.03), and they were more likely to achieve the national MVPA guideline (\u2265\u2009150 min/wk) than temporally inconsistent exercisers (86.3% vs. 74.2%, P\u2009=\u20090.004). Among temporally consistent exercisers, 47.8% were early-morning exercisers; MVPA levels did not differ by time of day of routine MVPA performance (P\u2009>\u20090.05). Greater automaticity and consistency in several cues were related to greater MVPA among all participants. CONCLUSIONS: Most participants reported consistent timing of MVPA. Temporal consistency was associated with greater MVPA, regardless of the specific time of day of routine MVPA performance. Consistency in exercise timing and other cues might help explain characteristic high PA levels among successful maintainers. ",
        "Promotion of Testing for Celiac Disease and the Gluten-Free Diet Among Complementary and Alternative Medicine Practitioners. INTRODUCTION: We identified the frequency and assessed the validity of marketing claims made by American chiropractors, naturopaths, homeopaths, acupuncturists, and integrative medicine practitioners relating to the diagnosis and treatment of celiac disease and nonceliac gluten sensitivity (NCGS), both of which have increased in prevalence in recent years. METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional study analyzing websites of practitioners from 10 cities in the United States and analyzed the websites for any mention of celiac or NCGS as well as specific claims of ability to diagnose, ability to treat, and treatment efficacy. We classified treatments promoted as true, false, or unproven, as assessed independently by 2 authors. RESULTS: Of 500 clinics identified, 178 (35.6%) made a claim regarding celiac disease, NCGS, or a gluten-free diet. Naturopath clinic websites have the highest rates of advertising at least one of diagnosis, treatment, or efficacy for celiac disease (40%), followed by integrative medicine clinics (36%), homeopaths (20%), acupuncturists (14%), and chiropractors (12%). Integrative medicine clinics have the highest rates of advertising at least one of diagnosis, treatment, or efficacy for NCGS (45%), followed by naturopaths (37%), homeopaths (14%), chiropractors (14%), and acupuncturists (10%). A geographic analysis yielded no significant variation in marketing rates among clinics from different cities. Of 232 marketing claims made by these complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) clinic websites, 138 (59.5%) were either false or unproven. DISCUSSION: A significant number of CAM clinics advertise diagnostic techniques or treatments for celiac disease or NCGS. Many claims are either false or unproven, thus warranting a need for increased regulation of CAM advertising to protect the public. ",
        "Head impacts sustained by male collegiate water polo athletes. Water polo is a contact sport that is gaining popularity in the United States and carries a risk of repeated head impacts and concussion. The frequency and magnitude of sport-related head impacts have not been described for water polo. We aimed to compare patterns of empirically measured head impact exposure of male collegiate water polo players to patterns previously reported by a survey of current and former water polo athletes. Participants wore water polo caps instrumented with head impact sensors during three seasons of collegiate water polo. Peak linear acceleration (PLA) and peak rotational acceleration (PRA) were recorded for head impacts. Athlete positions were recorded by research staff at the occurrence of each head impact. Head impacts were sustained by athletes in offensive positions more frequently than in defensive and transition positions (246, 59.9% vs. 93, 22.6% vs. 72, 17.5%). 37% of all head impacts during gameplay were sustained by athletes playing the offensive center position. Impact magnitude (means \u00b1 SD: PLA = 36.1\u00b112.3g, PRA = 5.0\u00b12.9 krads/sec2) did not differ between position or game scenario. Among goalies, impact frequency and magnitude were similar between games (means \u00b1 SD: 0.54\u00b1.51 hits/game, PLA = 36.9\u00b114.2g, PRA = 4.3\u00b14.2 krads/sec2) and practices (means \u00b1 SD: 0.96\u00b11.11 hits/practice, PLA = 43.7\u00b114.5g, PRA = 3.9\u00b12.5 krads/sec2). We report that collegiate water polo athletes are at risk for sport-related head impacts and impact frequency is dependent on game scenario and player position. In contrast, magnitude does not differ between scenarios or across positions. ",
        "Effect of early physician follow-up on mortality and subsequent hospital admissions after emergency care for heart failure: a retrospective cohort study. BACKGROUND: The 1-year mortality rate in patients with heart failure who are discharged from an emergency department is 20%. We sought to determine whether early follow-up after discharge from the emergency department was associated with decreased mortality or subsequent admission to hospital. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study conducted in Ontario, Canada, included adult patients who were discharged from 1 of 163 emergency departments between April 2007 and March 2014 with a primary diagnosis of heart failure. Using a propensity score-matched landmark analysis, we assessed follow-up in relation to mortality and admissions to hospital for cardiovascular conditions. RESULTS: Of 34 519 patients, 16 274 (47.1%) obtained follow-up care within 7 days and 28 846 (83.6%) within 30 days. Compared with follow-up between day 8 and 30, patients with follow-up care within 7 days had a lower rate of mortality over 1 year (hazard ratio [HR] 0.92; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.87-0.97), and a reduced rate of admission to hospital over 90 days (HR 0.87, 95% CI 0.80-0.94) and 1 year (HR 0.92; 95% CI 0.87-0.97); the mortality rate over 90 days in this group trended to a lower rate (HR 0.90, 95% CI 0.10-1.00). Follow-up care within 30 days, compared with patients without 30-day follow-up, was associated with a reduction in 1-year mortality (HR 0.89, 95% CI 0.82-0.97) but not admission to hospital (HR 1.02, 95% CI 0.94-1.10). In this group, there was a trend toward an increase in 90-day admission to hospital (HR 1.14, 95% CI 1.00-1.29). INTERPRETATION: Follow-up care within 7 days of discharge from the emergency department was associated with lower rates of long-term mortality, as well as subsequent hospital admissions, and a trend to lower short-term mortality rates. Timely access to longitudinal care for patients with heart failure who are discharged from the emergency setting should be prioritized. ",
        "Effects of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular health events on work and earnings: a population-based retrospective cohort study. BACKGROUND: Survivors of acute health events can experience lasting reductions in functional status and quality of life, as well as reduced ability to work and earn income. We aimed to assess the effect of acute myocardial infarction (MI), cardiac arrest and stroke on work and earning among working-age people. METHODS: For this retrospective cohort study, we used the Canadian Hospitalization and Taxation Database, which contains linked hospital and income tax data, from 2005 to 2013 to perform difference-in-difference analyses. We matched patients admitted to hospital for acute MI, cardiac arrest or stroke with controls who were not admitted to hospital for these indications. Participants were aged 40-61 years, worked in the 2 years before the event and were alive 3 years after the event. Patients were matched to controls for 11 variables. The primary outcome was working status 3 years postevent. We also assessed earnings change attributable to the event. We matched 19 129 particpants who were admitted to hospital with acute MI, 1043 with cardiac arrest and 4395 with stroke to 1 820 644, 307 375 and 888 481 controls, respectively. RESULTS: Fewer of the patients who were admitted to hospital were working 3 years postevent than controls for acute MI (by 5.0 percentage points [pp], 95% confidence interval [CI] 4.5-5.5), cardiac arrest (by 12.9 pp, 95% CI 10.4-15.3) and stroke (by 19.8 pp, 95% CI 18.5-23.5). Mean (95% CI) earnings declines attributable to the events were $3834 (95% CI 3346-4323) for acute MI, $11 143 (95% CI 8962-13 324) for cardiac arrest, and $13 278 (95% CI 12 301-14 255) for stroke. The effects on income were greater for patients who had lower baseline earnings, comorbid disease, longer hospital length of stay or needed mechanical ventilation. Sex, marital status or self-employment status did not affect income declines. INTERPRETATION: Acute MI, cardiac arrest and stroke all resulted in substantial loss in employment and earnings that persisted for at least 3 years after the events. These outcomes have consequences for patients, families, employers and governments. Identification of subgroups at high risk for these losses may assist in targeting interventions, policies and legislation to promote return to work. ",
        "Risks of noncardiac surgery early after percutaneous coronary intervention. BACKGROUND: Prior registry data suggest that 4%-20% of patients require noncardiac surgery (NCS) within 2\u202fyears of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Contemporary data on NCS after PCI in the United States among women and men are limited. We determined the rate of early hospital readmission for NCS and associated outcomes in a large cohort of patients who underwent PCI in the United States. METHODS: Adults undergoing PCI between January 1 and June 30, 2014, were identified from the Nationwide Readmission Database. Patients readmitted for NCS within 6\u202fmonths of PCI were identified. Outcomes of interest were in-hospital death, myocardial infarction (MI), and bleeding defined by International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, codes. RESULTS: Among 221,379 patients who underwent PCI and survived to hospital discharge, 3.5% (n\u202f=\u202f7,696) were readmitted for NCS within 6\u202fmonths post-PCI, and 41% of these hospitalizations were elective. Early NCS was complicated by MI in 4.7% of cases, and 21% of perioperative MIs were fatal. Bleeding was recorded in 32.0% of patients. All-cause mortality occurred in 4.4% of patients (n\u202f=\u202f339) readmitted for surgery. The risk of death or MI was greatest when NCS was performed within the first month after PCI. CONCLUSIONS: Despite clear guidelines to avoid surgery early after PCI, NCS was performed in 1 of every 29 patients with recent PCI, corresponding to as many as ~30,000 patients each year nationwide. Surgical mortality and perioperative MI were high in this setting. Strategies to minimize perioperative thrombotic and bleeding risks during readmission for NCS after PCI are necessary. ",
        "Association of occupational exposures with cardiovascular disease among US Hispanics/Latinos. OBJECTIVE: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a leading cause of mortality and morbidity in the USA. The role of occupational exposures to chemicals in the development of CVD has rarely been studied even though many agents possess cardiotoxic properties. We therefore evaluated associations of self-reported exposures to organic solvents, metals and pesticides in relation to CVD prevalence among diverse Hispanic/Latino workers. METHODS: Cross-sectional data from 7404 employed individuals, aged 18-74 years, enrolled in the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos (HCHS/SOL) were analysed. Participants from four US cities provided questionnaire data and underwent clinical examinations, including ECGs. CVD was defined as the presence of at least one of the following: coronary heart disease, atrial fibrillation, heart failure or cerebrovascular disease. Prevalence ratios reflecting the relationship between each occupational exposure and CVD as well as CVD subtypes were calculated using Poisson regression models. RESULTS: Hispanic/Latino workers reported exposures to organic solvents (6.5%), metals (8.5%) and pesticides (4.7%) at their current jobs. Overall, 6.1% of participants had some form of CVD, with coronary heart disease as the most common (4.3%) followed by cerebrovascular disease (1.0%), heart failure (0.8%) and atrial fibrillation (0.7%). For individuals who reported working with pesticides, the prevalence ratios for any CVD were 2.18 (95% CI 1.34 to 3.55), coronary heart disease 2.20 (95% CI 1.31 to 3.71), cerebrovascular disease 1.38 (95% CI 0.62 3.03), heart failure 0.91 (95% CI 0.23 to 3.54) and atrial fibrillation 5.92 (95% CI 1.89 to 18.61) after adjustment for sociodemographic, acculturation, lifestyle and occupational characteristics. Metal exposures were associated with an almost fourfold (3.78, 95% CI 1.24 to 11.46) greater prevalence of atrial fibrillation. Null associations were observed for organic solvent exposures. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that working with metals and pesticides could be risk factors for CVD among Hispanic/Latino workers. Further work is needed to evaluate these relationships prospectively. ",
        "Effects of Nutritional Supplements and Dietary Interventions on Cardiovascular Outcomes: An Umbrella Review and Evidence Map. Background: The role of nutritional supplements and dietary interventions in preventing mortality and cardiovascular disease (CVD) outcomes is unclear. Purpose: To examine evidence about the effects of nutritional supplements and dietary interventions on mortality and cardiovascular outcomes in adults. Data Sources: PubMed, CINAHL, and the Cochrane Library from inception until March 2019; ClinicalTrials.gov (10 March 2019); journal Web sites; and reference lists. Study Selection: English-language, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and meta-analyses of RCTs that assessed the effects of nutritional supplements or dietary interventions on all-cause mortality or cardiovascular outcomes, such as death, myocardial infarction, stroke, and coronary heart disease. Data Extraction: Two independent investigators abstracted data, assessed the quality of evidence, and rated the certainty of evidence. Data Synthesis: Nine systematic reviews and 4 new RCTs were selected that encompassed a total of 277 trials, 24 interventions, and 992\u00a0129 participants. A total of 105 meta-analyses were generated. There was moderate-certainty evidence that reduced salt intake decreased the risk for all-cause mortality in normotensive participants (risk ratio [RR], 0.90 [95% CI, 0.85 to 0.95]) and cardiovascular mortality in hypertensive participants (RR, 0.67 [CI, 0.46 to 0.99]). Low-certainty evidence showed that omega-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid (LC-PUFA) was associated with reduced risk for myocardial infarction (RR, 0.92 [CI, 0.85 to 0.99]) and coronary heart disease (RR, 0.93 [CI, 0.89 to 0.98]). Folic acid was associated with lower risk for stroke (RR, 0.80 [CI, 0.67 to 0.96]; low certainty), whereas calcium plus vitamin D increased the risk for stroke (RR, 1.17 [CI, 1.05 to 1.30]; moderate certainty). Other nutritional supplements, such as vitamin B6, vitamin A, multivitamins, antioxidants, and iron and dietary interventions, such as reduced fat intake, had no significant effect on mortality or cardiovascular disease outcomes (very low- to moderate-certainty evidence). Limitations: Suboptimal quality and certainty of evidence. Conclusion: Reduced salt intake, omega-3 LC-PUFA use, and folate supplementation could reduce risk for some cardiovascular outcomes in adults. Combined calcium plus vitamin D might increase risk for stroke. Primary Funding Source: None. ",
        "Does adding hip exercises to quadriceps exercises result in superior outcomes in pain, function and quality of life for people with knee osteoarthritis? A systematic review and meta-analysis. OBJECTIVES: To determine, in people with knee osteoarthritis (KOA): i) the effectiveness of adding hip strengthening exercises to quadriceps exercises and ii) the type of hip strengthening exercise with the greatest evidence for improving pain, function and quality of life. DESIGN: Systematic review with meta-analysis. DATA SOURCES: Medline, Embase, Cochrane, CINAHL and SportDiscus databases were searched from inception to January 2018. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR SELECTING STUDIES: Randomised controlled trials investigating the effect of adding hip exercises to quadriceps exercises in people with KOA on pain, function and/or quality of life were included. Three subgroups of hip exercises were included: resistance, functional neuromuscular or multimodal exercise. RESULTS: Eight studies were included. Pooled data provide evidence that combined hip and quadriceps exercise is significantly more effective than quadriceps exercise alone for improving walking function (standardised mean difference -1.06, 95% CI -2.01 to -0.12), but not for outcomes of pain (-0.09, 95% CI -0.96 to 0.79), patient-reported function (-0.74, 95% CI -1.56 to 0.08) or stair function (-0.7, 95% CI -1.67 to 0.26). Subgroup analyses reveal that hip resistance exercises are more effective than functional neuromuscular exercises for improving pain (p<0.0001) and patient-reported function (p<0.0001). Multimodal exercise is no more effective than quadriceps strengthening alone for pain (0.13, 95% CI -0.31 to 0.56), patient-reported function (-0.15, 95% CI -0.58 to 0.29) or stair function (0.13, 95% CI -0.3 to 0.57). CONCLUSION: Walking improved after the addition of hip strengthening to quadriceps strengthening in people with KOA. The addition of resistance hip exercises to quadriceps resulted in greater improvements in patient-reported pain and function. ",
        "Increasing the perceived relevance of cervical screening in older women who do not plan to attend screening. OBJECTIVES: Uptake of cervical screening among women aged 50-64 years is declining. Not feeling at risk because of current sexual behaviour is a reason some older women give for not being screened. We hypothesised that explaining the long interval between acquiring human papillomavirus (HPV) and developing cervical cancer would increase the relevance of screening in older women. METHODS: Women aged 50-64 years (n=597) who did not intend to go for screening were recruited through an online panel and randomised to one of three information conditions: cause only (basic information about HPV and cervical cancer), cause with basic timeline (also read a sentence describing the long interval between acquiring HPV and developing cervical cancer) and cause with explicit timeline (read the same as the timeline group alongside an explanation of what this means for older women). Perceived risk of cervical cancer, screening intention strength and understanding of HPV were assessed preinformation and postinformation exposure. RESULTS: Information condition was significantly associated with risk perceptions and intention strength postintervention (F(2,593)=6.26, p=0.002\u2009and F(2,593)=4.98, p=0.007 respectively). Women in the cause with explicit timeline condition were more likely to increase their risk perceptions and intention strength compared with cause only (24%\u2009vs 9% and 25%\u2009vs 13% for risk perceptions and intention, respectively). In the cause with explicit timeline group, women with 4-10 lifetime partners had higher odds of increasing their perceived risk and intention strength postintervention compared with those with 0-1 partners (OR=2.27, 95% CI 1.01 to 5.12 and OR=3.20, 95% CI 1.34 to 7.67, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Providing a clear explanation that decouples women's perceived cervical cancer risk from their current sexual behaviour has the potential to increase perceived risk of cervical cancer and intentions to be screened among older women. Providing women with a clear cognitive representation of the aetiology of cervical cancer may be one approach to increasing screening uptake. ",
        "Use of Antibiotics Without a Prescription in the U.S. Population: A Scoping Review. Background: Use of antibiotics without a prescription may increase unnecessary and inappropriate drug use or doses as well as global risk for antimicrobial resistance. Purpose: To perform a scoping review of research on the prevalence of nonprescription antibiotic use in the United States and to examine the factors that influence it. Data Sources: Searches of PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, Scopus, and relevant Web sites without language restrictions from January 2000 to March 2019. Study Selection: Studies reporting nonprescription use of antibiotics, storage of antibiotics, intention to use antibiotics without a prescription, and factors influencing nonprescription use. Data Extraction: Two reviewers independently screened citations and full texts and performed data abstraction. Data Synthesis: Of 17\u00a0422 screened articles, 31 met inclusion criteria. Depending on population characteristics, prevalence of nonprescription antibiotic use varied from 1% to 66%, storage of antibiotics for future use varied from 14% to 48%, and prevalence of intention to use antibiotics without a prescription was 25%. Antibiotics were obtained without a prescription from various sources, including previously prescribed courses, local markets or stores, and family or friends. Reported factors contributing to nonprescription use included easy access through markets or stores that obtain antibiotics internationally for under-the-counter sales, difficulty accessing the health care system, costs of physician visits, long waiting periods in clinics, and transportation problems. Limitation: Scarce evidence and heterogeneous methods and outcomes. Conclusion: Nonprescription antibiotic use is a seemingly prevalent and understudied public health problem in the United States. An increased understanding of risk factors and pathways that are amenable to intervention is essential to decrease this unsafe practice. Primary Funding Source: None. ",
        "How does exercise treatment compare with antihypertensive medications? A network meta-analysis of 391 randomised controlled trials assessing exercise and medication effects on systolic blood pressure. OBJECTIVE: To compare the effect of exercise regimens and medications on systolic blood pressure (SBP). DATA SOURCES: Medline (via PubMed) and the Cochrane Library. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I), angiotensin-2 receptor blockers (ARBs), \u03b2-blockers, calcium channel blockers (CCBs) and diuretics were identified from existing Cochrane reviews. A previously published meta-analysis of exercise interventions was updated to identify recent RCTs that tested the SBP-lowering effects of endurance, dynamic resistance, isometric resistance, and combined endurance and resistance exercise interventions (up to September 2018). DESIGN: Random-effects network meta-analysis. OUTCOME: Difference in mean change from baseline SBP between comparator treatments (change from baseline in one group minus that in the other group) and its 95% credible interval (95% CrI), measured in mmHg. RESULTS: We included a total of 391 RCTs, 197 of which evaluated exercise interventions (10\u2009461 participants) and 194 evaluated antihypertensive medications (29\u2009281 participants). No RCTs compared directly exercise against medications. While all medication trials included hypertensive populations, only 56 exercise trials included hypertensive participants (\u2265140\u2009mmHg), corresponding to 3508 individuals. In a 10% random sample, risk of bias was higher in exercise RCTs, primarily due to lack of blinding and incomplete outcome data. In analyses that combined all populations, antihypertensive medications achieved higher reductions in baseline SBP compared with exercise interventions (mean difference -3.96\u2009mmHg, 95% CrI -5.02 to -2.91). Compared with control, all types of exercise (including combination of endurance and resistance) and all classes of antihypertensive medications were effective in lowering baseline SBP. Among hypertensive populations, there were no detectable differences in the SBP-lowering effects of ACE-I, ARB, \u03b2-blocker and diuretic medications when compared with endurance or dynamic resistance exercise. There was no detectable inconsistency between direct and indirect comparisons. Although there was evidence of small-study effects, this affected both medication and exercise trials. CONCLUSIONS: The effect of exercise interventions on SBP remains under-studied, especially among hypertensive populations. Our findings confirm modest but consistent reductions in SBP in many studied exercise interventions across all populations but individuals receiving medications generally achieved greater reductions than those following structured exercise regimens. Assuming equally reliable estimates, the SBP-lowering effect of exercise among hypertensive populations appears similar to that of commonly used antihypertensive medications. Generalisability of these findings to real-world clinical settings should be further evaluated. ",
        "Association Between Early Hypertension Control and Cardiovascular Disease Incidence in Veterans With Diabetes. OBJECTIVE: Guidelines for hypertension treatment in patients with diabetes diverge regarding the systolic blood pressure (SBP) threshold at which treatment should be initiated and treatment goal. We examined associations of early SBP treatment with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) events in U.S. adults with diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We studied 43,986 patients with diabetes who newly initiated antihypertensive therapy between 2002 and 2007. Patients were classified into categories based on SBP at treatment initiation (130-139 or \u2265140 mmHg) and after 2 years of treatment (100-119, 120-129, 130-139, 140-159, and \u2265160 mmHg). The primary outcome was composite ASCVD events (fatal and nonfatal myocardial infarction and stroke), estimated using inverse probability of treatment-weighted Poisson regression and multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression. RESULTS: Relative to individuals who initiated treatment when SBP was 130-139 mmHg, those with pretreatment SBP \u2265140 mmHg had higher ASCVD risk (hazard ratio 1.10 [95% CI 1.02, 1.19]). Relative to those with pretreatment SBP of 130-139 mmHg and on-treatment SBP of 120-129 mmHg (reference group), ASCVD incidence was higher in those with pretreatment SBP \u2265140 mmHg and on-treatment SBP 120-129 mmHg (adjusted incidence rate difference [IRD] 1.0 [-0.2 to 2.1] events/1,000 person-years) and in those who achieved on-treatment SBP 130-139 mmHg (IRD 1.9 [0.6, 3.2] and 1.1 [0.04, 2.2] events/1,000 person-years for those with pretreatment SBP 130-139 mmHg and \u2265140 mmHg, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: In this observational study, patients with diabetes initiating antihypertensive therapy when SBP was 130-139 mmHg and those achieving on-treatment SBP <130 mmHg had better outcomes than those with higher SBP levels when initiating or after 2 years on treatment.

        "Global patterns of mortality in international migrants: a systematic review and meta-analysis. BACKGROUND: 258 million people reside outside their country of birth; however, to date no global systematic reviews or meta-analyses of mortality data for these international migrants have been done. We aimed to review and synthesise available mortality data on international migrants. METHODS: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched MEDLINE, Embase, the Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar databases for observational studies, systematic reviews, and randomised controlled trials published between Jan 1, 2001, and March 31, 2017, without language restrictions. We included studies reporting mortality outcomes for international migrants of any age residing outside their country of birth. Studies that recruited participants exclusively from intensive care or high dependency hospital units, with an existing health condition or status, or a particular health exposure were excluded. We also excluded studies limited to maternal or perinatal outcomes. We screened studies using systematic review software and extracted data from published reports. The main outcomes were all-cause and International Classification of Diseases, tenth revision (ICD-10) cause-specific standardised mortality ratios (SMRs) and absolute mortality rates. We calculated summary estimates using random-effects models. This study is registered with PROSPERO, number CRD42017073608. FINDINGS: Of the 12\u2008480 articles identified by our search, 96 studies were eligible for inclusion. The studies were geographically diverse and included data from all global regions and for 92 countries. 5464 mortality estimates for more than 15\u00b72 million migrants were included, of which 5327 (97%) were from high-income countries, 115 (2%) were from middle-income countries, and 22 (<1%) were from low-income countries. Few studies included mortality estimates for refugees (110 estimates), asylum seekers (144 estimates), or labour migrants (six estimates). The summary estimate of all-cause SMR for international migrants was lower than one when compared with the general population in destination countries (0\u00b770 [95% CI 0\u00b765-0\u00b776]; I2=99\u00b78%). All-cause SMR was lower in both male migrants (0\u00b772 [0\u00b763-0\u00b781]; I2=99\u00b78%) and female migrants (0\u00b775 [0\u00b767-0\u00b784]; I2=99\u00b78%) compared with the general population. A mortality advantage was evident for refugees (SMR 0\u00b750 [0\u00b746-0\u00b754]; I2=89\u00b78%), but not for asylum seekers (1\u00b705 [0\u00b789-1\u00b724]; I2=54\u00b74%), although limited data was available on these groups. SMRs for all causes of death were lower in migrants compared with the general populations in the destination country across all 13 ICD-10 categories analysed, with the exception of infectious diseases and external causes. Heterogeneity was high across the majority of analyses. Point estimates of all-cause age-standardised mortality in migrants ranged from 420 to 874 per 100\u2008000 population. INTERPRETATION: Our study showed that international migrants have a mortality advantage compared with general populations, and that this advantage persisted across the majority of ICD-10 disease categories. The mortality advantage identified will be representative of international migrants in high-income countries who are studying, working, or have joined family members in these countries. However, our results might not reflect the health outcomes of more marginalised groups in low-income and middle-income countries because little data were available for these groups, highlighting an important gap in existing research. Our results present an opportunity to reframe the public discourse on international migration and health in high-income countries.

        "Declared impact of the US President's statements and campaign statements on Latino populations' perceptions of safety and emergency care access. Statements about building walls, deportation and denying services to undocumented immigrants made during President Trump's presidential campaign and presidency may induce fear in Latino populations and create barriers to their health care access. To assess how these statements relate to undocumented Latino immigrants' (UDLI) and Latino legal residents/citizens' (LLRC) perceptions of safety and their presentations for emergency care, we conducted surveys of adult patients at three county emergency departments (EDs) in California from June 2017 to December 2018. Of 1,684 patients approached, 1,337 (79.4%) agreed to participate: 34.3% UDLI, 36.9% LLRC, and 29.8% non-Latino legal residents/citizens (NLRC). The vast majority of UDLI (95%), LLRC (94%) and NLRC (85%) had heard statements about immigrants. Most UDLI (89%), LLRC (88%) and NLRC (87%) either thought that these measures were being enacted now or will be enacted in the future. Most UDLI and half of LLRC reported that these statements made them feel unsafe living in the US, 75% (95% CI 70-80%) and 51% (95% CI 47-56%), respectively. More UDLI reported that these statements made them afraid to come to the ED (24%, 95% CI 20-28%) vs LLRC (4.4%, 95% CI 3-7%) and NLRC (3.5%, 95% CI 2-6%); 55% of UDLI with this fear stated it caused them to delay coming to the ED (median delay 2-3 days). The vast majority of patients in our California EDs have heard statements during the 2016 presidential campaign or from President Trump about measures against undocumented immigrants, which have induced worry and safety concerns in both UDLI and LLRC patients. Exposure to these statements was also associated with fear of accessing emergency care in some UDLIs. Given California's sanctuary state status, these safety concerns and ED access fears may be greater in a nationwide population of Latinos. ",
        "Can infant sleeping bags be recommended by medical professionals as protection against sudden infant death syndrome?. Clinical scenario: A mother brought her infant to the hospital with bronchiolitis and incidentally asked if I would recommend the use of infant sleeping bags to protect against Sudden Infant Death Syndrome as several of her friends use them. Structured question: Can infant sleeping bags be recommended by medical professionals as protective against Sudden Infant Death Syndrome? Methods: A literature search was performed. Trials were included if they had an English version available and the papers examined the impact that sleeping bag use had on risk of SIDS or its risk factors. Cochrane Library search found eight trials, two of which were found to meet inclusion criteria. MEDLINE was searched using the search terms ((baby sleeping bag) OR infant sleeping bag) OR cotton sleeping sack. Forty-seven papers were found, two of which were found to meet the inclusion criteria, one of which had already been found in the Cochrane Library search. One further paper was found through searching citations of the papers included. Discussion: Sleeping bags are used in 48-95% of infants in the UK and advocated for by the Lullaby Trust for their safety in the prevention of SIDS. The case control studies included found that sleeping bags are as safe, if not safer than other bedding when examining SIDS as an outcome. For sleeping bags to be safe they must be well made and appropriately used, which includes the correct size, Tog, clothing and other bedding for bedroom temperature. ",
        "Consistent use of bedtime parenting strategies mediates the effects of sleep education on child sleep: secondary findings from an early-life randomized controlled trial. OBJECTIVE: Using data from a randomized controlled trial, this study investigated whether parent's consistent use of recommended bedtime strategies with infants was a mediating mechanism for improved child sleep. METHODS: Expectant mothers were allocated to 4 groups: usual care (Control); additional support regarding Food, (physical) Activity, and Breastfeeding (FAB); advice on infant sleep through 1 group educational session during the antenatal period and 1 home visit when the child was 3\u202fweeks of age (Sleep), or both FAB and Sleep interventions (Combination). An index relating to parent's consistent use of strategies to encourage infant sleep self-settling was developed from data collected when infants were 4 and 6\u202fmonths of age. Child sleep self-control was measured at 3.5\u202fyears of age through a behavior rating scale. Child overnight sleep duration was measured using accelerometers at 1, 2, 3.5, and 5\u202fyears of age. Analyses examined whether any association between intervention group and child sleep self-control or sleep duration was mediated by consistent use of bedtime strategies at 4 and 6\u202fmonths. RESULTS: Compared to Controls, Sleep group parents had significantly higher odds of using more intervention strategies consistently (1.63; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.14-2.33), as did Combination group parents (1.45; 95% CI 1.01-2.07). Consistent strategy use was significantly associated with a decrease in child bedtime behavioral difficulties (0.97; 95% CI 0.95-0.98) and increased sleep duration (0.152; SE\u202f=\u202f0.017). Sleep group assignment reduced child sleep self-control difficulties and improved sleep duration indirectly via parent's consistent use of bedtime strategies. DISCUSSION: Consistent use of appropriate bedtime strategies in infancy is an important factor that influences child sleep self-control in later development. ",
        "The Possums Infant Sleep Program: parents' perspectives on a novel parent-infant sleep intervention in Australia. AIM: To evaluate parental perspectives on the acceptability and usefulness of a 'cued-care' approach to infant sleep implemented in an Australian primary care setting. The Possums Infant Sleep Program aims to empower parents to better understand their infant's sleep and their responses to it, and optimize healthy function of the infant's biological sleep regulators to protect against excessive night-waking. METHODS: The evaluation was undertaken by an independent infant sleep researcher, with no previous involvement in the Possums program. Parents' experiences of the sleep intervention were captured using a mixed methods approach involving (a) group discussions of sleep issues between parents and clinic staff, (b) discussions with parents who volunteered to provide face-to-face feedback, and (c) an online survey designed in light of the information gained from a and b. A one-year audit of clinic registrations provided contextual data. RESULTS: Sixty-four clinic clients fully (45) or partially (19) provided answers to survey questions. Respondents were primarily mothers, mean age 34, with a postgraduate qualification and high family income. Their term infants were predominantly breastfed and attended the clinic for feeding and/or sleeping difficulties across the first year of life. Almost all embraced the Possums approach, describing it as challenging and life changing. Audit data confirmed the survey sample reflected the general clinic population. CONCLUSIONS: The Possums Infant Sleep Program was acceptable to parents, and highly valued. Recipients reported reduced stress, less concern about perceived sleep problems (frequent night-waking, short-day-time naps, delayed sleep onset), and better quality of life. ",
        "Alcoholic beverages as trigger factor and the effect on alcohol consumption behavior in patients with migraine. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Alcoholic beverages are frequently reported migraine triggers. We aimed to assess self-reported alcohol consumption as a migraine attack trigger and to investigate the effect on alcohol consumption behavior in a large migraine cohort. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional, web-based, questionnaire study among 2197 patients with migraine from the well-defined Leiden University MIgraine Neuro-Analysis (LUMINA) study population. We assessed alcoholic beverage consumption and self-reported trigger potential, reasons behind alcohol abstinence and time between alcohol consumption and migraine attack onset. RESULTS: Alcoholic beverages were reported as a trigger by 35.6% of participants with migraine. In addition, over 25% of patients with migraine who had stopped consuming or never consumed alcoholic beverages did so because of presumed trigger effects. Wine, especially red wine (77.8% of participants), was recognized as the most common trigger among the alcoholic beverages. However, red wine consistently led to an attack in only 8.8% of participants. Time of onset was rapid (<3\u00a0h) in one-third of patients and almost 90% had an onset <10\u00a0h independent of beverage type. CONCLUSIONS: Alcoholic beverages, especially red wine, are recognized as a migraine trigger factor by patients with migraine and have a substantial effect on alcohol consumption behavior. Rapid onset of provoked migraine attacks in contrast to what is known about hangover headache might point to a different mechanism. The low consistency of provocation suggests that alcoholic beverages acting as a singular trigger is insufficient and may depend on a fluctuating trigger threshold. ",
        "Prevalence and Knowledge of Potential Interactions Between Over-the-Counter Products and Apixaban. BACKGROUND: Direct-acting oral anticoagulants (DOACs), such as apixaban, are the most commonly prescribed anticoagulants, with advantages in that they do not require routine monitoring. However, less frequent contact with healthcare professionals may contribute to poor patient knowledge about potential interactions between over-the-counter (OTC) products and DOACs. OBJECTIVE: Determine the prevalence of use of OTC products (OTC medications and dietary supplements) with potentially serious apixaban interactions and assess patient knowledge of potential interactions. DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey. SETTING: Academic-affiliated outpatient medical practices in northern and southern California. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 791 English- or Spanish-speaking patients prescribed apixaban. MEASUREMENTS: Use and knowledge of OTC medications and dietary supplements with potentially serious apixaban interactions. RESULTS: Almost all respondents (n = 771; 97.5%) reported OTC product use. Of respondents, 33% (n = 266) took at least one OTC product with potentially serious apixaban interactions daily/most days and 53 (6.7%) took multiple products (mean = 2.6 [SD = 2.6]). Aspirin was taken daily by 116 (14.7%; of which 75 [64.7%] also consumed other potentially interacting OTC products), and some days/as needed by an additional 82 (10.4%). Ibuprofen and naproxen were taken daily/most days by 14 (1.8%) and occasionally by 225 (28.5%). Dietary supplements with potentially serious interactions were taken daily/most days by 160 (20.2%). Approximately 66% of respondents were either uncertain or incorrect about the potential for increased bleeding from combining nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and apixaban. Less knowledge about OTC products with potentially serious interactions was associated with greater OTC product use (odds ratio = 0.54; 95% confidence interval = 0.35-0.85). CONCLUSION: Significant numbers of patients take OTC products (particularly dietary supplements) with potentially serious interactions with the DOAC apixaban and appear to lack knowledge about potentially harmful interactions. Interventions are needed to educate patients and healthcare providers about potential dangers of taking interacting OTC products in combination with apixaban, and data are needed on outcomes associated with concomitant apixaban-OTC product use.

        "Longitudinal, strain-specific Staphylococcus aureus introduction and transmission events in households of children with community-associated meticillin-resistant S aureus skin and soft tissue infection: a prospective cohort study. BACKGROUND: Devising effective, targeted approaches to prevent recurrent meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) skin and soft tissue infection requires an understanding of factors driving MRSA acquisition. We comprehensively defined household longitudinal, strain-level S aureus transmission dynamics in households of children with community-associated MRSA skin and soft tissue infection. METHODS: From 2012-15, otherwise healthy paediatric patients with culture-confirmed, community-onset MRSA infections were recruited for the Household Observation of MRSA in the Environment (HOME) prospective cohort study from hospitals and community practices in metropolitan St Louis (MO, USA). Children with health-care-related risk factors were excluded, as determined by evidence of recent hospital admission, an invasive medical device, or residence in a long-term care facility. Household contacts (individuals sleeping in the home \u2265four nights per week) and indoor dogs and cats were also enrolled. A baseline visit took place at the index patient's primary home, followed by four quarterly visits over 12 months. At each visit, interviews were done and serial cultures were collected, to detect S aureus from three anatomic sites of household members, two anatomic sites on dogs and cats, and 21 environmental surfaces. Molecular typing was done by repetitive-sequence PCR to define distinct S aureus strains within each household. Longitudinal, multivariable generalised mixed-effects logistic regression models identified factors associated with S aureus acquisition. FINDINGS: Across household members, pets, and environmental surfaces, 1267 strain acquisition events were observed. Acquisitions were driven equally by 510 introductions of novel strains into households and 602 transmissions within households, each associated with distinct factors. Frequent handwashing decreased the likelihood of novel strain introduction into the household (odds ratio [OR] 0\u00b786, credible interval [CrI] 0\u00b774-1\u00b701). Transmission recipients were less likely to own their homes (OR 0\u00b777, CrI 0\u00b763-0\u00b794) and were more likely to share bedrooms with strain-colonised individuals (OR 1\u00b733, CrI 1\u00b712-1\u00b758), live in homes with higher environmental S aureus contamination burden (OR 3\u00b797, CrI 1\u00b796-8\u00b720), and report interval skin and soft tissue infection (OR 1\u00b732, CrI 1\u00b707-1\u00b764). Transmission sources were more likely to share bath towels (OR 1\u00b725, CrI 1\u00b701-1\u00b757). Pets were often transmission recipients, but rarely the sole transmission source. INTERPRETATION: The household environment plays a key role in transmission, a factor associated with skin and soft tissue infection. Future interventions should inclusively target household members and the environment, focusing on straightforward changes in hand hygiene and household sharing behaviours.

        "Insomnia and daytime sleepiness: risk factors for sports-related concussion. OBJECTIVE/BACKGROUND: Poor quality and inadequate sleep are associated with impaired cognitive, motor, and behavioral components of sport performance and increased injury risk. While prior work identifies sports-related concussions as predisposing factors for poor sleep, the role of sleep as a sports-related concussion risk factor is unknown. The purpose of this study was to quantify the effect of poor sleep quality and insomnia symptoms on future sports-related concussion risk. PATIENTS/METHODS: In this study, 190 NCAA Division-1 athletes completed a survey battery, including the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) and National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) Sleep module. Univariate risk ratios for future sports-related concussions were computed with ISI and NHANES sleepiness scores as independent predictors. An additional multiple logistic regression model including sport, sports-related concussion history, and significant univariate predictors jointly assessed the odds of sustaining a concussion. RESULTS: Clinically moderate-to-severe insomnia severity (RR\u00a0=\u00a03.13, 95% CI: 1.320-7.424, p\u00a0=\u00a00.015) and excessive daytime sleepiness two or more times per month (RR\u00a0=\u00a02.856, 95% CI: 0.681-11.977, p\u00a0=\u00a00.037) increased concussion risk. These variables remained significant and comparable in magnitude in a multivariate model adjusted for sport participation. CONCLUSION: Insomnia and daytime sleepiness are independently associated with increased sports-related concussion risk. More completely identifying bidirectional relationships between concussions and sleep requires further research. Clinicians and athletes should be cognizant of this relationship and take proactive measures - including assessing and treating sleep-disordered breathing, limiting insomnia risk factors, improving sleep hygiene, and developing daytime sleepiness management strategies - to reduce sports-related concussion risk and support overall athletic performance.

        "Treating insomnia improves depression, maladaptive thinking, and hyperarousal in postmenopausal women: comparing cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBTI), sleep restriction therapy, and sleep hygiene education. INTRODUCTION: Depression increases during menopause, and subclinical depressive symptoms increase risk for major depression. Insomnia is common among postmenopausal women and increases depression-risk in this already-vulnerable population. Recent evidence supports the efficacy of cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBTI) to treat menopausal insomnia, but it remains unclear whether treating insomnia also alleviates co-occurring depressive symptoms and depressogenic features. This trial tested whether CBTI improves depressive symptoms, maladaptive thinking, and somatic hyperarousal in postmenopausal women with insomnia; as well as whether sleep restriction therapy (SRT)-a single component of CBTI-is equally efficacious. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Single-site, randomized controlled trial. 117 postmenopausal women (56.34\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.41 years) with peri-or-postmenopausal onset of chronic insomnia were randomized to three treatment conditions: sleep hygiene education control (SHE), SRT, and CBTI. Blinded assessments were performed at baseline, posttreatment, and six-month follow-up. RESULTS: CBTI produced moderate-to-large reductions in depressive symptoms, whereas SRT produced moderate reductions but not until six months posttreatment. Treatment effects on maladaptive thinking were mixed. CBTI and SRT both produced large improvements in dysfunctional beliefs about sleep, but weaker influences on presleep cognitive arousal, rumination, and worry. Presleep somatic arousal greatly improved in the CBTI group and moderately improved in the SRT group. Improvements in depression, maladaptive thinking, and hyperarousal were linked to improved sleep. SHE produced no durable treatment effects. CONCLUSIONS: CBTI and SRT reduce depressive symptoms, dysfunctional beliefs about sleep, and presleep somatic hyperarousal in postmenopausal women, with CBTI producing superior results. Despite its cognitive emphasis, cognitive arousal did not respond strongly or durably to CBTI. NAME: Behavioral Treatment of Menopausal Insomnia: Sleep and Daytime Outcomes. URL: clinicaltrials.gov.

        "Insomnia symptoms and risk of cardiovascular diseases among 0.5 million adults: A 10-year cohort. OBJECTIVE: To examine the associations of individual insomnia symptoms with risks of incident cardio-cerebral vascular diseases (CVD) and possible moderating factors among Chinese adults. METHODS: The China Kadoorie Biobank is a prospective cohort study that recruited participants from 10 areas across China. Data from 487,200 adults 30 to 79 years of age who were free of stroke, coronary heart disease, and cancer at baseline were analyzed. Three insomnia symptoms were assessed with self-reported difficulties in initiating or maintaining sleep, early morning awakening, and daytime dysfunction for at least 3 d/wk at baseline. Incidences of CVD were followed up through disease registries and national health insurance databases until 2016. RESULTS: During a median of 9.6 years of follow-up, 130,032 cases of CVD were documented. Cox regressions showed that 3 insomnia symptoms were associated with increased risk of total CVD, with respective adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of 1.09 (95% CI 1.07-1.11), 1.07 (95% CI 1.05-1.09), and 1.13 (95% CI 1.09-1.18). Participants with individual symptoms also had higher risks of ischemic heart disease (IHD; HR 1.13, 1.09, and 1.17) and ischemic stroke but not hemorrhagic stroke. Participants with all 3 symptoms were at an 18%, 22%, or 10% higher risk of CVD, IHD, or ischemic stroke compared to nonsymptomatic adults. Associations between 3 symptoms and CVD incidence were consistently stronger in younger adults or those without baseline hypertension (p for interaction <0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Individual and coexisting insomnia symptoms are independent risk factors for CVD incidence, especially among young adults or adults who have not developed hypertension. ",
        "When Can I Drive? Predictors of Returning to Driving After Total Joint Arthroplasty. INTRODUCTION: A common question by patients considering total joint arthroplasty (TJA) is when can I return to driving. The ability to return to driving has enormous effect on the independence of the patient, ability to return to work, and other activities of daily living. With advances in accelerated rehabilitation protocols, newer studies have questioned the classic teaching of waiting 6 weeks after TJA. The goal of this prospective study was to determine specific patient predictors for return to driving and create individualized models able to estimate return to driving based on patient risk factors for both total knee arthroplasty (TKA) and total hip arthroplasty (THA). METHODS: From July 2017 to January 2018, 554 primary TKA and 490 primary THA patients were prospectively enrolled to obtain information regarding return to driving. Patients were sent a survey every 2 weeks regarding their return to driving. Additional information regarding vehicle type, transmission, and involvement in motor vehicle accidents was collected. Bivariate analysis was done followed by the creation of a multiple linear regression models to analyze return to driving after TKA and THA. RESULTS: The majority (98.2%, 1,025/1,044) of patients returned to driving within 12 weeks of surgery. On average, patients returned to driving at 4.4 and 3.7 weeks for TKA and THA (P < 0.001), respectively. The rate of motor vehicle accidents was 0.7% (7/1,044) within 12 weeks after surgery with no injuries reported. After multivariate analysis, baseline return to driving began at 10.9 days for TKA and 17.1 days for THA. The following predictors added additional time to return to driving for TJA: not feeling safe to drive, limited range of motion, female sex, limitations due to pain, other limitations, discharge to a rehabilitation facility, right-sided procedures, limited ability to break, preoperative anemia, and preoperative use of a cane. DISCUSSION: Important predictors identified for return to driving were sex, joint laterality, limited ability to walk or ability to break, and feeling safe. Surgeons should consider these factors when counseling patients on their postoperative expectations regarding driving after TJA. ",
        "JUUL: Spreading Online and Offline. PURPOSE: The increasing popularity of the JUUL electronic nicotine delivery system among youth poses several potential public health concerns. Social media can be used to better understand the spread of information related to JUUL. This study examined whether adolescents (age < 18) are following JUUL's official Twitter account and subsequently sharing (retweeting) JUUL's posts to their followers. We also assessed various patterns in which adolescents share information on JUUL with each other. METHODS: We collected 3,239 tweets from JUUL's official Twitter account (@JUULVapor) for one full year from February 2017 to January 2018. These tweets were shared by Twitter users to their followers 1,124times by 721 unique users. Users were determined to be either adolescent (age <18) or adult (\u226518) based on a systematic procedure involving double coding. We used social network analysis to explore the relationships between users retweeting JUUL. RESULTS: One-quarter (25%) of users were determined to be adolescents. Social network analysis revealed a maximum path length of 4 and a positive assortativity (r\u202f=\u202f.29). There were 25 (9%) instances of an adolescent retweeting content from another adolescent, 35 (12%) of an adolescent retweeting from an adult, and 30 (11%) of an adult retweeting from an adolescent. CONCLUSIONS: JUUL's official Twitter account is being followed-and its messages are being shared-by adolescents. Rigorous policies and prevention programs are needed to curb adolescent exposure to JUUL content and discussions online. ",
        "Advertising in Young Children's Apps: A Content Analysis. OBJECTIVE: Young children use mobile devices on average 1 hour/day, but no studies have examined the prevalence of advertising in children's apps. The objective of this study was to describe the advertising content of popular children's apps. METHODS: To create a coding scheme, we downloaded and played 39 apps played by children aged 12 months to 5 years in a pilot study of a mobile sensing app; 2 researchers played each app, took detailed notes on the design of advertisements, and iteratively refined the codebook (interrater reliability 0.96). Codes were then applied to the 96 most downloaded free and paid apps in the 5 And Under category on the Google Play app store. RESULTS: Of the 135 apps reviewed, 129 (95%) contained at least 1 type of advertising. These included use of commercial characters (42%); full-app teasers (46%); advertising videos interrupting play (e.g., pop-ups [35%] or to unlock play items [16%]); in-app purchases (30%); prompts to rate the app (28%) or share on social media (14%); distracting ads such as banners across the screen (17%) or hidden ads with misleading symbols such as \"$\" or camouflaged as gameplay items (7%). Advertising was significantly more prevalent in free apps (100% vs 88% of paid apps), but occurred at similar rates in apps labeled as \"educational\" versus other categories. CONCLUSION: In this exploratory study, we found high rates of mobile advertising through manipulative and disruptive methods. These results have implications for advertising regulation, parent media choices, and apps' educational value. ",
        "Organized Sport Participation From Childhood to Adolescence Is Associated With Bone Mass in Young Adults From the Raine Study. There is a critical need for longitudinal cohort studies to consider the association of the cumulative exposure of physical activity during childhood and adolescence and bone mass. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between organized sports trajectories (that capture distinct and potentially meaningful patterns over critical developmental periods) and bone mass at age 20 years. Participation in organized sport was recorded by parental report at ages 5, 8, 10, 14, and 17 years in 984 offspring (48% female) of a pregnancy cohort (Raine Study). Latent class analysis identified three trajectory classes in each sex. In females, these were \"consistent sport participators\" (48%), \"dropouts\" (34%), and \"non-participators\" (18%); in males, \"consistent sport participators\" (55%), \"dropouts\" (37%), and \"sport joiners\" (8%). Whole-body bone mineral content (BMC) at age 20 years was assessed by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). At age 20 years, after adjustment for covariates measured at age 20 years, including height, lean mass, physical activity, calcium intake, serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D, alcohol, and smoking, males who were \"consistent sport participators\" had significantly greater whole-body and leg BMC than those who dropped out of sport (p < 0.001), whereas males who joined sports had significantly greater leg BMC than those who dropped out of sport (p\u2009=\u20090.002). Females in the \"consistent sport participator\" trajectory had significantly greater leg BMC than those who dropped out (all p\u2009=\u20090.004). Participation in organized sport during childhood and adolescence is associated with bone mass at age 20 years. Because attainment of optimal peak bone mass in young adulthood is protective against osteoporosis in later life, this may have long-term skeletal benefits. \u00a9 2018 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.

        "Physically active lessons in schools and their impact on physical activity, educational, health and cognition outcomes: a systematic review and meta-analysis. OBJECTIVE: This review provides the first meta-analysis of the impact of physically active lessons on lesson-time and overall physical activity (PA), as well as health, cognition and educational outcomes. DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis of controlled studies. Six meta-analyses pooled effects on lesson-time PA, overall PA, in-class educational and overall educational outcomes, cognition and health outcomes. Meta-analyses were conducted using the metafor package in R. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane tool for risk of bias. DATA SOURCES: PubMed, Embase, PsycINFO, ERIC and Web of Science, grey literature and reference lists were searched in December 2017 and April 2019. STUDIES ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Physically active lessons compared with a control group in a randomised or non-randomised design, within single component interventions in general school populations. RESULTS: 42 studies (39 in preschool or elementary school settings, 27 randomised controlled trials) were eligible to be included in the systematic review and 37 of them were included across the six meta-analyses (n=12\u2009663). Physically active lessons were found to produce large, significant increases in lesson-time PA (d=2.33; 95%\u2009CI 1.42 to 3.25: k=16) and small, increases on overall PA (d=0.32; 95%\u2009CI 0.18 to 0.46: k=8), large, improvement in lesson-time educational outcomes (d=0.81; 95%\u2009CI 0.47 to 1.14: k=7) and a small improvement in overall educational outcomes (d=0.36; 95%\u2009CI 0.09 to 0.63: k=25). No effects were seen on cognitive (k=3) or health outcomes (k=3). 25/42 studies had high risk of bias in at least two domains. CONCLUSION: In elementary and preschool settings, when physically active lessons were added into the curriculum they had positive impact on both physical activity and educational outcomes. These findings support policy initiatives encouraging the incorporation of physically active lessons into teaching in elementary and preschool setting. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: CRD42017076933. ",
        "Similarity in transgender and cisgender children's gender development. Gender is one of the central categories organizing children's social world. Clear patterns of gender development have been well-documented among cisgender children (i.e., children who identify as a gender that is typically associated with their sex assigned at birth). We present a comprehensive study of gender development (e.g., gender identity and gender expression) in a cohort of 3- to 12-y-old transgender children (n = 317) who, in early childhood, are identifying and living as a gender different from their assigned sex. Four primary findings emerged. First, transgender children strongly identify as members of their current gender group and show gender-typed preferences and behaviors that are strongly associated with their current gender, not the gender typically associated with their sex assigned at birth. Second, transgender children's gender identity (i.e., the gender they feel they are) and gender-typed preferences generally did not differ from 2 comparison groups: cisgender siblings (n = 189) and cisgender controls (n = 316). Third, transgender and cisgender children's patterns of gender development showed coherence across measures. Finally, we observed minimal or no differences in gender identity or preferences as a function of how long transgender children had lived as their current gender. Our findings suggest that early sex assignment and parental rearing based on that sex assignment do not always define how a child identifies or expresses gender later. ",
        "Asthma and academic performance in urban children. BACKGROUND: Urban minority children experience high levels of asthma morbidity. Poor school performance can be an indicator that asthma is in poor control. Little attention has been paid to examining real-time links between asthma and academic performance, particularly in high-risk groups. OBJECTIVE: Examine 1) academic performance across a range of indicators in a group of urban children with asthma and urban children without chronic illness and ethnic differences in these associations, and 2) associations between asthma and academic performance in the group of urban children with asthma and ethnic differences in these associations. METHODS: Two hundred sixteen black/African American (33%), Latino (46%), and non-Latino white (21%) urban children, ages 7 to 9 years completed a clinic- and home-based protocol that assessed asthma and allergy status, objective measurements of lung function, and academic functioning. RESULTS: Analyses revealed that children with asthma experienced a higher number of school absences when compared with healthy controls. Greater disparities in academic outcomes emerged when examining ethnic differences within the groups of children with and without asthma. Poor academic outcomes were observed in Latino children with asthma. Furthermore, a strong correspondence of poor asthma outcomes and decrements in academic performance were seen in the full sample, and these associations emerged across ethnic groups. CONCLUSION: Asthma activity contributes to poorer academic outcomes across a range of indicators, and urban minority children with asthma, particularly Latino children, may be at heightened risk for poorer academic performance. School management guidelines for asthma need to be consistently implemented and tailored for school staff, caregivers, and students with asthma to address challenges of managing asthma within the urban school setting.

        "Risk of knee osteoarthritis after different types of knee injuries in young adults: a population-based cohort study. OBJECTIVES: To estimate the risk of clinically diagnosed knee osteoarthritis (OA) after different types of knee injuries in young adults. METHODS: In a longitudinal cohort study based on population-based healthcare data from Sk\u00e5ne, Sweden, we included all persons aged 25-34 years in 1998-2007 (n=149\u2009288) with and without diagnoses of knee injuries according to International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-10. We estimated the HR of future diagnosed knee OA in injured and uninjured persons using Cox regression, adjusted for potential confounders. We also explored the impact of type of injury (contusion, fracture, dislocation, meniscal tear, cartilage tear/other injury, collateral ligament tear, cruciate ligament tear and injury to multiple structures) on diagnosed knee OA risk. RESULTS: We identified 5247 persons (mean (SD) age 29.4 (2.9) years, 67% men) with a knee injury and 142\u2009825 persons (mean (SD) age 30.2 (3.0) years, 45% men) without. We found an adjusted HR of 5.7 (95% CI 5.0 to 6.6) for diagnosed knee OA in injured compared with uninjured persons during the first 11 years of follow-up and 3.4 (95% CI 2.9 to 4.0) during the following 8 years. The corresponding risk difference (RD) after 19 years of follow-up was 8.1% (95% CI 6.7% to 9.4%). Cruciate ligament injury, meniscal tear and fracture of the tibia plateau/patella were associated with greatest increase in risk (RD of 19.6% (95% CI 13.2% to 25.9%), 10.5% (95% CI 6.4% to 14.7%) and 6.6% (95% CI 1.1% to 12.2%), respectively). CONCLUSION: In young adults, knee injury increases the risk of future diagnosed knee OA about sixfold with highest risks found after cruciate ligament injury, meniscal tear and intra-articular fracture.

        "Knee osteoarthritis risk is increased 4-6 fold after knee injury - a systematic review and meta-analysis. OBJECTIVE: To estimate knee osteoarthritis (OA) risk following anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), meniscus or combined ACL and meniscus injury. DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, Embase, SPORTDiscus, CINAHL and Web of Science until November 2018. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR SELECTING STUDIES: Prospective or retrospective studies with at least 2-year follow-up including adults with ACL injury, meniscal injury or combined injuries. Knee OA was defined by radiographs or clinical diagnosis and compared with the contralateral knee or non-injured controls. STUDY APPRAISAL AND SYNTHESIS: Risk of bias was assessed using the SIGN50 checklist. ORs for developing knee OA were estimated using random effects meta-analysis. RESULTS: 53 studies totalling \u223c1\u2009million participants were included: 185\u2009219 participants with ACL injury, mean age 28 years, 35% females, 98% surgically reconstructed; 83\u2009267 participants with meniscal injury, mean age 38 years, 36% females, 22% confirmed meniscectomy and 73% unknown; 725\u2009362 participants with combined injury, mean age 31 years, 26% females, 80% treated surgically. The OR of developing knee OA were 4.2 (95% CI 2.2 to 8.0; I2=92%), 6.3 (95% CI 3.8 to 10.5; I2=95%) and 6.4 (95% CI 4.9 to 8.3; I2=62%) for patients with ACL injury, meniscal injury and combined injuries, respectively. CONCLUSION: The odds of developing knee OA following ACL injury are approximately four times higher compared with a non-injured knee. A meniscal injury and a combined injury affecting both the ACL and meniscus are associated with six times higher odds compared with a non-injured knee. Large inconsistency (eg, study design, follow-up period and comparator) and few high-quality studies suggest that future studies may change these estimates. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Patients sustaining a major knee injury have a substantially increased risk of developing knee OA, highlighting the importance of knee injury prevention programmes and secondary prevention strategies to prevent or delay knee OA development.PROSPERO registration number CRD42015016900.

        "Can even experienced orthopaedic surgeons predict who will benefit from surgery when patients present with degenerative meniscal tears? A survey of 194 orthopaedic surgeons who made 3880 predictions. OBJECTIVES: To examine the ability of surgeons to predict the outcome of treatment for meniscal tears by arthroscopic partial meniscectomy (APM) and exercise therapy in middle-aged patients. DESIGN AND SETTING: Electronic survey. Orthopaedic surgeon survey participants were presented 20 patient profiles. These profiles were derived from a randomised clinical trial comparing APM with exercise therapy in middle-aged patients with symptomatic non-obstructive meniscal tears. From each treatment group (APM and exercise therapy), we selected five patients with the best (responders) and five patients with the worst (non-responders) knee function after treatment. 1111 orthopaedic surgeons and residents in the Netherlands and Australia were invited to participate in the survey. INTERVENTIONS: For each of the 20 patient profiles, surgeons (unaware of treatment allocation) had to choose between APM and exercise therapy as preferred treatment and subsequently had to estimate the expected change in knee function for both treatments on a 5-point Likert Scale. Finally, surgeons were asked which patient characteristics affected their treatment choice. MAIN OUTCOMES: The primary outcome was the surgeons' percentage correct predictions. We also compared this percentage between experienced knee surgeons and other orthopaedic surgeons, and between treatment responders and non-responders. RESULTS: We received 194 (17%) complete responses for all 20 patient profiles, resulting in 3880 predictions. Overall, 50.0% (95% CI 39.6% to 60.4%) of the predictions were correct, which equals the proportion expected by chance. Experienced knee surgeons were not better in predicting outcome than other orthopaedic surgeons (50.4% vs 49.5%, respectively; p=0.29). The percentage correct predictions was lower for patient profiles of non-responders (34%; 95%\u2009CI 21.3% to 46.6%) compared with responders (66.0%; 95%\u2009CI 57.0% to 75.0%; p=0.01).In general, bucket handle tears, knee locking and failed non-operative treatment directed the surgeons' choice towards APM, while higher level of osteoarthritis, degenerative aetiology and the absence of locking complaints directed the surgeons' choice towards exercise therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Surgeons' criteria for deciding that surgery was indicated did not pass statistical examination. This was true regardless of a surgeon's experience. These results suggest that non-surgical management is appropriate as first-line therapy in middle-aged patients with symptomatic non-obstructive meniscal tears. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03462134. Wild goose chase - no predictable patient subgroups benefit from meniscal surgery: patient-reported outcomes of 641 patients 1 year after surgery. BACKGROUND: Despite absence of evidence of a clinical benefit of arthroscopic partial meniscectomy (APM), many surgeons claim that subgroups of patients benefit from APM. OBJECTIVE: We developed a prognostic model predicting change in patient-reported outcome 1\u2009year following arthroscopic meniscal surgery to identify such subgroups. METHODS: We included 641 patients (age 48.7 years (SD 13), 56% men) undergoing arthroscopic meniscal surgery from the Knee Arthroscopy Cohort Southern Denmark. 18 preoperative factors identified from literature and/or orthopaedic surgeons (patient demographics, medical history, symptom onset and duration, knee-related symptoms, etc) were combined in a multivariable linear regression model. The outcome was change in Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS4) (average score of 4 of 5 KOOS subscales excluding the activities of daily living subscale) from presurgery to 52 weeks after surgery. A positive KOOS4 change score constitutes improvement. Prognostic performance was assessed using R2 statistics and calibration plots and was internally validated by adjusting for optimism using 1000 bootstrap samples. RESULTS: Patients improved on average 18.6 (SD 19.7, range -38.0 to 87.8) in KOOS4. The strongest prognostic factors for improvement were (1) no previous meniscal surgery on index knee and (2) more severe preoperative knee-related symptoms. The model's overall predictive performance was low (apparent R2=0.162, optimism adjusted R2=0.080) and it showed poor calibration (calibration-in-the-large=0.205, calibration slope=0.772). CONCLUSION: Despite combining a large number of preoperative factors presumed clinically relevant, change in patient-reported outcome 1\u2009year following meniscal surgery was not predictable. This essentially quashes the existence of 'subgroups' with certain characteristics having a particularly favourable outcome after meniscal surgery. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT01871272. ",
        "Risks and clinical predictors of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma diagnoses in adults with diagnosed NAFLD: real-world study of 18 million patients in four European cohorts. BACKGROUND: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a common condition that progresses in some patients to steatohepatitis (NASH), cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Here we used healthcare records of 18 million adults to estimate risk of acquiring advanced liver disease diagnoses in patients with NAFLD or NASH compared to individually matched controls. METHODS: Data were extracted from four European primary care databases representing the UK, Netherlands, Italy and Spain. Patients with a recorded diagnosis of NAFLD or NASH (NAFLD/NASH) were followed up for incident cirrhosis and HCC diagnoses. Each coded NAFLD/NASH patient was matched to up to 100 \"non-NAFLD\" patients by practice site, gender, age\u2009\u00b1\u20095\u2009years and visit recorded within \u00b1\u20096\u2009months. Hazard ratios (HR) were estimated using Cox models adjusted for age and smoking status and pooled across databases by random effects meta-analyses. RESULTS: Out of 18,782,281 adults, we identified 136,703 patients with coded NAFLD/NASH. Coded NAFLD/NASH patients were more likely to have diabetes, hypertension and obesity than matched controls. HR for cirrhosis in patients compared to controls was 4.73 (95% CI 2.43-9.19) and for HCC, 3.51 (95% CI 1.72-7.16). HR for either outcome was higher in patients with NASH and those with high-risk Fib-4 scores. The strongest independent predictor of a diagnosis of HCC or cirrhosis was baseline diagnosis of diabetes. CONCLUSIONS: Real-world population data show that recorded diagnosis of NAFLD/NASH increases risk of life-threatening liver outcomes. Diabetes is an independent predictor of advanced liver disease diagnosis, emphasising the need to identify specific groups of patients at highest risk. ",
        "Association of dietary macronutrient composition and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease in an ageing population: the Rotterdam Study. OBJECTIVE: A healthy lifestyle is the first-line treatment in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), but specific dietary recommendations are lacking. Therefore, we aimed to determine whether dietary macronutrient composition is associated with NAFLD. DESIGN: Participants from the Rotterdam Study were assessed on (1) average intake of macronutrients (protein, carbohydrate, fat, fibre) using a Food Frequency Questionnaire and (2) NAFLD presence using ultrasonography, in absence of excessive alcohol, steatogenic drugs and viral hepatitis. Macronutrients were analysed using the nutrient density method and ranked (Q1-Q4). Logistic regression analyses were adjusted for sociodemographic, lifestyle and metabolic covariates. Moreover, analyses were adjusted for and stratified by body mass index (BMI) (25\u2009kg/m2). Also, substitution models were built. RESULTS: In total, 3882 participants were included (age 70\u00b19, 58% female). NAFLD was present in 1337 (34%) participants of whom 132 were lean and 1205 overweight. Total protein was associated with overweight NAFLD after adjustment for sociodemographic and lifestyle covariates (ORQ4vsQ1 1.40; 95%\u2009CI 1.11 to 1.77). This association was driven by animal protein (ORQ4vsQ1 1.54; 95%\u2009CI 1.20 to 1.98). After adjustment for metabolic covariates, only animal protein remained associated with overweight NAFLD (ORQ4vsQ1 1.36; 95%\u2009CI 1.05 to 1.77). Monosaccharides and disaccharides were associated with lower overall NAFLD prevalence (ORQ4vsQ1 0.66; 95%\u2009CI 0.52 to 0.83) but this effect diminished after adjustment for metabolic covariates and BMI. No consistent associations were observed for fat subtypes or fibre. There were no substitution effects. CONCLUSION: This large population-based study shows that high animal protein intake is associated with NAFLD in overweight, predominantly aged Caucasians, independently of well-known risk factors. Contrary to previous literature, our results do not support a harmful association of monosaccharides and disaccharides with NAFLD. ",
        "Epidemiology of chronic liver diseases in the USA in the past three decades. OBJECTIVE: Given significant advances in treatment of viral hepatitis and the growing epidemic of obesity, the burden of the different types of liver diseases in the USA may be changing. Our aim was to assess the shift in the prevalence of different liver disease aetiologies in the USA over the past three decades. DESIGN: National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES; cross-sectional 1988-1994 and 1999-2016) were used. RESULTS: A total of 58\u2009731 adults from NHANES (1988-2016) were included. Over the study period, the prevalence of chronic hepatitis B and alcoholic liver disease remained stable: 0.3%-0.4% and 0.8%-1.0%, respectively (p>0.05). The prevalence of chronic hepatitis C decreased nearly twofold: 1.6% in 1988-1994 to 0.9% in 2013-2016 (p=0.03). In contrast, the prevalence of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD; by US-Fatty Liver Index) increased from 20.0% (1988-1994) to 28.3% (1999-2004) to 33.2% (2009-2012) and 31.9% (2013-2016) (p<0.0001). Furthermore, steady increases were observed in the rates of obesity (22.2% in 1988-1994 to 31.0% in 1999-2004 to 38.9% in 2013-2016), type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) (from 7.2% to 8.2% to 13.5% same years), insulin resistance and hypertension (all p<0.0001). Yearly trend analyses showed that the only LD with consistently increasing prevalence was NAFLD (trend p=0.01). Multivariable regression analysis showed that obesity (OR 10.4; 95%\u2009CI 9.5 to 11.3) and T2DM (OR 3.7; 95% CI 3.2 to 4.2) were the major independent predictors of NAFLD. CONCLUSIONS: Over the past 30 years in the USA, NAFLD is the only liver disease with growing prevalence, synchronous with the increasing rates of obesity and T2DM. ",
        "Screen of traditional soup broths with reported antipyretic activity towards the discovery of potential antimalarials. OBJECTIVE: The global impact of artemisinin-based combination therapies on malaria-associated mortality and their origins in ancient Chinese medicine has heightened interest in the natural discovery of future antimalarials. METHODS: A double-blind study to identify potential ingredients with antimalarial activity from traditional remedies with reported antipyretic properties. Recipes of clear broths, passed down by tradition in families of diverse ethnic origin, were sourced by school children. Broths were then tested for their ability to arrest malaria parasite asexual growth or sexual stage development in vitro. Clear broth extract was incubated with in vitro cultures of Plasmodium falciparum asexual or mature sexual stage cultures and assayed for parasite viability after 72 hours. RESULTS: Of the 56 broths tested, 5 were found to give >50% in vitro growth inhibition against P. falciparum asexual blood stages, with 2 having comparable inhibition to that seen with dihydroartemisinin, a leading antimalarial. Four other broths were found to have >50% transmission blocking activity, preventing male parasite sexual stage development. After unblinding, two active broths were found to be from siblings from different classes, who had brought in the same vegetarian soup, demonstrating assay robustness. CONCLUSIONS: This screening approach succeeded in finding broths with activity against malaria parasite in vitro growth, arising from complex vegetable and/or meat-based broths. This represented a successful child education exercise, in teaching about the interface between natural remedies, traditional medicine and evidence-based drug discovery. ",
        "Race and Ethnicity, Medical Insurance, and Within-Hospital Severe Maternal Morbidity Disparities. OBJECTIVE: To examine within-hospital racial and ethnic disparities in severe maternal morbidity rates and determine whether they are associated with differences in types of medical insurance. METHODS: We conducted a population-based, cross-sectional study using linked 2010-2014 New York City discharge and birth certificate data sets (N=591,455 deliveries) to examine within-hospital black-white, Latina-white, and Medicaid-commercially insured differences in severe maternal morbidity. We used logistic regression to produce risk-adjusted rates of severe maternal morbidity for patients with commercial and Medicaid insurance and for black, Latina, and white patients within each hospital. We compared these within-hospital adjusted rates using paired t-tests and conditional logit models. RESULTS: Severe maternal morbidity was higher among black and Latina women than white women (4.2% and 2.9% vs 1.5%, respectively, P<.001) and among women insured by Medicaid than those commercially insured (2.8% vs 2.0%, P<.001). Women insured by Medicaid compared with those with commercial insurance had similar risk for severe maternal morbidity within the same hospital (P=.54). In contrast, black women compared with white women had significantly higher risk for severe maternal morbidity within the same hospital (P<.001), as did Latina women (P<.001). Conditional logit analyses confirmed these findings, with black and Latina women compared with white women having higher risk for severe maternal morbidity (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.52; 95% CI 1.46-1.62 and aOR 1.44; 95% CI 1.36-1.53, respectively) and women insured by Medicaid compared with those commercially insured having similar risk. CONCLUSION: Within hospitals in New York City, black and Latina women are at higher risk of severe maternal morbidity than white women; this is not associated with differences in types of insurance.

        "Men with serious chronic illnesses and malignancies are less likely to seek treatment for erectile dysfunction. The aim of this study was to evaluate one possible reason why men do not seek help for erectile dysfunction. For this study, 500 men that visited their family doctors were stratified into one of three groups based on the reasons for their visits and their overall health statuses. A questionnaire was used to ask each participant about his willingness to seek help for erectile dysfunction should it occur during his lifetime. The statistical analysis of their answers showed that the men with serious chronic illnesses and malignancies were less interested in sexual activity, and they were less likely to seek help for erectile dysfunction when compared to otherwise healthy men and men with mild chronic diseases. Better patient education and reassurance could increase the proportion of men with chronic illnesses and malignancies who seek treatment for erectile dysfunction. ",
        "Effectiveness of school-based self-management interventions for asthma among children and adolescents: findings from a Cochrane systematic review and meta-analysis. INTRODUCTION: The evidence that teaching self-management techniques to children and young people with asthma in schools is effective has not, to date, been the subject of systematic review. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of intervention studies. Studies were eligible if they employed a randomised parallel-group design and were published in English from 1995 onwards. Participants included children with asthma aged 5-18\u2009years who participated within their own school environment. Searches were conducted on the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register. Quantitative data were combined using random-effects meta-analyses. RESULTS: Thirty-three outcome evaluation studies were included. School-based interventions were effective in reducing the frequency of emergency department visits (OR 0.70, 95%\u2009CI 0.53 to 0.92; studies=13), and moderately effective in reducing levels of hospitalisations (standardised mean differences [SMD] -0.19, 95%\u2009CI -0.35 to -0.04; studies=6). A meta-analysis of three studies suggest that the intervention approach could reduce the number of days of restricted activity (SMD -0.30, 95%\u2009CI -0.41 to -0.18; studies=3). However, there was uncertainty as to whether school-based self-management interventions impacted on reducing absences from school. CONCLUSIONS: Self-management interventions for children with asthma delivered in schools reduce the number of acute episodes of healthcare usage. We conclude that the school environment is an important space for delivering interventions to improve children's health. ",
        "Persistent vasomotor symptoms and breast cancer in the Women's Health Initiative. OBJECTIVE: Vasomotor symptoms (VMS) including hot flashes and night sweats are common during the menopausal transition and may persist. Although VMS pathophysiology is complex, estrogen's efficiency as VMS therapy suggests hormonal environment change may influence this process. As studies of VMS and breast cancer are inconsistent, we examined associations between persistent VMS and breast cancer incidence and mortality. METHODS: The analytic sample included 25,499 postmenopausal women aged 50 to 79 in the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) without current/former menopausal hormone therapy use with information on VMS status (never vs persistent). Breast cancers were verified by medical record review. Cause of death attribution was enhanced by serial National Death Index queries. Associations between VMS status and breast cancer incidence and mortality was determined using time dependent Cox regression analyses adjusted for breast cancer risk factors. RESULTS: Through 17.9 years (median) follow-up, 1,399 incident breast cancers were seen. Women with persistent VMS (VMS median duration 10+ years) (n\u200a=\u200a9,715), compared to women with never VMS (n\u200a=\u200a15,784), had a higher breast cancer incidence (hazard ratio [HR] 1.13 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.02-1.27). While breast cancer-specific mortality was higher in women with persistent VMS (HR 1.33 95% CI 0.88-2.02), the difference was not statistically significant. Persistent VMS status had no influence on breast cancer overall survival (HR 1.02 95% CI 0.81-1.29). CONCLUSION: Women with persistent VMS are more likely to be diagnosed with breast cancer than women who never experienced VMS, but not more likely to die from breast cancer. ",
        "Rethinking the techno vagina: a case series of patient complications following vaginal laser treatment for atrophy. OBJECTIVE: The treatment of genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM) includes prescription hormone therapy, nonhormonal over-the-counter products, and most recently, laser treatment. Although the Food and Drug Administration has cleared fractional carbon dioxide (CO2) laser for a variety of dermatologic and gynecologic indications, lasers have not to date, been approved for use for vulvar/vaginal atrophy, or sexual dysfunction. METHODS: Four case studies that were referred to a tertiary sexual medicine center regarding laser treatment complications for GSM are reported. Patient data were Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 protected and informed consent was obtained by all patients. RESULTS: Four cases are presented, which demonstrate complications after completion of three consecutive laser treatments for GSM. Case 1 is a 65-year-old woman with GSM and moderate vaginal stenosis who had two vaginal wall lacerations after resumption of intercourse. Case 2 is a 61-year-old woman who had persistent dyspareunia following vaginal laser treatments. Case 3 is a 68-year-old woman who reported worsening dyspareunia and had a fibrous band mid vagina that impinged on the canal. Case 4 is a 55-year-old woman who complained of dyspareunia and insertional pain, after her laser. Assessment and follow-up treatment are presented. CONCLUSIONS: Laser therapy for the vagina shows excellent promise for the treatment of GSM in some women; however, complications such as fibrosis, scarring, agglutination, and penetration injury have been documented. Food and Drug Administration-approved products for GSM should be considered frontline treatments until long-term, prospective, randomized, sham-controlled trials are conducted that confirm efficacy and safety for device treatments.

        "Female sexuality and vaginal health across the menopausal age. OBJECTIVE: The primary aim was to evaluate changes in female sexuality across the menopausal period, and the secondary objective was to test the associations of female sexuality domains with vaginal atrophy and its symptoms. METHODS: A cross-sectional multicenter study was performed involving 518 women, 40 to 55 years of age, consulting outpatient gynecological services at 30 centers across Italy. Vaginal atrophy was identified by the contemporaneous presence of a pH >5, subjective vaginal dryness, and an objective sign. The relationships between vaginal atrophy and its main symptoms (vaginal dryness and dyspareunia), and Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) score and its domains (desire, arousal, orgasm, dyspareunia, lubrication, and sexual satisfaction) were analyzed. RESULTS: The prevalence of sexual dysfunction, as defined by a FSFI score <26.55, was 70.6%, increasing from 55% in the years 40 to 45, to 82.8% (P\u200a<\u200a0.01) in the years 52 to 55 of age. Mean FSFI score decreased from 40 to 45, to 46 to 48 years of age (23.13\u200a\u00b1\u200a9.76 vs 19.49\u200a\u00b1\u200a9.88; P\u200a<\u200a0.05), and from 48 to 51, to 52 to 55 years of age (21.3\u200a\u00b1\u200a8.06 to 17.59\u200a\u00b1\u200a9.11; P\u200a<\u200a0.01). Independent determinants of FSFI were age, vaginal atrophy, and the presence of vaginal dryness and dyspareunia (R2 0.208; P\u200a=\u200a0.011). FSFI score was independently correlated (R2 0.116) with weight (CR -0.067; 95% confidence interval [CI] -0.126, -0.006; P\u200a<\u200a0.032), menopausal status (CR -2.406; 95% CI -4.180, -0.63; P\u200a<\u200a0.008), and vaginal dryness (CR -5.647; 95% CI -7.677, -3.618; P\u200a<\u200a0.0001). Vaginal dryness was the only variable correlated independently with each FSFI domain, including desire (also correlated with menopausal status), arousal (with age and menopausal status), lubrication (with age), orgasm (with age), satisfaction (with vaginal atrophy and being an ex-smoker), and dyspareunia (with age and spontaneously referred dyspareunia). CONCLUSIONS: In the perimenopausal years, FSFI score decreases and sexual dysfunction increases by about 30%. Vaginal dryness is the symptom of vaginal atrophy most closely related to all domains of female sexuality. ",
        "Menstrual Suppression for Military Women: Barriers to Care in the United States. Since 2000 there has been a 17% increase in the number of women serving in the U.S. military. As women enter the services in more significant numbers and are increasingly deployed to combat operations, the military must adopt policies and practices that accommodate the health care needs of female warriors. According to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, it is essential that obstetrician-gynecologists are knowledgeable and prepared to address the unique risks to women's reproductive health that are associated with military service. This article responds to this call by focusing on issues related to menstrual regulation or suppression in the female active-duty population. Analysis shows that although servicewomen have consistently reported a desire to suppress or regulate menstruation, rates of this practice remain low. Potential reasons for this include barriers to care and issues related to health literacy within the military population of patients and health care providers. This article provides an overview of the growing body of survey and interview data focusing on military women's health to show that there are gaps in knowledge and significant barriers to care that must be addressed. Ultimately, this work argues that medical care and counseling should be more responsive to the needs of female service members. Educating female service members on the option of menstrual suppression should be made a standard part of routine well-woman care and predeployment physicals, thereby removing sex-specific barriers and enabling more women to take on forward combat roles.

        "The impact of menstrual symptoms on everyday life: a\u00a0survey among 42,879 women. BACKGROUND: Menstrual symptoms such as dysmenorrhea, heavy menstrual bleeding, and perimenstrual mood disorders are known to be widespread among the general population. From studies in patients with endometriosis and premenstrual disorder, it has been shown that these symptoms can have a large impact on women's quality of life and account for substantial health care use. Furthermore, it is estimated that many women initially do not consult a doctor while facing menstrual symptoms. Consequently, the impact of menstrual symptoms on daily activities in the general population is unknown. OBJECTIVE: To obtain a nationwide overview of menstrual symptoms and their impact on everyday activities. STUDY DESIGN: Nationwide, cross-sectional, internet-based survey among 42,879 women aged 15-45 years, conducted from July to October 2017. OUTCOME MEASURES: presence of menstrual symptoms, pain or intensity score, impact on daily activities. RESULTS: Dysmenorrhea was the most common symptom, with a prevalence of 85%, followed by psychological complaints (77%), and tiredness (71%). During their menstrual period, 38% of all women reported not to be able to perform all their regular daily activities. From the women that had to skip tasks because of their symptoms, only 48.6% told their family that menstrual symptoms were the reason for the transfer of tasks. CONCLUSION: Menstrual symptoms are widespread among the general population. One in 3 women quit daily activities owing to menstrual symptoms. Half of all women did not mention menstrual complaints being the reason for transferring tasks in a family setting. These results must be interpreted with caution owing to the potential for selection bias. However, considering the impact of menstrual symptoms on daily activities in a large group of women, it is time to open the societal dialogue and improve education for both patients and doctors. ",
        "Smartphone-based migraine behavioral therapy: a single-arm study with assessment of mental health predictors. Progressive muscle relaxation (PMR) is an under-utilized Level A evidence-based treatment for migraine prevention. We studied the feasibility and acceptability of smartphone application (app)-based PMR for migraine in a neurology setting, explored whether app-based PMR might reduce headache (HA) days, and examined potential predictors of app and/or PMR use. In this single-arm pilot study, adults with ICHD3 migraine, 4+ HA days/month, a smartphone, and no prior behavioral migraine therapy in the past year were asked to complete a daily HA diary and do PMR for 20\u2009min/day for 90 days. Outcomes were: adherence to PMR (no. and duration of audio plays) and frequency of diary use. Predictors in the models were baseline demographics, HA-specific variables, baseline PROMIS (patient-reported outcomes measurement information system) depression and anxiety scores, presence of overlapping pain conditions studied and app satisfaction scores at time of enrollment. Fifty-one patients enrolled (94% female). Mean age was 39\u2009\u00b1\u200913 years. The majority (63%) had severe migraine disability at baseline (MIDAS). PMR was played 22\u2009\u00b1\u200921 days on average. Mean/session duration was 11\u2009\u00b1\u20097\u2009min. About half (47%) of uses were 1+ time/week and 35% of uses were 2+ times/week. There was a decline in use/week. On average, high users (PMR 2+ days/week in the first month) had 4 fewer days of reported HAs in month 2 vs. month 1, whereas low PMR users (PMR <\u20092 days/week in the first month) had only 2 fewer HA days in month 2. PROMIS depression score was negatively associated with the log odds of using the diary at least once (vs. no activity) in a week (OR\u2009=\u20090.70, 95% CI\u2009=\u2009[0.55, 0.85]) and of doing the PMR at least once in a week (OR\u2009=\u20090.77, 95% CI\u2009=\u2009[0.68, 0.91]). PROMIS anxiety was positively associated with using the diary at least once every week (OR\u2009=\u20091.33, 95% CI\u2009=\u2009[1.09, 1.73]) and with doing the PMR at least once every week (OR\u2009=\u20091.14 [95% CI\u2009=\u2009[1.02, 1.31]). In conclusion, about half of participants used smartphone-based PMR intervention based upon a brief, initial introduction to the app. App use was associated with reduction in HA days. Higher depression scores were negatively associated with diary and PMR use, whereas higher anxiety scores were positively associated. ",
        "Sexual Assault in the Military and Increased Odds of Sexual Pain Among Female Veterans. OBJECTIVE: To examine whether the relationship between childhood sexual abuse and sexual function in civilian women is also found among female veterans, and to consider the additional effects of sexual assault in the military. METHODS: Using a retrospective cohort design, participants (N=1,004) from two midwestern Department of Veterans Affairs medical centers and associated clinics completed a telephone-assisted interview on sexual assault, sexual pain, and mental health. Binary logistic regression was used to compare the rates of sexual pain between women with no sexual assault history, histories of childhood sexual abuse alone, histories of sexual assault in the military alone, and histories of childhood sexual abuse and sexual assault in the military. RESULTS: Female veterans with histories of childhood sexual abuse and sexual assault in the military reported the highest rates of sexual pain (\u03c7(3)=40.98, P<.001), posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD, \u03c7(3)=88.18, P<.001), and depression (\u03c7(3)=56.07, P<.001), followed by women with sexual assault in the military histories alone, women with childhood sexual abuse histories alone, and women with no sexual assault. Female veterans with histories of childhood sexual abuse and sexual assault in the military were 4.33 times more likely to report sexual pain, 6.35 times more likely to report PTSD, and 3.91 times more likely to report depression than female veterans with no sexual assault. CONCLUSION: The relationship between sexual assault and sexual pain in female veterans is distinct from their civilian peers. For female veterans, sexual assault in the military is more detrimental to sexual function (specifically sexual pain) than childhood sexual abuse alone, and the combination of childhood sexual abuse and sexual assault in the military confers the greatest risk for sexual pain. Given this difference in sexual health, treatments for sexual dysfunction related to a history of childhood sexual abuse in civilian women may not be adequate for female veterans. Female veterans may require a targeted treatment approach that takes into account the particular nature and consequences of sexual assault in the military. ",
        "Sleep problems and functioning during initial training for a high-risk occupation. OBJECTIVES: The current study sought to characterize the sleep problems of soldiers entering Basic Combat Training and to identify the link between sleep problems and subsequent performance, psychological distress, anger reactions, and attention. DESIGN: Soldiers were surveyed at 4 time points throughout the standard 10\u202fweeks of Basic Combat Training. Surveys were administered at weeks 1, 3, 6, and 9. Sleep problems were identified as either present or absent at each time point using a sleep problem screening questionnaire. Four sleep patterns were identified and then used to evaluate outcomes throughout training (n\u202f=\u202f1577). RESULTS: When compared to those who never had a sleep problem (\"healthy \"; 60.6%), those who recovered from their initial sleep problem (\"recovered\"; 12.8%) started training with higher psychological distress and anger reactions and lower attention but steadily improved throughout training. Those who developed a sleep problem during training (\"new onset\"; 20.0%) and those who had a sleep problem throughout training (\"chronic\"; 6.6%) also started off significantly worse than the healthy group. The new-onset and chronic groups saw slower psychological distress improvement and a decline in attention throughout the course compared to the healthy group. The chronic group also significantly increased their anger reactions throughout training compared to the healthy group. CONCLUSION: Sleep problems during Basic Combat Training may be an indicator for difficulties managing entry into the military. These findings highlight the importance of improving sleep health for soldiers throughout Basic Combat Training and for others with similar training in high-risk occupations. ",
        "Closed-loop digital meditation improves sustained attention in young adults. Attention is a fundamental cognitive process that is critical for essentially all aspects of higher-order cognition and real-world activities. Younger generations have deeply embraced information technology and multitasking in their personal lives, school and the workplace, creating myriad challenges to their attention. While improving sustained attention in healthy young adults would be beneficial, enhancing this ability has proven notoriously difficult in this age group. Here we show that 6\u2009weeks of engagement with a meditation-inspired, closed-loop software program (MediTrain) delivered on mobile devices led to gains in both sustained attention and working memory in healthy young adults. These improvements were associated with positive changes in key neural signatures of attentional control (frontal theta inter-trial coherence and parietal P3b latency), as measured by electroencephalography. Our findings suggest the utility of delivering aspects of the ancient practice of focused-attention meditation in a modern, technology-based approach and its benefits on enhancing sustained attention.

        "Electrical fingerprint of the amygdala guides neurofeedback training for stress resilience. Real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging (rt-fMRI) has revived the translational perspective of neurofeedback (NF)1. Particularly for stress management, targeting deeply located limbic areas involved in stress processing2 has paved new paths for brain-guided interventions. However, the high cost and immobility of fMRI constitute a challenging drawback for the scalability (accessibility and cost-effectiveness) of the approach, particularly for clinical purposes3. The current study aimed to overcome the limited applicability of rt-fMRI by using an electroencephalography (EEG) model endowed with improved spatial resolution, derived from simultaneous EEG-fMRI, to target amygdala activity (termed amygdala electrical fingerprint (Amyg-EFP))4-6. Healthy individuals (n\u2009=\u2009180) undergoing a stressful military training programme were randomly assigned to six Amyg-EFP-NF sessions or one of two controls (control-EEG-NF or NoNF), taking place at the military training base. The results demonstrated specificity of NF learning to the targeted Amyg-EFP signal, which led to reduced alexithymia and faster emotional Stroop, indicating better stress coping following Amyg-EFP-NF relative to controls. Neural target engagement was demonstrated in a follow-up fMRI-NF, showing greater amygdala blood-oxygen-level-dependent downregulation and amygdala-ventromedial prefrontal cortex functional connectivity following Amyg-EFP-NF relative to NoNF. Together, these results demonstrate limbic specificity and efficacy of Amyg-EFP-NF during a stressful period, pointing to a scalable non-pharmacological yet neuroscience-based training to prevent stress-induced psychopathology.

        "Emergency medical services oxygen equipment: a fomite for transmission of MRSA?. OBJECTIVES: The primary purpose of this study was to determine if methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was present on the surface of oxygen cylinders and regulators used in the prehospital setting and secondarily to assess other surfaces for MRSA within the ambulance compartment, as a comparison. METHODS: On 17 March 2018, the surface of oxygen cylinders and regulators located in ambulances at an emergency medical services (EMS) station in North Alabama (n=9) and at an offsite oxygen cylinder storage area (n=70) were swabbed using sterile cotton-tipped applicators saturated in an 0.9% NaCl solution. These cotton-tipped applicators were then streaked across the surface of HardyCHROM MRSA plates, followed by incubation at 36\u00b0C for 24\u2009hours. The growth of pink or magenta colonies was considered a positive indication for the presence of MRSA. The motivation for assessing oxygen cylinders at the offsite storage area was to outline the persistence of MRSA on stored oxygen cylinders. RESULTS: Of nine oxygen cylinders tested in the ambulances, nine had MRSA colonisation (100%). MRSA was also present on 67 of 70 oxygen cylinders (96%) tested at the offsite oxygen cylinder storage area. CONCLUSION: Oxygen cylinders appear to act as a fomite for MRSA. The development of universal disinfection protocols for oxygen equipment could help reduce the risk of patient infection due to cross-contamination. ",
        "Spending at least 120\u2009minutes a week in nature is associated with good health and wellbeing. Spending time in natural environments can benefit health and well-being, but exposure-response relationships are under-researched. We examined associations between recreational nature contact in the last seven days and self-reported health and well-being. Participants (n\u2009=\u200919,806) were drawn from the Monitor of Engagement with the Natural Environment Survey (2014/15-2015/16); weighted to be nationally representative. Weekly contact was categorised using 60\u2009min blocks. Analyses controlled for residential greenspace and other neighbourhood and individual factors. Compared to no nature contact last week, the likelihood of reporting good health or high well-being became significantly greater with contact \u2265120\u2009mins (e.g. 120-179\u2009mins: ORs [95%CIs]: Health\u2009=\u20091.59 [1.31-1.92]; Well-being\u2009=\u20091.23 [1.08-1.40]). Positive associations peaked between 200-300\u2009mins per week with no further gain. The pattern was consistent across key groups including older adults and those with long-term health issues. It did not matter how 120\u2009mins of contact a week was achieved (e.g. one long vs. several shorter visits/week). Prospective longitudinal and intervention studies are a critical next step in developing possible weekly nature exposure guidelines comparable to those for physical activity. ",
        "Evaluating the effects of social networking sites addiction, task distraction, and self-management on nurses' performance. AIMS: The purpose of this study was to explore the relationship of social networking sites (SNSs) addiction on nurses' performance and how this relationship was mediated by task distraction and moderated by self-management. DESIGN: This cross-sectional study is designed to empirically test the relationship of SNSs addiction, task distraction, and self-management with the nurses' performance. METHODS: Data were collected by conducting an online survey on nurses across the world using a web-based questionnaire developed through 'Google Docs' and distributed through Facebook from 13 August 2018 - 17 November 2018. The Facebook groups were searched using the selected key terms. In total, 45 groups were found to have relevance to this research; therefore, request was made to the admins of these groups to participate in this research and to post a link in their groups. Only 19 group admins responded positively by uploading a link of the research instrument on their respective group pages and 461 members of these groups participated in the research. RESULTS: Results of the data collected from 53 different countries indicated that SNSs addiction results in lowering the nurses' performance. This relationship is further strengthened by task distraction introduced as a mediating variable. The results show that self-management mediates the relationship between SNSs addiction and employees' performance. Moreover, the results of the study confirm that self-management reduces the negative impact of SNSs addiction on nurses' performance. CONCLUSION: Social networking sites (SNSs) addiction and task distraction reduce the nurses' performance, whereas self-management enhances nurses' performance. IMPACT: This study addresses the problem of using SNSs at the workplace and its potential effect on nurses' performance. Results demonstrate that SNSs addiction reduces the performance which is further decreased by task distraction; however, self-management of nurses can enhance the nurses' performance. The research has numerous theoretical and practical implications for hospital administration, doctors, and nurses. ",
        "Clinical encounters about obesity: Systematic review of patients' perspectives. Guidelines recommend clinicians intervene on obesity but it is unclear how people with overweight react. In this systematic review, we searched 20 online databases for qualitative studies interviewing people with overweight or obesity who had consulted a primary care clinician. Framework synthesis was used to analyse 21 studies to produce a new theoretical understanding. Consultations in which patients discussed their weight were more infrequent than patients would have liked, which some perceived was because they were unworthy of medical time; others that it indicated doctors feel being overweight is not a serious risk. Patients reported that doctors offered banal advice assuming that the patient ate unhealthily or was not trying to address their weight. Patients reported doctors assumed that their symptoms were due to overweight without a proper history or examination, creating concern that serious illness may be missed. Patients responded positively to offers of support for weight loss and active monitoring of weight. Patients with overweight internalize weight stigma sensitizing them to clues that clinicians are judging them negatively, even if weight is not discussed. Patients' negative experiences in consultations relate to perceived snap judgements and flippant advice and negative experiences appear more salient than positive ones. ",
        "Increased Rwandan Access to Obstetrician-Gynecologists Through a U.S.-Rwanda Academic Training Partnership. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the first 5 years of the Human Resources for Health Rwanda program from the program onset in the July 2012-2016 academic years, and its effects on access to care through examination of: 1) the number of trained obstetrician-gynecologists (ob-gyns) who graduated from the University of Rwanda and the University of Rwanda-Human Resources for Health program and 2) a geospatial analysis of pregnant women's access to Rwandan public hospitals with trained ob-gyns. METHODS: We used GPS coordinates in this cross-sectional study to identify public (government) hospitals with ob-gyns in 2011 (before initiation of the program) compared with 2016 (year 5 of the program). We compared access to care for the years 2011 and 2016 through geocoding the proportion of pregnant women within 10 and 25 km from these hospitals and compared the travel time to these hospitals in the two time periods. We used a World Pop dataset of Rwandan pregnancies from 2015, ArcGIS for spatial operations, R for statistical analysis, zonal statistics for circular distances, and friction surface for travel time analysis. RESULTS: The number of ob-gyns in public hospitals increased from 14 to 49 nationally. Before the program, 18 residents graduated over a 7-year period (two residents per year); 33 graduated by year 5 (six residents per year). Rwandan faculty increased by 45%. In 2011, most providers were in the capital city. Between 2011 and 2016, the proportion of pregnant women living 10 km from an ob-gyn-staffed public hospital increased from 13.0% to 31.6%; within 25 km increased from 28.4% to 82.9%. Travel time analysis from 2011 to 2016 showed 49.1% of Rwandan women within 1 hour of a hospital and 85.6% within 2 hours. In 2016, this coverage increased to 87.5% and 98.3%, respectively. CONCLUSION: In 5 years, the Human Resources for Health Rwanda program improved the number of residency graduates in obstetrics and gynecology and nationwide access to these providers. The program reduced rural-urban disparities in access to ob-gyns. ",
        "Access to Office-Based Buprenorphine Treatment in Areas With High Rates of Opioid-Related Mortality: An Audit Study. Background: Improving access to treatment for opioid use disorder is a national priority, but little is known about the barriers encountered by patients seeking buprenorphine-naloxone (\"buprenorphine\") treatment. Objective: To assess real-world access to buprenorphine treatment for uninsured or Medicaid-covered patients reporting current heroin use. Design: Audit survey (\"secret shopper\" study). Setting: 6 U.S. jurisdictions with a high burden of opioid-related mortality (Massachusetts, Maryland, New Hampshire, West Virginia, Ohio, and the District of Columbia). Participants: From July to November 2018, callers contacted 546 publicly listed buprenorphine prescribers twice, posing as uninsured or Medicaid-covered patients seeking buprenorphine treatment. Measurements: Rates of new appointments offered, whether buprenorphine prescription was possible at the first visit, and wait times. Results: Among 1092 contacts with 546 clinicians, schedulers were reached for 849 calls (78% response rate). Clinicians offered new appointments to 54% of Medicaid contacts and 62% of uninsured-self-pay contacts, whereas 27% of Medicaid and 41% of uninsured-self-pay contacts were offered an appointment with the possibility of buprenorphine prescription at the first visit. The median wait time to the first appointment was 6 days (interquartile range [IQR], 2 to 10 days) for Medicaid contacts and 5 days (IQR, 1 to 9 days) for uninsured-self-pay contacts. These wait times were similar regardless of clinician type or payer status. The median wait time from first contact to possible buprenorphine induction was 8 days (IQR, 4 to 15 days) for Medicaid and 7 days (IQR, 3 to 14 days) for uninsured-self-pay contacts. Limitation: The survey sample included only publicly listed buprenorphine prescribers. Conclusion: Many buprenorphine prescribers did not offer new appointments or rapid buprenorphine access to callers reporting active heroin use, particularly those with Medicaid coverage. Nevertheless, wait times were not long, implying that opportunities may exist to increase access by using the existing prescriber workforce. Primary Funding Source: National Institute on Drug Abuse.

        "Global patterns in excess body weight and the associated cancer burden. The prevalence of excess body weight and the associated cancer burden have been rising over the past several decades globally. Between 1975 and 2016, the prevalence of excess body weight in adults-defined as a body mass index (BMI) \u2265 25 kg/m2 -increased from nearly 21% in men and 24% in women to approximately 40% in both sexes. Notably, the prevalence of obesity (BMI \u2265 30 kg/m2 ) quadrupled in men, from 3% to 12%, and more than doubled in women, from 7% to 16%. This change, combined with population growth, resulted in a more than 6-fold increase in the number of obese adults, from 100 to 671 million. The largest absolute increase in obesity occurred among men and boys in high-income Western countries and among women and girls in Central Asia, the Middle East, and North Africa. The simultaneous rise in excess body weight in almost all countries is thought to be driven largely by changes in the global food system, which promotes energy-dense, nutrient-poor foods, alongside reduced opportunities for physical activity. In 2012, excess body weight accounted for approximately 3.9% of all cancers (544,300 cases) with proportion varying from less than 1% in low-income countries to 7% or 8% in some high-income Western countries and in Middle Eastern and Northern African countries. The attributable burden by sex was higher for women (368,500 cases) than for men (175,800 cases). Given the pandemic proportion of excess body weight in high-income countries and the increasing prevalence in low- and middle-income countries, the global cancer burden attributable to this condition is likely to increase in the future. There is emerging consensus on opportunities for obesity control through the multisectoral coordinated implementation of core policy actions to promote an environment conducive to a healthy diet and active living. The rapid increase in both the prevalence of excess body weight and the associated cancer burden highlights the need for a rejuvenated focus on identifying, implementing, and evaluating interventions to prevent and control excess body weight.

        "Compounded Topical Pain Creams to Treat Localized Chronic Pain: A Randomized Controlled Trial. Background: The use of compounded topical pain creams has increased dramatically, yet their effectiveness has not been well evaluated. Objective: To determine the efficacy of compounded creams for chronic pain. Design: Randomized controlled trials of 3 interventions. (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02497066). Setting: Military treatment facility. Participants: 399 patients with localized pain classified by each patient's treating physician as neuropathic (n\u00a0= 133), nociceptive (n\u00a0= 133), or mixed (n\u00a0= 133). Intervention: Pain creams compounded for neuropathic pain (ketamine, gabapentin, clonidine, and lidocaine), nociceptive pain (ketoprofen, baclofen, cyclobenzaprine, and lidocaine), or mixed pain (ketamine, gabapentin, diclofenac, baclofen, cyclobenzaprine, and lidocaine), or placebo. Measurements: The primary outcome measure was average pain score 1 month after treatment. A positive categorical response was a reduction in pain score of 2 or more points coupled with a score above 3 on a 5-point satisfaction scale. Secondary outcomes included Short Form-36 Health Survey scores, satisfaction, and categorical response. Participants with a positive outcome were followed through 3 months. Results: For the primary outcome, no differences were found in the mean reduction in average pain scores between the treatment and control groups for patients with neuropathic pain (-0.1 points [95% CI, -0.8 to 0.5 points]), nociceptive pain (-0.3 points [CI, -0.9 to 0.2 points]), or mixed pain (-0.3 points [CI, -0.9 to 0.2 points]), or for all patients (-0.3 points [CI, -0.6 to 0.1 points]). At 1 month, 72 participants (36%) in the treatment groups and 54 (28%) in the control group had a positive outcome (risk difference, 8% [CI, -1% to 17%]). Limitations: Generalizability is limited by heterogeneity among pain conditions and formulations of the study interventions. Randomized follow-up was only 1 month. Conclusion: Compounded pain creams were not better than placebo creams, and their higher costs compared with approved compounds should curtail routine use.

        "Comparative evaluation of group-based mindfulness-based stress reduction and cognitive behavioural therapy for the treatment and management of chronic pain: A systematic review and network meta-analysis. QUESTION: This review compares mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) to cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) in its ability to improve physical functioning and reduce pain intensity and distress in patients with chronic pain (CP), when evaluated against control conditions. STUDY SELECTION AND ANALYSIS: Ovid MEDLINE, EmbaseClassic+Embase, PsycINFO and the Cochrane Library were searched to identify randomised controlled trials. The primary outcome measure was physical functioning. Secondary outcomes were pain intensity and depression symptoms. We used random and fixed effects (RE and FE) network meta-analyses (NMA) to compare MBSR, CBT and control interventions on the standardised mean difference scale. FINDINGS: Twenty-one studies were included: 13 CBT vs control (n=1095), 7 MBSR vs control (n=545) and 1 MBSR vs CBT vs control (n=341). Of the 21 articles, 12 were determined to be of fair or good quality. Findings from RE NMA for change in physical functioning, pain intensity and depression revealed clinically important advantages relative to control for MBSR and CBT, but no evidence of an important difference between MBSR and CBT was found. CONCLUSIONS: This review suggests that MBSR offers another potentially helpful intervention for CP management. Additional research using consistent measures is required to guide decisions about providing CBT or MBSR. ",
        "The CHARGE study: an assessment of parental occupational exposures and autism spectrum disorder. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study is to determine if parental occupational exposure to 16 agents is associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). METHODS: Demographic, health and parental occupational data were collected as part of the CHildhood Autism Risks from Genetics and Environment study. The workplace exposure assessment was conducted by two experienced industrial hygienists for the parents of 537 children with ASD and 414 typically developing (TD) children. For each job, frequency and intensity of 16 agents were assessed and both binary and semi-quantitative cumulative exposure variables were derived. Logistic regression models were used to calculate adjusted odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) to assess associations between parental occupational exposures 3\u2009months pre-pregnancy until birth. RESULTS: The OR of ASD in the children of mothers exposed to any solvents was 1.5 times higher than the mothers of TD children (95% CI=1.01-2.23). Cumulative exposure indicated that the OR associated with a moderate level of solvent exposure in mothers was 1.85 (95% CI=1.09, 3.15) for children with ASD compared with TD children. No other exposures were associated with ASD in mothers, fathers or the parents combined. CONCLUSION: Maternal occupational exposure to solvents may increase the risk for ASD. These results are consistent with a growing body of evidence indicating that environmental and occupational exposures may be associated with ASD. Future research should consider specific types of solvents, larger samples and/or different study designs to evaluate other exposures for potential associations with ASD. ",
        "The association of early life stressors with pain sensitivity and pain experience at 22 years. Early life stress (ELS) can significantly influence biological pathways associated with nociception, increasing vulnerability to future heightened pain sensitivity and subsequent risk of pain events. However, very little human research has investigated the association of ELS, measured across multiple domains, with future pain sensitivity. Data from Gen1 and Gen2 of the Raine Study were used to assess the association between a wide range of early life stressors, including antenatally, and pressure and cold pain sensitivity at young adulthood. Participants were classified into 2 groups according to their cold pain sensitivity. In addition, the interaction between ELS, pain sensitivity, and pain experience (based on \u00d6rebro Musculoskeletal Pain Questionnaire) at age 22 years was examined. Analysis was performed using both a complete case and multiple imputation approach, adjusting for contemporaneous 22-year correlates, with comparable results in each model. More problematic behaviour at age 2 years was associated with less pressure pain sensitivity at 22 years (13.7 kPa, 95% CI: 1.0-27.0, P = 0.037), with no interaction between problematic behaviour and pain experience at 22 years. For those reporting a moderate/high pain experience at 22 years, poor family functioning increased the odds ratio for high cold pain sensitivity (3.0, 95% CI: 1.6-5.6), but for those reporting no/low pain experience, it did not (OR:1.2, 95% CI: 0.8-1.8). This study provides the most comprehensive investigation of the relationship between ELS and pressure and cold pain sensitivity in young adults supporting early life as a critical period of development influencing future nociceptive processing.

        "Compliance with hand hygiene in emergency medical services: an international observational study. INTRODUCTION: Healthcare-associated infection caused by insufficient hygiene is associated with mortality, economic burden, and suffering for the patient. Emergency medical service (EMS) providers encounter many patients in different surroundings and are thus at risk of posing a source of microbial transmission. Hand hygiene (HH), a proven infection control intervention, has rarely been studied in the EMS. METHODS: A multicentre prospective observational study was conducted from December 2016 to May 2017 in ambulance services from Finland, Sweden, Australia and Denmark. Two observers recorded the following parameters: HH compliance according to WHO guidelines (before patient contact, before clean/aseptic procedures, after risk of body fluids, after patient contact and after contact with patient surroundings). Glove use and basic parameters such as nails, hair and use of jewellery were also recorded. RESULTS: Sixty hours of observation occurred in each country, for a total of 87 patient encounters. In total, there were 1344 indications for HH. Use of hand rub or hand wash was observed: before patient contact, 3%; before clean/aseptic procedures, 2%; after the risk of body fluids, 8%; after patient contact, 29%; and after contact with patient-related surroundings, 38%. Gloves were worn in 54% of all HH indications. Adherence to short or up done hair, short, clean nails without polish and no jewellery was 99%, 84% and 62%, respectively. HH compliance was associated with wearing gloves (OR 45; 95%\u2009CI 10.8 to 187.8; p=0.000) and provider level (OR 1.7; 95%\u2009CI 1.1 to 2.4; p=0.007), but not associated with gender (OR 1.3; 95%\u2009CI 0.9 to 1.9; p=0.107). CONCLUSION: HH compliance among EMS providers was remarkably low, with higher compliance after patient contacts compared with before patient contacts, and an over-reliance on gloves. We recommend further research on contextual challenges and hygiene perceptions among EMS providers to clarify future improvement strategies. ",
        "Playground lead levels in rubber, soil, sand, and mulch surfaces in Boston. Rubber surfacing is often used in playgrounds due to its potential injury prevention benefits and as a way to recycle waste tires. Available research on chemicals in recycled rubber has focused on synthetic turf applications, but is limited for playground rubber surfacing. Potential lead contamination from vulcanizing agents used in rubber surfacing are a possible concern; however this has not been researched. We examined levels of lead in poured-in-place rubber and compared them to levels in soil, sand, and wood mulch materials from 28 randomly selected playgrounds in Boston, MA, USA using X-ray fluorescence. To evaluate the association between material type and lead concentrations, we conducted a two-way ANOVA with repeated measures and built a linear regression model controlling for distance to major roadway, neighborhood-level status as an environmental justice area, peeling paint on the playground, and rubber condition. Average lead levels were 65.7 \u03bcg/g for soil, 22.0 \u03bcg/g for rubber, 8.5 \u03bcg/g for sand, and 9.0 \u03bcg/g for mulch. Our finding of lower concentrations of lead in sand and mulch compared to rubber and soil should be used to inform playground design to optimize children's health, alongside other chemical and safety considerations.

        "Racial Disparities in Postpartum Pain Management. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate racial and ethnic differences in women's postpartum pain scores, inpatient opioid administration, and discharge opioid prescriptions. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of all deliveries at a single high-volume tertiary care center from December 1, 2015, through November 30, 2016. Women were included if they self-identified as non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, or Hispanic; were at least 18 years of age; and did not have documented allergies to nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs or morphine. Medical records were queried for three outcomes: 1) patient-reported postpartum pain score (on a scale of 0-10) at discharge (dichotomized less than 5 or 5 or higher), 2) inpatient opioid dosing during postpartum hospitalization (reported as morphine milligram equivalents [MMEs] per postpartum day), and 3) receipt of an opioid prescription at discharge. The associations between each of these outcomes and maternal race-ethnicity were assessed using multivariable logistic regression models with random effects to account for clustering by discharge physician. A sensitivity analysis was conducted in which women of different race and ethnicity were matched using propensity scores. RESULTS: A total of 9,900 postpartum women were eligible for analysis. Compared with non-Hispanic white women, Hispanic and non-Hispanic black women had significantly greater odds of reporting a pain score of 5 or higher (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.61, 95% 1.26-2.06 and aOR 2.18, 95% 1.63-2.91, respectively) but received significantly fewer inpatient MMEs/d (adjusted \u03b2 -5.03, 95% CI -6.91 to -3.15, and adjusted \u03b2 -3.54, 95% CI -5.88 to -1.20, respectively). Additionally, Hispanic and non-Hispanic black women were significantly less likely to receive an opioid prescription at discharge (aOR 0.80, 95% CI 0.67 to -0.96 and aOR 0.78, 95% CI 0.62-0.98) compared with non-Hispanic white women. Results of the propensity score analysis largely corroborated those of the primary analysis, with the exception that the difference in inpatient MMEs/d between non-Hispanic white and non-Hispanic black women did not reach statistical significance. CONCLUSION: Hispanic and non-Hispanic black women experience disparities in pain management in the postpartum setting that cannot be explained by less perceived pain. ",
        "Natural history of prediabetes in older adults from a population-based longitudinal study. BACKGROUND: The natural history of prediabetes in older adults remains unknown. OBJECTIVES: To assess the rate at which prediabetes progresses to diabetes, leads to death or reverts to normoglycaemia in older adults and to identify prognostic factors related to different outcomes of prediabetes. METHODS: In the Swedish National Study on Aging and Care-Kungsholmen, 2575 diabetes-free participants aged \u226560\u00a0years were examined at baseline and followed for up to 12\u00a0years. At each wave, diabetes was diagnosed via medical examination, antidiabetic drug use, medical records or glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) \u22656.5%. Prediabetes was defined as HbA1c \u22655.7% and normoglycaemia as HbA1c <5.7% in diabetes-free participants. Data were analysed with multinomial logistic regression. RESULTS: At baseline, 918 (36%) individuals had prediabetes. Of them, 204 (22%) reverted to normoglycaemia (3.4/100 person-years, 95% CI 5.6-12.3), 119 (13%) developed diabetes (2.0/100 person-years, 95% CI 1.7-2.4) and 215 (23%) died (13.0/100 person-years, 95% CI 11.4-14.9) during the 12-year follow-up. The rates of reversion, progression and mortality were higher in the first 6-year than in the second 6-year follow-up, albeit not statistically significant. Lower systolic blood pressure (SBP), absence of heart diseases and weight loss promoted the reversion from prediabetes to normoglycaemia, whilst obesity accelerated its progression to diabetes. CONCLUSIONS: During a 12-year follow-up, most of older adults with prediabetes remained stable or reverted to normoglycaemia, whereas only one-third developed diabetes or died. Lower SBP, no heart diseases and weight management may promote reversion to normoglycaemia, suggesting possible strategies for achieving normoglycaemia in older adults with prediabetes. ",
        "Association of Self-Reported Sleep and Circadian Measures With Glycemia in Adults With Prediabetes or Recently Diagnosed Untreated Type 2 Diabetes. OBJECTIVE: Sleep disturbances and circadian misalignment (social jet lag, late chronotype, or shift work) have been associated with worse glycemic control in type 2 diabetes (T2D). Whether these findings apply to adults with prediabetes is yet unexplored. We hypothesized that self-reported short sleep, poor sleep quality, and/or circadian misalignment are associated with higher glycemia, BMI, and blood pressure (BP) in adults with prediabetes or recently diagnosed, untreated T2D. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Our cohort included 962 overweight/obese adults ages 20-65 years with prediabetes or recently diagnosed, untreated T2D who completed a 2-h oral glucose tolerance test and validated sleep questionnaires. Independent associations of sleep and circadian variables with glycemia, BMI, and BP were evaluated with regression models. RESULTS: The multiethnic cohort was 55% men, with mean \u00b1 SD age 52.2 \u00b1 9.5 years and BMI 34.7 \u00b1 5.5 kg/m2. Mean sleep duration was 6.6 \u00b1 1.3 h. Poor sleep quality was reported by 54% and high risk for obstructive sleep apnea by 64%. HbA1c was significantly higher in those reporting <5 or >8 h sleep per night. Sleep duration >8 h was also associated with higher fasting glucose and <6 h with higher BMI. Shift work was also associated with higher BMI. Social jet lag and delayed chronotype were associated with higher BP. CONCLUSIONS: In our cohort, self-reported short and long sleep were both associated with adverse measures of glycemia, and short sleep and shift work were associated with higher BMI. Further research using objective measures of sleep is needed to better delineate the relationship between sleep and glycemia in adults with prediabetes or T2D. ",
        "Risk of Postpartum Depression Among Women with Asthma. BACKGROUND: Several epidemiological studies have suggested that the risk of depression is increased in patients with asthma, but the impact of asthma during pregnancy on postpartum depression remains unknown. OBJECTIVE: To assess the association between maternal asthma and postpartum depression in a population-based cohort study retrieved from administrative databases. METHODS: A cohort of 35,520 pregnancies in women with asthma during pregnancy and 197,057 pregnancies in women without asthma who delivered between 1998 and 2009 was extracted from the Quebec Asthma and Pregnancy Database. They were followed from the day of delivery up to 1 year postpartum. A generalized estimating equation model was used to estimate the adjusted odds ratios of postpartum depression with 95% CIs in women with asthma during pregnancy versus women without asthma. RESULTS: Postpartum depression within 1 year after delivery occurred in 6.1% of women with asthma versus 2.9% of women without asthma. After adjusting for several potential confounders, including depression/postpartum depression up to 10 years before pregnancy, we found that women with asthma were 58% more likely to experience postpartum depression within 1 year after delivery than women without asthma during pregnancy (adjusted odds ratio, 1.58; 95% CI, 1.50-1.67). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that women with asthma are more likely to suffer from postpartum depression. A close monitoring of signs of depression for pregnant women with asthma is indicated, allowing prompt and efficient interventions if needed. ",
        "Do female elite athletes experience more complicated childbirth than non-athletes? A case-control study. OBJECTIVE: Previous studies have suggested that female athletes might be at higher risk of experiencing complications such as caesarean sections and perineal tears during labour than non-athletes. Our aim was to study delivery outcomes, including emergency caesarean section rates, length of the first and second stages of labour and severe perineal tears, in first-time pregnant elite athletes compared with non-athletes. METHODS: This is a retrospective case-control study comparing birth outcomes of primiparous female elite athletes engaging in high-impact and low-impact sports compared with non-athletic controls. The athletes had prior to birth competed at a national team level or equivalent. Participant characteristics and frequency of training for at least 3\u2009years before a first pregnancy were collected via a self-administered questionnaire. Information on delivery outcome was retrieved from the Icelandic Medical Birth Registry. RESULTS: In total, 248 participated, 118 controls, 41 low-impact and 89 high-impact elite athletes. No significant differences were found between the groups with regard to incidence of emergency caesarean section or length of the first and second stages of labour. The incidence of third-degree to fourth-degree perineal tears was significantly higher (23.7%) among low-impact athletes than in the high-impact group (5.1%, p=0.01), but no significant differences were seen when the athletes were compared with the controls (12%; p=0.09 for low-impact and p=0.12 for high-impact athletes). CONCLUSION: Participation in competitive sports at the elite level was not related to adverse delivery outcome, including length of labour, the need for caesarean section during delivery and severe perineal tears.

        "Marijuana Use in Pregnancy and While Breastfeeding. The prevalence and perceived safety of marijuana use in pregnancy are increasing with expanding legalization. Marijuana crosses the placenta and passes into breast milk, resulting in fetal and neonatal exposure. Many women cite medical reasons for prenatal marijuana use such as nausea and vomiting of pregnancy, anxiety, and chronic pain. The scientific literature regarding marijuana in pregnancy is mixed, resulting in confusion among practitioners as to how to counsel women about risks of use. In addition, there is a paucity of literature related to marijuana use and breastfeeding. Existing pregnancy studies are predominantly retrospective cohorts with a reliance on self-report for ascertainment of exposure, which underestimates use. Many studies fail to adjust for important confounding factors such as tobacco use and sociodemographic differences. Despite the limitations of the existing evidence, there are animal and human data suggesting potential harm of cannabis use. The harms are biologically plausible given the role of the endocannabinoid system in pregnancy implantation, placentation, and fetal neurologic development. Two recent systematic reviews and meta-analyses found an association between marijuana use and adverse perinatal outcomes, especially with heavy marijuana use. In addition, three longitudinal cohort studies demonstrate a possible effect of prenatal marijuana exposure on long-term neurobehavioral outcomes. Marijuana use may be associated with growth restriction, stillbirth, spontaneous preterm birth, and neonatal intensive care unit admission. Therefore, women should be advised to refrain from using marijuana during pregnancy and lactation. ",
        "Mediterranean-style diet in pregnant women with metabolic risk factors (ESTEEM): A pragmatic multicentre randomised trial. BACKGROUND: Pregnant women with metabolic risk factors are at high risk of complications. We aimed to assess whether a Mediterranean-style diet reduces adverse pregnancy outcomes in high-risk women. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We conducted a multicentre randomised trial in 5 maternity units (4 in London and 1 in Birmingham) between 12 September 2014 and 29 February 2016. We randomised inner-city pregnant women with metabolic risk factors (obesity, chronic hypertension, or hypertriglyceridaemia) to a Mediterranean-style diet with high intake of nuts, extra virgin olive oil, fruits, vegetables, nonrefined grains, and legumes; moderate to high consumption of fish; low to moderate intake of poultry and dairy products; low intake of red and processed meat; and avoidance of sugary drinks, fast food, and food rich in animal fat versus usual care. Participants received individualised dietary advice at 18, 20, and 28 weeks' gestation. The primary endpoints were composite maternal (gestational diabetes or preeclampsia) and composite offspring (stillbirth, small for gestational age, or admission to neonatal care unit) outcomes prioritised by a Delphi survey. We used an intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis with multivariable models and identified the stratification variables and prognostic factors a priori. We screened 7,950 and randomised 1,252 women. Baseline data were available for 593 women in the intervention (93.3% follow-up, 553/593) and 612 in the control (95.6% follow-up, 585/612) groups. Over a quarter of randomised women were primigravida (330/1,205; 27%), 60% (729/1,205) were of Black or Asian ethnicity, and 69% (836/1,205) were obese. Women in the intervention arm consumed more nuts (70.1% versus 22.9%; adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 6.8, 95% confidence interval [CI] 4.3-10.6, p \u2264 0.001) and extra virgin olive oil (93.2% versus 49.0%; aOR 32.2, 95% CI 16.0-64.6, p \u2264 0.001) than controls; increased their intake of fish (p < 0.001), white meat (p < 0.001), and pulses (p = 0.05); and reduced their intake of red meat (p < 0.001), butter, margarine, and cream (p < 0.001). There was no significant reduction in the composite maternal (22.8% versus 28.6%; aOR 0.76, 95% CI 0.56-1.03, p = 0.08) or composite offspring (17.3% versus 20.9%; aOR 0.79, 95% CI 0.58-1.08, p = 0.14) outcomes. There was an apparent reduction in the odds of gestational diabetes by 35% (aOR 0.65, 95% CI 0.47-0.91, p = 0.01) but not in other individual components of the composite outcomes. Mothers gained less gestational weight (mean 6.8 versus 8.3 kg; adjusted difference -1.2 Kg, 95% CI -2.2 to -0.2, p = 0.03) with intervention versus control. There was no difference in any of the other maternal and offspring complications between both groups. When we pooled findings from the Effect of Simple, Targeted Diet in Pregnant Women With Metabolic Risk Factors on Pregnancy Outcomes (ESTEEM) trial with similar trials using random effects meta-analysis, we observed a significant reduction in gestational diabetes (odds ratio [OR] 0.67, 95% CI 0.53-0.84, I2 = 0%), with no heterogeneity (2 trials, 2,397 women). The study's limitations include the use of participant reported tools for adherence to the intervention instead of objective biomarkers. CONCLUSIONS: A simple, individualised, Mediterranean-style diet in pregnancy did not reduce the overall risk of adverse maternal and offspring complications but has the potential to reduce gestational weight gain and the risk of gestational diabetes.

        "Is infant neural sensitivity to vocal emotion associated with mother-infant relational experience?. An early understanding of others' vocal emotions provides infants with a distinct advantage for eliciting appropriate care from caregivers and for navigating their social world. Consistent with this notion, an emerging literature suggests that a temporal cortical response to the prosody of emotional speech is observable in the first year of life. Furthermore, neural specialisation to vocal emotion in infancy may vary according to early experience. Neural sensitivity to emotional non-speech vocalisations was investigated in 29 six-month-old infants using near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). Both angry and happy vocalisations evoked increased activation in the temporal cortices (relative to neutral and angry vocalisations respectively), and the strength of the angry minus neutral effect was positively associated with the degree of directiveness in the mothers' play interactions with their infant. This first fNIRS study of infant vocal emotion processing implicates bilateral temporal mechanisms similar to those found in adults and suggests that infants who experience more directive caregiving or social play may more strongly or preferentially process vocal anger by six months of age.

        "Dietary guideline adherence during preconception and pregnancy: A systematic review. The aim of this study is to determine the level of adherence to dietary guidelines among men and women during preconception, and pregnant women, and factors associated with adherence. Searches were conducted in CINAHL, AMED, EMBASE, and Maternity and Infant Care from inception to March 2018. Observational studies assessing the primary outcome (adherence to dietary guidelines and/or nutritional recommendations) and/or secondary outcome (factors associated with adherence) were eligible. Study quality was assessed using the National Institutes of Health Quality Assessment Tool for Observational Cohort and Cross-sectional studies. Men or women (aged \u226518 years) who identified as trying/intending to conceive or were pregnant. Eighteen studies were included. The quality of studies was fair (44%) to good (56%). Most studies indicated preconceptual and pregnant women do not meet recommendations for vegetable, cereal grain, or folate intake. Pregnant women did not meet iron or calcium intake requirements in 91% and 55% of included studies, respectively, and also exceeded fat intake recommendations in 55% of included studies. Higher level education was associated with improved guideline adherence in pregnant women, whereas older age and non-smoking status were associated with greater guideline adherence in preconceptual and pregnant women. The findings of this review suggest that preconceptual and pregnant women may not be meeting the minimum requirements stipulated in dietary guidelines and/or nutritional recommendations. This could have potential adverse consequences for pregnancy and birth outcomes and the health of the offspring. Major knowledge gaps identified in this review, which warrant further investigation, are the dietary intakes of men during preconception, and the predictors of guideline adherence. ",
        "Early life exposure to famine and reproductive aging among Chinese women. OBJECTIVE: To assess the effect of early life exposure to famine, as endured during 1959 to 1961 in China, on reproductive aging in adult women. METHODS: Between 2011 and 2012, 2,868 women born around the Chinese famine period (1956-1964) were enrolled in this study from three communities in China. Age at natural menopause was obtained retrospectively from a structured questionnaire. The associations of early life famine exposure with reproductive aging during adulthood were estimated, with adjustment of socioeconomic status, lifestyle factors, and body mass index. RESULTS: Women exposed to prenatal famine had a higher risk of early menopause (ie, natural menopause <45 years, odds ratio: 1.59, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.07, 2.36), and a nonsignificant trend of higher risk of premature ovarian failure (ie, natural menopause <40 y, odds ratio: 1.94, 95% CI: 0.93, 4.00), compared to unexposed women. Exposure to famine during childhood was not significantly associated with reproductive aging. In a secondary analysis focusing on the fetal exposure, prenatal famine exposure was associated with a higher risk of premature ovarian failure (odds ratio: 2.07, 95% CI: 1.08, 3.87), and a nonsignificant trend of higher risk of early menopause (odds ratio: 1.37, 95% CI: 0.98, 1.91), compared to those unexposed to prenatal famine. CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed that fetal exposure to famine was associated with an increased risk of early menopause. Such findings provided evidence in favor of the thrifty phenotype theory in reproductive aging and helped better understand the etiology of early menopause. ",
        "Awareness of fetal movements and care package to reduce fetal mortality (AFFIRM): a stepped wedge, cluster-randomised trial. BACKGROUND: 2\u00b76 million pregnancies were estimated to have ended in stillbirth in 2015. The aim of the AFFIRM study was to test the hypothesis that introduction of a reduced fetal movement (RFM), care package for pregnant women and clinicians that increased women's awareness of the need for prompt reporting of RFM and that standardised management, including timely delivery, would alter the incidence of stillbirth. METHODS: This stepped wedge, cluster-randomised trial was done in the UK and Ireland. Participating maternity hospitals were grouped and randomised, using a computer-generated allocation scheme, to one of nine intervention implementation dates (at 3 month intervals). This date was concealed from clusters and the trial team until 3 months before the implementation date. Each participating hospital had three observation periods: a control period from Jan 1, 2014, until randomised date of intervention initiation; a washout period from the implementation date and for 2 months; and the intervention period from the end of the washout period until Dec 31, 2016. Treatment allocation was not concealed from participating women and caregivers. Data were derived from observational maternity data. The primary outcome was incidence of stillbirth. The primary analysis was done according to the intention-to-treat principle, with births analysed according to whether they took place during the control or intervention periods, irrespective of whether the intervention had been implemented as planned. This study is registered with www.ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01777022. FINDINGS: 37 hospitals were enrolled in the study. Four hospitals declined participation, and 33 hospitals were randomly assigned to an intervention implementation date. Between Jan 1, 2014, and Dec, 31, 2016, data were collected from 409\u2008175 pregnancies (157\u2008692 deliveries during the control period, 23\u2008623 deliveries in the washout period, and 227\u2008860 deliveries in the intervention period). The incidence of stillbirth was 4\u00b740 per 1000 births during the control period and 4\u00b706 per 1000 births in the intervention period (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 0\u00b790, 95% CI 0\u00b775-1\u00b707; p=0\u00b723). INTERPRETATION: The RFM care package did not reduce the risk of stillbirths. The benefits of a policy that promotes awareness of RFM remains unproven.

        "Outcomes of infants born to women with influenza A(H1N1)pdm09. BACKGROUND: Pregnant women with influenza are more likely to have complications, but information on infant outcomes is limited. METHODS: Five state/local health departments collected data on outcomes of infants born to pregnant women with 2009 H1N1 influenza reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from April to December 2009. Collaborating sites linked information on pregnant women with confirmed 2009 H1N1 influenza, many who were severely ill, to their infants' birth certificates. Collaborators also collected birth certificate data from two comparison groups that were matched with H1N1-affected pregnancies on month of conception, sex, and county of residence. RESULTS: 490 pregnant women with influenza, 1,451 women without reported influenza with pregnancies in the same year, and 1,446 pregnant women without reported influenza with prior year pregnancies were included. Women with 2009 H1N1 influenza admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU; n\u2009=\u200964) were more likely to deliver preterm infants (<37\u2009weeks), low birth weight infants, and infants with Apgar scores <=6 at 5 min than women in comparison groups (adjusted relative risk, aRR\u2009=\u20093.9 [2.7, 5.6], aRR\u2009=\u20094.6 [2.9, 7.5], and aRR\u2009=\u20098.7 [3.6, 21.2], for same year comparisons, respectively). Women with influenza who were not hospitalized and hospitalized women not admitted to the ICU did not have significantly elevated risks for adverse infant outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Severely ill women with 2009 H1N1 influenza during pregnancy were more likely to have adverse birth outcomes than women without influenza, providing more support for influenza vaccination during pregnancy.

        "Associations between low- and high-dose oral fluconazole and pregnancy outcomes: 3 nested case-control studies. BACKGROUND: While topical azoles are the first-line treatment for fungal infections, oral fluconazole is frequently used during pregnancy. We aimed to assess the effect of exposure to low and high doses of fluconazole during pregnancy on the occurrence of spontaneous abortions, major congenital malformations and stillbirths. METHODS: Within the Quebec Pregnancy Cohort (1998-2015), we identified women exposed to low- (\u2264 150 mg) and high-dose (> 150 mg) fluconazole, and women who were not exposed. For each case of spontaneous abortion or stillbirth, up to 5 controls were randomly selected using an incidence density sampling method matched on gestational age at diagnosis of spontaneous abortion or stillbirth (index date) and the year of the last menstrual period. For cases of major congenital malformation, we considered all liveborn babies as controls. Generalized estimation equation models were used to analyze the 3 main outcomes separately. RESULTS: Within a cohort of 441 949 pregnancies, 320 868 pregnancies were included in the analyses of spontaneous abortions, 226 599 of major congenital malformations and 7832 of stillbirths. Most (69.5%) women exposed to fluconazole in pregnancy received the common single therapeutic dose of 150 mg (low dose); the remainder received a dose of > 150 mg (high dose). Use of oral fluconazole during early pregnancy was associated with an increased risk of spontaneous abortion compared with no exposure (adjusted odds ratio [OR] for 345 cases exposed to low-dose treatment 2.23, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.96-2.54; adjusted OR for 249 cases exposed to high-dose treatment 3.20, 95% CI 2.73-3.75). Exposure to fluconazole during the first trimester did not increase the risk of overall major congenital malformations; however, exposure to a high dose during the first trimester was associated with an increased risk of cardiac septal closure anomalies (adjusted OR 1.81, 95% CI 1.04-3.14; 13 exposed cases) compared with no exposure. No association was found between exposure to fluconazole during pregnancy and the risk of stillbirth. INTERPRETATION: Any maternal exposure to fluconazole during pregnancy may increase risk of spontaneous abortion and doses higher than 150 mg during the first trimester may increase risk of cardiac septal closure anomalies.

        "Residence change during the first trimester of pregnancy and adverse birth outcomes. BACKGROUND: There are few published studies evaluating the impact of perinatal residence change on infant outcomes and whether these associations differ by socioeconomic status. METHODS: We conducted a population-based cohort study using Washington State birth certificate data from 2007 to 2014 to assess whether women who moved during the first trimester of pregnancy (n=28\u2009011) had a higher risk of low birth weight, preterm birth and small for gestational age than women who did not move during the first trimester (n=112\u2009367). 'Non-first-trimester movers' were frequency matched 4:1 to movers by year. We used generalised linear models to calculate risk ratios and risk differences adjusted for maternal age, race, marital status, parity, education, smoking, income and insurance payer for the birth. We also stratified analyses by variables related to socioeconomic status to see whether associations differed across socioeconomic strata. RESULTS: Moving in the first trimester was associated with an increased risk of low birth weight (6.4% vs 4.5%, adjusted risk ratio 1.37 (95% CI 1.29 to 1.45)) and preterm birth (9.1% vs 6.4%, adjusted risk ratio 1.42 (95% CI 1.36 to 1.49)) and a slight increased risk of small for gestational age (9.8% vs 8.7%, adjusted risk ratio 1.09 (95% CI 1.00 to 1.09)). Residence change was associated with low birth weight and preterm birth in all socioeconomic strata. CONCLUSION: Moving during the first trimester of pregnancy may be a risk factor for adverse birth outcomes in US women. Healthcare providers may want to consider screening for plans to move and offering support. ",
        "Preeclampsia and risk of end stage kidney disease: A Swedish nationwide cohort study. BACKGROUND: Preeclampsia has been suggested to increase the risk of end-stage kidney disease (ESKD); however, most studies were unable to adjust for potential confounders including pre-existing comorbidities such as renal disease and cardiovascular disease (CVD). We aimed to examine the association between preeclampsia and the risk of ESKD in healthy women, while taking into account pre-existing comorbidity and potential confounders. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Using data from the Swedish Medical Birth Register (MBR), women who had singleton live births in Sweden between 1982 and 2012, including those who had preeclampsia, were identified. Women with a diagnosis of chronic kidney disease (CKD), CVD, hypertension, or diabetes prior to the first pregnancy were excluded. The outcome was a diagnosis of ESKD, identified from the Swedish Renal Registry (SRR) from January 1, 1991, onwards along with the specified cause of renal disease. We conducted Cox proportional hazards regression analysis to examine the association between preeclampsia and ESKD adjusting for several potential confounders: maternal age, body mass index (BMI), education, native country, and smoking. This analysis accounts for differential follow-up among women because women had different lengths of follow-up time. We performed subgroup analyses according to preterm preeclampsia, small for gestational age (SGA), and women who had 2 pregnancies with preeclampsia in both. The cohort consisted of 1,366,441 healthy women who had 2,665,320 singleton live births in Sweden between 1982 and 2012. At the first pregnancy, women's mean (SD) age and BMI were 27.8 (5.13) and 23.4 (4.03), respectively, 15.2% were smokers, and 80.7% were native Swedish. The overall median (interquartile range [IQR]) follow-up was 7.4 years (3.2-17.4) and 16.4 years (10.3-22.0) among women with ESKD diagnosis. During the study period, 67,273 (4.9%) women having 74,648 (2.8% of all pregnancies) singleton live births had preeclampsia, and 410 women developed ESKD with an incidence rate of 1.85 per 100,000 person-years. There was an association between preeclampsia and ESKD in the unadjusted analysis (hazard ratio [HR] = 4.99, 95% confidence interval [CI] 3.93-6.33; p < 0.001), which remained in the extensively adjusted (HR = 4.96, 95% CI 3.89-6.32, p < 0.001) models. Women who had preterm preeclampsia (adjusted HR = 9.19; 95% CI 5.16-15.61, p < 0.001) and women who had preeclampsia in 2 pregnancies (adjusted HR = 7.13, 95% CI 3.12-16.31, p < 0.001) had the highest risk of ESKD compared with women with no preeclampsia. Considering this was an observational cohort study, and although we accounted for several potential confounders, residual confounding cannot be ruled out. CONCLUSIONS: The present findings suggest that women with preeclampsia and no major comorbidities before their first pregnancy are at a 5-fold increased risk of ESKD compared with parous women with no preeclampsia; however, the absolute risk of ESKD among women with preeclampsia remains small. Preeclampsia should be considered as an important risk factor for subsequent ESKD. Whether screening and/or preventive strategies will reduce the risk of ESKD in women with adverse pregnancy outcomes is worthy of further investigation. ",
        "Night work and miscarriage: a Danish nationwide register-based cohort study. OBJECTIVE: Observational studies indicate an association between working nights and miscarriage, but inaccurate exposure assessment precludes causal inference. Using payroll data with exact and prospective measurement of night work, the objective was to investigate whether working night shifts during pregnancy increases the risk of miscarriage. METHODS: A cohort of 22 744 pregnant women was identified by linking the Danish Working Hour Database (DWHD), which holds payroll data on all Danish public hospital employees, with Danish national registers on births and admissions to hospitals (miscarriage). The risk of miscarriage during pregnancy weeks 4-22 according to measures of night work was analysed using Cox regression with time-varying exposure adjusted for a fixed set of potential confounders. RESULTS: In total 377 896 pregnancy weeks (average 19.7) were available for follow-up. Women who had two or more night shifts the previous week had an increased risk of miscarriage after pregnancy week 8 (HR 1.32 (95% CI 1.07 to 1.62) compared with women, who did not work night shifts. The cumulated number of night shifts during pregnancy weeks 3-21 increased the risk of miscarriages in a dose-dependent pattern. CONCLUSIONS: The study corroborates earlier findings that night work during pregnancy may confer an increased risk of miscarriage and indicates a lowest observed threshold level of two night shifts per week.

        "Peripartum Outcomes Before and After Hurricane Harvey. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association between Hurricane Harvey landfall with maternal and neonatal morbidity. METHODS: Using an institutional perinatal database from two hospitals in Houston, Texas, women with nonanomalous singletons delivering after 24 weeks of gestation between August 2011 and June 2018 were included. To evaluate the possible association of hurricane landfall with pregnancy outcomes, gravid women delivering within 280 days (40 weeks of gestation) on or after August 25, 2017 (the day of hurricane landfall) were categorized as exposed, and women who delivered before August 25, 2017, were the reference group. Composite maternal morbidity included any of the following: hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, chorioamnionitis, endometritis, blood transfusion, peripartum hysterectomy, maternal critical care admission, pulmonary edema, or maternal death. Composite neonatal morbidity included any of the following: 5-minute Apgar score 3 or less, respiratory distress syndrome, use of ventilator or continuous positive airway pressure, suspected newborn sepsis, seizure, stillbirth, or neonatal death. Adjusted odds ratios (aORs) were calculated after correcting for possible confounders identified on univariate analysis. Disruption in outcome trends were measured in time series analyses. RESULTS: Of 40,502 deliveries in our database, 29,179 (72%) met the inclusion criteria, with 3,842 (13.2%) delivering within 280 days of Hurricane Harvey landfall. Women delivering after Hurricane Harvey were on average less likely to be obese and more likely to be older, Caucasian, married, have a household income higher than $75,000, a high school education, and private insurance. However, compared with the cohort of gravid patients who delivered before Hurricane Harvey, composite maternal morbidity increased by 27% (11.5% vs 14.7%, aOR 1.27, 95% CI 1.14-1.42) after the storm. Composite neonatal morbidity increased by 50% (7.8% vs 11.9%, aOR 1.52, 95% CI 1.34-1.71). In time series analyses, we observed a significant shift in composite maternal morbidity specific to women of low socioeconomic status (estimate 2.87, P=.028). CONCLUSION: Despite having fewer at-risk baseline characteristics, gravid patients delivering after landfall by Hurricane Harvey had a significantly higher likelihood of adverse outcomes as did their neonates.

        "Screen-time is associated with inattention problems in preschoolers: Results from the CHILD birth cohort study. BACKGROUND: Pre-school children spend an average of two-hours daily using screens. We examined associations between screen-time on pre-school behavior using data from the Canadian Healthy Infant Longitudinal Development (CHILD) study. METHODS: CHILD participant parents completed the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) at five-years of age. Parents reported their child's total screen-time including gaming and mobile devices. Screen-time was categorized using the recommended threshold of two-hours/day for five-years or one-hour/day for three-years. Multiple linear regression examined associations between screen-time and externalizing behavior (e.g. inattention and aggression). Multiple logistic regression identified characteristics of children at risk for clinically significant externalizing problems (CBCL T-score\u226565). RESULTS: Screen-time was available for over 95% of children (2,322/2,427) with CBCL data. Mean screen-time was 1\u00b74 hours/day (95%CI 1\u00b74, 1\u00b75) at five-years and 1\u00b75 hours/day (95%CI: 1\u00b75, 1\u00b76) at three-years. Compared to children with less than 30-minutes/day screen-time, those watching more than two-hours/day (13\u00b77%) had a 2\u00b72-point increase in externalizing T-score (95%CI: 0\u00b79, 3\u00b75, p\u22640\u00b7001); a five-fold increased odd for reporting clinically significant externalizing problems (95%CI: 1\u00b70, 25\u00b70, p = 0\u00b705); and were 5\u00b79 times more likely to report clinically significant inattention problems (95%CI: 1\u00b76, 21\u00b75, p = 0\u00b701). Children with a DSM-5 ADHD T-score above the 65 clinical cut-off were considered to have significant ADHD type symptoms (n = 24). Children with more than 2-hours of screen-time/day had a 7\u00b77-fold increased risk of meeting criteria for ADHD (95%CI: 1\u00b76, 38\u00b71, p = 0\u00b701). There was no significant association between screen-time and aggressive behaviors (p>0.05). CONCLUSION: Increased screen-time in pre-school is associated with worse inattention problems. ",
        "Cross-sectional and Prospective Associations of Actigraphy-Assessed Sleep Regularity With Metabolic Abnormalities: The Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis. OBJECTIVE: To cross-sectionally and prospectively investigate the association between irregular sleep patterns, a potential marker for circadian disruption, and metabolic abnormalities. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis, participants completed 7-day actigraphy at exam 5 (2010-2013) and were prospectively followed throughout exam 6 (2016 to 2017). Sleep regularity was quantified by the 7-day SD of actigraphy-assessed sleep duration and sleep onset timing. Metabolic abnormalities were defined by 1) the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III criteria and 2) a data-driven clustering of metabolic factors. RESULTS: In the exam 5 cross-sectional analysis adjusted for sociodemographic and lifestyle factors (n = 2,003), every 1-h increase in the sleep duration SD was associated with 27% (95% CI 1.10, 1.47) higher odds of metabolic syndrome, and every 1-h increase in the sleep timing SD was associated with 23% (95% CI 1.06, 1.42) higher odds. The associations remained significant with additional adjustment for sleep-related factors including sleep duration. In the prospective analysis (n = 970), the corresponding fully adjusted odds ratio (OR) was 1.27 (95% CI 0.97, 1.65) for sleep duration and 1.36 (1.03, 1.80) for sleep timing. Compared with the cluster of few metabolic changes, every 1-h increase in sleep variability was associated with almost doubled odds for the cluster characterized by incidence of multiple metabolic abnormalities (OR 1.97 [95% CI 1.18, 3.30] for sleep duration and OR 2.10 [95% CI 1.25, 3.53] for sleep timing). CONCLUSIONS: Increased variability in sleep duration and timing was associated with higher prevalence and incidence of metabolic abnormalities even after consideration of sleep duration and other lifestyle factors.

        "Speech-based markers for posttraumatic stress disorder in US veterans. BACKGROUND: The diagnosis of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is usually based on clinical interviews or self-report measures. Both approaches are subject to under- and over-reporting of symptoms. An objective test is lacking. We have developed a classifier of PTSD based on objective speech-marker features that discriminate PTSD cases from controls. METHODS: Speech samples were obtained from warzone-exposed veterans, 52 cases with PTSD and 77 controls, assessed with the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale. Individuals with major depressive disorder (MDD) were excluded. Audio recordings of clinical interviews were used to obtain 40,526 speech features which were input to a random forest (RF) algorithm. RESULTS: The selected RF used 18 speech features and the receiver operating characteristic curve had an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.954. At a probability of PTSD cut point of 0.423, Youden's index was 0.787, and overall correct classification rate was 89.1%. The probability of PTSD was higher for markers that indicated slower, more monotonous speech, less change in tonality, and less activation. Depression symptoms, alcohol use disorder, and TBI did not meet statistical tests to be considered confounders. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that a speech-based algorithm can objectively differentiate PTSD cases from controls. The RF classifier had a high AUC. Further validation in an independent sample and appraisal of the classifier to identify those with MDD only compared with those with PTSD comorbid with MDD is required. ",
        "Suicidal thought and behavior in individuals with restless legs syndrome. BACKGROUND: Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is associated with an unrelenting urge to move at night, which can cause chronic sleeplessness, depression, and despondency; thus increasing risk of suicide. We aimed to determine frequency of suicidal ideation and behavior in RLS. METHODS: RLS and control participants were recruited through community and RLS Foundation advertisements. RLS diagnosis was confirmed using the Cambridge-Hopkins RLS Questionnaire and severity was assessed using the International RLS Study Group Severity Scale (IRLSS). Lifetime suicidal ideation (plan) and behavior (attempt) was assessed using the Suicidal Behavior Questionnaire-revised. The Brief Lifetime Depression Scale evaluated lifetime depression history. Forward stepwise logistic regression determined the odds of suicidal ideation or behavior. RESULTS: In this study, 192 RLS and 158 control participants were comparable for age, sex, race, and other potential demographic confounders. In general, RLS was moderate-to-severe (mean IRLSS 26.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a07.5). Significantly more RLS than control participants had lifetime suicidal ideation or behavior (27.1% vs. 7.0%; p\u00a0<\u00a00.00001) or lifetime depression history (65.6%% vs. 22.8%; p\u00a0<\u00a00.00001). The odds of having a lifetime suicidal ideation or behavior was higher in those with RLS [2.80 (1.29,6.11)], even after accounting for depression and other confounders. In RLS, the odds of lifetime suicidal ideation or behavior was increased if there was lifetime depression [7.37 (2.65,20.47)] or if RLS in the past was severe or very severe [2.36 (1.03,5.40)]. CONCLUSIONS: Lifetime suicidal ideation or behavior is prevalent in RLS sufferers, and its likelihood is dependent on RLS severity and depression history. ",
        "Is running associated with a lower risk of all-cause, cardiovascular and cancer mortality, and is the more the better? A systematic review and meta-analysis. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association of running participation and the dose of running with the risk of all-cause, cardiovascular and cancer mortality. DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis. DATA SOURCES: Journal articles, conference papers and doctoral theses indexed in Academic Search Ultimate, CINAHL, Health Source: Nursing/Academic Edition, MasterFILE Complete, Networked Digital Library of Theses and Dissertations, Open Access Theses and Dissertations, PsycINFO, PubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus, SPORTDiscus and Web of Science. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR SELECTING STUDIES: Prospective cohort studies on the association between running or jogging participation and the risk of all-cause, cardiovascular and/or cancer mortality in a non-clinical population of adults were included. RESULTS: Fourteen studies from six prospective cohorts with a pooled sample of 232\u2009149 participants were included. In total, 25\u2009951 deaths were recorded during 5.5-35\u2009year follow-ups. Our meta-analysis showed that running participation is associated with 27%, 30% and 23% lower risk of all-cause (pooled adjusted hazard ratio (HR)=0.73; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.68 to 0.79), cardiovascular (HR=0.70; 95%\u2009CI 0.49 to 0.98) and cancer (HR=0.77; 95%\u2009CI 0.68 to 0.87) mortality, respectively, compared with no running. A meta-regression analysis showed no significant dose-response trends for weekly frequency, weekly duration, pace and the total volume of running. CONCLUSION: Increased rates of participation in running, regardless of its dose, would probably lead to substantial improvements in population health and longevity. Any amount of running, even just once a week, is better than no running, but higher doses of running may not necessarily be associated with greater mortality benefits. ",
        "Effects of moderately increased testosterone concentration on physical performance in young women: a double blind, randomised, placebo controlled study. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of a moderate increase in serum testosterone on physical performance in young, physically active, healthy women. METHODS: A double blind, randomised, placebo controlled trial was conducted between May 2017 and June 2018 (ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT03210558). 48 healthy, physically active women aged 18-35 years were randomised to 10 weeks of treatment with 10\u2009mg of testosterone cream daily or placebo (1:1). All participants completed the study. The primary outcome measure was aerobic performance measured by running time to exhaustion (TTE). Secondary outcomes were anaerobic performance (Wingate test) and muscle strength (squat jump (SJ), counter movement jump (CMJ) and knee extension peak torque). Hormone levels were analysed and body composition assessed by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry. RESULTS: Serum levels of testosterone increased from 0.9 (0.4) nmol/L to 4.3 (2.8) nmol/L in the testosterone supplemented group. TTE increased significantly by 21.17\u2009s (8.5%) in the testosterone group compared with the placebo group (mean difference 15.5\u2009s; P=0.045). Wingate average power, which increased by 15.2 W in the testosterone group compared with 3.2 W in the placebo group, was not significantly different between the groups (P=0.084). There were no significant changes in CMJ, SJ and knee extension. Mean change from baseline in total lean mass was 923\u2009g for the testosterone group and 135\u2009g for the placebo group (P=0.040). Mean change in lean mass in the lower limbs was 398\u2009g and 91\u2009g, respectively (P=0.041). CONCLUSION: The study supports a causal effect of testosterone in the increase in aerobic running time as well as lean mass in young, physically active women. ",
        "Burden of Sciatica on US Medicare Recipients. OBJECTIVE: This study evaluates the disease burden of sciatica on the US Medicare cohort. BACKGROUND DATA: Sciatica is a common disability that has important physical, mental, and economic effects. The Medicare Health Outcomes Survey (HOS) is a demographic and outcomes survey used to monitor the performance of Medicare Advantage health plans in the United States. The HOS includes data on demographics, chronic medical conditions, and patient-reported outcomes. METHODS: Medicare HOS data for cohorts from 2007 to 2013 were obtained. Patients were placed into two categories based on the survey results: with or without a history of sciatica. Baseline demographics, chronic medical conditions, and physical health symptoms were aggregated. In addition, average VR-12 physical component summary and mental component summary scores were calculated for each group at baseline and at 2-year follow-up. A Fisher exact test was used to assess significance for categorical variables, and a t-test was used for continuous variables. VR-12 changes as small as 1 to 2 units have been found to be clinically and socially relevant. RESULTS: The baseline cohort data of 1,000,952 patients yielded 250,869 patients (25%) who reported the diagnosis of sciatica, compared with 750,083 patients (75%) without sciatica. Patients with a history of sciatica tended to be younger, less educated, and notably with more medical comorbidities. Physical component summary outcomes were approximately 8 units lower in the sciatica group at baseline and 7 units lower at 2-year follow-up. Mental component summary outcomes were 6 units lower in the sciatica group at baseline and 5 units lower at 2-year follow-up. CONCLUSION: A large percentage of the US Medicare cohort suffers from symptomatic sciatica. Our study identified a 25% prevalence in the Medicare cohort. In addition, sciatica is associated with an increased incidence of comorbid medical conditions and poor health-related quality of life. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level III STUDY DESIGN:: Observational-Cohort Study. ",
        "The e-merging e-pidemic of e-scooters. Introduction: Since their release in 2017, standing electric motorized scooters (eScooters) have risen in popularity as an alternative mode of transportation. We sought to examine the incidence of injury, injury patterns, prevalence of helmet and drug and alcohol use in eScooter trauma. Methods: This was a multi-institutional retrospective case series of patients admitted for injuries related to operation of an eScooter following the widespread release of these devices in September 2017 (September 1, 2017 to October 31, 2018). Demographics, drug and alcohol use, helmet use, admission vitals, injuries, procedures, hospital and intensive care unit length of stay (LOS), death, and disposition were analyzed. Results: 103 patients were admitted during the study period, and monthly admissions increased significantly over time. Patients were young men (mean age 37.1 years; 65% male), 98% were not wearing a helmet. Median LOS was 1\u2009day (IQR 1-3). 79% of patients were tested for alcohol and 48% had a blood alcohol level >80 mg/dL. 60% of patients had a urine toxicology screen, of which 52% were positive. Extremity fractures were the most frequent injury (42%), followed by facial fractures (26%) and intracranial hemorrhage (18%). Median Injury Severity Score was 5.5 (IQR 5-9). One-third of patients (n=34) required an operative intervention, the majority of which were open fixations of extremity and facial fractures. No patients died during the study. The majority of patients were discharged home (86%). Conclusion: eScooter-related trauma has significantly increased over time. Alcohol and illicit substance use among these patients was common, and helmet use was extremely rare. Significant injuries including intracranial hemorrhage and fractures requiring operative intervention were present in over half (51%) of patients. Interventions aimed at increasing helmet use and discouraging eScooter operation while intoxicated are necessary to reduce the burden of eScooter-related trauma. Level of evidence: Level IV. ",
        "Health outcomes associated with emergency department visits by adolescents for self-harm: a propensity-matched cohort study. BACKGROUND: Self-harm is increasing among adolescents, and because of changing behaviours, current data are needed on the consequences of self-harm. We sought to investigate the trends related to hospital presentation, readmission, patient outcome and medical costs in adolescents who presented with self-harm to the emergency department. METHODS: We used administrative data on 403 805 adolescents aged 13-17 years presenting to Ontario emergency departments in 2011-2013. Adolescents with self-harm visits were 1:2 propensity matched to controls with visits without self-harm, using demographic, mental health and other clinical variables. Five years after the index presentation, hospital or emergency department admission rates for self-harm, overall mortality, suicides and conservative cost estimates were compared between the 2 groups. RESULTS: Of 5832 adolescents who visited Ontario emergency departments in 2011-2013 after self-harm (1.4% of visits), 5661 were matched to 10 731 adolescents who presented for reasons other than self-harm. Adolescents who presented with self-harm had a shorter time to a repeat emergency department or hospital admission for self-harm (hazard ratio [HR] 4.84, 95% confidence interval [CI] 4.44-5.27), more suicides (HR 7.96, 95% CI 4.00-15.86), and higher overall mortality (HR 3.23, 95% CI 2.12-4.93; p < 0.001). The positive predictive value of self-harm-related emergency department visits for suicide was 0.7%. Adolescents with self-harm visits had mean 5-year estimates of health care costs of $30 388 compared with $19 055 for controls (p < 0.001). INTERPRETATION: Adolescents with emergency department visits for self-harm have higher rates of mortality, suicide and recurrent self-harm, as well as higher health care costs, than matched controls. Development of algorithms and interventions that can identify and help adolescents at highest risk of recurrent self-harm is warranted. ",
        "Sleep problems and risk of all-cause cognitive decline or dementia: an updated systematic review and meta-analysis. OBJECTIVES: To conduct an updated systematic review and meta-analysis of association between sleep and all-cause cognitive disorders. METHODS: PubMed and EMBASE were searched from inception to 18 February 2019. Cohort studies exploring longitudinal associations of sleep with cognitive decline or dementia were included. The multivariable-adjusted effect estimates were pooled by random-effects models, with credibility assessment. The robust error meta-regression model was used to conduct the dose-response meta-analysis for sleep duration. RESULTS: 11\u2009155 reports were searched and 51 eligible cohorts with 15 sleep problems were included for our meta-analyses. Ten types of sleep conditions or parameters, including six (insomnia, fragmentation, daytime dysfunction, prolonged latency, rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder and excessive time in bed) with moderate-to-high levels of evidence, were linked to higher risk of all-cause cognitive disorders. Furthermore, a U-shaped relationship was revealed for the associations with sleep duration. CONCLUSIONS: Sleep management might serve as a promising target for dementia prevention. ",
        "Oral isotretinoin for acne. BACKGROUND: Acne vulgaris, a chronic inflammatory disease of the pilosebaceous unit associated with socialisation and mental health problems, may affect more than 80% of teenagers. Isotretinoin is the only drug that targets all primary causal factors of acne; however, it may cause adverse effects. OBJECTIVES: To assess efficacy and safety of oral isotretinoin for acne vulgaris. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the following databases up to July 2017: the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO and LILACS. We updated this search in March 2018, but these results have not yet been incorporated in the review. We also searched five trial registries, checked the reference lists of retrieved studies for further references to relevant trials, and handsearched dermatology conference proceedings. A separate search for adverse effects of oral isotretinoin was undertaken in MEDLINE and Embase up to September 2013. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised clinical trials (RCTs) of oral isotretinoin in participants with clinically diagnosed acne compared against placebo, any other systemic or topical active therapy, and itself in different formulation, doses, regimens, or course duration. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. MAIN RESULTS: We included 31 RCTs, involving 3836 participants (12 to 55 years) with mild to severe acne. There were twice as many male participants as females.Most studies were undertaken in Asia, Europe, and North America. Outcomes were generally measured between eight to 32 weeks (mean 19.7 weeks) of therapy.Assessed comparisons included oral isotretinoin versus placebo or other treatments such as antibiotics. In addition, different doses, regimens, or formulations of oral isotretinoin were assessed, as well as oral isotretinoin with the addition of topical agents.Pharmaceutical companies funded 12 included trials. All, except three studies, had high risk of bias in at least one domain.Oral isotretinoin compared with oral antibiotics plus topical agentsThese studies included participants with moderate or severe acne and assessed outcomes immediately after 20 to 24 weeks of treatment (short-term). Three studies (400 participants) showed isotretinoin makes no difference in terms of decreasing trial investigator-assessed inflammatory lesion count (RR 1.01 95% CI 0.96 to 1.06), with only one serious adverse effect found, which was Stevens-Johnson syndrome in the isotretinoin group (RR 3.00, 95% CI 0.12 to 72.98). However, we are uncertain about these results as they were based on very low-quality evidence.Isotretinoin may slightly improve (by 15%) acne severity, assessed by physician's global evaluation (RR 1.15, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.32; 351 participants; 2 studies), but resulted in more less serious adverse effects (67% higher risk) (RR 1.67, 95% CI 1.42 to 1.98; 351 participants; 2 studies), such as dry lips/skin, cheilitis, vomiting, nausea (both outcomes, low-quality evidence).Different doses/therapeutic regimens of oral isotretinoinFor our primary efficacy outcome, we found three RCTs, but heterogeneity precluded meta-analysis. One study (154 participants) reported 79%, 80% and 84% decrease in total inflammatory lesion count after 20 weeks of 0.05, 0.1, or 0.2 mg/kg/d of oral isotretinoin for severe acne (low-quality evidence). Another trial (150 participants, severe acne) compared 0.1, 0.5, and 1 mg/kg/d oral isotretinoin for 20 weeks and, respectively, 58%, 80% and 90% of participants achieved 95% decrease in total inflammatory lesion count. One RCT, of participants with moderate acne, compared isotretinoin for 24 weeks at (a) continuous low dose (0.25 to 0.4 mg/kg/day), (b) continuous conventional dose (0.5 to 0.7 mg/kg/day), and (c) intermittent regimen (0.5 to 0.7 mg/kg/day, for one week in a month). Continuous low dose (MD 3.72 lesions; 95% CI 2.13 to 5.31; 40 participants; one study) and conventional dose (MD 3.87 lesions; 95% CI 2.31 to 5.43; 40 participants; one study) had a greater decrease in inflammatory lesion counts compared to intermittent treatment (all outcomes, low-quality evidence).Fourteen RCTs (906 participants, severe and moderate acne) reported that no serious adverse events were observed when comparing different doses/therapeutic regimens of oral isotretinoin during treatment (from 12 to 32 weeks) or follow-up after end of treatment (up to 48 weeks). Thirteen RCTs (858 participants) analysed frequency of less serious adverse effects, which included skin dryness, hair loss, and itching, but heterogeneity regarding the assessment of the outcome precluded data pooling; hence, there is uncertainty about the results (low- to very-low quality evidence, where assessed).Improvement in acne severity, assessed by physician's global evaluation, was not measured for this comparison.None of the included RCTs reported birth defects. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Evidence was low-quality for most assessed outcomes.We are unsure if isotretinoin improves acne severity compared with standard oral antibiotic and topical treatment when assessed by a decrease in total inflammatory lesion count, but it may slightly improve physician-assessed acne severity. Only one serious adverse event was reported in the isotretinoin group, which means we are uncertain of the risk of serious adverse effects; however, isotretinoin may result in more minor adverse effects.Heterogeneity in the studies comparing different regimens, doses, or formulations of oral isotretinoin meant we were unable to undertake meta-analysis. Daily treatment may be more effective than treatment for one week each month. None of the studies in this comparison reported serious adverse effects, or measured improvement in acne severity assessed by physician's global evaluation. We are uncertain if there is a difference in number of minor adverse effects, such as skin dryness, between doses/regimens.Evidence quality was lessened due to imprecision and attrition bias. Further studies should ensure clearly reported long- and short-term standardised assessment of improvement in total inflammatory lesion counts, participant-reported outcomes, and full safety accounts. Oral isotretinoin for acne that has not responded to oral antibiotics plus topical agents needs further assessment, as well as different dose/regimens of oral isotretinoin in acne of all severities.

        "Association between late-night tweeting and next-day game performance among professional basketball players. OBJECTIVES: In sports, decreased sleep duration is generally associated with poorer performance compared to adequate or enhanced sleep duration. Yet, these findings have primarily been taken from small numbers of athletes performing outside of real games or competitions. It remains unknown how acute decreased sleep duration impacts real-game performance among professional athletes. Here, we merged 2 publicly available datasets to jointly measure late-night social media activity (a proxy for sleep deprivation) and next-day game performance. SETTING: Professional basketball competition. PARTICIPANTS: 112 players from the National Basketball Association. MEASUREMENTS: Time-stamped social media activity and in-game individual performance statistics. RESULTS: Late-night tweeting (compared to not late-night tweeting) is associated with within-person reductions in next-day game performance, including fewer points scored and fewer rebounds. However, we also observe less time played per game following late-night tweets and decreases in the negative outputs of turnovers and personal fouls. The critical measure of shooting accuracy - which is not time dependent - provides the clearest evidence of a performance penalty following late-night tweeting activity (between 11:00\u202fpm and 7:00\u202fam); players successfully make shots at a rate 1.7 percentage points less following late-night tweeting. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that acute sleep deprivation, as measured via late-night Twitter activity, is associated with changes in next-day game performance among professional National Basketball Association athletes. More broadly, the use of late-night social media activity may serve as a useful general proxy for sleep deprivation in other social, occupational, and physical performance-based contexts. ",
        "Accuracy of a smartwatch based single-lead electrocardiogram device in detection of atrial fibrillation. OBJECTIVE: The AliveCor KardiaBand (KB) is an Food and Drug Administration-approved smartwatch-based cardiac rhythm monitor that records a lead-Intelligent ECG (iECG). Despite the appeal of wearable integrated ECG devices, there is a paucity of data evaluating their accuracy in diagnosing atrial fibrillation (AF). We evaluated whether a smartwatch-based device for AF detection is an accurate tool for diagnosing AF when compared with 12-lead ECG. METHODS: A prospective, multi-centre, validation study was conducted in an inpatient hospital setting. The KB paired with a smartwatch, generated an automated diagnosis of AF or sinus rhythm (SR). This was compared with a 12-lead ECG performed immediately after iECG tracing. Where an unclassified or no-analysis tracing was generated, repeat iECG was performed. RESULTS: 439 ECGs (iECGs (n=239) and 12-lead ECG (n=200)) were recorded in 200 patients (AF: n=38; SR: n=162) from three tertiary centres. Sensitivity and specificity using KB was 94.4% and 81.9% respectively, with a positive predictive value of 54.8% and negative predictive value of 98.4%. Agreement between 12-lead ECG and KB diagnosis was moderate when unclassified tracings were included (\u03ba=0.60, 95%\u2009CI 0.47 to 0.72). Combining the automated device diagnosis with blinded electrophysiologists (EP) interpretation of unclassified tracings improved overall agreement (EP1: \u03ba=0.76, 95%\u2009CI 0.65 to 0.87; EP2: \u03ba=0.74, 95%\u2009CI 0.63 to 0.86). CONCLUSION: The KB demonstrated moderate diagnostic accuracy when compared with a 12-lead ECG. Combining the automated device diagnosis with EP interpretation of unclassified tracings yielded improved accuracy. However, even with future improvements in automated algorithms, physician involvement will likely remain an essential component when exploring the utility of these devices for arrhythmia screening.

        "Relationship Between Poor Olfaction and Mortality Among Community-Dwelling Older Adults: A Cohort Study. Background: Poor olfaction is common among older adults and has been linked to higher mortality. However, most studies have had a relatively short follow-up and have not explored potential explanations. Objective: To assess poor olfaction in relation to mortality in older adults and to investigate potential explanations. Design: Community-based prospective cohort study. Setting: 2 U.S. communities. Participants: 2289 adults aged 71 to 82 years at baseline (37.7% black persons and 51.9% women). Measurements: Brief Smell Identification Test in 1999 or 2000 (baseline) and all-cause and cause-specific mortality at 3, 5, 10, and 13 years after baseline. Results: During follow-up, 1211 participants died by year 13. Compared with participants with good olfaction, those with poor olfaction had a 46% higher cumulative risk for death at year 10 (risk ratio, 1.46 [95% CI, 1.27 to 1.67]) and a 30% higher risk at year 13 (risk ratio, 1.30 [CI, 1.18 to 1.42]). Similar associations were found in men and women and in white and black persons. However, the association was evident among participants who reported excellent to good health at baseline (for example, 10-year mortality risk ratio, 1.62 [CI, 1.37 to 1.90]) but not among those who reported fair to poor health (10-year mortality risk ratio, 1.06 [CI, 0.82 to 1.37]). In analyses of cause-specific mortality, poor olfaction was associated with higher mortality from neurodegenerative and cardiovascular diseases. Mediation analyses showed that neurodegenerative diseases explained 22% and weight loss explained 6% of the higher 10-year mortality among participants with poor olfaction. Limitation: No data were collected on change in olfaction and its relationship to mortality. Conclusion: Poor olfaction is associated with higher long-term mortality among older adults, particularly those with excellent to good health at baseline. Neurodegenerative diseases and weight loss explain only part of the increased mortality. Primary Funding Source: National Institutes of Health and Michigan State University. ",
        "Impact and Timing of Smoking Cessation on Reducing Risk of Rheumatoid Arthritis Among Women in the Nurses' Health Studies. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the impact and timing of smoking cessation on developing rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and serologic phenotypes. METHODS: We investigated smoking cessation and RA risk in the Nurses' Health Study (NHS) (1976-2014) and the NHS II (1989-2015). Smoking exposures and covariates were obtained by biennial questionnaires. Self-reported RA was confirmed by medical record review for American College of Rheumatology/European League Against Rheumatism criteria. Cox regression was used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) for RA serologic phenotypes (all, seropositive, seronegative) according to smoking status, intensity, pack-years, and years since cessation. RESULTS: Among 230,732 women, we identified 1,528 incident cases of RA (63.4% of which were seropositive) during 6,037,151 person-years of follow-up. Compared with never smoking, current smoking increased the risk of all RA (multivariable HR 1.47, 95% CI 1.27-1.72) and seropositive RA (HR 1.67, 95% CI 1.38-2.01) but not seronegative RA (HR 1.20, 95% CI 0.93-1.55). An increasing number of smoking pack-years was associated with an increased trend for the risk of all RA (P < 0.0001) and seropositive RA (P < 0.0001). With increasing duration of smoking cessation, a decreased trend for the risk of all RA was observed (P = 0.009) and seropositive RA (P = 0.002). Compared to recent quitters (<5 years), those who quit \u226530 years ago had an HR of 0.63 (95% CI 0.44-0.90) for seropositive RA. However, a modestly increased risk of RA was still detectable 30 years after quitting smoking (for all RA, HR 1.25 [95% CI 1.02-1.53]; for seropositive RA, HR 1.30 [95% CI 1.01-1.68]; reference, never smoking). CONCLUSION: These results confirm that smoking is a strong risk factor for developing seropositive RA and demonstrate for the first time that a behavior change of sustained smoking cessation could delay or even prevent seropositive RA.

        "Does soccer headgear reduce the incidence of sport-related concussion? A cluster, randomised controlled trial of adolescent athletes. BACKGROUND: There have been no large randomised controlled trials to determine whether soccer headgear reduces the incidence or severity of sport-related concussion (SRC) in US high school athletes. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to determine whether headgear reduces the incidence or severity (days out from soccer) of SRCs in soccer players. METHODS: 2766 participants (67% female, age 15.6\u00b11.2) (who undertook 3050 participant years) participated in this cluster randomised trial. Athletes in the headgear (HG) group wore headgear during the season, while those in the no headgear (NoHG) group did not. Staff recorded SRC and non-SRC injuries and soccer exposures. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards models were used to examine time-to-SRC between groups, while severity was compared with a Wilcoxon rank-sum test. RESULTS: 130 participants (5.3% female, 2.2% male) sustained an SRC. The incidence of SRC was not different between the HG and NoHG groups for males (HR: 2.00 (0.63-6.43) p=0.242) and females (HR: 0.86 (0.54-1.36) p=0.520). Days lost from SRC were not different (p=0.583) between the HG group (13.5 (11.0-018.8) days) and the NoHG group (13.0 (9.0-18.8) days). CONCLUSIONS: Soccer headgear did not reduce the incidence or severity of SRC in high school soccer players. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT02850926. ",
        "Few training sessions between return to play and first match appearance are associated with an increased propensity for injury: a prospective cohort study of male professional football players during 16 consecutive seasons. BACKGROUND: It has been hypothesised that injury risk after return to play following an injury absence is influenced by the amount of training completed before return to competition. AIM: To analyse if the number of completed training sessions between return to play and the first subsequent match appearance was associated with the odds of injury in men's professional football. METHODS: From a cohort study, including 303\u2009637 individual matches, 4805 first match appearances after return to play following moderate to severe injuries (\u22658 days absence) were analysed. Rate ratios (RRs) were used to compare injury rates in the first match appearances with the average seasonal match injury rate. Odds ratios (ORs) were used to analyse associations between the number of completed training sessions and general (all injuries), muscle, and non-muscle injury odds. RESULTS: Injury rate in the first match after return to play was increased by 87% compared with the average seasonal match injury rate (46.9 vs 25.0/1000\u2009hours, RR=1.87; 95%\u2009CI 1.64 to 2.14). The odds of injury dropped 7% with each training session before the first match (OR 0.93; 95%\u2009CI 0.87 to 0.98). The same association was found for muscle injuries (OR 0.87; 95%\u2009CI 0.79 to 0.95) but not for non-muscle injuries (OR 0.99; 95%\u2009CI 0.91 to 1.07). CONCLUSIONS: Injury rates in the first match after injury are higher than the average seasonal match injury rate, but the propensity for player injury is decreased when players complete more training sessions before their first match.

        "Psychosocial stress and bone loss among postmenopausal women: results from the Women's Health Initiative. BACKGROUND: Bone loss is a major public health concern with large proportions of older women experiencing osteoporotic fractures. Previous research has established a relationship between psychosocial stressors and fractures. However, few studies have investigated bone loss as an intermediary in this relationship. This study investigates whether social stress is associated with bone loss during a 6-year period in postmenopausal women. METHODS: Data from 11\u2009020 postmenopausal women from the USA was used to examine self-reported psychosocial stress in relation to change in bone mineral density (BMD) measured at the femoral neck, lumbar spine and total hip. Linear regression models were used to examine associations between social measures of psychosocial stress (social strain, social functioning and social support) and per cent change in BMD over 6\u2009years. RESULTS: High social stress was associated with decreased BMD over 6\u2009years. After adjustment for confounders, each point higher in social strain was associated with 0.082% greater loss of femoral neck BMD, 0.108% greater loss of total hip BMD and 0.069% greater loss of lumbar spine BMD (p<0.05). Low social functioning and low social support were associated with greater decreases in femoral neck BMD, and low social functioning was associated with greater decreases in total hip BMD. CONCLUSION: The findings provide evidence for an association between high social stress and greater bone loss over 6\u2009years of follow-up. In agreement with the prior literature, the findings for social strain and social functioning suggest that poor quality of social relationships may be associated with bone loss in postmenopausal women.

        "Kissing may be an important and neglected risk factor for oropharyngeal gonorrhoea: a cross-sectional study in men who have sex with men. OBJECTIVES: A mathematical model suggested that a significant proportion of oropharyngeal gonorrhoea cases are acquired via oropharynx-to-oropharynx transmission (ie, tongue-kissing), but to date, no empirical study has investigated this. This study aimed to examine the association between kissing and oropharyngeal gonorrhoea among gay and bisexual men who have sex with men (MSM). METHODS: MSM attending a public sexual health centre in Melbourne, Australia, between March 2016 and February 2017 were invited to participate in a brief survey that collected data on their number of male partners in the last 3 months, in three distinct categories: kissing-only (ie, no sex including no oral and/or anal sex), sex-only (ie, any sex without kissing), and kissing-with-sex (ie, kissing with any sex). Univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to examine associations between oropharyngeal gonorrhoea positivity by nucleic acid amplification tests and the three distinct partner categories. RESULTS: A total of 3677 men completed the survey and were tested for oropharyngeal gonorrhoea. Their median age was 30 (IQR 25-37) and 6.2% (n=229) had oropharyngeal gonorrhoea. Men had a mean number of 4.3 kissing-only, 1.4 sex-only, and 5.0 kissing-with-sex partners in the last 3 months. Kissing-only and kissing-with-sex were associated with oropharyngeal gonorrhoea, but sex-only was not. The adjusted odds for having oropharyngeal gonorrhoea were 1.46-fold (95% CI 1.04 to 2.06) for men with \u22654 kissing-only partners and 1.81-fold (95% CI 1.17 to 2.79) for men with \u22654 kissing-with-sex partners. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that kissing may be associated with transmission of oropharyngeal gonorrhoea in MSM, irrespective of whether sex also occurs. ",
        "Prestroke physical activity could influence acute stroke severity (part of PAPSIGOT). OBJECTIVE: To investigate the influence of prestroke physical activity (PA) on acute stroke severity. METHODS: Data from patients with first stroke were retrieved from registries with a cross-sectional design. The variables were PA, age, sex, smoking, diabetes, hypertension and statin treatment, stroke severity, myocardial infarction, new stroke during hospital stay, and duration of inpatient care at stroke unit. PA was assessed with Saltin-Grimby's 4-level Physical Activity Level Scale, and stroke severity was assessed with the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS). Logistic regression was used to predict stroke severity, and negative binomial regression was used to compare the level of PA and stroke severity. RESULTS: The study included 925 patients with a mean age of 73.1 years, and 45.2% were women. Patients who reported light or moderate PA levels were more likely to present a mild stroke (NIHSS score 0 to 5) compared with physically inactive patients in a model that also included younger age as a predictor (odds ratio = 2.02 for PA and odds ratio = 0.97 for age). The explanatory value was limited at 6.8%. Prestroke PA was associated with less severe stroke, and both light PA such as walking at least 4 h/wk and moderate PA 2-3 h/wk appear to be beneficial. Physical inactivity was associated with increased stroke severity. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that PA and younger age could result in a less severe stroke. Both light PA such as walking at least 4 h/wk and moderate PA 2-3 h/wk appear to be beneficial. ",
        "Effects of increased minimum wages by unemployment rate on suicide in the USA. BACKGROUND: Social welfare policies such as the minimum wage can affect population health, though the impact may differ by the level of unemployment experienced by society at a given time. METHODS: We ran difference-in-differences models using monthly data from all 50 states and Washington, DC from 1990 to 2015. We used educational attainment to define treatment and control groups. The exposure was the difference between state and federal minimum wage in US$2015, defined both by the date the state law became effective and lagged by 1\u2009year. Models included state and year fixed effects, and additional state-level covariates to account for state-specific time-varying confounding. We assessed effect modification by the state-level unemployment rate, and estimated predicted suicide counts under different minimum wage scenarios. RESULTS: The effect of a US$1 increase in the minimum wage ranged from a 3.4% decrease (95%\u2009CI 0.4 to 6.4) to a 5.9% decrease (95%\u2009CI 1.4 to 10.2) in the suicide rate among adults aged 18-64 years with a high school education or less. We detected significant effect modification by unemployment rate, with the largest effects of minimum wage on reducing suicides observed at higher unemployment levels. CONCLUSION: Minimum wage increases appear to reduce the suicide rate among those with a high school education or less, and may reduce disparities between socioeconomic groups. Effects appear greatest during periods of high unemployment. ",
        "Short Sleep Is Associated With Low Bone Mineral Density and Osteoporosis in the Women's Health Initiative. Short sleep duration, recognized as a public health epidemic, is associated with adverse health conditions, yet little is known about the association between sleep and bone health. We tested the associations of usual sleep behavior and bone mineral density (BMD) and osteoporosis. In a sample of 11,084 postmenopausal women from the Women's Health Initiative (WHI; mean age 63.3\u2009years, SD = 7.4), we performed a cross-sectional study of the association of self-reported usual hours of sleep and sleep quality (WHI Insomnia Rating Score) with whole body, total hip, femoral neck, and spine BMD using linear regression models. We also studied the association of sleep duration and quality with dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA)-defined low bone mass (T-score\u2009<\u2009-2.5 to <-1) and osteoporosis (T-score\u2009\u2264\u2009-2.5) using multinomial regression models. We adjusted for age, DXA machine, race, menopausal symptoms, education, smoking, physical activity, body mass index, alcohol use, physical function, and sleep medication use. In adjusted linear regression models, women who reported sleeping 5\u2009hours or less per night had on average 0.012 to 0.018\u2009g/cm2 significantly lower BMD at all four sites compared with women who reported sleeping 7\u2009hours per night (reference). In adjusted multinomial models, women reporting 5\u2009hours or less per night had higher odds of low bone mass and osteoporosis of the hip (odds ratio [OR] =\u20091.22; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.03-1.45, and 1.63; 1.15-2.31, respectively). We observed a similar pattern for spine BMD, where women with 5\u2009hours or less per night had higher odds of osteoporosis (adjusted OR = 1.28; 95% CI 1.02-1.60). Associations of sleep quality and DXA BMD failed to reach statistical significance. Short sleep duration was associated with lower BMD and higher risk of osteoporosis. Longitudinal studies are needed to confirm the cross-sectional effects of sleep duration on bone health and explore associated mechanisms. \u00a9 2019 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.

        "Application of SPF moisturisers is inferior to sunscreens in coverage of facial and eyelid regions. Many moisturisers contain sun protection factors (SPF) equivalent to those found in sunscreens. However, there is a lack of research into how SPF moisturiser application compares to sunscreens in terms of coverage achieved and protection afforded. Previously we demonstrated that users incompletely covered their eyelid regions during routine sunscreen application. Here, we aimed to determine if SPF moisturiser users also displayed these tendencies. A study population of 84 participants (22 males, 62 females, age 18-57) were exposed to UV radiation and photographed using a tripod mounted UV sensitive DSLR camera on two separate visits. At visit one, images were acquired before and after applying either SPF30 sunscreen or moisturiser, then at visit two the study was repeated with the other formulation. Images were processed for facial landmark identification followed by segmentation mapping of hue saturation values to identify areas of the face that were/were not covered. Analyses revealed that application of moisturiser was significantly worse than sunscreen in terms area of the whole face missed (11.1% missed with sunscreen compared to 16.6% for SPF moisturiser p<0.001 paired t-test). This difference was primarily due to decreased coverage of the eyelid regions (14.0% missed with sunscreen, 20.9% moisturiser, p<0.001). Analysis of a post-study questionnaire revealed participants to be unaware of their incomplete coverage. Secondary analyses revealed improved coverage in males (p = 0.05), and, with moisturiser only, in participants with darker skin tones (p = 0.02). Together these data indicate that, despite potential advantages in terms of increased frequency of application of moisturiser, the areas of the face that are at higher cancer risk are likely not being protected, and that participants are unaware that they are at risk. As such, alternative sun-protection strategies should be promoted. ",
        "Understanding the Barriers to Reporting Sexual Harassment in Surgical Training. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the occurrence, nature, and reporting of sexual harassment in surgical training and to understand why surgical trainees who experience harassment might not report it. This information will inform ways to overcome barriers to reporting sexual harassment. SUMMARY/ BACKGROUND DATA: Sexual harassment in the workplace is a known phenomenon with reports of high frequency in the medical field. Aspects of surgical training leave trainees especially vulnerable to harassing behavior. The characteristics of sexual harassment and reasons for its underreporting have yet to be studied on the national level in this population. METHODS: An electronic anonymous survey was distributed to general surgery trainees in participating program; all general surgery training programs nationally were invited to participate. RESULTS: Sixteen general surgery training programs participated, yielding 270 completed surveys (response rate of 30%). Overall, 48.9% of all respondents and 70.8% of female respondents experienced at least 1 form of sexual harassment during their training. Of the respondents who experienced sexual harassment, 7.6% reported the incident. The most common cited reasons for nonreporting were believing that the action was harmless (62.1%) and believing reporting would be a waste of time (47.7%). CONCLUSION: Sexual harassment occurs in surgical training and is rarely reported. Many residents who are harassed question if the behavior they experienced was harassment or feel that reporting would be ineffectual-leading to frequent nonreporting. Surgical training programs should provide all-level education on sexual harassment and delineate the best mechanism for resident reporting of sexual harassment. ",
        "Laparoscopic Sleeve Gastrectomy Versus Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of Weight Loss, Comorbidities, and Biochemical Outcomes From Randomized Controlled Trials. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to compare weight loss, obesity-related comorbidities, and biochemical outcomes of LSG versus LRYGB through a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs). SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: LSG and LRYGB are the 2 most commonly performed bariatric surgeries for the treatment of obesity. The comparative outcomes of the 2 surgeries is a topic of ongoing debate and medium-term outcomes remain uncertain. METHODS: A search for RCTs comparing LRYGB versus LSG was conducted. Pooled outcomes between 2 procedures were compared using pairwise random-effects meta-analysis at 1, 3, and 5-year follow-up time points. Grading of recommendations, assessment, development, and evaluation was used to assess certainty of evidence. RESULTS: Thirty-three studies involving 2475 patients were included. LRYGB resulted in greater loss of body mass index compared to LSG at 1 year [mean difference -1.25\u200akg/m, 95% confidence interval (CI) -2.01 to -0.49, P = 0.001; moderate certainty of evidence] which persisted at 3 years, but there was insufficient evidence at 5 years. Resolution of dyslipidemia was higher for LRYGB than LSG at 1 year (risk ratio 0.58, 95% CI 0.46-0.73, P < 0.001; moderate certainty of evidence) and 5 years (risk ratio 0.68, 95%CI 0.46-0.99, P = 0.04; low certainty of evidence). There was no difference between LRYGB and LSG for remission of type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and hemoglobin A1c, fasting insulin, homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance, high-density lipoprotein, and the rate of 30-day major and minor complications. CONCLUSIONS: There are insufficient data from RCTs to draw any conclusions regarding the long-term comparative effectiveness beyond 3 years between LRYGB and LSG. ",
        "Comparison of Surgical Intervention and Mortality for Seven Surgical Emergencies in England and the United States. OBJECTIVE: To examine differences between England and the USA in the rate of surgical intervention and in-hospital mortality for 7 index surgical emergencies. BACKGROUND: Considerable international variation exists in the configuration, provision, and outcomes of emergency healthcare. METHODS: Patients aged <80 years hospitalized with 1 of 7 surgical emergencies (ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm, aortic dissection, appendicitis, perforated esophagus, peptic ulcer, small bowel or large bowel, and incarcerated or strangulated hernias) were identified from English Hospital Episode Statistics and the USA Nationwide Inpatient Sample (2006-2012) and classified by whether they received a corrective surgical intervention. The rates of surgical intervention and population mortality were compared between England and the USA after adjustment for patient demographic factors. RESULTS: From 2006 to 2012, there were 136,047 admissions in English hospitals and 1,863,626 admissions in US hospitals due to the index surgical emergencies.Proportion of patients receiving no surgical intervention, for all 7 conditions was greater in the England (OR 4.25, 1.55, 8.53, 1.92, 2.06, 2.42, 1.75) and population in-hospital mortality was greater in England (OR 1.34, 1.67, 2.22, 1.65, 2.7, 4.46, 3.22) for ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm, aortic dissection, appendicitis, perforated esophagus, peptic ulcer, small bowel or large bowel, and incarcerated or strangulated hernias respectively.In England (where follow-up was available), lack of utilization of surgery was also associated with increased in-hospital and long-term mortality for all conditions. CONCLUSION: England and US hospitals differ in the threshold for surgical intervention, which may be associated with increases in mortality in England for these 7 general surgical emergencies. ",
        "Association of designated open water swim area regulations and open water drowning rates. BACKGROUND: Although most persons over 5 years of age drown in open water, few laws have sought to regulate open water swim sites. We examined the association between regulations for designated open water swim sites and open water drowning death rates by state. METHODS: Using International Classification of Disease (ICD)-10 codes in the CDC Web-based Injury Statistics Query and Reporting System (WISQARS), we identified and calculated open water drowning deaths involving all ages from 2012 to 2017 for 50 states and calculated open water drowning death rates. We then identified and categorised types of state regulations (lifeguards, water quality, rescue equipment, tracking/planning/reporting and signage) for open water swim sites in place in 2017 for a sample of 30 states (20 high-drowning, 10 low-drowning). Analyses evaluated associations between open water drowning rates in three groups (overall, youth and non-white) and the total number and types of state regulations. RESULTS: Swim site regulations and open water drowning death rates for 10\u2009839 victims were associated in all regression models. States with more types of regulations had lower open water drowning death rates in a dose-response relationship. States lacking regulations compared with states with all five types of regulations had open water drowning death rates 3.02 times higher among youth (95%\u2009CI 1.82 to 4.99) and 4.16 times higher among non-white residents (95%\u2009CI 2.46 to 7.05). Lifeguard and tracking/planning/reporting regulations were associated with a 33% and 45% reduction in open water drowning rates overall and among those aged 0-17\u2009years. CONCLUSION: States' open water swim area regulations, especially addressing tracking/planning/reporting and lifeguards, were associated with lower open water drowning death rates. ",
        "A prospective study of tea drinking temperature and risk of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. Previous studies have reported an association between hot tea drinking and risk of esophageal cancer, but no study has examined this association using prospectively and objectively measured tea drinking temperature. We examined the association of tea drinking temperature, measured both objectively and subjectively at study baseline, with future risk of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) in a prospective study. We measured tea drinking temperature using validated methods and collected data on several other tea drinking habits and potential confounders of interest at baseline in the Golestan Cohort Study, a population-based prospective study of 50,045 individuals aged 40-75\u2009years, established in 2004-2008 in northeastern Iran. Study participants were followed-up for a median duration of 10.1 years (505,865 person-years). During 2004-2017, 317 new cases of ESCC were identified. The objectively measured tea temperature (HR 1.41, 95% CI 1.10-1.81; for \u226560\u00b0C vs. <60\u00b0C), reported preference for very hot tea drinking (HR 2.41, 95% CI 1.27-4.56; for \"very hot\" vs. \"cold/lukewarm\"), and reported shorter time from pouring tea to drinking (HR 1.51, 95% CI 1.01-2.26; for <2 vs. \u22656 min) were all associated with ESCC risk. In analysis of the combined effects of measured temperature and amount, compared to those who drank less than 700\u2009ml of tea/day at <60\u00b0C, drinking 700\u2009mL/day or more at a higher-temperature (\u226560\u00b0C) was consistently associated with an about 90% increase in ESCC risk. Our results substantially strengthen the existing evidence supporting an association between hot beverage drinking and ESCC. ",

OBJECTIVE: To determine adolescent predictors of muscularity-oriented disordered eating behaviors in young men and women using a nationally representative longitudinal sample in the United States and to examine differences by sex. METHOD: We used nationally representative longitudinal cohort data collected from baseline (11-18\u2009years old, 1994-1995) and 7-year follow-up (18-24\u2009years old, 2001-2002) of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health. We examined adolescent demographic, behavioral, and mental health predictors of young adult muscularity-oriented disordered eating behaviors defined as eating more or differently to gain weight or bulk up, supplements to gain weight or bulk up, or androgenic anabolic steroid use at 7-year follow-up. RESULTS: Of the 14,891 included participants, 22% of males and 5% of females reported any muscularity-oriented disordered eating behavior at follow-up in young adulthood. Factors recorded at adolescence that were prospectively associated with higher odds of muscularity-oriented disordered eating in both sexes included black race, exercising to gain weight, self-perception of being underweight, and lower body mass index z-score. In addition, participation in weightlifting; roller-blading, roller-skating, skate-boarding, or bicycling; and alcohol among males and depressive symptoms among females during adolescence were associated with higher odds of muscularity-oriented disordered eating in young adulthood. CONCLUSIONS: Interventions to prevent muscularity-oriented disordered eating behaviors may target at-risk youth, particularly those of black race or who engage in exercise to gain weight. Future research should examine longitudinal health outcomes associated with muscularity-oriented disordered eating behaviors. ",
        "Support for My Video is Support for Me: A YouTube Scoping Review of Videos Including Adolescents With Chronic Pain. OBJECTIVES: Adolescents are heavy users of social media as a venue to share experience and obtain information. Adolescents with chronic pain may be no different. Given that adolescents with chronic pain report feelings of social isolation, of being different, and lack peer understanding, social media may help them obtain social support. We conducted a scoping review of YouTube to identify how adolescents with chronic pain use this platform to connect with other adolescents. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The terms \"youth with chronic pain\" and \"teens with chronic pain\" were entered into the YouTube search bar to locate videos. Videos in English, targeted at and including an adolescent with chronic pain were included. Videos were screened for eligibility until 20 consecutive videos listed on the main page were excluded. For each included video the first 5 related videos suggested by YouTube in the sidebar were also screened for eligibility. RESULTS: This selection process resulted in 18 included videos, with a total of 936 viewer comments. Recurring comment themes were identified using qualitative content analysis. Video content mainly covered multidisciplinary treatment options, alternative treatments, and impact of pain on daily life. Although a variety of treatment options were discussed, details of treatment were lacking. Comments reflected the overarching message \"you are not alone!\" and mainly focused on providing and receiving support, sharing suffering, and revealing the impact of pain on relationships and daily life. DISCUSSION: Despite potential challenges associated with social media, YouTube may be a promising platform for provision of social support for adolescents with chronic pain. ",
        "ACOG Committee Opinion No. 758 Summary: Promoting Healthy Relationships in Adolescents. Obstetrician-gynecologists have the opportunity to promote healthy relationships by encouraging adolescents to discuss past and present relationships while educating them about respect for themselves and mutual respect for others. Because middle school is a time when some adolescents may develop their first romantic or sexual relationships, it is an ideal timeframe for obstetrician-gynecologists and other health care providers, parents, and guardians to play a role in anticipatory guidance. Creating a nonjudgmental environment and educating staff on the unique concerns of adolescents are helpful ways to provide effective and appropriate care to this group of patients. Obstetrician-gynecologists and other health care providers caring for minors should be aware of federal and state laws that affect confidentiality. Obstetrician-gynecologists should screen patients routinely for intimate partner violence along with reproductive and sexual coercion and be prepared to address positive responses. Furthermore, obstetrician-gynecologists should be aware of mandatory reporting laws in their state when intimate partner violence, adolescent dating violence, or statutory rape is suspected. Pregnant and parenting adolescents; lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer or questioning (LGBTQ) individuals; and adolescents with physical and mental disabilities are at particular risk of disparities in the health care system. The promotion of healthy relationships in these groups requires the obstetrician-gynecologist to be aware of the unique barriers and hurdles to sexual and nonsexual expression, as well as to health care. Interventions to promote healthy relationships and a strong sexual health framework are more effective when started early and can affect indicators of long-term individual health and public health.

        "The Epidemiology of Depressive Symptoms in the Last Year of Life. BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE: Depression impacts quality of life at all life stages, but the epidemiology of depression in the last year of life is unknown. This study's objectives were to document the epidemiology of depressive symptoms in the year prior to death and to assess how the trajectory of depressive symptoms varies by sociodemographic and clinical factors. DESIGN: Observational, cross-sectional, cohort study using the Health and Retirement Study. SETTING: Population-based survey. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 3274 individuals who died within 12\u2009months after assessment. MEASURES: Primary outcome: eight-item Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CESD-8). Covariates included sociodemographics, self-reported illnesses, and activity of daily living (ADL) limitations. RESULTS: Average CESD-8 score increased over the last year of life, with 59.3% screening positive for depression in the last month before death. Depression symptoms increased gradually from 12 to 4\u2009months before death (increase of 0.05 points/month; 95% confidence interval [CI] =\u20090.01-0.08 points/month) and then escalated from 4 to 1\u2009months before death (increase of 0.29 points/month; 95% CI = 0.16-0.39 points/month). Women, younger adults, and nonwhite adults all demonstrated higher rates of depressive symptoms. Individuals with cancer reported escalating rates of depressive symptoms at the end of life, while individuals with lung disease and ADL impairment demonstrated persistently high rates throughout the year before death. CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed high rates of depressive symptoms in the last year of life as well as differences in the burden of depressive symptoms. A public health approach must be taken to screen for and appropriately treat symptoms of depression across the lifespan. J Am Geriatr Soc 68:321-328, 2020. ",
        "Relation between 20-year income volatility and brain health in midlife: The CARDIA study. OBJECTIVE: Income volatility presents a growing public health threat. To our knowledge, no previous study examined the relationship among income volatility, cognitive function, and brain integrity. METHODS: We studied 3,287 participants aged 23-35 years in 1990 from the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults prospective cohort study. Income volatility data were created using income data collected from 1990 to 2010 and defined as SD of percent change in income and number of income drops \u226525% (categorized as 0, 1, or 2+). In 2010, cognitive tests (n = 3,287) and brain scans (n = 716) were obtained. RESULTS: After covariate adjustment, higher income volatility was associated with worse performance on processing speed (\u03b2 = -1.09, 95% confidence interval [CI] -1.73 to -0.44) and executive functioning (\u03b2 = 2.53, 95% CI 0.60-4.50) but not on verbal memory (\u03b2 = -0.02, 95% CI -0.16 to 0.11). Similarly, additional income drops were associated with worse performance on processing speed and executive functioning. Higher income volatility and more income drops were also associated with worse microstructural integrity of total brain and total white matter. All findings were similar when restricted to those with high education, suggesting reverse causation may not explain these findings. CONCLUSION: Income volatility over a 20-year period of formative earning years was associated with worse cognitive function and brain integrity in midlife. ",
        "Smoke-free and tobacco-free colleges and universities in the United States. OBJECTIVE: To describe the number and proportion of accredited, degree-granting institutions with 100% smoke-free and 100% tobacco-free protections across the USA and by state. METHODS: Data on postsecondary education institutions from the US Department of Education National Center for Education Statistics Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System 2015, and smoke-free and tobacco-free campus protections from the American Nonsmokers' Rights Foundation's Smokefree and Tobacco-Free Colleges and Universities List 2017, were integrated to calculate the number and proportion of: (1) smoke-free and tobacco-free accredited, degree-granting institutions and (2) students and staff protected by campus policies and state laws. Campus protections are given a 100% smoke-free designation if smoking is not allowed on campus anywhere, at any time; 100% tobacco-free designations extend smoke-free protections to include non-combustible products such as smokeless tobacco. RESULTS: 823 accredited, degree-granting institutions (16.7%) representing 1816 individual campuses, sites and schools have either 100% smoke-free or 100% tobacco-free protections. An estimated 14.9 million college students (26.9%) and 8.9 million faculty and staff (25.4%) are protected by campus policies and state laws. Only three states and two territories have 100% smoke-free or 100% tobacco-free protections in over half of their institutions; four states and six territories have no known 100% smoke-free or 100% tobacco-free campus protections. CONCLUSIONS: In 2017, just 16.7% of accredited, degree-granting institutions in the USA had 100% smoke-free or 100% tobacco-free protections. Despite progress, more efforts can ensure that students and staff benefit from comprehensive 100% smoke-free and 100% tobacco-free protections at US colleges and universities. ",
        "Charcoal-containing dentifrices. Charcoal toothpastes and powders are fashionable oral hygiene products, intended for toothbrushing, extrinsic stain removal and, it is claimed, 'tooth whitening'. The popularity of charcoal toothpastes is believed to be increasing in many countries across the world, including the UK, US, Japan, India, Thailand, Lithuania, Australia, Hong Kong, China, Korea and Switzerland, where charcoal-based toothpastes have been reported to be produced. It is understood that many patients ask members of their dental team for advice on the use and benefits of charcoal toothpastes and powders, and that such advice is often empirical. The purpose of this article is to provide an overview of the current knowledge and understanding of charcoal toothpastes and powders, including consideration of the strength of the evidence to support claims made by the manufacturers of these products.

        "Effect of seawalls on tsunami evacuation departure in the 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake. OBJECTIVE: To quantitatively evaluate the effect of seawalls on tsunami evacuation departure. METHODS: A mixed-effect Cox proportional-hazards regression model was applied to evacuation behavioural data obtained from a probability survey of survivors of the 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake and Tsunami in Iwate and Miyagi prefectures. FINDINGS: Presence of a seawall higher than the forecast tsunami height at any given time reduces the likelihood of prompt evacuation by 30%. Findings suggest the existence of a false sense of security among residents deriving from the presence of seawalls. CONCLUSION: Prompt evacuation is a key factor affecting survival. The effect of seawalls on evacuation decisions is an important policy consideration. More work is needed in disaster preparedness education and in the way tsunami warnings are given, taking into consideration the risk of forecast error. Priority should be given to promoting prompt evacuation and educating residents as to the uncertainty of tsunami forecasting, to ensure that residents do not ignore evacuation warnings due to false impressions of the safety provided by seawalls.

        "Measles, Mumps, Rubella Vaccination and Autism: A Nationwide Cohort Study. Background: The hypothesized link between the measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine and autism continues to cause concern and challenge vaccine uptake. Objective: To evaluate whether the MMR vaccine increases the risk for autism in children, subgroups of children, or time periods after vaccination. Design: Nationwide cohort study. Setting: Denmark. Participants: 657\u00a0461 children born in Denmark from 1999 through 31 December 2010, with follow-up from 1 year of age and through 31 August 2013. Measurements: Danish population registries were used to link information on MMR vaccination, autism diagnoses, other childhood vaccines, sibling history of autism, and autism risk factors to children in the cohort. Survival analysis of the time to autism diagnosis with Cox proportional hazards regression was used to estimate hazard ratios of autism according to MMR vaccination status, with adjustment for age, birth year, sex, other childhood vaccines, sibling history of autism, and autism risk factors (based on a disease risk score). Results: During 5\u00a0025\u00a0754 person-years of follow-up, 6517 children were diagnosed with autism (incidence rate, 129.7 per 100\u00a0000 person-years). Comparing MMR-vaccinated with MMR-unvaccinated children yielded a fully adjusted autism hazard ratio of 0.93 (95% CI, 0.85 to 1.02). Similarly, no increased risk for autism after MMR vaccination was consistently observed in subgroups of children defined according to sibling history of autism, autism risk factors (based on a disease risk score) or other childhood vaccinations, or during specified time periods after vaccination. Limitation: No individual medical charts were reviewed. Conclusion: The study strongly supports that MMR vaccination does not increase the risk for autism, does not trigger autism in susceptible children, and is not associated with clustering of autism cases after vaccination. It adds to previous studies through significant additional statistical power and by addressing hypotheses of susceptible subgroups and clustering of cases. Primary Funding Source: Novo Nordisk Foundation and Danish Ministry of Health. ",
        "Impact of multiple food environments on body mass index. BACKGROUND: Although the relationship between residential food environments and health outcomes have been extensively studied, the relationship between body mass index (BMI) and multiple food environments have not been fully explored. We examined the relationship between characteristics of three distinct food environments and BMI among elementary school employees in the metropolitan area of New Orleans, LA. We assessed the food environments around the residential and worksite neighborhoods and the commuting corridors. RESEARCH METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: This study combined data from three different sources: individual and worksite data (ACTION), food retailer database (Dunn and Bradstreet), and the U.S. Census TIGER/Line Files. Spatial and hierarchical analyses were performed to explore the impact of predictors at the individual and environmental levels on BMI. When the three food environments were combined, the number of supermarkets and the number of grocery stores at residential food environment had a significant association with BMI (\u03b2 = 0.56 and \u03b2 = 0.24, p < 0.01), whereas the number of full-service restaurants showed an inverse relationship with BMI (\u03b2 = -0.15, p < 0.001). For the commute corridor food environment, it was found that each additional fast-food restaurant in a vicinity of one kilometer traveled contributed to a higher BMI (\u03b2 = 0.80, p <0.05), while adjusting for other factors. No statistical associations were found between BMI and worksite food environment. CONCLUSIONS: The current study was the first to examine the relationship between BMI and food environments around residential neighborhoods, work neighborhoods, and the commuting corridor. Significant results were found between BMI and the availability of food stores around residential neighborhoods and the commuting corridor, adjusted for individual-level factors. This study expands the analysis beyond residential neighborhoods, illustrating the importance of multiple environmental factors in relation to BMI. ",
        "Welding fumes and lung cancer: a meta-analysis of case-control and cohort studies. BACKGROUND: An estimated 110\u2009million workers are exposed to welding fumes worldwide. Welding fumes are classified by the International Agency for Research on Cancer as carcinogenic to humans (group 1), based on sufficient evidence of lung cancer from epidemiological studies. OBJECTIVE: To conduct a meta-analysis of case-control and cohort studies on welding or exposure to welding fumes and risk of lung cancer, accounting for confounding by exposure to asbestos and tobacco smoking. METHODS: The literature was searched comprehensively in PubMed, reference lists of relevant publications and additional databases. Overlapping populations were removed. Meta-relative risks (mRRs) were calculated using random effects models. Publication bias was assessed using funnel plot, Eggers's test and Begg's test. RESULTS: Forty-five studies met the inclusion criteria (20 case-control, 25 cohort/nested case-control), which reduced to 37 when overlapping study populations were removed. For 'ever' compared with 'never' being a welder or exposed to welding fumes, mRRs and 95% CIs were 1.29 (1.20 to 1.39; I2=26.4%; 22 studies) for cohort studies, 1.87 (1.53 to 2.29; I2=44.1%; 15 studies) for case-control studies and 1.17 (1.04 to 1.38; I2=41.2%) for 8 case-control studies that adjusted for smoking and asbestos exposure. The mRRs were 1.32 (95% CI 1.20 to 1.45; I2=6.3%; 15 studies) among 'shipyard welders', 1.44 (95% CI 1.07 to 1.95; I2=35.8%; 3 studies) for 'mild steel welders' and 1.38 (95% CI 0.89 to 2.13; I2=68.1%; 5 studies) among 'stainless steel welders'. Increased risks persisted regardless of time period, geographic location, study design, occupational setting, exposure assessment method and histological subtype. CONCLUSIONS: These results support the conclusion that exposure to welding fumes increases the risk of lung cancer, regardless of the type of steel welded, the welding method (arc vs gas welding) and independent of exposure to asbestos or tobacco smoking.

        "Mental health conditions diagnosed before bilateral oophorectomy: a population-based case-control study. OBJECTIVE: We studied eight mental health conditions diagnosed before bilateral oophorectomy performed for nonmalignant indications. METHODS: We identified 1,653 premenopausal women who underwent bilateral oophorectomy for a nonmalignant indication in Olmsted County, Minnesota, during a 20-year period (1988-2007). Each woman was matched by age (\u00b11 year) to one population-based control who had not undergone bilateral oophorectomy before the index date (age range: 21-49 years). Both cases and controls were identified using the records-linkage system of the Rochester Epidemiology Project (REP http://www.rochesterproject.org). For eight mental health conditions, we calculated odds ratios (ORs) and their 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) adjusted for race, education, and income using conditional logistic regression. RESULTS: Pre-existing mood disorders, anxiety disorders, and somatoform disorders were associated with increased risk of bilateral oophorectomy in overall analyses. These associations were also significant in women \u226445 years of age at index date. Personality disorders were associated with increased risk only in overall analyses and adjustment disorders only in women 46 to 49 years of age. Some of the associations were significantly different across strata by age at index date and by indication. There was also a linear trend of increasing adjusted ORs from 1.55 (95% CI 1.31-1.83) for one mental health condition to 2.19 (95% CI 1.40-3.41) for three or more conditions (trend P\u200a<\u200a0.001). CONCLUSIONS: We identified several mental health conditions that were associated with bilateral oophorectomy for nonmalignant indications. Awareness of these associations may guide women and physicians in future decision-making and limit unindicated bilateral oophorectomies. VIDEO SUMMARY:: http://links.lww.com/MENO/A458. ",
        "Women Firefighters' Health and Well-Being: An International Survey. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to identify specific health and well-being issues that women firefighters may experience as part of their daily working practices. Issues identified from this under-represented population can drive future research, education, and strategy to guide safety and health practices. METHODS: A total of 840 women firefighters from 14 separate countries (255 United Kingdom and Ireland, 320 North America, 177 Australasia, and 88 mainland Europe) completed the survey over a 4-month period. Questions related to general health and well-being and role-specific health concerns, gender-related issues, and available exercise facilities. RESULTS: Women firefighters in North America reported a higher prevalence of lower back (49%) and lower limb (51%) injuries than all other groups. North American respondents reported more heat illnesses (45%) than respondents from other places (36%). Although many participants did not respond, of those who did, 39% thought the menstrual cycle (199/512) or menopause (55/151) affected their work, and 36% were concerned for their ability to meet future job demands. Sixteen percent felt confident they could complete the role after 60\u00a0years of age. Women firefighters identified a lack of strength and conditioning support (50%) or lack of gym access (21%). There appears to be poor availability of female-specific personal protective equipment, with availability greatest in the United Kingdom (66%) compared with the sample as a whole (42%). CONCLUSIONS: There is a need for female-specific strength and conditioning support and facilities to decrease injury and illness risk and improve longevity. Research and education into gynecological issues, heat exposure, and their effects on women firefighters' fertility and cancer risk is required. ",
        "Prevalence of human papillomavirus infection, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia and cervical cancer in imprisoned women worldwide: a systematic review and meta-analysis. BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Imprisoned women have higher rates of abnormalities at cervical screening and some studies suggest that cervical cancer is the most common cancer in this population. The aim of this work was to summarise the current evidence on the prevalence of human papilloma virus (HPV) infection, cervical cancer and precancerous lesions in women in prison worldwide and to compare these rates with the general population. METHODS: We systematically searched and reviewed published and unpublished data reporting the prevalence of any HPV infection, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) and cervical cancer in imprisoned women. We created forest plots with prevalence estimates from studies with comparable outcomes and of prevalence ratios using data from national screening programmes as a comparison group. FINDINGS: A total of 53 533 imprisoned women from 10 countries and 35 studies were included in the review. The prevalence of HPV among prisoners ranged from 10.5% to 55.4% with significant heterogeneity. The prevalence of CIN diagnosed by cytology in prisoners ranged from 0% to 22%. Ratios comparing the prevalence of CIN in imprisoned women to that in the community ranged from 1.13 to 5.46. Cancer prevalence estimates were at least 100 times higher than in populations participating in national screening programmes. CONCLUSION: Imprisoned women are at higher risk of cervical cancer than the general population. There is a high prevalence of HPV infection and precancerous lesions in this population. Targeted programmes for control of risk factors and the development of more effective cervical screening programmes are recommended. PROSPERO REGISTRATION NUMBER: CRD42014009690. ",
        "Trends in Substance Use Prevention Program Participation Among Adolescents in the U.S. PURPOSE: The aim of the article was to examine national trends in adolescent participation in substance use prevention programs (SUPP). METHODS: We examine 15 years of cross-sectional data (2002-2016) from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health. Main outcomes were participation in past-year school and community-based SUPP (no/yes). Logistic regression was used to examine trends in the prevalence of participation. RESULTS: Participation in school-based SUPP decreased significantly from 48% among adolescents in 2002-2003 to 40% in 2015-2016, a 16.5% proportional decline. Significant declines for school-based participation were observed in all demographic and drug involvement subgroups examined. Youth participation in community-based SUPP also decreased significantly. However, this downward trend was significant only among younger teens, females, youth in very low (<$20,000) and moderate ($40,000-$74,999) income households and in rural areas. CONCLUSIONS: Participation in SUPP has decreased since the early 2000s, with noteworthy declines among Latino youth and youth from rural areas and socioeconomically disadvantaged backgrounds. ",
        "Update on triple-negative breast cancer disparities for the United States: A population-based study from the United States Cancer Statistics database, 2010 through 2014. BACKGROUND: Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) has been associated with a more aggressive histology, poorer prognosis, and nonresponsiveness to hormone therapy. It is imperative that cancer research identify factors that drive disparities and focus on prevention. METHODS: Using the United States Cancer Statistics database, the authors examined differences between TNBCs compared with all other breast cancers with regard to age, race/ethnicity, and stage at diagnosis. RESULTS: A total of 1,151,724 cases of breast cancer were identified from 2010 through 2014, with the triple-negative phenotype accounting for approximately 8.4% of all cases. In unadjusted analyses, non-Hispanic black women (odds ratio [OR], 2.27; 95% CI, 2.23-2.31) and Hispanic women (OR, 1.22; 95% CI, 1.19-1.25) had higher odds of diagnosis when compared with non-Hispanic white women. Women aged <40\u00a0years had the highest odds of diagnosis compared with women aged 50 to 64\u00a0years (OR, 1.95; 95% CI, 1.90-2.01). Diagnosis at American Joint Committee on Cancer stage III and beyond conferred higher odds of the diagnosis of TNBC (OR for stage III, 1.69 [95% CI, 1.68-1.72]; and OR for stage IV, 1.47 [95% CI, 1.43-1.51]). Results varied slightly in adjusted analyses. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the current study demonstrated that there is a significant burden of disease in TNBC diagnosed among women of color, specifically non-Hispanic black women, and younger women. Additional studies are needed to determine drivers of disparities between race, age, and stage of disease at diagnosis. ",
        "Patient-Physician Agreement in Reporting and Prioritizing Existing Chronic Conditions. PURPOSE: In this study, we aimed to assess (1) the agreement between patient self-reports and general practitioner (GP) reports of the chronic conditions affecting the patients and (2) the agreement between patients and GPs on health priorities in a primary care setting. METHOD: Patients were recruited in the Parisian area of France by a convenience sample of GPs; eligibility criteria required that the GP was the patient's listed primary care provider for at least 12 months. Participants were asked to report all the patient's current chronic conditions by using a previously developed list of 124 chronic conditions and write a list of up to 3 priority conditions. RESULTS: From April to May 2017, 233 patients were recruited from 16 GP practices. Agreement between the number of conditions reported by patients and by GPs was moderate (intraclass correlation coefficient 0.59, 95% CI, 0.50 to 0.69). Agreement between patient self-reports and GP reports of each chronic condition ranged from very good (eg, \u03ba = 0.85 for hypothyroidism) to poor (eg, \u03ba = 0.12 for chronic anxiety disorder). Among the 153 patient-GP pairs for which both the patient and GP wrote a priority list, 45 (29.4%) of patients' first priorities did not appear anywhere on the corresponding GPs' lists, and 19 (12.4%) pairs had no matching priority condition. CONCLUSIONS: Agreement between patients and their GPs varied widely depending on the diseases reported. Low agreement on health priorities suggests a need for improvement to ensure better alignment between patient and physician perspectives. ",
        "Cancer treatment and survivorship statistics, 2019. The number of cancer survivors continues to increase in the United States because of the growth and aging of the population as well as advances in early detection and treatment. To assist the public health community in better serving these individuals, the American Cancer Society and the National Cancer Institute collaborate every 3\u00a0years to estimate cancer prevalence in the United States using incidence and survival data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results cancer registries; vital statistics from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Center for Health Statistics; and population projections from the US Census Bureau. Current treatment patterns based on information in the National Cancer Data Base are presented for the most prevalent cancer types. Cancer-related and treatment-related short-term, long-term, and late health effects are also briefly described. More than 16.9\u00a0million Americans (8.1\u00a0million males and 8.8\u00a0million females) with a history of cancer were alive on January 1, 2019; this number is projected to reach more than 22.1\u00a0million by January 1, 2030 based on the growth and aging of the population alone. The 3 most prevalent cancers in 2019 are prostate (3,650,030), colon and rectum (776,120), and melanoma of the skin (684,470) among males, and breast (3,861,520), uterine corpus (807,860), and colon and rectum (768,650) among females. More than one-half (56%) of survivors were diagnosed within the past 10\u00a0years, and almost two-thirds (64%) are aged 65\u00a0years or older. People with a history of cancer have unique medical and psychosocial needs that require proactive assessment and management by follow-up care providers. Although there are growing numbers of tools that can assist patients, caregivers, and clinicians in navigating the various phases of cancer survivorship, further evidence-based resources are needed to optimize care.

        "Medication Use to Reduce Risk of Breast Cancer: US Preventive Services Task Force Recommendation Statement. Importance: Breast cancer is the most common nonskin cancer among women in the United States and the second leading cause of cancer death. The median age at diagnosis is 62 years, and an estimated 1 in 8 women will develop breast cancer at some point in their lifetime. African American women are more likely to die of breast cancer compared with women of other races. Objective: To update the 2013 US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendation on medications for risk reduction of primary breast cancer. Evidence Review: The USPSTF reviewed evidence on the accuracy of risk assessment methods to identify women who could benefit from risk-reducing medications for breast cancer, as well as evidence on the effectiveness, adverse effects, and subgroup variations of these medications. The USPSTF reviewed evidence from randomized trials, observational studies, and diagnostic accuracy studies of risk stratification models in women without preexisting breast cancer or ductal carcinoma in situ. Findings: The USPSTF found convincing evidence that risk assessment tools can predict the number of cases of breast cancer expected to develop in a population. However, these risk assessment tools perform modestly at best in discriminating between individual women who will or will not develop breast cancer. The USPSTF found convincing evidence that risk-reducing medications (tamoxifen, raloxifene, or aromatase inhibitors) provide at least a moderate benefit in reducing risk for invasive estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer in postmenopausal women at increased risk for breast cancer. The USPSTF found that the benefits of taking tamoxifen, raloxifene, and aromatase inhibitors to reduce risk for breast cancer are no greater than small in women not at increased risk for the disease. The USPSTF found convincing evidence that tamoxifen and raloxifene and adequate evidence that aromatase inhibitors are associated with small to moderate harms. Overall, the USPSTF determined that the net benefit of taking medications to reduce risk of breast cancer is larger in women who have a greater risk for developing breast cancer. Conclusions and Recommendation: The USPSTF recommends that clinicians offer to prescribe risk-reducing medications, such as tamoxifen, raloxifene, or aromatase inhibitors, to women who are at increased risk for breast cancer and at low risk for adverse medication effects. (B recommendation) The USPSTF recommends against the routine use of risk-reducing medications, such as tamoxifen, raloxifene, or aromatase inhibitors, in women who are not at increased risk for breast cancer. (D recommendation) This recommendation applies to asymptomatic women 35 years and older, including women with previous benign breast lesions on biopsy (such as atypical ductal or lobular hyperplasia and lobular carcinoma in situ). This recommendation does not apply to women who have a current or previous diagnosis of breast cancer or ductal carcinoma in situ. Medication Use for the Risk Reduction of Primary Breast Cancer in Women: Updated Evidence Report and Systematic Review for the US Preventive Services Task Force. Importance: Medications to reduce risk of breast cancer are effective for women at increased risk but also cause adverse effects. Objective: To update the 2013 US Preventive Services Task Force systematic review on medications to reduce risk of primary (first diagnosis) invasive breast cancer in women. Data Sources: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and Database of Systematic Reviews, EMBASE, and MEDLINE (January 1, 2013, to February 1, 2019); manual review of reference lists. Study Selection: Discriminatory accuracy studies of breast cancer risk assessment methods; randomized clinical trials of tamoxifen, raloxifene, and aromatase inhibitors for primary breast cancer prevention; studies of medication adverse effects. Data Extraction and Synthesis: Investigators abstracted data on methods, participant characteristics, eligibility criteria, outcome ascertainment, and follow-up. Results of individual trials were combined by using a profile likelihood random-effects model. Main Outcomes and Measures: Probability of breast cancer in individuals (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC]); incidence of breast cancer, fractures, thromboembolic events, coronary heart disease events, stroke, endometrial cancer, and cataracts; and mortality. Results: A total of 46 studies (82 articles [>5 million participants]) were included. Eighteen risk assessment methods in 25 studies reported low accuracy in predicting the probability of breast cancer in individuals (AUC, 0.55-0.65). In placebo-controlled trials, tamoxifen (risk ratio [RR], 0.69 [95% CI, 0.59-0.84]; 4 trials [n\u2009=\u200928\u202f421]), raloxifene (RR, 0.44 [95% CI, 0.24-0.80]; 2 trials [n\u2009=\u200917\u202f806]), and the aromatase inhibitors exemestane and anastrozole (RR, 0.45 [95% CI, 0.26-0.70]; 2 trials [n\u2009=\u20098424]) were associated with a lower incidence of invasive breast cancer. Risk for invasive breast cancer was higher for raloxifene than tamoxifen in 1 trial after long-term follow-up (RR, 1.24 [95% CI, 1.05-1.47]; n\u2009=\u200919\u202f747). Raloxifene was associated with lower risk for vertebral fractures (RR, 0.61 [95% CI, 0.53-0.73]; 2 trials [n\u2009=\u200916\u202f929]) and tamoxifen was associated with lower risk for nonvertebral fractures (RR, 0.66 [95% CI, 0.45-0.98]; 1 trial [n\u2009=\u200913\u202f388]) compared with placebo. Tamoxifen and raloxifene were associated with increased thromboembolic events compared with placebo; tamoxifen was associated with more events than raloxifene. Tamoxifen was associated with higher risk of endometrial cancer and cataracts compared with placebo. Symptomatic effects (eg, vasomotor, musculoskeletal) varied by medication. Conclusions and Relevance: Tamoxifen, raloxifene, and aromatase inhibitors were associated with lower risk of primary invasive breast cancer in women but also were associated with adverse effects that differed between medications. Risk stratification methods to identify patients with increased breast cancer risk demonstrated low accuracy. ",
        "Breast cancer deaths averted over 3 decades. BACKGROUND: From 1975 to 1990, female breast cancer mortality rates in the United States increased by 0.4% per year. Since 1990, breast cancer mortality rates have fallen between 1.8% and 3.4% per year, a decrease that is attributed to increased mammography screening and improved treatment. METHODS: The authors used age-adjusted female breast cancer mortality rate and population data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program to estimate the number of breast cancer deaths averted by screening mammography and improved treatment since 1989. Four different assumptions regarding background mortality rates (in the absence of screening mammography and improved treatment) were used to estimate deaths averted for women aged 40 to 84 years by taking the difference between SEER-reported mortality rates and background mortality rates for each 5-year age group, multiplied by the population for each 5-year age group. SEER data were used to estimate annual and cumulative breast cancer deaths averted in 2012 and 2015 and extrapolated SEER data were used to estimate deaths averted in 2018. RESULTS: The number of single-year breast cancer deaths averted ranged from 20,860 to 33,842 in 2012, from 23,703 to 39,415 in 2015, and from 27,083 to 45,726 in 2018. Breast cancer mortality reductions ranged from 38.6% to 50.5% in 2012, from 41.5% to 54.2% in 2015, and from 45.3% to 58.3% in 2018. Cumulative breast cancer deaths averted since 1989 ranged from 237,234 to 370,402 in 2012, from 305,934 to 483,435 in 2015, and from 384,046 to 614,484 in 2018. CONCLUSIONS: Since 1989, between 384,000 and 614,500 breast cancer deaths have been averted through the use of mammography screening and improved treatment. ",
        "Type 2 Diabetes, but Not Insulin (Analog) Treatment, Is Associated With More Advanced Stages of Breast Cancer: A National Linkage of Cancer and Pharmacy Registries. OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether women with type 2 diabetes (T2D) develop a more advanced stage of breast cancer and whether treatment with insulin (analogs) is associated with specific breast cancer characteristics. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: For this nested case-control study, women with breast cancer diagnosed in 2002-2014 were selected from the linked Netherlands Cancer Registry-PHARMO Database Network (N = 33,377). T2D was defined as receiving two or more dispensings of noninsulin blood glucose-lowering drugs prior to breast cancer diagnosis. Women with T2D were matched to women without diabetes. Among women with T2D, insulin users and nonusers were compared. Multivariable ordinal logistic regression was used to investigate the association between T2D/insulin and breast cancer characteristics, including TNM classification (tumor size, lymph node status, metastasis), morphology, grade, estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor (PR), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2, and molecular subtype. RESULTS: Women with T2D (n = 1,567) were more often diagnosed with a more advanced tumor stage (odds ratio 1.28 [95% CI 13-1.44]) and a higher grade (1.22 [1.08-1.39]) though less often with a PR-negative breast tumor (0.77 [0.67-0.89]) than women without diabetes (n = 6,267). No associations were found for the other breast cancer characteristics. Women with T2D using insulin (n = 388) were not diagnosed with different breast cancer characteristics compared with women with T2D not using insulin (n = 1,179). CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that women with T2D are at increased risk to be diagnosed with a more aggressive type of breast cancer than women without diabetes. No evidence was found that the use of insulin (analogs) is associated with developing more advanced breast cancer tumors. ",
        "Effect of home-based music intervention versus ambient music on breast cancer survivors in the community: A feasibility study in Taiwan. To explore the effects of home-based music intervention (HBMI) on symptom severity, pain intensity and perceived fatigue among patients with breast cancer. In this randomised controlled trial, patients with breast cancer were randomly assigned into an HBMI or control group. The HBMI group was administered 24-week HBMI involving five 30-min sessions per week. The primary outcome was symptom severity; the secondary outcomes were pain and fatigue. A generalised estimating equation was employed to compare the effects after 6, 12 and 24\u00a0weeks of intervention between the two groups. A total of 60 patients were recruited. After 6, 12 and 24\u00a0weeks, HBMI significantly reduced symptom severity, pain intensity, overall fatigue, general fatigue, emotional fatigue and vigour (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Additionally, HBMI significantly reduced physical fatigue after 6 (p\u00a0=\u00a00.003) and 12 (p\u00a0=\u00a00.013) weeks and mental fatigue after 6\u00a0weeks (p\u00a0=\u00a00.001). After 6, 12 and 24\u00a0weeks, HBMI reduced symptom severity, pain intensity and overall fatigue. Furthermore, HBMI instantaneously reduced physical and mental fatigue. We recommend that HBMI be administered to patients with breast cancer to reduce their negative thoughts associated with cancer. ",
        "Nordic walking for women with breast cancer: A systematic review. Nordic walking (NW) seems to be an interesting rehabilitation strategy for women with breast cancer (BC). No review article that has synthesised and summarised the existing scientific evidence about the effect of NW on BC survivors has been published so far. A systematic review was conducted aimed at identifying the characteristics and methodological quality of the studies that have analysed the effects of NW on women with BC. The critical appraisal of the randomised controlled trials (RCTs) was retrieved from the Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro). The methodological quality of the uncontrolled studies was evaluated by means of the Quality Assessment Tool for Before-After Studies with No Control Group. Nine investigations (four RCTs and five quasi-experimental studies) were included in the final analysis. The RCTs showed a fair methodological quality, while the quasi-experimental studies obtained a score ranging from \"fair\" to \"poor\". Judging from the findings of the analysed studies, NW had a significant and positive impact on a number of BC symptoms, including lymphedema, physical fitness, disability and morbid perceptions. No adverse effects were reported. However, due to the methodological limitations observed, further research is needed to confirm such findings. ",
        "Gendered and racialized social expectations, barriers, and delayed breast cancer diagnosis. BACKGROUND: Black women are more likely to be diagnosed at a later stage of breast cancer in part due to barriers to timely screening mammography, resulting in poorer mortality and survival outcomes. Patient navigation that helps to overcome barriers to the early detection of breast cancer is an effective intervention for reducing breast cancer disparity. However, the ability to recognize and seek help to overcome barriers may be affected by gendered and racialized social expectations of women. METHODS: Data from a randomized controlled trial, the Patient Navigation in Medically Underserved Areas study, were used. The likelihood of obtaining a follow-up screening mammogram was compared between women who identified \u22651 barriers and those who did not. RESULTS: Of the 3754 women who received the Patient Navigation in Medically Underserved Areas navigation intervention, approximately 14% identified\u2009\u2265\u20091 barriers, which led to additional navigator contacts. Consequently, those women who reported barriers were more likely to obtain a subsequent screening mammogram. Black women, women living in poverty, and women with a higher level of distrust were less likely to report barriers. CONCLUSIONS: Minority women living in poverty have always been the source of social support for others. However, gendered and racialized social expectations may affect the ways in which women seek help for their own health needs. A way to improve the effectiveness of navigation would be to recognize how minority women's gender images and expectations could shape how they seek help and support. A report of no barriers does not always translate into no problems. Proactive approaches to identify potential barriers may be beneficial. ",
        "Causes of death after breast cancer diagnosis: A US population-based analysis. BACKGROUND: The focus on noncancer causes of death in patients with breast cancer (BC) remains superficial. The objective of the current study was to assess and quantify causes of death after BC diagnosis. METHODS: In total, 754,270 women with BC in the United States who were diagnosed during 2000 through 2015 and retrieved from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program were studied. Standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) for causes of death were calculated. RESULTS: Of the included patients, 183,002 (24.3%) died during the follow-up period. The greatest proportion of deaths (46.2%) occurred within 1 to 5\u00a0years after diagnosis. Most deaths occurred from BC itself or from other cancers, and the number of BC deaths decreased as more years passed after diagnosis. The most common noncancer causes of death within <10\u00a0years after diagnosis were heart diseases followed by cerebrovascular diseases. However, >10\u00a0years after diagnosis, the most common noncancer causes of death were heart diseases followed by Alzheimer disease. Patients had a statistically significant higher risk of death from chronic liver diseases within 5 to 10\u00a0years after diagnosis compared with the general population (SMR, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.09-1.38) and had statistically significant higher risks of death from Alzheimer disease (SMR, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.14-1.29) and from diseases of the heart (SMR, 1.06; 95% CI, 1.02-1.09) >10\u00a0years after diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: Although BC remains the most common cause of death after BC diagnosis, other non-BC causes of death (mainly heart and cerebrovascular diseases) represent a significant number of deaths among patients with BC. These findings provide important insight into how BC survivors should be counselled regarding future health risks. ",
        "The effect of entry and retention in opioid agonist treatment on contact with the criminal justice system among opioid-dependent people: a retrospective cohort study. BACKGROUND: Evidence on the effectiveness of opioid agonist treatment (OAT) in reducing crime is mixed. We aimed to assess the effect of OAT on crime in terms of delaying time to first charge and reducing overall charge rates, as well as the relationship between OAT retention and overall charge rates. METHODS: We did a retrospective cohort study of opioid-dependent people who entered OAT for the first time between Jan 1, 2004, and Dec 30, 2010, in New South Wales (NSW), Australia. We used three linked NSW and national administrative datasets. Data on OAT were obtained from the Pharmaceutical Drugs of Addiction System, data on charges were obtained from the Reoffending Database, and data on mortality were obtained from the National Death Index. The cohort was followed up until Dec 31, 2011. Time-dependent OAT exposure was modelled using Cox proportional hazards models (time to first charge) and Andersen-Gill intensity models (total charge-days). Retention in OAT was modelled using two features of treatment engagement, number of OAT episodes and proportion of follow-up time in OAT (presented in quartile groupings: lowest, low-mid, low-high, highest) using zero-inflated negative binomial regression (total charges). All models were adjusted for sociodemographic, criminographic, and treatment-related variables. FINDINGS: 10\u2008744 new OAT entrants were included in the study. 5751 (53\u00b75%) people were charged with an offence. In adjusted analyses, OAT was associated with an initial benefit in delaying the time to first charge (hazard ratio 0\u00b743, 95% CI 0\u00b733-0\u00b755) and reducing total charge-days (0\u00b739, 95% CI 0\u00b730-0\u00b752); however, these protective effects reduced over time. Total charge rates were higher as the number of OAT episodes increased (incident rate ratio [IRR] 1\u00b713, 95% CI 1\u00b711-1\u00b715), and when relatively lower proportions of time were spent in OAT (IRR among the lowest three quartiles ranged from 1\u00b711 [95% CI 1\u00b702-1\u00b721] to 1\u00b722 [95% CI 1\u00b712-1\u00b733]). INTERPRETATION: OAT was associated with a reduction in overall charge rates and was more protective as treatment engagement increased. Maximising treatment retention is crucial to achieving long-term health and social benefits of OAT.

        "Weight loss and breast cancer incidence in postmenopausal women. BACKGROUND: Although obesity is an established risk factor for postmenopausal breast cancer, the results of weight loss and breast cancer studies are inconsistent. Therefore, we evaluated associations between weight change and breast cancer risk in postmenopausal women in the Women's Health Initiative Observational Study. METHODS: Postmenopausal women (n = 61,335) who had no prior breast cancer and a normal mammogram had body weight and height measured and body mass index (BMI) calculated at baseline and year 3. Weight change at year 3 was categorized as stable (<5%), loss (\u22655%), or gain (\u22655%) with further assessment of weight loss intentionality by self-report. Multivariable Cox proportional hazard regression models were used to evaluate relationships between weight change and subsequent breast cancer incidence. RESULTS: During a mean follow-up of 11.4 years with 3061 incident breast cancers, women with weight loss (n = 8175) had a significantly lower risk of breast cancer compared with women whose weight remained stable (n = 41,139) (hazard ratio [HR], 0.88; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.78-0.98; P = .02) with no interaction by BMI. Adjustment for mammography did not alter findings (HR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.78-0.99) with no significant difference by weight loss intentionality. Weight gain (\u22655%) (n = 12,021) was not associated with breast cancer risk (HR, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.93-1.11) but was associated with higher triple-negative breast cancer incidence (HR, 1.54; 95% CI, 1.16-2.05). CONCLUSIONS: Postmenopausal women who lose weight have lower breast cancer risk than those with stable weight. These findings suggest that postmenopausal women who lose weight may reduce their breast cancer risk. ",
        "US FDA Breast Implant Postapproval Studies: Long-term Outcomes in 99,993 Patients. OBJECTIVE: To analyze the long-term safety and efficacy outcomes of patients with breast implants. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Research is ongoing regarding the safety of silicone breast implants. Despite the number of patients with breast implants followed by United States Food and Drug Administration large postapproval studies (LPAS), this database has not been thoroughly analyzed or reported. METHODS: This is a multicentered, cohort study. LPAS prospectively monitor long-term implant-related outcomes and systemic harms for silicone/saline implants from 2 manufacturers (Allergan and Mentor) placed for primary/revision augmentation/reconstruction. Systemic harms, self-harm, and reproductive outcomes are compared with normative data. Implant-related complications are analyzed by implant composition and operative indication in the short and long terms. RESULTS: LPAS data includes 99,993 patients, 56% of implants were silicone for primary augmentation. Long-term magnetic resonance imaging surveillance is under 5%. Compared with normative data, silicone implants are associated with higher rates of Sjogren syndrome (Standardized incidence ratio [SIR]8.14), scleroderma (SIR 7.00), rheumatoid arthritis (SIR5.96), stillbirth (SIR4.50), and melanoma (SIR3.71). One case of BI-ALCL is reported. There is no association with suicide. In the short term, rupture is higher for saline (2.5% vs. 0.5%, P < 0.001), and capsular contracture higher for silicone (5.0% vs. 2.8%, P < 0.001). At 7 years, reoperation rate is 11.7% for primary augmentation, and 25% for primary/revision reconstruction. Capsular contracture (III/IV) occurs in 7.2% of primary augmentations, 12.7% primary reconstructions, and is the most common reason for reoperation among augmentations. CONCLUSIONS: This is the largest study of breast implant outcomes. Silicone implants are associated with an increased risk of certain rare harms; associations need to be further analyzed with patient-level data to provide conclusive evidence. Long-term safety and implant-related outcomes should inform patient and surgeon decision-making when selecting implants. ",
        "Bullying, pain and analgesic use in school-age children. AIM: The aim of this study was to examine whether the self-reported use of analgesics is associated with being a victim of bullying. METHODS: This cross-sectional, school-based survey included all students in grades 6 (11\u00a0years old), 8 (13\u00a0years old) and 10 (15\u00a0years old) in Iceland (response rate: 84%; n\u00a0=\u00a011\u00a0018). The students filled out an anonymous standardised questionnaire: the Icelandic Contribution to the International Health Behavior in School-Aged Children (HBSC) Study. RESULTS: Being bullied was associated with increased use of analgesics even after controlling for self-reported pain. CONCLUSION: Bullying occurs in all schools, and its effects on health are pervasive. Interventions aimed at reducing bullying and promoting health in schools are important and may reduce the use of analgesics in adolescents. ",
        "Effects of physical activity calorie equivalent food labelling to reduce food selection and consumption: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled studies. BACKGROUND: There is limited evidence that nutritional labelling on food/drinks is changing eating behaviours. Physical activity calorie equivalent (PACE) food labelling aims to provide the public with information about the amount of physical activity required to expend the number of kilocalories in food/drinks (eg, calories in this pizza requires 45\u2009min of running to burn), to encourage healthier food choices and reduce disease. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to systematically search for randomised controlled trials and experimental studies of the effects of PACE food labelling on the selection, purchase or consumption of food/drinks. METHODS: PACE food labelling was compared with any other type of food labelling or no labelling (comparator). Reports were identified by searching electronic databases, websites and social media platforms. Inverse variance meta-analysis was used to summarise evidence. Weighted mean differences (WMD) and 95% CIs were used to describe between-group differences using a random effects model. RESULTS: 15 studies were eligible for inclusion. When PACE labelling was displayed on food/drinks and menus, significantly fewer calories were selected, relative to comparator labelling (WMD=-64.9 kcal, 95%\u2009CI -103.2 to -26.6, p=0.009, n=4606). Presenting participants with PACE food labelling results in the consumption of significantly fewer calories (WMD=-80.4 kcal, 95%\u2009CI-136.7 to -24.2, p=0.005, n=486) relative to comparator food labelling. CONCLUSION: Based on current evidence PACE food labelling may reduce the number of kilocalories selected from menus and decrease the number of kilocalories/grams of food consumed by the public, compared with other types of food labelling/no labelling.

        "Bariatric Surgery is Associated With Reduced Risk of Breast Cancer in Both Premenopausal and Postmenopausal Women. MINI: We examined risk of breast cancer among 17,998 women who had bariatric surgery and 53,889 women matched on body mass index with no surgery. We found bariatric surgery was associated with a reduced risk of both premenopausal [hazard ratio (HR) = 0.72, 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.54-0.94] and postmenopausal (HR = 0.55, 95% CI, 0.42-0.72) breast cancer. This retrospective cohort study examined whether bariatric surgery is associated with reduced risk of breast cancer among pre- and postmenopausal women. Obesity is associated with increased risk of breast cancer, but the impact of weight loss on breast cancer risk has been difficult to quantify. The cohort included obese (body mass index \u226535\u200akg/m) patients enrolled in an integrated health care delivery system between 2005 and 2012 (with follow-up through 2014). Female bariatric surgery patients (N = 17,998) were matched on body mass index, age, study site, and comorbidity index to 53,889 women with no bariatric surgery. Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox proportional hazards models were used to examine incident breast cancer up to 10 years after bariatric surgery. Pre- and postmenopausal women were examined separately, and further classified by estrogen receptor (ER) status. The analysis included 301 premenopausal and 399 postmenopausal breast cancer cases. In multivariable adjusted models, bariatric surgery was associated with a reduced risk of both premenopausal (HR = 0.72, 95% CI, 0.54-0.94) and postmenopausal (HR = 0.55, 95% CI, 0.42-0.72) breast cancer. Among premenopausal women, the effect of bariatric surgery was more pronounced among ER-negative cases (HR = 0.36, 95% CI, 0.16-0.79). Among postmenopausal women, the effect was more pronounced in ER-positive cases (HR = 0.52, 95% CI, 0.39-0.70). Bariatric surgery was associated with a reduced risk of breast cancer among severely obese women. These findings have significant public health relevance because the prevalence of obesity continues to rise, and few modifiable breast cancer risk factors have been identified, especially for premenopausal women.

        "Medical financial hardship among cancer survivors in the United States. BACKGROUND: The current study examined medical financial hardship in cancer survivors and those without a cancer history in the United States. METHODS: The 2013 to 2016 National Health Interview Survey was used to identify cancer survivors (stratified by ages 18-49 years [1424 survivors], ages 50-64 years [2916 survivors], and ages \u226565 years [6014 survivors]) and individuals without a cancer history (ages 18-64 years [66,951 individuals], ages 50-64 years [31,741 individuals], and ages \u226565 years [25,744 individuals]). Medical financial hardship was categorized into 3 domains: 1) material (eg, problems paying medical bills); 2) psychological (eg, worrying about paying medical bills); and 3) behavioral (eg, delaying/forgoing care due to cost). Generalized ordinal logistic regressions were used to examine the associations between cancer history, hardship, and health insurance deductibles/health savings accounts (among privately insured cancer survivors aged 18-64 years only). RESULTS: Compared with those without a cancer history, cancer survivors were more likely to report any material (ages 18-49 years: 43.4% vs 30.1%; ages 50-64 years: 32.8% vs 27.8%; and ages \u226565 years: 17.3% vs 14.7%), psychological (ages 18-49 years: 53.5% vs 47.1%), and behavioral (ages 18-49 years: 30.6% vs 21.8%; and ages 50-64 years: 27.2% vs 23.4%) measure of financial hardship, and multiple domains of hardship (age groups 18-49 years and 50-64 years; all P\u00a0<\u00a0.01). Among privately insured survivors, having a high-deductible health plan without a health savings account was found to be associated with greater hardship compared with having low-deductible insurance. CONCLUSIONS: Younger cancer survivors are particularly vulnerable to material, psychological, and behavioral medical financial hardship. Interventions designed to reduce financial hardship should consider multiple domains of hardship as well as insurance benefit design. ",
        "A randomized controlled trial of 24\u00a0weeks of varenicline for tobacco use among cancer patients: Efficacy, safety, and adherence. OBJECTIVE: Continuing to smoke after a cancer diagnosis undermines prognosis. Yet few trials have tested Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved tobacco use medications in this population. Extended use varenicline may represent an effective treatment for cancer patients who smoke given barriers to cessation including a prolonged time line for relapse. METHODS: A placebo-controlled randomized trial tested 12\u00a0weeks of varenicline plus 12\u00a0weeks of placebo (standard [ST]) vs 24\u00a0weeks of varenicline (extended [ET]) with seven counseling sessions for treatment-seeking cancer patients who smoke (N\u00a0=\u00a0207). Primary outcomes were 7-day biochemically confirmed abstinence at weeks 24 and 52. Treatment adherence and side effects, adverse and serious adverse events, and blood pressure were assessed. RESULTS: Point prevalence and continuous abstinence quit rates at weeks 24 and 52 were not significantly different across treatment arms (P's\u00a0>\u00a00.05). Adherence (43% of sample) significantly interacted with treatment arm for week 24 point prevalence (odds ratio [OR]\u00a0=\u00a02.31; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.15-4.63; P\u00a0=\u00a00.02) and continuous (OR\u00a0=\u00a05.82; 95% CI, 2.66-12.71; P\u00a0<\u00a00.001) abstinence. For both outcomes, adherent participants who received ET reported higher abstinence (60.5% and 44.2%) vs ST (44.7% and 27.7%), but differences in quit rates between arms were not significant for nonadherent participants (ET: 9.7% and 4.8%; ST: 12.7% and 10.9%). There were no significant differences between treatment arms on side effects, adverse and serious adverse events, and rates of high blood pressure (P's\u00a0>\u00a00.05). CONCLUSIONS: Compared with ST, ET varenicline does not increase patient risk and increases smoking cessation rates among patients who adhere to treatment. Studies are needed to identify effective methods to increase medication adherence to treat patient tobacco use effectively. ",
        "The course of cancer-related insomnia: don't expect it to disappear after cancer treatment. OBJECTIVE: The study aimed to examine the 12-month course of cancer-related insomnia (CRI) and to identify possible predictors for the prevalence and persistence of CRI. METHODS: This longitudinal multicenter study included N\u00a0=\u00a0405 patients with cancer (56% females, mean age: 58.6 years). CRI was measured by the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI). Socio-demographic and clinical data, as well as psychological parameters (Distress Thermometer, PHQ-9, GAD-7, and EORTC-Fatigue), were assessed at baseline (T1) and 12 months later (T2). RESULTS: In our sample, a high prevalence of relevant insomnia symptoms (49.4%, ISI\u00a0>\u00a07) was found, while a clinical insomnia diagnosis was verified in 12.8% (ISI\u00a0>\u00a014). When insomnia was present at T1, this problem was persistent after one year in 64%. At T2, however, significantly more women suffered from insomnia symptoms (53.3% women vs. 39.3% men; p\u00a0=\u00a00.003). Insomnia was associated with many clinical and psychological parameters, especially with fatigue (r\u00a0=\u00a00.5). Multiple regression analysis revealed that, in women, only insomnia at T1 was a significant predictor for insomnia at T2 (R2\u00a0=\u00a00.40; F(5)\u00a0=\u00a012.5; p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), whereas in men insomnia, depressive symptoms and the use of psychotropic drugs at T1 predicted the extent of insomnia at T2 (R2\u00a0=\u00a00.28; F(7)\u00a0=\u00a09.5; p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). In all participants, levels of distress, depression, and anxiety decreased from T1 to T2 (p's\u00a0<\u00a00.016). CONCLUSION: Insomnia is a common disorder in cancer patients. Although medical and psychological parameters improved during the 12-month course of cancer treatment, our results show that insomnia is highly persistent, especially in women. This indicates that adequate support for those affected is needed. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: DRKS00004860. ",
        "Suicidal death within a year of a cancer diagnosis: A population-based study. BACKGROUND: The suicide risk after a new cancer diagnosis remains a controversial issue. This study examines the suicide risk within the year after a cancer diagnosis. This is the largest study to assess recent trends in suicide risk after a cancer diagnosis. METHODS: Data were obtained from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program. All patients diagnosed with cancer between 2000 and 2014 were selected. The event was defined as death due to suicide within the first year after a cancer diagnosis, and patients who experienced the event after their diagnosis were observed. The observed/expected (O/E) ratio was assessed as well as the excess risk per 10,000 person-years to determine the suicide risk change after the diagnosis in comparison with the general population. RESULTS: A total of 4,671,989 patients with cancer were included; 1585 committed suicide within 1 year of their diagnosis. The risk of suicide increased significantly with an O/E ratio of 2.52 and with an excess risk of 2.51 per 10,000 person-years. When the risk of suicide was studied according to the cancer site, the highest increases in the O/E ratio came after diagnoses of pancreatic cancer (8.01) and lung cancer (6.05). The risk of suicide also increased significantly after a diagnosis of colorectal cancer with an O/E ratio of 2.08. However, the risk of suicidal death did not increase significantly after breast and prostate cancer diagnoses. CONCLUSIONS: The risk of suicide increases significantly in the first year after a diagnosis of cancer in comparison with the general population, and this increase varies with the type and prognosis of cancer. Close observation and referral to mental health services, when indicated, are important for mitigating such risk. ",
        "Physicians' perspectives on medication adherence and health promotion among cancer survivors. BACKGROUND: Cancer survivors face an increased risk of cardiovascular events compared with the general population. Adopting a healthy lifestyle may reduce these risks, and guidelines encourage health-promotion counseling for cancer survivors, but the extent of physician adherence is unclear. METHODS: This mixed-method study surveyed 91 physicians, including 30 primary care physicians (PCPs), 30 oncologists, and 31 specialists (urologists, dermatologists, and gynecologists). Interviews also were conducted with 12 oncologists. RESULTS: Most PCPs (90%) reported recommending health promotion (eg, weight loss, smoking cessation) to at least some cancer survivors, whereas few oncologists (26.7%) and specialists (9.7%) said they ever did so (P\u00a0<\u00a0.001). Although most physicians believed that at least 50% of cancer survivors would be adherent to medication regimens to prevent cancer recurrence, they also believed that, if patients were trying to lose weight, they would not remain medication-adherent. In interviews, oncologists expressed fear that providing health-promotion advice would distress or overwhelm patients. Additional health-promotion barriers identified by thematic analysis included: identifying cancer as oncologists' focal concern, time pressure, insufficient behavior change training, and care coordination challenges. Facilitators included perceiving a patient benefit and having health-promotion resources integrated into the cancer care system. CONCLUSIONS: Physicians often do not have the time, expertise, or resources to address health promotion with cancer survivors. Research is needed to evaluate whether health-promotion efforts compromise medical regimen adherence, as physicians' responses suggest. ",
        "Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder in elite athletes: a narrative review. Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common brain developmental disorder in the general population that may be even more prevalent in elite athletes in certain sports. General population studies of ADHD are extensive and have reported on prevalence, symptoms, therapeutic and adverse effects of treatment and new clinical and research findings. However, few studies have reported on prevalence, symptoms and treatments of ADHD in elite athletes. This narrative review summarises the literature on symptoms, comorbidities, effects of ADHD on performance and management options for elite athletes with ADHD. The prevalence of ADHD in student athletes and elite athletes may be 7%-8%. The symptoms and characteristics of ADHD play a role in athletes' choice of a sport career and further achieving elite status. Proper management of ADHD in elite athletes is important for safety and performance, and options include pharmacologic and psychosocial treatments. ",
        "Temporal trends in liver cancer mortality by educational attainment in the United States, 2000-2015. BACKGROUND: Liver cancer is the most rapidly rising cause of cancer death in the United States. However, it is unclear whether the mortality trend differs by socioeconomic and/or hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection status. METHODS: Joinpoint analyses and Poisson regression modeling were performed to examine trends in death rates from liver cancer by education and HCV infection status among persons aged 25 to 74\u00a0years from 2000 to 2015. Disparities in liver cancer mortality were measured as a relative index of inequality by education. RESULTS: From 2000 to 2015, the overall liver cancer death rate (per 100,000\u00a0persons) increased from 7.5 to 11.2 in men and from 2.8 to 3.8 in women. The increase was generally steeper in less educated groups for women and was confined to persons with \u226415\u00a0years of education for men. Consequently, the relative disparity increased until 2006 and then levelled off in women, whereas it continued to increase from 3.49 (95% CI, 3.08-3.97) to 7.74 (95% CI, 7.13-8.40) in men, with the increase more pronounced for HCV-related liver cancer than HCV-unrelated liver cancer. CONCLUSIONS: The increases in liver cancer death rates in the United States have largely been confined to less educated persons, especially among men. Enhanced and targeted efforts are needed to halt and reverse the undue growing burden of liver cancer in lower socioeconomic groups. ",
        "Effects of Cannabis Use on Sedation Requirements for Endoscopic Procedures. Context: Cannabis (or marijuana) became legal for recreational use in Colorado in 2012, and this legislation change has created both challenges and opportunities in medicine. More patients are using cannabis, and more patients are now willing to admit cannabis use than in the past, which increases the likelihood that they will be forthcoming about use during medical questioning. Cannabis use may have implications during medical care, including procedural sedation. Objective: To determine whether regular cannabis use had any effect on the dose of medication needed for sedation during endoscopic procedures. Methods: A total of 250 medical records were reviewed from 1 endoscopy center and 1 endoscopist to minimize the variability in sedation technique for the study purposes. The cohort was reviewed with regard to age and gender to determine whether differences were present among different groups as to the relative amount of sedation medication required in cannabis users vs nonusers. Results: Medical records from 250 patients were reviewed, and researchers found that compared with people who did not regularly use cannabis, people who regularly used cannabis required an amount of sedation for endoscopic procedures that was significantly higher (P=.05). The statistical significance persisted when adjusted for age, sex, and use of alcohol, benzodiazepines, and opiates. Conclusion: Determining cannabis use before procedural sedation can be an important tool for planning patient care and assessing both medication needs and possible risks related to increased dosage requirements during endoscopic procedures.

        "Cannabis in homes with children: use and storage practices in a legalised state. Our objective was to examine the prevalence of cannabis in homes with children and temporal trends in storage practices among caregivers. Caregivers of children ages 1-14 in Colorado, identified through a representative population-based telephone survey, participated in a repeated telephone survey from 2014 to 2017. Representing 79\u2009805 households in Colorado with children, 8.6% (95% CI 7.3 to 10.0) of caregivers reported cannabis in the home. From 2014 to 2017, the prevalence of reporting cannabis in the home increased significantly from 6.9% to 11.2% (p=0.02). Among caregivers who reported cannabis in the home, 91.4% reported storage locations inaccessible to children, such as 'out of reach'. Fewer, 67.0%, caregivers reported storage in a locked container, such as a cabinet, drawer or safe. In a state with recreational cannabis, an increasing number of children live in homes where cannabis is present. Public health practitioners should promote messages to caregivers about safe cannabis storage practices. ",
        "Home care aides' experiences of verbal abuse: a survey of characteristics and risk factors. OBJECTIVE: Violence from care recipients and family members, including both verbal and physical abuse, is a serious occupational hazard for healthcare and social assistance workers. Most workplace violence studies in this sector focus on hospitals and other institutional settings. This study examined verbal abuse in a large home care (HC) aide population and evaluated risk factors. METHODS: We used questionnaire survey data collected as part of a larger mixed methods study of a range of working conditions among HC aides. This paper focuses on survey responses of HC aides (n=954) who reported on verbal abuse from non-family clients and their family members. Risk factors were identified in univariate and multivariable analyses. RESULTS: Twenty-two per cent (n=206) of aides reported at least one incident of verbal abuse in the 12 months before the survey. Three factors were found to be important in multivariable models: clients with dementia (relative risk (RR) 1.38, 95%\u2009CI 1.07 to 1.78), homes with too little space for the aide to work (RR 1.52, 95%\u2009CI 1.17 to 1.97) and predictable work hours (RR 0.74, 95%\u2009CI 0.58 to 0.94); two additional factors were associated with verbal abuse, although not as strongly: having clients with limited mobility (RR 1.35, 95%\u2009CI 0.94 to 1.93) and an unclear plan for care delivery (RR 1.27, 95%\u2009CI 0.95 to 1.69). Aides reporting verbal abuse were 11 times as likely to also report physical abuse (RR 11.53; 95%\u2009CI 6.84 to 19.45). CONCLUSIONS: Verbal abuse is common among HC aides. These findings suggest specific changes in work organisation and training that may help reduce verbal abuse. ",
        "High Prevalence of Celiac Disease Among Screened First-Degree Relatives. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the prevalence of first-degree relatives (FDRs) with celiac disease detected at screening and diagnostic significance of anti-tissue transglutaminase (anti-TTG). PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study of 104 patients with a diagnosis of celiac disease and their FDRs, collecting data from electronic records of Mayo Clinic and celiac disease registry from December 20, 1983, to May 22, 2017. We collected demographics, presenting symptoms, indication for testing, family history, number of other family members screened, biopsy reports, and results of serologic tests. RESULTS: Of 477 FDRs identified, 360 were screened (mean screening rate per family, 79%\u00b125%) and 160 FDRs (44.4%) were diagnosed with celiac disease, at a mean age 31.9\u00b121.6 years (62% female). All diagnosed FDRs had positive anti-TTG titers. Clinical features were documented in 148 diagnosed FDRs, of those 9 (6%) had classic, 97 (66%) had non-classic symptoms, and 42(28%) had no reported symptoms. Histology reports were available from 155 FDRs: 12 (8%) had Marsh 1, 77 (50%) had Marsh 3a, and 66 (43%) had Marsh 3b. A level of anti-TTG greater than or equal to 2.75 of the upper limit of normal identified FDRs with villous atrophy with 87% sensitivity, 82% specificity, and a positive predictive value of 95%. CONCLUSION: In a retrospective cohort study of patients diagnosed with celiac disease, we found a high prevalence of celiac disease among screened FDRs. High anti-TTG titers associated with villous atrophy on small bowel biopsies, irrespective of symptoms. ",
        "Detection of Gluten in Gluten-Free Labeled Restaurant Food: Analysis of Crowd-Sourced Data. INTRODUCTION: Adherence to a gluten-free (GF) diet is the mainstay of therapy for celiac disease. Until now, those wishing to avoid gluten in restaurants had to rely on menu labels, word of mouth, intuition, and restaurant workers' advice, with a relative dearth of supporting data. We used crowd-sourced data from users of a portable gluten detection device to estimate rates of, and identify risk factors for, gluten contamination of supposed GF restaurant foods. METHODS: We analyzed data from a portable gluten detection device (Nima), collected across the United States during an 18-month period by users who opted to share the results of their point-of-care tests. Data were sorted by region, time of day, median household income in the restaurant's vicinity, restaurant genre, and food items. We used the \u03c7 test for bivariate analysis and multiple logistic regression for multivariate analysis to identify predictors of gluten detection in restaurant food. RESULTS: There were 5,624 tests, performed by 804 users, in the examined period. Gluten was detected in 32% of GF labeled foods. Rates of gluten detection differed by meal, with 27.2% at breakfast and 34.0% at dinner (P = 0.0008). GF labeled pizza and pasta were most likely to test positive for gluten, with gluten detected in 53.2% of pizza and 50.8% of pasta samples. On multivariate analysis, GF labeled food was less likely to test positive for gluten in the West than in the Northeast United States (odds ratio 0.80; 95% confidence interval 0.67-0.95). CONCLUSIONS: This study of crowd-sourced data suggests that a substantial fraction of GF labeled restaurant foods contain detectable gluten. Although the highly sensitive Nima device may detect gluten at levels <20 parts per million (ppm), leading to gluten exposure of unknown clinical significance, our findings raise a potential concern. In addition, our findings of higher rates of gluten detection in pizza and pasta provide practical data when providing dining strategies for patients with celiac disease. ",
        "Risk of severe maternal morbidity associated with cesarean delivery and the role of maternal age: a population-based propensity score analysis. BACKGROUND: Short-term maternal complications of cesarean delivery remain uncertain because of confounding by indication. Our objective was to assess whether cesarean delivery is associated with severe acute intra- or postpartum maternal morbidity compared with vaginal delivery, overall and according to the timing of the cesarean. METHODS: We performed a case-control analysis using data from EPIMOMS, a prospective population-based study of deliveries at 22 gestation weeks or later from 6 regions of France in 2012-2013. Cases of intra- or postpartum severe acute maternal morbidity that were not a result of a condition present before delivery were compared with controls randomly selected in a 1/50 ratio. Associations between delivery modes and severe acute maternal morbidity were estimated in a propensity score-matched sample. RESULTS: Among 182 300 deliveries, we identified 1444 cases and 3464 controls. The proportion of cesarean delivery was significantly higher among cases than controls (36.0% v. 18.2%). In the propensity score-matched analysis, cesarean deliveries were significantly associated with a higher risk of severe acute maternal morbidity (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 1.8, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.5-2.2). This association increased with maternal age and was particularly marked for women aged 35 years or older (adjusted OR 2.9, 95% CI 1.9-4.4). This increased risk was significant for cesarean deliveries during labour in women of all age groups and for those before labour only in women aged 35 years or older (adjusted OR 5.1, 95% CI 2.3-11.0). INTERPRETATION: Cesarean delivery is associated with a higher risk of severe acute maternal morbidity than vaginal delivery, particularly in women aged 35 years and older. Clinical decisions regarding delivery mode should account for this excess risk accordingly. ",
        "Non-clinical interventions for reducing unnecessary caesarean section. BACKGROUND: Caesarean section rates are increasing globally. The factors contributing to this increase are complex, and identifying interventions to address them is challenging. Non-clinical interventions are applied independently of a clinical encounter between a health provider and a patient. Such interventions may target women, health professionals or organisations. They address the determinants of caesarean births and could have a role in reducing unnecessary caesarean sections. This review was first published in 2011. This review update will inform a new WHO guideline, and the scope of the update was informed by WHO's Guideline Development Group for this guideline. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of non-clinical interventions intended to reduce unnecessary caesarean section. SEARCH METHODS: We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL and two trials registers in March 2018. We also searched websites of relevant organisations and reference lists of related reviews. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised trials, non-randomised trials, controlled before-after studies, interrupted time series studies and repeated measures studies were eligible for inclusion. The primary outcome measures were: caesarean section, spontaneous vaginal birth and instrumental birth. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We followed standard methodological procedures recommended by Cochrane. We narratively described results of individual studies (drawing summarised evidence from single studies assessing distinct interventions). MAIN RESULTS: We included 29 studies in this review (19 randomised trials, 1 controlled before-after study and 9 interrupted time series studies). Most of the studies (20 studies) were conducted in high-income countries and none took place in low-income countries. The studies enrolled a mixed population of pregnant women, including nulliparous women, multiparous women, women with a fear of childbirth, women with high levels of anxiety and women having undergone a previous caesarean section.Overall, we found low-, moderate- or high-certainty evidence that the following interventions have a beneficial effect on at least one primary outcome measure and no moderate- or high-certainty evidence of adverse effects.Interventions targeted at women or familiesChildbirth training workshops for mothers alone may reduce caesarean section (risk ratio (RR) 0.55, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.33 to 0.89) and may increase spontaneous vaginal birth (RR 2.25, 95% CI 1.16 to 4.36). Childbirth training workshops for couples may reduce caesarean section (RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.94) and may increase spontaneous vaginal birth (RR 2.13, 95% CI 1.09 to 4.16). We judged this one study with 60 participants to have low-certainty evidence for the outcomes above.Nurse-led applied relaxation training programmes (RR 0.22, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.43; 104 participants, low-certainty evidence) and psychosocial couple-based prevention programmes (RR 0.53, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.90; 147 participants, low-certainty evidence) may reduce caesarean section. Psychoeducation may increase spontaneous vaginal birth (RR 1.33, 95% CI 1.11 to 1.61; 371 participants, low-certainty evidence). The control group received routine maternity care in all studies.There were insufficient data on the effect of the four interventions on maternal and neonatal mortality or morbidity.Interventions targeted at healthcare professionalsImplementation of clinical practice guidelines combined with mandatory second opinion for caesarean section indication slightly reduces the risk of overall caesarean section (mean difference in rate change -1.9%, 95% CI -3.8 to -0.1; 149,223 participants). Implementation of clinical practice guidelines combined with audit and feedback also slightly reduces the risk of caesarean section (risk difference (RD) -1.8%, 95% CI -3.8 to -0.2; 105,351 participants). Physician education by local opinion leader (obstetrician-gynaecologist) reduced the risk of elective caesarean section to 53.7% from 66.8% (opinion leader education: 53.7%, 95% CI 46.5 to 61.0%; control: 66.8%, 95% CI 61.7 to 72.0%; 2496 participants). Healthcare professionals in the control groups received routine care in the studies. There was little or no difference in maternal and neonatal mortality or morbidity between study groups. We judged the certainty of evidence to be high.Interventions targeted at healthcare organisations or facilitiesCollaborative midwifery-labourist care (in which the obstetrician provides in-house labour and delivery coverage, 24 hours a day, without competing clinical duties), versus a private practice model of care, may reduce the primary caesarean section rate. In one interrupted time series study, the caesarean section rate decreased by 7% in the year after the intervention, and by 1.7% per year thereafter (1722 participants); the vaginal birth rate after caesarean section increased from 13.3% before to 22.4% after the intervention (684 participants). Maternal and neonatal mortality were not reported. We judged the certainty of evidence to be low.We studied the following interventions, and they either made little or no difference to caesarean section rates or had uncertain effects.Moderate-certainty evidence suggests little or no difference in caesarean section rates between usual care and: antenatal education programmes for physiologic childbirth; antenatal education on natural childbirth preparation with training in breathing and relaxation techniques; computer-based decision aids; individualised prenatal education and support programmes (versus written information in pamphlet).Low-certainty evidence suggests little or no difference in caesarean section rates between usual care and: psychoeducation; pelvic floor muscle training exercises with telephone follow-up (versus pelvic floor muscle training without telephone follow-up); intensive group therapy (cognitive behavioural therapy and childbirth psychotherapy); education of public health nurses on childbirth classes; role play (versus standard education using lectures); interactive decision aids (versus educational brochures); labourist model of obstetric care (versus traditional model of obstetric care).We are very uncertain as to the effect of other interventions identified on caesarean section rates as the certainty of the evidence is very low. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: We evaluated a wide range of non-clinical interventions to reduce unnecessary caesarean section, mostly in high-income settings. Few interventions with moderate- or high-certainty evidence, mainly targeting healthcare professionals (implementation of guidelines combined with mandatory second opinion, implementation of guidelines combined with audit and feedback, physician education by local opinion leader) have been shown to safely reduce caesarean section rates. There are uncertainties in existing evidence related to very-low or low-certainty evidence, applicability of interventions and lack of studies, particularly around interventions targeted at women or families and healthcare organisations or facilities.

        "Recorded Diagnoses of Depression During Delivery Hospitalizations in the United States, 2000-2015. OBJECTIVE: To describe national, state-specific, and sociodemographic trends in diagnoses of depressive disorders recorded during delivery hospitalizations. METHODS: Data were analyzed from the National Inpatient Sample (2000-2015) and 31 publicly available State Inpatient Databases (2000-2015) of the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project. Delivery hospitalizations were identified by using International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) diagnostic and procedure codes for obstetric delivery. Depressive disorders were identified from ICD-9-CM diagnoses codes classified as depressive disorders in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th Edition (291.89, 292.84, 293.83, 296.2-296.26, 296.3-296.36, 300.4, and 311). Prevalence rates and average annual rate change were calculated nationally and across 28 states with at least 3 years of data and age, payer source, and race or ethnicity. RESULTS: The U.S. rate of depressive disorders recorded during delivery hospitalizations increased from 4.1 diagnoses per 1,000 hospitalizations in 2000 to 28.7 in 2015. Rates significantly increased in 27 of the 28 states. Recent (2014-2015) rates were lowest in Hawaii and Nevada (less than 14/1,000) and highest in Vermont, Minnesota, Oregon, and Wisconsin (greater than 49/1,000). Rates in 2015 were highest among those aged 35 years or older, public insurance recipients, and non-Hispanic white women (greater than 31/1,000). The highest annual rate increases were in Vermont and Maine (3.8/1,000 or greater). Non-Hispanic white women, those 35 years of age or older, and public insurance recipients showed the highest annual rate increases during 2000-2015 (1.7/1,000 or greater). CONCLUSION: During 2000-2015, rates of depressive disorders recorded during delivery hospitalizations increased nationally, in 27 states with available data, and across all sociodemographic categories.

        "How women are treated during facility-based childbirth in four countries: a cross-sectional study with labour observations and community-based surveys. BACKGROUND: Women across the world are mistreated during childbirth. We aimed to develop and implement evidence-informed, validated tools to measure mistreatment during childbirth, and report results from a cross-sectional study in four low-income and middle-income countries. METHODS: We prospectively recruited women aged at least 15 years in twelve health facilities (three per country) in Ghana, Guinea, Myanmar, and Nigeria between Sept 19, 2016, and Jan 18, 2018. Continuous observations of labour and childbirth were done from admission up to 2 h post partum. Surveys were administered by interviewers in the community to women up to 8 weeks post partum. Labour observations were not done in Myanmar. Data were collected on sociodemographics, obstetric history, and experiences of mistreatment. FINDINGS: 2016 labour observations and 2672 surveys were done. 838 (41\u00b76%) of 2016 observed women and 945 (35\u00b74%) of 2672 surveyed women experienced physical or verbal abuse, or stigma or discrimination. Physical and verbal abuse peaked 30 min before birth until 15 min after birth (observation). Many women did not consent for episiotomy (observation: 190 [75\u00b71%] of 253; survey: 295 [56\u00b71%] of 526) or caesarean section (observation: 35 [13\u00b74%] of 261; survey: 52 [10\u00b78%] of 483), despite receiving these procedures. 133 (5\u00b70%) of 2672 women or their babies were detained in the facility because they were unable to pay the bill (survey). Younger age (15-19 years) and lack of education were the primary determinants of mistreatment (survey). For example, younger women with no education (odds ratio [OR] 3\u00b76, 95% CI 1\u00b76-8\u00b70) and younger women with some education (OR 1\u00b76, 1\u00b71-2\u00b73) were more likely to experience verbal abuse, compared with older women (\u226530 years), adjusting for marital status and parity. INTERPRETATION: More than a third of women experienced mistreatment and were particularly vulnerable around the time of birth. Women who were younger and less educated were most at risk, suggesting inequalities in how women are treated during childbirth. Understanding drivers and structural dimensions of mistreatment, including gender and social inequalities, is essential to ensure that interventions adequately account for the broader context.

        "Dissecting racial bias in an algorithm used to manage the health of populations. Health systems rely on commercial prediction algorithms to identify and help patients with complex health needs. We show that a widely used algorithm, typical of this industry-wide approach and affecting millions of patients, exhibits significant racial bias: At a given risk score, Black patients are considerably sicker than White patients, as evidenced by signs of uncontrolled illnesses. Remedying this disparity would increase the percentage of Black patients receiving additional help from 17.7 to 46.5%. The bias arises because the algorithm predicts health care costs rather than illness, but unequal access to care means that we spend less money caring for Black patients than for White patients. Thus, despite health care cost appearing to be an effective proxy for health by some measures of predictive accuracy, large racial biases arise. We suggest that the choice of convenient, seemingly effective proxies for ground truth can be an important source of algorithmic bias in many contexts. ",
        "Neurodevelopmental outcome at 5 years of age after general anaesthesia or awake-regional anaesthesia in infancy (GAS): an international, multicentre, randomised, controlled equivalence trial. BACKGROUND: In laboratory animals, exposure to most general anaesthetics leads to neurotoxicity manifested by neuronal cell death and abnormal behaviour and cognition. Some large human cohort studies have shown an association between general anaesthesia at a young age and subsequent neurodevelopmental deficits, but these studies are prone to bias. Others have found no evidence for an association. We aimed to establish whether general anaesthesia in early infancy affects neurodevelopmental outcomes. METHODS: In this international, assessor-masked, equivalence, randomised, controlled trial conducted at 28 hospitals in Australia, Italy, the USA, the UK, Canada, the Netherlands, and New Zealand, we recruited infants of less than 60 weeks' postmenstrual age who were born at more than 26 weeks' gestation and were undergoing inguinal herniorrhaphy, without previous exposure to general anaesthesia or risk factors for neurological injury. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) by use of a web-based randomisation service to receive either awake-regional anaesthetic or sevoflurane-based general anaesthetic. Anaesthetists were aware of group allocation, but individuals administering the neurodevelopmental assessments were not. Parents were informed of their infants group allocation upon request, but were told to mask this information from assessors. The primary outcome measure was full-scale intelligence quotient (FSIQ) on the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence, third edition (WPPSI-III), at 5 years of age. The primary analysis was done on a per-protocol basis, adjusted for gestational age at birth and country, with multiple imputation used to account for missing data. An intention-to-treat analysis was also done. A difference in means of 5 points was predefined as the clinical equivalence margin. This completed trial is registered with ANZCTR, number ACTRN12606000441516, and ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00756600. FINDINGS: Between Feb 9, 2007, and Jan 31, 2013, 4023 infants were screened and 722 were randomly allocated: 363 (50%) to the awake-regional anaesthesia group and 359 (50%) to the general anaesthesia group. There were 74 protocol violations in the awake-regional anaesthesia group and two in the general anaesthesia group. Primary outcome data for the per-protocol analysis were obtained from 205 children in the awake-regional anaesthesia group and 242 in the general anaesthesia group. The median duration of general anaesthesia was 54 min (IQR 41-70). The mean FSIQ score was 99\u00b708 (SD 18\u00b735) in the awake-regional anaesthesia group and 98\u00b797 (19\u00b766) in the general anaesthesia group, with a difference in means (awake-regional anaesthesia minus general anaesthesia) of 0\u00b723 (95% CI -2\u00b759 to 3\u00b706), providing strong evidence of equivalence. The results of the intention-to-treat analysis were similar to those of the per-protocol analysis. INTERPRETATION: Slightly less than 1 h of general anaesthesia in early infancy does not alter neurodevelopmental outcome at age 5 years compared with awake-regional anaesthesia in a predominantly male study population.

        "Trends in school-age pedestrian and pedalcyclist crashes in the USA: 26 states, 2000-2014. BACKGROUND: Despite substantial progress, motor vehicle crashes remain a leading killer of US children. Previously, we documented significant positive impacts of Safe Routes to School interventions on school-age pedestrian and pedalcyclist crashes. OBJECTIVE: To expand our analysis of US trends in motor vehicle crashes involving school-age pedestrians and pedalcyclists, exploring heterogeneity by age and geography. METHODS: We obtained recent police-reported crash data from 26 states, calculating population rates of pedestrian and pedalcyclist crashes, crash fatality rates and pedestrian commuter-adjusted crash rates ('pedestrian danger index') for school-age children as compared with other age groups. We estimated national and statewide trends by age, injury status, day and travel hour using hierarchical linear modeling. RESULTS: School-age children accounted for nearly one in three pedestrians and one in two pedalcyclists struck in motor vehicle crashes from 2000 to 2014. Yet, the rates of these crashes declined 40% and 53%, respectively, over that time, on average, even as adult rates rose. Average crash rates varied geographically from 24.4 to 100.8 pedestrians and 15.6 to 56.7 pedalcyclists struck per 100\u2009000 youth. Crash rates and fatality rates were inversely correlated. CONCLUSIONS: Despite recent increases in adult pedestrian crashes, school-age and younger pedestrians experienced ongoing declines in motor vehicle crashes through 2014 across the USA. There was no evidence of displacement in crash severity; declines were observed in all outcomes. The growing body of state crash data resources can present analytic challenges but also provides unique insights into national and local pedestrian crash trends for all crash outcomes. ",
        "Commuting time to work and behaviour-related health: a fixed-effect analysis. OBJECTIVES: Long commuting times are linked to poor health outcomes, but the evidence is mainly cross-sectional. We examined longitudinal within-individual associations between commuting time and behaviour-related health. METHODS: Data were from the Swedish Longitudinal Occupational Survey of Health study. We selected workers who responded to a minimum of two surveys conducted every other year between 2008 and 2018. We included all study waves with self-reported commuting time (ie, the exposure, 1-5, 6-10, 11-15 or \u226515\u2009hours/week), body mass index (based on weight and height), physical (in)activity, smoking, alcohol use and sleep problems (ie, the outcomes) (Nindividuals=20 376, Nobservations=46 169). We used conditional logistic regression for fixed effects analyses that controls for time-varying confounders by design. Analyses were stratified by working hours: normal (30-40\u2009hours/week) or longer than normal (>40\u2009hours/week) and adjusted for time dependent covariates: age, marital status, occupational position, presence of children, chronic disease, depressive symptoms, job strain and shift work. RESULTS: Those working >40\u2009hours/week had higher odds of physical inactivity (OR 1.25, 95%\u2009CI 1.03 to 1.51) and sleep problems (OR 1.16, 95%\u2009CI 1.00 to 1.35) when they were commuting >5\u2009hours/week than when they were commuting 1-5\u2009hours/week. Among women working normal hours, longer commuting time associated with lower odds of problem drinking. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that lengthy commuting time increases the risk of physical inactivity and sleep problems if individuals have longer than normal weekly working hours. Effects of work arrangements that decrease commuting time should be examined in relation to health behaviours. ",
        "Elevated cerebrospinal fluid total tau in former professional athletes with multiple concussions. OBJECTIVE: To identify CSF biomarkers that are related to decreased white matter (WM) integrity and poor cognitive performance in former professional athletes with a history of multiple concussions. METHODS: Concentrations of phosphorylated tau181, total tau (t-tau), and \u03b2-amyloid in the CSF were measured in 3 groups: 22 former professional athletes with multiple concussions (mean \u00b1 SD age 55.9 \u00b1 12.2 years), 5 healthy controls (age 57.4 \u00b1 5.2 years), and 12 participants (age 60.0 \u00b1 6.6 years) diagnosed with Alzheimer disease (AD). All participants in the former athletes group underwent diffusion tensor imaging to determine WM tract integrity and completed neuropsychological testing. We divided the former athletes group into those with normal (<300 pg/mL) and high (>300 pg/mL) CSF t-tau. RESULTS: CSF t-tau in the former athletes group was significantly higher than in the healthy control group (349.3 \u00b1 182.6 vs 188.8 \u00b1 39.9 pg/mL, p = 0.003) and significantly lower than in the patients with AD (349.3 \u00b1 182.6 vs 857.0 \u00b1 449.3 pg/mL, p = 0.007). Fractional anisotropy values across all the tracts were significantly lower in the high CSF t-tau group compared to the normal CSF t-tau group (p = 0.036). Participants in the high CSF t-tau group scored significantly lower on the Trail Making Test (TMT) Part B compared to the normal CSF t-tau group (t scores 45.6 \u00b1 18.8 vs 62.3 \u00b1 10.1, p = 0.017). CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that former athletes with multiple concussions are at increased risk of elevated levels of CSF t-tau and that high CSF t-tau is associated with reduced WM integrity and worse scores on the TMT Part B.

        "Acanthamoeba keratitis: confirmation of the UK outbreak and a prospective case-control study identifying contributing risk factors. BACKGROUND/AIMS: Acanthamoeba keratitis (AK) is a chronic debilitating corneal infection principally affecting contact lens (CL) users. Studies were designed to test claims that the UK incidence may have increased in 2012-2014 and to evaluate potential causes. METHODS: Annualised incidence data were collected from January 1984 to December 2016. Case-control study subjects were recruited between 14 April 2011 and 05 June 2017. Reusable CL users with AK were recruited retrospectively and prospectively. Controls were reusable CL users, recruited prospectively, with any disorder other than AK. Multivariable analysis of questionnaire data measured independent risk factors for AK. RESULTS: The current outbreak of AK started in 2010-2011 with an incidence threefold higher than in 2004-2009. Risk factors for AK were: Oxipol disinfection, CLs made of group IV CL materials, poor CL hygiene, deficient hand hygiene, use of CLs while swimming or bathing, being white British, and for those in social classes 4-9. CONCLUSION: AK is a largely preventable disease. The current outbreak is unlikely to be due to any one of the identified risk factors in isolation. Improving CL and hand hygiene, avoiding CLs contamination with water and use of effective CL disinfection solutions, or daily disposable CLs, will reduce the incidence of AK. In the longer-term, water avoidance publicity for CL users can be expected to reduce the incidence further. Ongoing surveillance of AK numbers will identify changes in incidence earlier. Evaluation of Acanthamoeba contamination in end-user drinking water would contribute to our understanding of regional variations in the risk of exposure. ",
        "Intrauterine Device Expulsion After Postpartum Placement: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis. OBJECTIVE: To estimate expulsion rates among women with postpartum intrauterine device (IUD) placement by timing of insertion, IUD type, and delivery method. DATA SOURCES: We searched PubMed, Cochrane Library, and ClinicalTrials.gov from 1974 to May 2018. METHODS OF STUDY SELECTION: We searched databases for any published studies that examined postpartum placement of a copper IUD or levonorgestrel intrauterine system and reported counts of expulsions. We assessed study quality using the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force evidence grading system. We calculated pooled absolute rates of IUD expulsion and estimated adjusted relative risks (RRs) for timing of postpartum placement, delivery method, and IUD type using log-binomial multivariable regression model. TABULATION, INTEGRATION, AND RESULTS: We identified 48 level I to II-3 studies of poor to good quality. Pooled rates of expulsion varied by timing of IUD placement, ranging from 1.9% with interval placements (4 weeks postpartum or greater), 10.0% for immediate placements (10 minutes or less after placental delivery), and 29.7% for early placements (greater than 10 minutes to less than 4 weeks postpartum). Immediate and early postpartum placements were associated with increased risk of expulsion compared with interval placement (adjusted RR 7.63, 95% CI 4.31-13.51; adjusted RR 6.17, 95% CI 3.19-11.93, respectively). Postpartum placement less than 4 weeks after vaginal delivery was associated with an increased risk of expulsion compared with cesarean delivery (adjusted RR 5.19, 95% CI 3.85-6.99). Analysis of expulsion rates at less than 4 weeks postpartum also indicated that the levonorgestrel intrauterine system was associated with a higher risk of expulsion (adjusted RR 1.91, 95% CI 1.50-2.43) compared with CuT380A. CONCLUSION: Postpartum IUD expulsion rates vary by timing of placement, delivery method, and IUD type. These results can aid in counseling women to make an informed choice about when to initiate their IUD and to help institutions implement postpartum contraception programs. ",
        "Public perception towards bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation. OBJECTIVE: Bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) improves survival and neurological outcomes. Nonetheless, many OHCA patients do not receive bystander CPR during a witnessed arrest. Our aim was to identify potential barriers to bystander CPR. METHODS: Participants at CPR training events conducted in the USA between February and May 2018 answered a 14-question survey prior to training. Respondents were asked about their overall comfort level performing CPR, and about potential concerns specific to performing CPR on a middle-aged female, a geriatric male, and male and female adolescent patients. Open-ended responses were analysed qualitatively by categorising responses into themes. RESULTS: Of the 677 participants, 582 (86.0%) completed the survey, with 509 (88.1%) between 18 and 29 years of age, 341 (58.6%) without prior CPR training and 556 (96.0%) without prior CPR experience. Across all four scenarios of patients in cardiac arrest, less than 65% of respondents reported that they would be 'Extremely Likely' (20.6%-29.1%) or 'Moderately Likely' (26.9%-34.8%) to initiate CPR. The leading concerns were 'causing injury to patient' for geriatric (n=193, 63.1%), female (n=51, 20.5%) and adolescent (n=148, 50.9%) patients. Lack of appropriate skills was the second leading concern when the victim was a geriatric (n=41, 13.4%) or adolescent (n=68, 23.4%) patient, whereas for female patients, 35 (14.1%) were concerned about exposing the patient or the patient's breasts interfering with performance of CPR and 15 (6.0%) were concerned about being accused of sexual assault. Significant differences were observed in race, ethnicity and age regarding the likelihood of starting to perform CPR on female and adolescent patients. CONCLUSIONS: Participants at CPR training events have multiple concerns and fears related to performing bystander CPR. Causing additional harm and lack of skills were among the leading reservations reported. These findings should be considered for improved CPR training and public education. ",
        "Comparative Efficacy of Interventions for Aggressive and Agitated Behaviors in Dementia: A Systematic Review and Network Meta-analysis. Background: Both pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic interventions are used to treat neuropsychiatric symptoms in persons with dementia. Purpose: To summarize the comparative efficacy of pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic interventions for treating aggression and agitation in adults with dementia. Data Sources: MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, CINAHL, and PsycINFO between inception and 28 May 2019 without language restrictions; gray literature; and reference lists scanned from selected studies and systematic reviews. Study Selection: Randomized controlled trials comparing interventions for treating aggression and agitation in adults with dementia. Data Extraction: Pairs of reviewers independently screened studies, abstracted data, and appraised risk of bias. Data Synthesis: After screening of 19\u00a0684 citations, 163 studies (23\u00a0143 patients) were included in network meta-analyses. Analysis of interventions targeting aggression and agitation (148 studies [21\u00a0686 patients]) showed that multidisciplinary care (standardized mean difference [SMD], -0.5 [95% credible interval {CrI}, -0.99 to -0.01]), massage and touch therapy (SMD, -0.75 [CrI, -1.12 to -0.38]), and music combined with massage and touch therapy (SMD, -0.91 [CrI, -1.75 to -0.07]) were clinically more efficacious than usual care. Recreation therapy (SMD, -0.29 [CrI, -0.57 to -0.01]) was statistically but not clinically more efficacious than usual care. Limitations: Forty-six percent of studies were at high risk of bias because of missing outcome data. Harms and costs of therapies were not evaluated. Conclusion: Nonpharmacologic interventions seemed to be more efficacious than pharmacologic interventions for reducing aggression and agitation in adults with dementia.

        "The relationship between social media use and disordered eating in young adolescents. BACKGROUND: The relationship between social media (SM) use and disordered eating (DE) has not been adequately explored in young adolescents. METHODS: Data from 996 Grade 7 and 8 adolescents (n = 534 girls; M age = 13.08) was investigated. DE cognitions (Eating Disorder Examination-Questionnaire [EDE-Q]), DE behaviors (Project Eating Among Teens), and SM use measures related to Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, and Tumblr were completed. RESULTS: DE behaviors were reported by 51.7% of girls and 45.0% of boys, with strict exercise and meal skipping the most common. A total of 75.4% of girls and 69.9% of boys had at least one SM account where Instagram was the most common, used by 68.1% of girls and 61.7% of boys. Global EDE-Q scores were significantly higher for girls and boys with each type of SM account, except for Facebook and Instagram for girls. A greater number of SM accounts was associated with higher DE scores for both cognitions and behaviors. Girls with Snapchat and Tumblr accounts and boys with Snapchat, Facebook and Instagram were significantly more likely to have both DE behaviors and over-evaluation of shape and weight in the clinical range. Greater daily time spent using Instagram was associated with significantly higher Global EDE-Q scores and DE behaviors for girls, while this pattern was also found for Snapchat usage and DE behaviors for girls. CONCLUSIONS: A clear pattern of association was found between SM usage and DE cognitions and behaviors with this exploratory study confirming that these relationships occur at younger-age than previously investigated.

        "Atrial fibrillation, antithrombotic treatment, and cognitive aging: A population-based study. OBJECTIVE: To examine the association of atrial fibrillation (AF) with cognitive decline and dementia in old age, and to explore the cognitive benefit of antithrombotic treatment in patients with AF. METHODS: This population-based cohort study included 2,685 dementia-free participants from the Swedish National Study on Aging and Care in Kungsholmen, who were regularly examined from 2001-2004 to 2010-2013. AF was ascertained from clinical examination, ECG, and patient registry. Global cognitive function was assessed using the Mini-Mental State Examination. We followed the DSM-IV criteria for the diagnosis of dementia, the NINDS-AIREN (National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke and Association Internationale pour la Recherch\u00e9 et l'Enseignement en Neurosciences) criteria for vascular dementia, and the NINCDS-ADRDA (National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke and the Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association) criteria for Alzheimer disease. Data were analyzed using multiple linear mixed-effects and Cox regression models. RESULTS: We identified 243 participants (9.1%) with AF at baseline. During the 9-year follow-up period, 279 participants (11.4%) developed AF and 399 (14.9%) developed dementia. As a time-varying variable, AF was significantly associated with a faster annual Mini-Mental State Examination decline (\u03b2 coefficient = -0.24, 95% confidence interval [CI]: -0.31 to -0.16) and an increased hazard ratio (HR) of all-cause dementia (HR = 1.40, 95% CI: 1.11-1.77) and vascular and mixed dementia (HR = 1.88, 95% CI: 1.09-3.23), but not Alzheimer disease (HR = 1.33, 95% CI: 0.92-1.94). Among people with either prevalent or incident AF, use of anticoagulant drugs, but not antiplatelet treatment, was associated with a 60% decreased risk of dementia (HR = 0.40, 95% CI: 0.18-0.92). CONCLUSION: AF is associated with a faster global cognitive decline and an increased risk of dementia in older people. Use of anticoagulant drugs may reduce dementia risk in patients with AF. ",
        "Retinal Microvascular and Neurodegenerative Changes in Alzheimer's Disease and Mild Cognitive Impairment Compared with Control Participants. PURPOSE: Evaluate and compare the retinal microvasculature in the superficial capillary plexus (SCP) in Alzheimer's disease (AD), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and cognitively intact controls using OCT angiography. OCT parameters were also compared. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. PARTICIPANTS: Seventy eyes from 39 AD participants, 72 eyes from 37 MCI participants, and 254 eyes from 133 control participants were enrolled. METHODS: Participants were imaged using Zeiss Cirrus HD-5000 with AngioPlex (Carl Zeiss Meditec, Dublin, CA) and underwent cognitive evaluation with Mini-Mental State Examination. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Vessel density (VD) and perfusion density (PD) in the SCP within the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study 6-mm circle, 3-mm circle, and 3-mm ring were compared between groups. Foveal avascular zone (FAZ) area, central subfield thickness (CST), macular ganglion cell-inner plexiform layer (GC-IPL) thickness, and peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness were also compared. RESULTS: Alzheimer's participants showed significantly decreased SCP VD and PD in the 3-mm ring (P\u00a0=\u00a00.001 and P = 0.002, respectively) and 3-mm circle (P = 0.003 and P = 0.004, respectively) and decreased SCP VD in the 6-mm circle (P = 0.047) compared with MCI and significantly decreased SCP VD and PD in the 3-mm ring (P = 0.008 and P = 0.004, respectively) and 3-mm circle (P = 0.015 and P = 0.009, respectively) and SCP PD in the 6-mm circle (P = 0.033) when compared with cognitively intact controls. There was no difference in SCP VD or PD between MCI and controls (P > 0.05). FAZ area and CST did not differ significantly between groups (P\u00a0>\u00a00.05). Alzheimer's participants showed significantly decreased GC-IPL thickness over the inferior (P = 0.032) and inferonasal (P = 0.025) sectors compared with MCI and significantly decreased GC-IPL thickness over the entire (P = 0.012), superonasal (P = 0.041), inferior (P = 0.004), and inferonasal (P = 0.006) sectors compared to controls. MCI participants showed significantly decreased temporal RNFL thickness (P = 0.04) compared with controls. CONCLUSIONS: Alzheimer's participants showed significantly reduced macular VD, PD, and GC-IPL thickness compared with MCI and controls. Changes in the retinal microvasculature may mirror small vessel cerebrovascular changes in AD. ",
        "Association Between Waist Circumference and Dementia in Older Persons: A Nationwide Population-Based Study. OBJECTIVE: This study examined whether a positive association exists between waist circumference (WC) and dementia among older persons. METHODS: The study population comprised 872,082 participants aged 65 years and older who participated in a Korean national health screening examination between January 1, 2009, and December 31, 2009. Adjusted hazard ratios and 95% CIs for dementia during follow-up from 2009 to 2015 were calculated according to baseline BMI and WC categories. RESULTS: After a multivariate adjustment that included BMI, the hazard ratios for dementia showed a stepwise increase according to the increase in WC categories by 5 cm from 85 to 90 cm in men and from 80 to 85 cm in women until \u2265\u2009110 cm (from 1.06 [95% CI: 1.03-1.09] to 1.64 [95% CI: 1.37-1.94] in men and from 1.04 [95% CI: 1.02-1.07] to 1.58 [95% CI: 1.36-1.84] in women). The influence of the current WC category for abdominal obesity on the risk of dementia was different according to BMI; especially, the normal weight men and women with abdominal obesity had a prominent increased risk of dementia compared with those without abdominal obesity. CONCLUSIONS: Abdominal obesity, as measured by WC, was associated with significantly increased risk of dementia after adjustment for general obesity. ",
        "Scam Awareness Related to Incident Alzheimer Dementia and Mild Cognitive Impairment: A Prospective Cohort Study. Background: Decreased scam awareness may be an early indicator of impending Alzheimer dementia and its precursor, mild cognitive impairment, but prior studies have not systematically examined the associations between scam awareness and adverse cognitive outcomes. Objective: To test the hypothesis that low scam awareness is associated with increased risk for incident Alzheimer dementia, mild cognitive impairment, and Alzheimer disease pathology in the brain. Design: Prospective cohort study of aging. Setting: Community-based study in the greater Chicago metropolitan area. Participants: 935 older persons initially free of dementia. Measurements: Scam awareness was measured via questionnaire, incident Alzheimer dementia and mild cognitive impairment were documented in detailed annual cognitive and clinical evaluations, and Alzheimer disease neuropathology was quantified after death among a subset of persons who died (n\u00a0= 264). Proportional hazards models examined associations between scam awareness and incident Alzheimer dementia and mild cognitive impairment. Regression models examined associations between scam awareness and Alzheimer disease pathology, particularly \u03b2-amyloid burden and tau tangle density. Results: During a mean of about 6 years (SD, 2.4) of observation, 151 persons (16.1%) developed Alzheimer dementia. Low scam awareness was associated with increased risk for Alzheimer dementia (hazard ratio [HR], 1.56 [95% CI, 1.21 to 2.01]; P\u00a0< 0.001), such that each 1-unit increase in scam score (indicating lower awareness) was associated with about a 60% increase in dementia risk. Low scam awareness was also associated with increased risk for mild cognitive impairment (HR, 1.47 [CI, 1.20 to 1.81]; P\u00a0< 0.001). These associations persisted even after adjustment for global cognitive function. Finally, low scam awareness was associated with a higher burden of Alzheimer pathology in the brain, particularly \u03b2-amyloid (estimated increase [\u00b1SE] in \u03b2-amyloid per 1-unit increase in scam score, 0.22\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.10 unit; P\u00a0= 0.029). Limitation: The measure of scam awareness used here is too weak for prediction at the individual level. Conclusion: Low scam awareness among older persons is a harbinger of adverse cognitive outcomes and is associated with Alzheimer disease pathology in the brain.

        "Can Hearing Aids Delay Time to Diagnosis of Dementia, Depression, or Falls in Older Adults?. OBJECTIVE: To examine the association between hearing aids (HAs) and time to diagnosis of Alzheimer disease (AD) or dementia, anxiety or depression, and injurious falls among adults, aged 66 years and older, within 3 years of hearing loss (HL) diagnosis. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: We used 2008 to 2016 national longitudinal claims data (based on office visit, inpatient, or outpatient healthcare encounters) from a large private payer. We used Kaplan-Meier curves to examine unadjusted disease-free survival and crude and adjusted Cox regression models to examine associations between HAs and time to diagnosis of three age-related/HL-associated conditions within 3 years of HL diagnosis. All models were adjusted for age, sex, race/ethnicity, census divisions, and prior diagnosis of cardiovascular conditions, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, obesity, and diabetes. PARTICIPANTS: The participants included 114 862 adults, aged 66 years and older, diagnosed with HL. MEASUREMENT: Diagnosis of (1) AD or dementia; (2) depression or anxiety; and (3) injurious falls. INTERVENTION: Use of HAs. RESULTS: Large sex and racial/ethnic differences exist in HA use. Approximately 11.3% of women vs 13.3% of men used HAs (95% confidence interval [CI] difference = -0.024 to -0.016). Approximately 13.6% of whites (95% CI = 0.13-0.14) vs 9.8% of blacks (95% CI = 0.09-0.11) and 6.5% of Hispanics (95% CI = 0.06-0.07) used HAs. The risk-adjusted hazard ratios of being diagnosed with AD/dementia, anxiety/depression, and injurious falls within 3 years after HL diagnosis, for those who used HAs vs those who did not, were 0.82 (95% CI = 0.76-0.89), 0.89 (95% CI = 0.86-0.93), and 0.87 (95% CI = 0.80-0.95), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Use of HAs is associated with delayed diagnosis of AD, dementia, depression, anxiety, and injurious falls among older adults with HL. Although we have shown an association between use of HAs and reduced risk of physical and mental decline, randomized trials are needed to determine whether, and to what extent, the relationship is causal.

        "Rapid increase in the prevalence of cannabis use among people with depression in the United States, 2005-17: the role of differentially changing risk perceptions. AIMS: To estimate trends in the prevalence of cannabis use and risk perceptions of cannabis use from 2005 to 2017 among United States people with and without depression. DESIGN: Linear time trends of the prevalence of any, daily and non-daily past 30-day cannabis use and perceived great risk associated with regular cannabis use (outcome variables) among people with and without past-year depression were assessed using logistic regression with survey year as the predictor. All analyses were adjusted for gender, age, race/ethnicity and income; models assessing time trends of cannabis use prevalence were also adjusted for perceived risk. SETTING: The United States: National Survey on Drug Use and Health, an annual cross-sectional survey, 2005-17 public use data files. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 728\u2009691 people aged\u00a0\u2265\u00a012\u00a0years. MEASUREMENTS: Self-report of any, daily and non-daily past 30-day cannabis use and perceived great risk associated with regular cannabis use. FINDINGS: The prevalence of any, daily and non-daily cannabis use in the past month was higher among those with depression versus those without [e.g. 2017 for any use: 18.94 versus 8.67%; adjusted odds ratio (aOR)\u00a0=\u00a02.17 (95% confidence interval (CI)\u00a0=\u00a01.92, 2.45)]. Any, daily and non-daily cannabis use increased among people with and without depression from 2005 to 2017, yet the increase in any (aORs\u00a0=\u00a01.06 versus 1.05; P\u00a0=\u00a00.008) and daily (aORs\u00a0=\u00a01.10 versus 1.07; P\u00a0=\u00a00.021) cannabis use adjusted for socio-demographic characteristics was more rapid among those with depression. Perception of great risk associated with regular cannabis use was significantly lower among those with depression (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and decreased significantly more rapidly over the study period among people with depression, compared with those without (aORs\u00a0=\u00a00.89 versus 0.92; P\u00a0<\u00a00.001). CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of cannabis use in the United States increased from 2005 to 2017 among people with and without depression and was approximately twice as common among those with depression. People with depression experienced a more rapid decrease in perception of risk, which may be related to the more rapid increase in any and daily past-month cannabis use in this group. ",
        "A brief diet intervention can reduce symptoms of depression in young adults - A randomised controlled trial. There is strong epidemiological evidence that poor diet is associated with depression. The reverse has also been shown, namely that eating a healthy diet rich in fruit, vegetables, fish and lean meat, is associated with reduced risk of depression. To date, only one randomised controlled trial (RCT) has been conducted with elevated depression symptoms being an inclusion criterion, with results showing that a diet intervention can reduce clinical levels of depression. No such RCTs have been performed in young adults. Young adults with elevated levels of depression symptoms and who habitually consume a poor diet were randomly allocated to a brief 3-week diet intervention (Diet Group) or a habitual diet control group (Control Group). The primary and secondary outcome measures assessed at baseline and after the intervention included symptoms of depression (Centre for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale; CESD-R; and Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale- 21 depression subscale; DASS-21-D), current mood (Profile of Mood States), self-efficacy (New General Self-Efficacy Scale) and memory (Hopkins Verbal Learning Test). Diet compliance was measured via self-report questionnaires and spectrophotometry. One-hundred-and-one individuals were enrolled in the study and randomly assigned to the Diet Group or the Control Group. Upon completion of the study, there was complete data for 38 individuals in each group. There was good compliance with the diet intervention recommendations assessed using self-report and spectrophotometry. The Diet group had significantly lower self-reported depression symptoms than the Control Group on the CESD-R (p = 0.007, Cohen's d = 0.65) and DASS-21 depression subscale (p = 0.002, Cohen's d = 0.75) controlling for baseline scores on these scales. Reduced DASS-21 depression subscale scores were maintained on follow up phone call 3 months later (p = .009). These results are the first to show that young adults with elevated depression symptoms can engage in and adhere to a diet intervention, and that this can reduce symptoms of depression. The findings provide justification for future research into the duration of these benefits, the impacts of varying diet composition, and their biological basis. ",
        "Aerobic exercise alleviates depressive symptoms in patients with a major non-communicable chronic disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis. OBJECTIVE: To assess whether aerobic exercise was superior to usual care in alleviating depressive symptoms in patients living with a major non-communicable disease. DATA SOURCES: Data were obtained from online databases (PubMed, PsycINFO and SPORTDiscus) as well as from reference lists. The search and collection of eligible studies was conducted up to 18 October 2018 (PROSPERO registration number CRD42017069089). STUDY SELECTION: We included interventions that compared aerobic exercise with usual care in adults who reported depressive symptoms (ie, not necessarily the clinical diagnosis of depression) and were living with a major non-communicable disease. RESULTS: Twenty-four studies were included in the meta-analysis (4111 patients). Aerobic exercise alleviated depressive symptoms better than did usual care (standardised mean difference (SMD)=0.50; 95% CI 0.25 to 0.76; Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation: low quality). Aerobic exercise was particularly effective in alleviating depressive symptoms in cardiac patients (SMD=0.67; 95%\u2009CI 0.35 to 0.99). CONCLUSION: Aerobic exercise alleviated depressive symptoms in patients living with a major non-communicable disease, particularly in cardiac populations. Whether aerobic exercise treats clinically diagnosed depression was outside the scope of this study. ",
        "Effectiveness of a Community-Based Weight Management Program for Patients Taking Antidepressants and/or Antipsychotics. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to compare weight loss (WL) outcomes for patients taking antidepressants and/or antipsychotics with those not taking psychiatric medication. METHODS: A total of 17,519 adults enrolled in a lifestyle WL intervention at the Wharton Medical Clinics in Ontario, Canada, were analyzed. Sex-stratified multivariable linear regression analysis was used to examine the association of taking antidepressants, antipsychotics, both, or neither with WL when adjusting for age, initial weight, and treatment time. RESULTS: Twenty-three percent of patients were taking at least one psychiatric medication. Patients lost a significant amount of weight (P\u2009<\u20090.0001) regardless of psychiatric medication use. Women taking psychiatric medications lost a similar amount of weight as women who were not (P\u2009>\u20090.05). Conversely, men taking antidepressants lost only slightly less weight than men taking both classes\u00a0or neither class of psychiatric medication (3.2\u2009\u00b1\u20090.3 kg vs. 5.6\u2009\u00b1\u20090.9 kg and 4.3\u2009\u00b1\u20090.1 kg; P\u2009<\u20090.05). However, taking psychiatric medications that cause weight gain was associated with similar significant decreases in weight as taking medications that are weight neutral or associated with WL for both sexes (P\u2009>\u20090.05). CONCLUSIONS: Results of this study suggest that those who participate in a weight management program can lose significant amounts of weight regardless of psychiatric medication use. ",
        "Risk of Psychiatric Disorders and Suicide Attempts in Emerging Adults With Diabetes. OBJECTIVE: To determine the longitudinal risks of psychiatric disorders in adolescents and emerging adults with versus without diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study in Quebec, Canada, using linked health administrative databases of adolescents (age 15 years) with and without diabetes and without prior psychiatric disorders between 1997 and 2015, followed to age 25 years. RESULTS: Our cohort included 3,544 individuals with diabetes and 1,388,397 without diabetes. Individuals with diabetes were more likely to suffer from a mood disorder (diagnosed in the emergency department or hospital) (adjusted hazard ratio 1.33 [95% CI 1.19-1.50]), attempt suicide (3.25 [1.79-5.88]), visit a psychiatrist (1.82 [1.67-1.98]), and experience any type of psychiatric disorder (1.29 [1.21-1.37]) compared with their peers without diabetes. CONCLUSIONS: Between the ages of 15 and 25 years, the risks of psychiatric disorders and suicide attempts were substantially higher in adolescents and emerging adults with versus without diabetes. ",
        "Sexual functioning in 4,418 postmenopausal women participating in UKCTOCS: a qualitative free-text analysis. OBJECTIVE: Sexual well-being can contribute significantly to the overall quality of women's lives. This qualitative study aimed to examine sexual activity, functioning, and satisfaction in a large sample of postmenopausal women from the UK Collaborative Trial of Ovarian Cancer Screening (UKCTOCS) METHODS:: Thematic analysis was used to evaluate the free-text data of the Fallowfield Sexual Activity Questionnaire (FSAQ) completed by UKCTOCS participants at baseline before annual screening. RESULTS: A total of 24,305 women completed the baseline FSAQ and 4,525 (19%) provided free-text data, with 4,418 comments eligible for analysis. Median age was 64 years; 65% had a partner and 22.5% were sexually active. Four interrelated themes were derived: partner availability, physical and sexual health, mental well-being, and interpersonal relationships. Primary reason for absence of sexual activity was lack of a partner, mainly due to widowhood (n\u200a=\u200a1,000). Women discussed how partner's medical condition (27%) or sexual dysfunction (13.5%), their own physical health (18%) or menopause-related symptoms (12.5%), and prescribed medication (7%) affected sexual activity. Impact of low libido in self (16%) or partner (7%), relationship problems (10.5%) or logistics (6%), and perceptions of ageing (9%) were also mentioned. Few (3%) referred to positive sexual experiences or had sought medical help for sexual problems (6%). CONCLUSIONS: This qualitative analysis explored postmenopausal women's perspective on their sexual functioning. Having an intimate partner and good physical health are key factors for continuation of sexual activity and satisfaction. Further sexual education for healthcare professionals is needed to raise awareness about sexuality and sexual difficulties in later life. : Video Summary: Supplemental Digital Content 1, http://links.lww.com/MENO/A426.

        "Cannabis Use Is Associated With Increased Risk for Diabetic Ketoacidosis in Adults With Type 1 Diabetes: Findings From the T1D Exchange Clinic Registry. OBJECTIVE: We examined the frequency of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) in cannabis users compared with nonusers in the T1D Exchange clinic registry (T1DX). RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The association between cannabis use by total substance score for cannabis (TSC) and DKA in the past 12 months was examined using a logistic regression model adjusted for potential confounders among adults in the T1DX. RESULTS: Of 932 adults with type 1 diabetes, 61 had a TSC >4, which classified them as moderate cannabis users. Adjusting for sex, age at study visit, and HbA1c, cannabis use was associated with a twofold increase in risk for DKA among adults with type 1 diabetes (odds ratio 2.5 [95% CI 1.0-5.9]). CONCLUSIONS: Cannabis use was associated with an increased risk for DKA among adults in the T1DX. Providers should inform their patients of the potential risk of DKA with cannabis use. ",
        "Long-term Glycemic Control and Dementia Risk in Type 1 Diabetes. OBJECTIVE: Individuals with type 1 diabetes have experienced an increase in life expectancy, yet it is unknown what level of glycemic control is ideal for maintaining late-life brain health. We investigated the association of long-term glycemic control with dementia in older individuals with type 1 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We followed 3,433 members of a health care system with type 1 diabetes, aged \u226550 years, from 1996 to 2015. Repeated measurements of hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), dementia diagnoses, and comorbidities were ascertained from health records. Cox proportional hazards models were fit to evaluate the association of time-varying glycemic exposure with dementia, with adjustment for age, sex, race/ethnicity, baseline health conditions, and frequency of HbA1c measurement. RESULTS: Over a mean follow-up of 6.3 years, 155 individuals (4.5%) were diagnosed with dementia. Patients with \u226550% of HbA1c measurements at 8-8.9% (64-74 mmol/mol) and \u22659% (\u226575 mmol/mol) had 65% and 79% higher risk of dementia, respectively, compared with those with <50% of measurements exposed (HbA1c 8-8.9% adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 1.65 [95% CI 1.06, 2.57] and HbA1c \u22659% aHR 1.79 [95% CI 1.11, 2.90]). By contrast, patients with \u226550% of HbA1c measurements at 6-6.9% (42-52 mmol/mol) and 7-7.9% (53-63 mmol/mol) had a 45% lower risk of dementia (HbA1c 6-6.9% aHR 0.55 [95% CI 0.34, 0.88] and HbA1c 7-7.9% aHR 0.55 [95% CI 0.37, 0.82]). CONCLUSIONS: Among older patients with type 1 diabetes, those with majority exposure to HbA1c 8-8.9% and \u22659% had increased dementia risk, while those with majority exposure to HbA1c 6-6.9% and 7-7.9% had reduced risk. Currently recommended glycemic targets for older patients with type 1 diabetes are consistent with healthy brain aging. ",
        "The Mediterranean Diet and 2-Year Change in Cognitive Function by Status of Type 2 Diabetes and Glycemic Control. OBJECTIVE: To determine associations of a Mediterranean diet score (MeDS) with 2-year change in cognitive function by type 2 diabetes and glycemic control status and contrast it against other diet quality scores. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We used data from the longitudinal Boston Puerto Rican Health Study (n = 913; 42.6% with type 2 diabetes at 2 years). Glycemic control at baseline was categorized as uncontrolled (hemoglobin A1c \u22657% [53 mmol/mol]) versus controlled. Two-year change in glycemic control was defined as stable/improved versus poor/declined. We defined MeDS, Healthy Eating Index, Alternate Healthy Eating Index, and Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension scores. Adjusted mixed linear models assessed 2-year change in global cognitive function z score, executive and memory function, and nine individual cognitive tests. RESULTS: Higher MeDS, but no other diet quality score, was associated with higher 2-year change in global cognitive function in adults with type 2 diabetes (\u03b2 \u00b1 SE = 0.027 \u00b1 0.011; P = 0.016) but not in those without (P = 0.80). Similar results were noted for Mini-Mental State Examination, word recognition, digit span, and clock drawing tests. Results remained consistent for individuals under glycemic control at baseline (0.062 \u00b1 0.020; P = 0.004) and stable/improved over 2 years (0.053 \u00b1 0.019; P = 0.007), but not for individuals with uncontrolled or poor/declined glycemic control. All diet quality scores were associated with higher 2-year memory function in adults without type 2 diabetes. CONCLUSIONS: Both adhering to a Mediterranean diet and effectively managing type 2 diabetes may support optimal cognitive function. Healthy diets, in general, can help improve memory function among adults without type 2 diabetes. ",
        "Long-term Effects of Disasters on Seniors With Diabetes: Evidence From Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. OBJECTIVE: To estimate the long-run mortality effects of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita on seniors with diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort analysis of Medicare enrollment and claims data covering four states and \u223c10 years. Affected individuals were identified by whether they lived in a county that suffered a high impact and were stratified by whether they moved to a different county following the storms. Propensity scores matched affected and comparison subjects based on demographic and socioeconomic characteristics and the presence of chronic conditions. Our sample consisted of 170,328 matched affected subjects. RESULTS: The affected subjects had a nearly 40% higher all-cause mortality risk in the 1st month after the storms, but the difference fell to <6% by the end of the full observation period. The mortality risks of heart disease and nephritis also exhibited the largest differences immediately following the storms. Among the affected subjects, the all-cause mortality risk was higher for those who moved to a different county, with an especially large difference among those who moved to an affected county. CONCLUSIONS: The propensity matching procedure resulted in the comparison and affected groups having similar observable characteristics. However, we only examined the extreme outcome of mortality, our definition of affected was somewhat crude, and our sample did not include individuals enrolled in Medicare Advantage. Our findings highlight the importance of the immediate response to disasters, yet also demonstrate the long-lasting impact disasters can have. ",
        "Association of Time in Range, as Assessed by Continuous Glucose Monitoring, With Diabetic Retinopathy in Type 2 Diabetes. OBJECTIVE: Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) has provided new measures of glycemic control that link to diabetes complications. This study investigated the association between the time in range (TIR) assessed by CGM and diabetic retinopathy (DR). RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 3,262 patients with type 2 diabetes were recruited. TIR was defined as the percentage of time spent within the glucose range of 3.9-10.0 mmol/L during a 24-h period. Measures of glycemic variability (GV) were assessed as well. DR was determined by using fundus photography and graded as 1) non-DR; 2) mild nonproliferative DR (NPDR); 3) moderate NPDR; or 4) vision-threatening DR (VTDR). RESULTS: The overall prevalence of DR was 23.9% (mild NPDR 10.9%, moderate NPDR 6.1%, VTDR 6.9%). Patients with more advanced DR had significantly less TIR and higher measures of GV (all P for trend <0.01). The prevalence of DR on the basis of severity decreased with ascending TIR quartiles (all P for trend <0.001), and the severity of DR was inversely correlated with TIR quartiles (r = -0.147; P < 0.001). Multinomial logistic regression revealed significant associations between TIR and all stages of DR (mild NPDR, P = 0.018; moderate NPDR, P = 0.014; VTDR, P = 0.019) after controlling for age, sex, BMI, diabetes duration, blood pressure, lipid profile, and HbA1c. Further adjustment of GV metrics partially attenuated these associations, although the link between TIR and the presence of any DR remained significant. CONCLUSIONS: TIR assessed by CGM is associated with DR in type 2 diabetes. ",
        "Should Viscous Fiber Supplements Be Considered in Diabetes Control? Results From a Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials. OBJECTIVE: Evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) suggests that viscous dietary fiber may offer beneficial effects on glycemic control and, thus, an improved cardiovascular disease risk profile. Our purpose was to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of RCTs to synthesize the therapeutic effect of viscous fiber supplementation on glycemic control in type 2 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched through 15 June 2018. We included RCTs \u22653 weeks in duration that assessed the effects of viscous fiber on markers of glycemic control in type 2 diabetes. Two independent reviewers extracted data. Data were pooled using the generic inverse variance method and expressed as mean differences (MD) with 95% CIs. Heterogeneity was assessed (Cochran Q statistic) and quantified (I2 statistic). The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach was used to evaluate the overall certainty of the evidence. RESULTS: We identified 28 eligible trial comparisons (n = 1,394). Viscous fiber at a median dose of \u223c13.1 g/day significantly reduced HbA1c (MD -0.58% [95% CI -0.88, -0.28]; P = 0.0002), fasting blood glucose (MD -0.82 mmol/L [95% CI -1.32, -0.31]; P = 0.001), and HOMA-insulin resistance (IR) (MD -1.89 [95% CI -3.45, -0.33]; P = 0.02) compared with control and in addition to standard of care. The certainty of evidence was graded moderate for HbA1c, fasting glucose, fasting insulin, and HOMA-IR and low for fructosamine. CONCLUSIONS: Viscous fiber supplements improve conventional markers of glycemic control beyond usual care and should be considered in the management of type 2 diabetes. ",
        "Socioeconomic Inequality in Metabolic Control Among Children With Type 1 Diabetes: A Nationwide Longitudinal Study of 4,079 Danish Children. OBJECTIVE: To examine inequality in glycemic control by maternal educational level among children with type 1 diabetes in a setting with universal access to health care. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This was a longitudinal nationwide study of 4,079 Danish children with type 1 diabetes between the years 2000 and 2013. Children were divided into four groups based on mothers' education prebirth (\u2264high school [n = 1,643], vocational or 2-year college [n = 1,548], bachelor's degree [n = 695], \u2265master's degree [n = 193]). Means of socioeconomic and treatment characteristics were compared between groups. HbA1c and the number of daily glucose tests were compared repeatedly from onset until 5 years after onset across groups. HbA1c was compared across daily blood glucose testing frequency and groups. Linear regression was used to compare HbA1c across groups with and without adjustment for socioeconomic and treatment characteristics. RESULTS: Large differences in HbA1c across maternal education were found. The mean level of HbA1c during follow-up was 59.7 mmol/mol (7.6%) for children of mothers with \u2265master's degrees and 68.7 mmol/mol (8.4%) for children of mothers with \u2264high school (difference: 9.0 mmol/mol [95% CI 7.5, 10.6]; 0.8% [95% CI 0.7, 1.0]). The associations were attenuated but remained significant after adjustment. Observable characteristics explained 41.2% of the difference in HbA1c between children of mothers with \u2264high school and mothers with \u2265master's degree; 22.5% of the difference was explained by more frequent blood glucose monitoring among the children with the highly educated mothers. CONCLUSIONS: Family background is significantly related to outcomes for children with type 1 diabetes, even with universal access to health care. ",
        "Impact of increasing vegetarian availability on meal selection and sales in cafeterias. Shifting people in higher income countries toward more plant-based diets would protect the natural environment and improve population health. Research in other domains suggests altering the physical environments in which people make decisions (\"nudging\") holds promise for achieving socially desirable behavior change. Here, we examine the impact of attempting to nudge meal selection by increasing the proportion of vegetarian meals offered in a year-long large-scale series of observational and experimental field studies. Anonymized individual-level data from 94,644 meals purchased in 2017 were collected from 3 cafeterias at an English university. Doubling the proportion of vegetarian meals available from 25 to 50% (e.g., from 1 in 4 to 2 in 4 options) increased vegetarian meal sales (and decreased meat meal sales) by 14.9 and 14.5 percentage points in the observational study (2 cafeterias) and by 7.8 percentage points in the experimental study (1 cafeteria), equivalent to proportional increases in vegetarian meal sales of 61.8%, 78.8%, and 40.8%, respectively. Linking sales data to participants' previous meal purchases revealed that the largest effects were found in the quartile of diners with the lowest prior levels of vegetarian meal selection. Moreover, serving more vegetarian options had little impact on overall sales and did not lead to detectable rebound effects: Vegetarian sales were not lower at other mealtimes. These results provide robust evidence to support the potential for simple changes to catering practices to make an important contribution to achieving more sustainable diets at the population level.

        "Changes in Consumption of Sugary Beverages and Artificially Sweetened Beverages and Subsequent Risk of Type 2 Diabetes: Results From Three Large Prospective U.S. Cohorts of Women and Men. OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the associations of long-term changes in consumption of sugary beverages (including sugar-sweetened beverages and 100% fruit juices) and artificially sweetened beverages (ASBs) with subsequent risk of type 2 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We followed up 76,531 women in the Nurses' Health Study (1986-2012), 81,597 women in the Nurses' Health Study II (1991-2013), and 34,224 men in the Health Professionals' Follow-up Study (1986-2012). Changes in beverage consumption (in 8-ounce servings/day) were calculated from food frequency questionnaires administered every 4 years. Multivariable Cox proportional regression models were used to calculate hazard ratios for diabetes associated with changes in beverage consumption. Results of the three cohorts were pooled using an inverse variance-weighted, fixed-effect meta-analysis. RESULTS: During 2,783,210 person-years of follow-up, we documented 11,906 incident cases of type 2 diabetes. After adjustment for BMI and initial and changes in diet and lifestyle covariates, increasing total sugary beverage intake (including both sugar-sweetened beverages and 100% fruit juices) by >0.50 serving/day over a 4-year period was associated with a 16% (95% CI 1%, 34%) higher diabetes risk in the subsequent 4 years. Increasing ASB consumption by >0.50 serving/day was associated with 18% (2%, 36%) higher diabetes risk. Replacing one daily serving of sugary beverage with water, coffee, or tea, but not ASB, was associated with a 2-10% lower diabetes risk. CONCLUSIONS: Increasing consumption of sugary beverages or ASBs was associated with a higher risk of type 2 diabetes, albeit the latter association may be affected by reverse causation and surveillance bias.

        "Quantifying the impact of the Public Health Responsibility Deal on salt intake, cardiovascular disease and gastric cancer burdens: interrupted time series and microsimulation study. BACKGROUND: In 2011, England introduced the Public Health Responsibility Deal (RD), a public-private partnership (PPP) which gave greater freedom to the food industry to set and monitor targets for salt intakes. We estimated the impact of the RD on trends in salt intake and associated changes in cardiovascular disease (CVD) and gastric cancer (GCa) incidence, mortality and economic costs in England from 2011-2025. METHODS: We used interrupted time series models with 24 hours' urine sample data and the IMPACTNCD microsimulation model to estimate impacts of changes in salt consumption on CVD and GCa incidence, mortality and economic impacts, as well as equity impacts. RESULTS: Between 2003 and 2010 mean salt intake was falling annually by 0.20 grams/day among men and 0.12 g/d among women (P-value for trend both < 0.001). After RD implementation in 2011, annual declines in salt intake slowed statistically significantly to 0.11 g/d among men and 0.07 g/d among women (P-values for differences in trend both P < 0.001). We estimated that the RD has been responsible for approximately 9900 (interquartile quartile range (IQR): 6700 to 13,000) additional cases of CVD and 1500 (IQR: 510 to 2300) additional cases of GCa between 2011 and 2018. If the RD continues unchanged between 2019 and 2025, approximately 26\u2009000 (IQR: 20\u2009000 to 31,000) additional cases of CVD and 3800 (IQR: 2200 to 5300) cases of GCa may occur. INTERPRETATION: Public-private partnerships such as the RD which lack robust and independent target setting, monitoring and enforcement are unlikely to produce optimal health gains. ",
        "Rising Mortality From Alcohol-Associated Liver Disease in the United States in the 21st Century. OBJECTIVES: In contrast with other developed nations, life expectancy is decreasing in the United States, in part due to increasing mortality from alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD). Up-to-date estimates of ALD mortality are necessary for setting public health priorities to reverse this concerning trend. We therefore aimed to assess current (2017) estimates of ALD mortality and temporal trends from 1999 to 2017. METHODS: Using national data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, we analyzed stratified ALD mortality rates between 1999 and 2017. We determined the age-adjusted death rates, stratified by sex and categorized by age, race/ethnicity, urbanization, and census region. We also identified statistically significant changes in the annual rate difference (ARD), annual percentage change (APC), and average APC in ALD mortality. RESULTS: In 2017, mortality from ALD was higher than any other year since 1999 with age-adjusted rates of 13.1 per 100,000 (95% confidence interval [CI] 12.9-13.3) in men and 5.6 per 100,000 (95% CI 5.4-5.7) in women. Mortality was highest among men and women who were middle aged, Native American, and from rural areas. Since 2006, ALD mortality has increased in almost every age group and race with the exception of non-Hispanic black men. Absolute increases in mortality rates have been particularly pronounced in Native American women (2005-2017 ARD 0.8, 95% CI 0.6-0.9), non-Hispanic/white men (2006-2017 ARD 0.4, 95% CI 0.3-0.4), and non-Hispanic/white women (2013-2017 ARD 0.4, 95% CI 0.3-0.5). DISCUSSION: Mortality from ALD is increasing over time in most demographic groups. Increased effort is needed to develop targeted public health strategies to address high and increasing ALD mortality. ",
        "Preparation for the next major incident: are we ready? A 12-year update. OBJECTIVES: A major incident is any emergency that requires special arrangements by the emergency services and generally involves a large number of people. Recent such events in England have included the Manchester Arena bombing and the Grenfell Tower disaster. Hospitals are required by law to keep a major incident plan (MIP) outlining the response to such an event. In a survey conducted in 2006 we found a substantial knowledge gap among key individuals that would be expected to respond to the enactment of an MIP. We set out to repeat this survey study and assess any improvement since our original report. METHODS: We identified NHS trusts in England that received more than 30\u2009000 patients through the emergency department in the fourth quarter of the 2016/2017 period. We contacted the on-call anaesthetic, emergency, general surgery, and trauma and orthopaedic registrar at each location and asked each individual to answer a short verbal survey assessing their confidence in using their hospital's MIP. RESULTS: Of those eligible for the study, 62% were able to be contacted and consented to the study. In total 50% of respondents had read all or part of their hospital's MIP, 46.8% were confident that they knew where their plan was stored, and 36% knew the role they would play if a plan came into effect. These results show less confidence among middle-grade doctors compared with 2006. CONCLUSIONS: Confidence in using MIPs among specialty registrars in England is still low. In light of this, we make a number of recommendations designed to improve the education of hospital doctors in reacting to major incidents. ",
        "Occurrence of Salmonella, Campylobacter, Clostridium and Enterobacteriaceae in raw meat-based diets for dogs. The practice of feeding raw meat-based diets (RMBD) to dogs has increased in popularity in recent years. However, RMBD are based on offal that has not undergone any type of treatment to reduce the microbial content, so there is a risk of potential pathogenic microorganisms being present. Frozen samples from 60 RMBD packs produced by 10 different manufacturers were analysed for their content of bacteria belonging to the family Enterobacteriaceae, for Clostridium perfringens and for the presence of Salmonella and Campylobacter. Enterobacteriaceae were detected in all 60 samples and in 31 samples exceeded a level of 5000 bacteria/g, which is the threshold for satisfactory microbial hygiene according to EU regulations. In two samples, the amount of C. perfringens exceeded 5000 bacteria/g, which is the maximum level of anaerobic bacteria permitted by Swedish national guidelines. Salmonella species were found in four (7 per cent) and Campylobacter species in three (5 per cent) samples. These results show that it is critical to maintain good hygiene when storing, handling and feeding RMBD, in order to limit the potential health risks to animals and humans, especially young and immunocompromised individuals.

        "Compassionate End-of-Life Care: Mixed-Methods Multisite Evaluation of the 3 Wishes Project. Background: The 3 Wishes Project (3WP) is an end-of-life program that aims to honor the dignity of dying patients by creating meaningful patient- and family-centered memories while promoting humanistic interprofessional care. Objective: To determine whether this palliative intervention could be successfully implemented-defined as demonstrating value, transferability, affordability, and sustainability-beyond the intensive care unit in which it was created. Design: Mixed-methods formative program evaluation. (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT04147169). Setting: 4 North American intensive care units. Participants: Dying patients, their families, clinicians, hospital managers, and administrators. Intervention: Wishes from dying patients, family members, and clinicians were elicited and implemented. Measurements: Patient characteristics and processes of care; the number, type, and cost of each wish; and semistructured interviews and focus groups with family members, clinicians, and managers. Results: A total of 730 patients were enrolled, and 3407 wishes were elicited. Qualitative data were gathered from 75 family members, 72 clinicians, and 20 managers or hospital administrators. Value included intentional comforting of families as they honored the lives and legacies of their loved ones while inspiring compassionate clinical care. Factors promoting transferability included family appreciation and a collaborative intensive care unit culture committed to dignity-conserving end-of-life care. Staff participation evolved from passive support to professional agency. Program initiation required minimal investment for reusable materials; thereafter, the mean cost was $5.19 (SD, $17.14) per wish. Sustainability was demonstrated by the continuation of 3WP at each site after study completion. Limitation: This descriptive formative evaluation describes tertiary care center-specific experiences rather than aiming for generalizability to all jurisdictions. Conclusion: The 3WP is a transferrable, affordable, and sustainable program that provides value to dying patients, their families, clinicians, and institutions.

        "Injuries associated with electric-powered bikes and scooters: analysis of US consumer product data. BACKGROUND: Powered, two-wheeled transportation devices like electric bicycles (E-bikes) and scooters are increasingly popular, but little is known about their relative injury risk compared to pedal operated bicycles. METHODS: Descriptive and comparative analysis of injury patterns and trends associated with E-bikes, powered scooters and pedal bicycles from 2000 to 2017 using the US National Electronic Injury Surveillance System. RESULTS: While persons injured using E-bikes were more likely to suffer internal injuries (17.1%; 95%\u2009CI 5.6 to 28.6) and require hospital admission (OR=2.8, 95%\u2009CI 1.3 to 6.1), powered scooter injuries were nearly three times more likely to result in a diagnosis of concussion (3% of scooter injuries vs 0.5% of E-bike injuries). E-bike-related injuries were also more than three times more likely to involve a collision with a pedestrian than either pedal bicycles (OR=3.3, 95% CI 0.5 to 23.6) or powered scooters (OR=3.3, 95% CI 0.3 to 32.9), but there was no evidence that powered scooters were more likely than bicycles to be involved in a collision with a pedestrian (OR=1.0, 95%\u2009CI 0.3 to 3.1). While population-based rates of pedal bicycle-related injuries have been decreasing, particularly among children, reported E-bike injuries have been increasing dramatically particularly among older persons. CONCLUSIONS: E-bike and powered scooter use and injury patterns differ from more traditional pedal operated bicycles. Efforts to address injury prevention and control are warranted, and further studies examining demographics and hospital resource utilisation are necessary. ",
        "Gun laws and school safety. BACKGROUND: This paper examines the associations between state-level gun control and adolescent school safety overall and by student sex, age, and race. METHODS: We used data on 926\u2009639 adolescents from 45 states in the 1999-2015 Youth Risk Behavior Surveys. Students self-reported on weapon carrying at school, the number of times they experienced weapon threats or injuries at school, the number of school days missed due to feeling unsafe, and weapon carrying at any location. For each state and year, 133 gun laws were combined into an index of gun control strength. Difference-in-differences logistic regression models were used to evaluate the associations of stricter gun laws with binary measures of students' weapon carrying and perception of school safety, controlling for individual and state characteristics, as well as year and state fixed effects. RESULTS: An IQR increase in the index (ie, a 15-point increase corresponding to a strengthening of gun control) was associated with a 0.8-percentage point decrease in the probability of weapon threats at school (p=0.029), a 1.1-percentage point decrease in the probability of missing school due to feeling unsafe (p=0.002) and a 1.9-percentage point decrease in the probability of carrying weapons at any location (p=0.001). Stricter gun laws had a stronger negative association with weapon carrying among males compared with females. Stricter gun laws were also differentially associated with weapon carrying by race/ethnicity. CONCLUSIONS: The adoption of stricter state gun laws was associated with improvements in school climate and subjective perceptions of safety. ",
        "Physician Time Spent Using the Electronic Health Record During Outpatient Encounters: A Descriptive Study. Background: The amount of time that providers spend using electronic health records (EHRs) to support the care delivery process is a concern for the U.S. health care system. Given the potential effect on patient care and the high costs related to this time, particularly for medical specialists whose work is largely cognitive, these findings warrant more precise documentation of the time physicians invest in these clinically focused EHR functions. Objective: To describe how much time ambulatory medical subspecialists and primary care physicians across several U.S. care delivery systems spend on various EHR functions. Design: Descriptive study. Setting: U.S.-based, adult, nonsurgical, ambulatory practices using the Cerner Millennium EHR. Participants: 155\u00a0000 U.S. physicians. Measurements: Data were extracted from software log files in the Lights On Network (Cerner) during 2018 that totaled the time spent on each of the 13 clinically focused EHR functions. Averages per encounter by specialty were computed. Results: This study included data from approximately 100 million patient encounters with about 155\u00a0000 physicians from 417 health systems. Physicians spent an average of 16 minutes and 14 seconds per encounter using EHRs, with chart review (33%), documentation (24%), and ordering (17%) functions accounting for most of the time. The distribution of time spent by providers using EHRs varies greatly within specialty. The proportion of time spent on various clinically focused functions was similar across specialties. Limitations: Variation by health system could not be examined, and all providers used the same software. Conclusion: The time spent using EHRs to support care delivery constitutes a large portion of the physicians' day, and wide variation suggests opportunities to optimize systems and processes. Primary Funding Source: None. ",
        "Binge Drinking Among Older Adults in the United States, 2015 to 2017. OBJECTIVES: Binge drinking is a risk factor for a range of harms. This study estimates the national prevalence of binge drinking and adds to our understanding of correlates of binge drinking among older adults in the United States. DESIGN: Cross-sectional analysis. SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: A total of 10 927 adults, aged\u200965\u2009years or older, from the 2015 to 2017 administrations of the US National Survey on Drug Use and Health. MEASUREMENTS: We estimated the prevalence of past-month binge alcohol use (five or more drinks on the same occasion for men and\u2009four or more drinks on the same occasion for women). Characteristics of past-month binge drinkers, including demographics, substance use, serious mental illness, mental health treatment utilization, chronic disease, and emergency department (ED) use, were compared to participants who reported past-month alcohol use without binge drinking. Comparisons were made using \u03c72 tests. We then used multivariable generalized linear models using Poisson and log link to examine the association between covariates and binge drinking among all past-month alcohol users aged\u200965 years or older. RESULTS: Of 10 927 respondents, 10.6% (95% CI = 9.9%-11.2%) were estimated to be current binge drinkers. Binge drinkers were more likely to be male, have a higher prevalence of current tobacco and/or cannabis use, and have a lower prevalence of two or more chronic diseases compared to nonbinge drinkers. In multivariable analysis, among past-month alcohol users, the prevalence of binge drinking was higher among non-Hispanic African Americans than whites (adjusted prevalence ratio [aPR] = 1.44; 95% CI = 1.16-1.80), tobacco users (aPR = 1.52; 95% CI = 1.33-1.74), cannabis users (aPR = 1.41; 95% CI = 1.11-1.80), and those who visited the ED in the past year (aPR = 1.16; 95% CI = 1.00-1.33). CONCLUSION: Over a tenth of older adults in the United States are estimated to be current binge drinkers. Results confirm the importance of screening for binge drinking behaviors among older adults to minimize harms. J Am Geriatr Soc 67:2139-2144, 2019. ",
        "Effect of Aerobic or Resistance Exercise, or Both, on Bone Mineral Density and Bone Metabolism in Obese Older Adults While Dieting: A Randomized Controlled Trial. Weight loss therapy of older adults with obesity is limited by weight loss-induced decrease in bone mineral density (BMD), which could exacerbate ongoing age-related bone loss and increase the risk for fractures. Therefore, it is recommended that weight loss therapy of older adults with obesity should include an intervention such as regular exercise to reduce the concomitant bone loss. However, the most appropriate exercise types to combine with weight loss therapy in this older population is unknown. In a randomized controlled trial, we performed a head-to-head comparison of aerobic or resistance exercise, or both, during matched ~10% weight loss in 160 older adults with obesity. We measured changes in BMD (total hip, femoral neck, trochanter, intertrochanter, one-third radius, lumbar spine) and bone markers. Changes between groups were analyzed using mixed-model repeated measures analyses of variance. After 6\u2009months of intensive lifestyle interventions, BMD decreased less in the resistance group (-0.006\u2009g/cm2 [-0.7%]) and combination group (-0.012\u2009g/cm2 [-1.1%]) than in the aerobic group (-0.027\u2009g/cm2 [-2.6%]) (p = 0.001 for between-group comparisons). Serum C-telopeptide, procollagen type 1\u2009N-propeptide, and osteocalcin concentrations increased more in the aerobic group (33%, 16%, and 16%, respectively) than in the resistance group (7%, 2%, and 0%, respectively) and combination group (11%, 2%, and 5%, respectively) (p = 0.004 to 0.048 for between-group comparisons). Multiple regression analyses revealed that the decline in whole body mass and serum leptin were the independent predictors of the decline in hip BMD (multiple R = 0.45 [p\u2009<\u2009.001]). These findings indicate that compared with aerobic exercise, resistance and combined aerobic and resistance exercise are associated with less weight loss-induced decrease in hip BMD and less weight loss-induced increase in bone turnover. Therefore, both resistance and combined aerobic and resistance exercise can be recommended to protect against bone loss during weight loss therapy of older adults with obesity.

        "Exercise for preventing falls in older people living in the community: an abridged Cochrane systematic Review. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of exercise interventions for preventing falls in older people living in the community. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials evaluating the effects of any form of exercise as a single intervention on falls in people aged 60+years living in the community. RESULTS: Exercise reduces the rate of falls by 23% (rate ratio (RaR) 0.77, 95% CI 0.71 to 0.83; 12\u2009981 participants, 59 studies; high-certainty evidence). Subgroup analyses showed no evidence of a difference in effect on falls on the basis of risk of falling as a trial inclusion criterion, participant age 75 years+ or group versus individual exercise but revealed a larger effect of exercise in trials where interventions were delivered by a health professional (usually a physiotherapist). Different forms of exercise had different impacts on falls. Compared with control, balance and functional exercises reduce the rate of falls by 24% (RaR 0.76, 95%\u2009CI 0.70 to 0.81; 7920 participants, 39 studies; high-certainty evidence). Multiple types of exercise (commonly balance and functional exercises plus resistance exercises) probably reduce the rate of falls by 34% (RaR 0.66, 95%\u2009CI 0.50 to 0.88; 1374 participants, 11 studies; moderate-certainty evidence). Tai Chi may reduce the rate of falls by 19% (RaR 0.81, 95%\u2009CI 0.67 to 0.99; 2655 participants, 7 studies; low-certainty evidence). We are uncertain of the effects of programmes that primarily involve resistance training, dance or walking. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Given the certainty of evidence, effective programmes should now be implemented. ",
        "The Clinical Course after Long-Term Acute Care Hospital Admission among Older Medicare Beneficiaries. OBJECTIVES: Long-term acute care (LTAC) hospitals provide extended complex post-acute care to more than 120 000 Medicare beneficiaries annually, with the goal of helping patients to regain independence and recover. Because little is known about patients' long-term outcomes, we sought to examine the clinical course after LTAC admission. DESIGN: Nationally representative 5-year cohort study using 5% Medicare data from 2009 to 2013. SETTING: LTAC hospitals. PARTICIPANTS: Hospitalized Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries 65\u2009years of age or older who were transferred to an LTAC hospital. MEASUREMENTS: Mortality, recovery (defined as achieving 60 consecutive days alive without inpatient care), time spent in an inpatient facility following LTAC hospital admission, receipt of an artificial life-prolonging procedure (feeding tube, tracheostomy, hemodialysis), and palliative care physician consultation. RESULTS: Of 14 072 hospitalized older adults transferred to an LTAC hospital, median survival was 8.3 months, and 1- and 5-year survival rates were 45% and 18%, respectively. Following LTAC admission, 53% never achieved a 60-day recovery. The median time of their remaining life a patient spent as an inpatient after LTAC admission was 65.6% (interquartile range = 21.4%-100%). More than one-third (36.9%) died in an inpatient setting, never returning home after the LTAC admission. During the preceding hospitalization and index LTAC admission, 30.9% received an artificial life-prolonging procedure, and 1% had a palliative care physician consultation. CONCLUSION: Hospitalized older adults transferred to LTAC hospitals have poor survival, spend most of their remaining life as an inpatient, and frequently undergo life-prolonging procedures. This prognostic understanding is essential to inform goals of care discussions and prioritize healthcare needs for hospitalized older adults admitted to LTAC hospitals. Given the exceedingly low rates of palliative care consultations, future research is needed to examine unmet palliative care needs in this population. J Am Geriatr Soc 67:2282-2288, 2019. ",
        "Change in moderate alcohol consumption and quality of life: evidence from 2 population-based cohorts. BACKGROUND: Although the association of moderate alcohol consumption with specific disorders, such as cardiovascular disease and cancers, has been well documented, the evidence of the broader impact of alcohol consumption on health-related quality of life is less clear. Our objective was to examine the association of drinking patterns with changes in physical and mental well-being across populations. METHODS: We conducted a multilevel analysis with multivariate responses in the population-representative FAMILY Cohort in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China, to examine the association between alcohol drinking patterns across 2 waves (2009-2013) (i.e., quitters, initiators, persistent drinkers, persistent former drinkers and lifetime abstainers) and changes in physical and mental well-being (Physical and Mental Component Summary of the 12-Item Short Form Health Survey [SF-12]). Analyses were stratified by sex. We validated findings using a nationally representative cohort in the United States, the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC, 2001-2005). RESULTS: In the FAMILY Cohort (n = 10 386; median follow-up 2.3 yr), the change in mental well-being was more favourable in female quitters than in lifetime abstainers (\u03b2 = 1.44, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.43 to 2.45; mean score change of +2.0 for quitters and +0.02 for lifetime abstainers). This association was validated in the NESARC (n = 31 079; median follow-up 3.1 yr) (\u03b2 = 0.83, 95% CI 0.08 to 1.58; mean score change of -1.1 for quitters and -1.6 for lifetime abstainers). INTERPRETATION: The change in mental well-being was more favourable in female quitters, approaching the level of mental well-being of lifetime abstainers within 4 years of quitting in both Chinese and American populations.

        "Evaluation of the provision of helicopter emergency medical services in Europe. BACKGROUND: Helicopter emergency medical services (HEMS) are a useful means of reducing inequity of access to specialist emergency care. The aim of this study was to evaluate the variations in HEMS provision across Europe, in order to inform the further development of emergency care systems. METHODS: This is a survey of primary HEMS in the 32 countries of the European Economic Area and Switzerland. Information was gathered through internet searches (May to September 2016), and by emailing service providers, requesting verification and completion of data (September 2016 to July 2017). HEMS provision was calculated as helicopters per million population and per 1000\u2009km2 land area, by day and by night, and per US$10\u2009billion of gross domestic product (GDP), for each country. RESULTS: In 2016, the smallest and least prosperous countries had no dedicated HEMS provision. Luxembourg had the highest number of helicopters by area and population, day and night. Alpine countries had high daytime HEMS coverage and Scandinavia had good night-time coverage. Most helicopters carried a doctor. Funding of services varied from public to charitable and private. Most services performed both primary (from the scene) and secondary (interfacility) missions. CONCLUSIONS: Within Europe, there is a large variation in the number of helicopters available for emergency care, regardless of whether assessed with reference to population, land area or GDP. Funding of services varied, and did not seem to be clearly related to the availability of HEMS. ",
        "No rest for the weary: a cross-sectional study comparing patients' sleep in the emergency department to those on the ward. BACKGROUND: Boarding in emergency departments (EDs) is a persistent problem worldwide. We hypothesised that patients sleeping while being boarded in EDs have worse self-rated sleep than those admitted from EDs who sleep on the ward. METHODS: Prospective cross-sectional study conducted at the University College Hospital, Galway between October and November 2016. Self-rated sleep in patients boarded in EDs from 23:00 to 07:00 was compared with those admitted to the ward before 23:00. Patients rated their sleep using the Richards-Campbell Sleep Questionnaire. Patients were excluded if they had cognitive impairment, were unable or incapacitated or had evidence of alcohol or drug use in the previous 24\u2009hours. Continuous data are shown as medians (IQRs 25th-75th percentiles). Linear regression models of log-transformed outcome variables were performed. RESULTS: Ninety-three patients were included and 22 were excluded. Patients who boarded in the ED were significantly more likely to be medical patients (78% vs 21%, p<0.001), to be older (median age (IQR)=60 (39-71) vs 47 (32-68), p=0.04) and have more urgent presentations (74% vs 48% presenting as Manchester triage category 1 or 2, p=0.01) than patients who sleep on a ward. Patients who slept on the ward had significantly better sleep scores (mean log-transformed sleep scores (SD)=2.92 (1.05) vs 3.72 (0.66), p<0.001)). Those sleeping in the ED reported greater noisiness than those sleeping on the ward (mean log-transformed noisiness scores (SD)=3.18 (1.10) vs 4.15 (0.57), p<0.001). These significant differences in sleep scores and noisiness ratings persisted after adjustment for age, triage category and admitting service. CONCLUSION: We found those who sleep boarded in EDs have worse self-rated sleep than those who sleep on the ward. ",
        "Skipping has lower knee joint contact forces and higher metabolic cost compared to running. BACKGROUND: The health benefits of running based exercise programs are plentiful however the high rate of injury in these programs often reduces or eliminates exercise participation. Skipping has shorter steps, reduced vertical ground reaction forces (GRFs), and lower knee extensor torques, compared to running forming the basis of the present hypothesis that skipping would have lower tibio-femoral and patello-femoral joint contact forces. RESEARCH QUESTION: The purpose of this study was to compare knee contact forces between skipping and running at the same speed. We also compared metabolic cost of these two gaits to examine the idea that the larger vertical displacement in skipping is a primary factor in its previously reported high metabolic cost. METHODS: The study evaluated joint contact forces through musculoskeletal modeling with GRF and 3D kinematic data and metabolic cost using oxygen consumption data from 20 young, healthy, trained participants as they skipped and ran on an instrumented treadmill at 2.68\u2009m/s. RESULTS: Skipping, compared to running, had substantially lower tibio-femoral and patello-femoral joint contact forces and linear impulses on both per-step and per-kilometer (i.e. lower cumulative loads) bases and also 30% higher metabolic cost. The lower joint loads in skipping were directly associated with its shorter steps and the higher metabolic cost was directly associated to its larger vertical displacement through the stride. SIGNIFICANCE: As joint loads may predispose individuals to running related injuries, skipping presents an attractive alternative exercise modality with additional increased aerobic benefits. ",
        "Is interval training the magic bullet for fat loss? A systematic review and meta-analysis comparing moderate-intensity continuous training with high-intensity interval training (HIIT). OBJECTIVES: To compare the effects of interval training and moderate-intensity continuous training (MOD) on body adiposity in humans, and to perform subgroup analyses that consider the type and duration of interval training in different groups. DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis. DATA SOURCES: English-language, Spanish-language and Portuguese-language searches of the electronic databases PubMed and Scopus were conducted from inception to 11 December 2017. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR SELECTING STUDIES: Studies that met the following criteria were included: (1) original articles, (2) human trials, (3) minimum exercise training duration of 4 weeks, and (4) directly or indirectly compared interval training with MOD as the primary or secondary aim. RESULTS: Of the 786 studies found, 41 and 36 were included in the qualitative analysis and meta-analysis, respectively. Within-group analyses showed significant reductions in total body fat percentage (%) (interval training: -1.50 [95% CI -2.14 to -0.86, p<0.00001] and MOD: -1.44 [95% CI -2.00 to -0.89, p<0.00001]) and in total absolute fat mass (kg) (interval training: -1.58 [95% CI -2.74 to -0.43, p=0.007] and MOD: -1.13 [95% CI -2.18 to -0.08, p=0.04]), with no significant differences between interval training and MOD for total body fat percentage reduction (-0.23 [95% CI -1.43 to 0.97], p=0.705). However, there was a significant difference between the groups in total absolute fat mass (kg) reduction (-2.28 [95% CI -4.00 to -0.56], p=0.0094). Subgroup analyses comparing sprint interval training (SIT) with MOD protocols favour SIT for loss of total absolute fat mass (kg) (-3.22 [95% CI -5.71 to -0.73], p=0.01). Supervised training, walking/running/jogging, age (<30 years), study quality and intervention duration (<12 weeks) favourably influence the decreases in total absolute fat mass (kg) observed from interval training programmes; however, no significant effect was found on total body fat percentage (%). No effect of sex or body mass index was observed on total absolute fat mass (kg) or total body fat percentage (%). CONCLUSION: Interval training and MOD both reduce body fat percentage (%). Interval training provided 28.5% greater reductions in total absolute fat mass (kg) than MOD. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: CRD42018089427. ",
        "Management of Ocular Allergy Itch With an Antihistamine-Releasing Contact Lens. PURPOSE: A contact lens (CL)-based drug delivery system for therapeutic delivery of the antihistamine ketotifen was tested in 2 parallel, conjunctival allergen challenge-based trials. METHODS: Both trials employed the same multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled protocol. Test lenses were etafilcon A with 0.019 mg ketotifen; control lenses were etafilcon A with no added drug. Subjects were randomized into 3 treatment groups. Group 1 received test lens in one eye and control lens in the contralateral eye; the eye chosen to receive test lens was randomly selected in a 1:1 ratio. Group 2 received test lenses bilaterally, and group 3 received control lenses bilaterally. Allergen challenges were conducted on 2 separate visits: following lens insertion, the subjects were challenged at 15 minutes (to test onset) and 12 hours (to test duration). The primary endpoint was ocular itching measured using a 0 to 4 scale with half-unit steps. Secondary endpoints included ciliary, conjunctival, and episcleral hyperemia. RESULTS: The mean itching scores were lower for eyes wearing the test lens as compared to those that received control lenses, indicating that the test lens effectively reduced allergic responses. Mean differences in itching were statistically and clinically significant (mean score difference \u2265 1) at both onset and duration for both trials. CONCLUSIONS: This large-scale assessment (n = 244) is the first demonstration of efficacy for CL delivery of a therapeutic for ocular allergy. Results are comparable to direct topical drug delivery and suggest that the lens/ketotifen combination can provide a means of simultaneous vision correction and treatment for CL wearers with ocular allergies.

        "Household cleaning product-related ocular exposures reported to the United States poison control centres. BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: To investigate ocular exposures associated with household cleaning products in the United States. SUBJECTS/METHODS: A retrospective analysis of ocular exposures associated with household cleaning products was conducted using data from the National Poison Data System from 2000 through 2016. RESULTS: From January 2000 through December 2016, poison control centres in the United States received 319,508 calls for household cleaning product-related ocular exposures, averaging 18,795 exposures annually. The annual frequency of exposures decreased significantly by 28.8% during the study period. The rate of exposures per 100,000 US residents was 28.4 among young children (<6 years), 4.8 among older children (6-12 years), 4.2 among teenagers (13-19 years), and 4.2 among adults (\u226520 years); children 2 years old had the highest rate of exposure (62.8). Bleaches (25.9%), wall/floor/tile cleaners (13.4%), disinfectants (10.8%), laundry detergents (6.1%), and glass cleaners (5.3%) were the non-miscellaneous product subcategories most commonly associated with ocular exposures. The product subcategories associated with the greatest proportion of major medical outcomes were drain cleaners (1.4%), oven cleaners (1.1%), and automatic dishwasher detergents (0.4%). CONCLUSIONS: On average, the United States poison control centres received approximately two reports of household cleaning product-related ocular exposures every hour during the 17-year study period. Although the annual number and rate of exposures declined during this time, the number of these exposures remains high, especially among young children, underscoring the need for additional prevention efforts. Contrary to the overall trend, ocular exposures to laundry detergent packets have increased significantly and merit special preventive action. ",
        "Genes for Good: Engaging the Public in Genetics Research via Social Media. The Genes for Good study uses social media to engage a large, diverse participant pool in genetics research and education. Health history and daily tracking surveys are administered through a Facebook application, and participants who complete a minimum number of surveys are mailed a saliva sample kit (\"spit kit\") to collect DNA for genotyping. As of March 2019, we engaged >80,000 individuals, sent spit kits to >32,000 individuals who met minimum participation requirements, and collected >27,000 spit kits. Participants come from all 50 states and include a diversity of ancestral backgrounds. Rates of important chronic health indicators are consistent with those estimated for the general U.S. population using more traditional study designs. However, our sample is younger and contains a greater percentage of females than the general population. As one means of verifying data quality, we have replicated genome-wide association studies (GWASs) for exemplar traits, such as asthma, diabetes, body mass index (BMI), and pigmentation. The flexible framework of the web application makes it relatively simple to add new questionnaires and for other researchers to collaborate. We anticipate that the study sample will continue to grow and that future analyses may further capitalize on the strengths of the longitudinal data in combination with genetic information. ",
        "Effectiveness of a Voice Smoke Alarm Using the Child's Name for Sleeping Children: A Randomized Trial. OBJECTIVES: To test maternal voice alarm effectiveness under residential conditions and determine whether personalizing the maternal voice alarm message with the child's first name improves effectiveness. STUDY DESIGN: Using a randomized, nonblinded, repeated measures design, we compared 3 maternal voice smoke alarms with respect to their ability to awaken 176 children 5-12 years old from stage 4 slow-wave sleep and prompt their performance of an escape procedure. A conventional residential high-frequency tone smoke alarm was used as a comparative reference. Children's sleep stage was monitored in a residence-like research setting. RESULTS: Maternal voice alarms awakened 86%-91% of children and prompted 84%-86% to escape compared with 53% awakened and 51% escaped for the tone alarm. A sleeping child was 2.9-3.4 times more likely to be awakened by each of the 3 voice alarms than the tone alarm. The median time to awaken was 156 seconds for the tone alarm and 2 seconds for each voice alarm. The proportions of children who awakened and escaped differed significantly between the tone alarm and each voice alarm, but no significant differences were found between each pair of the voice alarms, regardless of whether the child's first name was included in the alarm message. CONCLUSIONS: The maternal voice alarms significantly outperformed the tone alarm under residential conditions. Personalizing the alarm message with the child's first name did not increase alarm effectiveness. These findings have important implications for development of an effective and practical smoke alarm for children. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01169155. ",
        "Associations between sleep disturbances, mental health outcomes and burnout in firefighters, and the mediating role of sleep during overnight work: A cross-sectional study. This study investigated whether sleep disorder risk and mental health outcomes in firefighters were associated with burnout, particularly emotional exhaustion, and examined the mediating role of sleep at work in these relationships. A secondary aim was to investigate associations between habitual sleep characteristics and burnout. North American firefighters (n\u2009=\u20096,307) completed the Maslach Burnout Inventory (emotional exhaustion, depersonalisation, personal accomplishment), and were screened for sleep disorders and self-reported current mental health conditions and sleep characteristics. Multiple logistic regression analyses examined associations between sleep, mental health outcomes and burnout. Firefighters screening positive for a sleep disorder, particularly insomnia, had increased risk of emotional exhaustion (adjusted odds ratio 3.78, 95% confidence interval 2.97-4.79). Firefighters self-reporting a current mental health condition were at greater risk of emotional exhaustion (adjusted odds ratio 3.45, 95% confidence interval 2.79-4.27). Sleep during overnight work mediated the impact of having a sleep disorder and mental health condition on high burnout. Sleepiness and sleep deficit (difference between required and actual sleep), even in firefighters without sleep disorder risk, were associated with depersonalisation (adjusted odds ratio 1.65, 95% confidence interval 1.34-2.03 and adjusted odds ratio 1.29, 95% confidence interval 1.06-1.57, respectively) and low personal accomplishment (adjusted odds ratio 1.25, 95% confidence interval 1.07-1.47 and adjusted odds ratio 1.17, 95% confidence interval 1.01-1.35, respectively). Sleep and mental health problems were associated with increased risk of burnout in firefighters, and sleep during overnight work mediated these relationships. The results suggest the need to examine the effectiveness of occupational interventions that improve the opportunity for sleep, together with screening for and treating sleep disorders, to reduce burnout risk.

METHODS: We identified patients of New Jersey primary care locations of the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia who were born in 1987-1997, were New Jersey residents, had their last primary care visit at age \u226512 years, and acquired a driver's license (N = 14\u2009936). Electronic health records were linked to New Jersey's licensing, crash, and violation databases. ADHD diagnosis was based on International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification diagnostic codes. We calculated monthly per-driver rates of crashes (at fault, alcohol related, nighttime, and with peers), violations, and suspensions. Adjusted rate ratios were estimated by using repeated-measures Poisson regression. RESULTS: Crash rates were higher for drivers with ADHD regardless of licensing age and, in particular, during the first month of licensure (adjusted rate ratio: 1.62 [95% confidence interval: 1.18-2.23]). They also experienced higher rates of specific crash types: their 4-year rate of alcohol-related crashes was 2.1 times that of drivers without ADHD. Finally, drivers with ADHD had higher rates of moving violations (for speeding, seat belt nonuse, and electronic equipment use) and suspensions. In the first year of driving, the rate of alcohol and/or drug violations was 3.6 times higher for adolescents with ADHD. CONCLUSIONS: Adolescents with ADHD are at particularly high crash risk in their initial months of licensure, and engagement in preventable risky driving behaviors may contribute to this elevated risk. Comprehensive preventive approaches that extend beyond current recommendations are critically needed. ",
        "Effectiveness of a Hand Hygiene Program at Child Care Centers: A Cluster Randomized Trial. OBJECTIVES: Respiratory infections (RIs) are an important cause of morbidity and excessive antibiotic prescriptions in children attending day care centers (DCCs). We aimed to assess the effectiveness of an educational and hand hygiene program in DCCs and homes in reducing RI incidence and antibiotic prescriptions in children. METHODS: A cluster, randomized, controlled, and open study of 911 children aged 0 to 3 years attending 24 DCCs in Almer\u00eda (Spain) with an 8-month follow-up. Two intervention groups of DCC families performed educational and hand hygiene measures, 1 with soap and water (SWG; n = 274), another with hand sanitizer (HSG; n = 339), and the control group (CG; n = 298) followed usual hand-washing procedures. RI episode rates were compared through multilevel Poisson regression models. The percentage of days missed were compared with Poisson exact tests. RESULTS: There were 5211 RI episodes registered. Children in the HSG had less risk of RI episodes (incidence rate ratio [IRR]: 0.77; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.68-0.88) and antibiotic prescriptions (IRR: 0.69; 95% CI: 0.57-0.84) compared with the those in the CG. Children in the SWG had a higher risk of RI episodes (IRR: 1.21; 95% CI: 1.06-1.39) and antibiotic prescriptions (IRR: 1.31; 95% CI: 1.08-1.56) than those in the HSG. Pupils missed 5186 DCC days because of RIs, and the percentage of days absent was significantly lower in the HSG compared with the CG (P < .001) and the SWG (P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Hand hygiene programs that include hand sanitizer and educational measures for DCC staff, children, and parents, reduce absent days, RIs, and antibiotic prescriptions for these infections in children at DCCs.

        "Expressions of Gratitude and Medical Team Performance. BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Exposure to negative social interactions (such as rudeness) has robust adverse implications on medical team performance. However, little is known regarding the effects of positive social interactions. We hypothesized that expressions of gratitude, a prototype of positive social interaction, would enhance medical teams' effectiveness. Our objective was to study the performance of NICU teams after exposure to expressions of gratitude from alternative sources. METHODS: Forty-three NICU teams (comprising 2 physicians and 2 nurses) participated in training workshops of acute care simulations. Teams were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 conditions: (1) maternal gratitude (in which the mother of a preterm infant expressed gratitude to NICU teams, such as the one that treated her child), (2) expert gratitude (in which a physician expert expressed gratitude to teams for participating in the training), (3) combined maternal and expert gratitude, or (4) control (same agents communicated neutral statements). The simulations were evaluated (5-point Likert scale: 1 = failed and 5 = excellent) by independent judges (blind to team exposure) using structured questionnaires. RESULTS: Maternal gratitude positively affected teams' performances (3.9 \u00b1 0.9 vs 3.6 \u00b1 1.0; P = .04), with most of this effect explained by the positive impact of gratitude on team information sharing (4.3 \u00b1 0.8 vs 4.0 \u00b1 0.8; P = .03). Forty percent of the variance in team information sharing was explained by maternal gratitude. Information sharing predicted team performance outcomes, explaining 33% of the variance in diagnostic performance and 41% of the variance in therapeutic performance. CONCLUSIONS: Patient-expressed gratitude significantly enhances medical team performance, with much of this effect explained by enhanced information sharing. ",
        "Pediatric Emergency Department Visits for Homelessness After Shelter Eligibility Policy Change. BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: In 2012, Massachusetts changed its emergency shelter eligibility policy for homeless families. One new criterion to document homelessness was staying in a location \"not meant for human habitation,\" and the emergency department (ED) fulfilled this requirement. Our aim for this study is to analyze the frequency and costs of pediatric ED visits for homelessness before and after this policy. METHODS: This is a retrospective study of ED visits for homelessness at a children's hospital from March 2010 to February 2016. A natural language processing tool was used to identify cases, which were manually reviewed for inclusion. We compared demographic and homelessness circumstance characteristics and conducted an interrupted time series analysis to compare ED visits by homeless children before and after the policy. We compared the change in ED visits for homelessness to the number of homeless children in Massachusetts. We analyzed payment data for each visit. RESULTS: There were 312 ED visits for homelessness; 95% (n = 297) of visits were after the policy. These visits increased 4.5 times after the policy (95% confidence interval: 1.33 to 15.23). Children seen after the policy were more likely to have no medical complaint (rate ratio: 3.27; 95% confidence interval: 1.18 to 9.01). Although the number of homeless children in Massachusetts increased 1.4 times over the study period, ED visits for homelessness increased 13-fold. Payments (average: $557 per visit) were >4 times what a night in a shelter would cost; 89% of payments were made through state-based insurance plans. CONCLUSIONS: A policy change to Massachusetts' shelter eligibility was associated with increased pediatric ED visits for homelessness along with substantial health care costs. ",
        "Infant Deaths in Sitting Devices. BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Annually, several hundred infant deaths occur in sitting devices (eg, car safety seats [CSSs] and strollers). Although American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines discourage routine sleeping in sitting devices, little is known about factors associated with deaths in sitting devices. Our objective was to describe factors associated with sleep-related infant deaths in sitting devices. METHODS: We analyzed 2004-2014 National Center for Fatality Review and Prevention data. The main outcome was sleep location (sitting device versus not). Setting, primary caregiver, supervisor at time of death, bed-sharing, and objects in the environment were compared by using \u03c72 tests and multivariable logistic regression. Descriptive statistics of additional possible risk factors were reviewed. RESULTS: Of 11\u2009779 infant sleep-related deaths, 348 (3.0%) occurred in sitting devices. Of deaths in sitting devices, 62.9% were in CSSs, and in these cases, the CSS was used as directed in <10%. Among all sitting-device deaths, 81.9% had \u22651 risk factor, and 54.9% had \u22652 risk factors. More than half (51.6%) of deaths in CSSs were at the child's home. Compared with other deaths, deaths in sitting devices had higher odds of occurring under the supervision of a child care provider (adjusted odds ratio 2.8; 95% confidence interval 1.5-5.2) or baby-sitter (adjusted odds ratio 2.0; 95% confidence interval 1.3-3.2) compared with a parent. CONCLUSIONS: There are higher odds of sleep-related infant death in sitting devices when a child care provider or baby-sitter is the primary supervisor. Using CSSs for sleep in nontraveling contexts may pose a risk to the infant. ",
        "Sleep-Related Infant Suffocation Deaths Attributable to Soft Bedding, Overlay, and Wedging. BACKGROUND: Unintentional suffocation is the leading cause of injury death among infants <1 year old in the United States, with 82% being attributable to accidental suffocation and strangulation in bed. Understanding the circumstances surrounding these deaths may inform prevention strategies. METHODS: We analyzed data from the population-based Sudden Unexpected Infant Death Case Registry from 2011 to 2014. Cases categorized as explained suffocation with unsafe sleep factors (suffocation), per the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Sudden Unexpected Infant Death Case Registry classification system, were included and assigned a mechanism of obstruction, including soft bedding, overlay, or wedging. We calculated frequencies and percentages of suffocation deaths by mechanism and selected demographic and sleep-environment characteristics. RESULTS: Fourteen percent of sudden unexpected infant death cases were classified as suffocation; these cases were most frequently attributed to soft bedding (69%), followed by overlay (19%) and wedging (12%). Median age at death in months varied by mechanism: 3 for soft bedding, 2 for overlay, and 6 for wedging. Soft-bedding deaths occurred most often in an adult bed (49%), in a prone position (82%), and with a blanket (or blankets) obstructing the airway (34%). Overlay deaths occurred most often in an adult bed (71%), and infants were overlaid by the mother (47%). Wedging deaths occurred most often when the infant became entrapped between a mattress and a wall (48%). CONCLUSIONS: Safe sleep environments can reduce infant suffocation deaths. Increased knowledge about the characteristics of suffocation deaths can help inform prevention strategies by targeting highest-risk groups. ",
        "Prevalence and Factors Associated With Safe Infant Sleep Practices. OBJECTIVES: To examine prevalence of safe infant sleep practices and variation by sociodemographic, behavioral, and health care characteristics, including provider advice. METHODS: Using 2016 Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System data from 29 states, we examined maternal report of 4 safe sleep practices indicating how their infant usually slept: (1) back sleep position, (2) separate approved sleep surface, (3) room-sharing without bed-sharing, and (4) no soft objects or loose bedding as well as receipt of health care provider advice corresponding to each sleep practice. RESULTS: Most mothers reported usually placing their infants to sleep on their backs (78.0%), followed by room-sharing without bed-sharing (57.1%). Fewer reported avoiding soft bedding (42.4%) and using a separate approved sleep surface (31.8%). Reported receipt of provider advice ranged from 48.8% (room-sharing without bed-sharing) to 92.6% (back sleep position). Differences by sociodemographic, behavioral, and health care characteristics were larger for safe sleep practices (\u223c10-20 percentage points) than receipt of advice (\u223c5-10 percentage points). Receipt of provider advice was associated with increased use of safe sleep practices, ranging from 12% for room-sharing without bed-sharing (adjusted prevalence ratio: 1.12; 95% confidence interval: 1.09-1.16) to 28% for back sleep position (adjusted prevalence ratio: 1.28; 95% confidence interval: 1.21-1.35). State-level differences in safe sleep practices spanned 20 to 25 percentage points and did not change substantially after adjustment for available characteristics. CONCLUSIONS: Safe infant sleep practices, especially those other than back sleep position, are suboptimal, with demographic and state-level differences indicating improvement opportunities. Receipt of provider advice is an important modifiable factor to improve infant sleep practices. ",
        "Adverse Childhood Experiences and Protective Factors With School Engagement. OBJECTIVES: To determine the associations of adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) and protective familial and community factors with school performance and attitudes in children ages 6 to 17. METHODS: A cross-sectional analysis of the 2011-2012 National Survey of Children's Health was performed. All data were demographically weighted and included 65\u2009680 children ages 6 to 17. The survey identified up to 9 ACEs in each child. ACE scores were categorized as 0, 1, 2, 3, and \u22654 ACEs. Children's protective factors (PFs) included the following: safe neighborhood, supportive neighbors, 4 neighborhood amenities, well-kept neighborhood, no household smoking, \u22655 family meals per week, and a parent who can talk to the child. PFs were categorized into \u22643, 4, 5, 6, and 7 PFs. School outcomes included the following: child repeated \u22651 grade; never, rarely, or sometimes completes homework; and never, rarely, or sometimes cares about school. \u03c72 tests and logistic regressions assessed the relationships between ACEs and school outcomes, PFs and school outcomes, and both ACEs and PFs and school outcomes, adjusting for sex, age, race, ethnicity, and maternal education. RESULTS: Each negative school outcome is associated with higher ACE scores and lower PF scores. After adding PFs into the same model as ACEs, the negative outcomes are reduced. The strongest PF is a parent who can talk to the child about things that matter and share ideas. CONCLUSIONS: As children's ACE scores increase, their school performance and attitudes decline. Conversely, as children's PF scores increase, school outcomes improve. Pediatric providers should consider screening for both ACEs and PFs to identify risks and strengths to guide treatment, referral, and advocacy. ",
        "Apps As Learning Tools: A Systematic Review. CONTEXT: Young children have increasing access to interactive applications (apps) at home and at school. Existing research is clear on the potential dangers of overuse of screens, but there is less clarity around the extent to which interactive apps may be helpful in supporting early learning. OBJECTIVE: In this systematic review, we present a narrative synthesis of studies examining whether children <6 years can learn from interactive apps. DATA SOURCES: The PsycInfo, PubMed, ACM Digital Library, and ERIC databases were searched. STUDY SELECTION: Studies were included if the study design was randomized or nonrandomized controlled (quasi-experimental), the sample mean age was <6 years, the intervention involved children playing with an interactive app, and academic, cognitive, or social-emotional skill outcomes were measured. DATA EXTRACTION: Of 1447 studies, 35 were included. RESULTS: Evidence of a learning benefit of interactive app use for early academic skills was found across multiple studies, particularly for early mathematics learning in typically developing children. Researchers did not find evidence of an intervention effect for apps aiming to improve social communication skills in children with autism spectrum disorder. LIMITATIONS: Risk of bias was unclear for many studies because of inadequate reporting. Studies were highly heterogenous in interventions, outcomes, and study design, making comparisons of results across studies difficult. CONCLUSIONS: There is emerging evidence to suggest that interactive apps may be useful and accessible tools for supporting early academic development. More research is needed to evaluate both the potential of educational apps to support early learning, and their limitations. ",
        "Depression, Anxiety, and Emergency Department Use for Asthma. BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Asthma is responsible for \u223c1.7 million emergency department (ED) visits annually in the United States. Studies in adults have shown that anxiety and depression are associated with increased asthma-related ED use. Our objective was to assess this association in pediatric patients with asthma. METHODS: We identified patients aged 6 to 21 years with asthma in the Massachusetts All-Payer Claims Database for 2014 to 2015 using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth and 10th Revision codes. We examined the association between the presence of anxiety, depression, or comorbid anxiety and depression and the rate of asthma-related ED visits per 100 child-years using bivariate and multivariable analyses with negative binomial regression. RESULTS: Of 65\u2009342 patients with asthma, 24.7% had a diagnosis of anxiety, depression, or both (11.2% anxiety only, 5.8% depression only, and 7.7% both). The overall rate of asthma-related ED use was 17.1 ED visits per 100 child-years (95% confidence interval [CI]: 16.7-17.5). Controlling for age, sex, insurance type, and other chronic illness, patients with anxiety had a rate of 18.9 (95% CI: 17.0-20.8) ED visits per 100 child-years, patients with depression had a rate of 21.7 (95% CI: 18.3-25.0), and patients with both depression and anxiety had a rate of 27.6 (95% CI: 24.8-30.3). These rates were higher than those of patients who had no diagnosis of anxiety or depression (15.5 visits per 100 child-years; 95% CI: 14.5-16.4; P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Children with asthma and anxiety or depression alone, or comorbid anxiety and depression, have higher rates of asthma-related ED use compared with those without either diagnosis. ",
        "Genetic and Early-Life Environmental Influences on Dental Caries Risk: A Twin Study. OBJECTIVES: To explore the relative contributions of genetic and environmental influences on dental caries risk and to investigate fetal and developmental risk factors for dental caries. METHODS: We recruited children from 250 twin pregnancies midgestation and collected demographic, health, and phenotypic data at recruitment, 24 and 36 weeks' gestational age, birth and 18 months, and 6 years of age. 25-hydroxyvitamin D was quantified in mothers at 28 weeks' gestation and in infants at birth. Dental caries and enamel defects were measured at six years of age. We compared concordance for the presence of any caries and advanced caries in monozygotic and dizygotic twin pairs. To investigate environmental risk factors for caries, we fitted multiple logistic regression models using generalized estimating equations to adjust for twin correlation. RESULTS: A total of 345 twins underwent dental assessment, with 111 (32.2%) showing signs of any caries and 83 (24.1%) having advanced caries. There was no evidence of higher concordance in monozygotic twins compared with dizygotic twins, with a difference of 0.05 (95% confidence interval -0.14 to 0.25; P = .30) and 0.00 (95% confidence interval -0.26 to 0.26; P = .50) for any caries and advanced caries, respectively, suggesting that environmental factors, rather than genetics, are the predominant determinant of caries risk. After adjusting for potential confounders, lack of community water fluoridation, hypomineralized second primary molars, dichorionic placenta, and maternal obesity were associated with caries. CONCLUSIONS: Environmental rather than genetic factors drive dental caries risk and arise as early as prenatal life. ",
        "Dietary Interventions for Autism Spectrum Disorder: A Meta-analysis. CONTEXT: Dietary interventions such as restrictive diets or supplements are common treatments for young people with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Evidence for the efficacy of these interventions is still controversial. OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy of specific dietary interventions on symptoms, functions, and clinical domains in subjects with ASD by using a meta-analytic approach. DATA SOURCES: Ovid Medline, PsycINFO, Embase databases. STUDY SELECTION: We selected placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized clinical trials assessing the efficacy of dietary interventions in ASD published from database inception through September 2017. DATA EXTRACTION: Outcome variables were subsumed under 4 clinical domains and 17 symptoms and/or functions groups. Hedges' adjusted g values were used as estimates of the effect size of each dietary intervention relative to placebo. RESULTS: In this meta-analysis, we examined 27 double-blind, randomized clinical trials, including 1028 patients with ASD: 542 in the intervention arms and 486 in the placebo arms. Participant-weighted average age was 7.1 years. Participant-weighted average intervention duration was 10.6 weeks. Dietary supplementation (including omega-3, vitamin supplementation, and/or other supplementation), omega-3 supplementation, and vitamin supplementation were more efficacious than the placebo at improving several symptoms, functions, and clinical domains. Effect sizes were small (mean Hedges' g for significant analyses was 0.31), with low statistical heterogeneity and low risk of publication bias. LIMITATIONS: Methodologic heterogeneity among the studies in terms of the intervention, clinical measures and outcomes, and sample characteristics. CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis does not support nonspecific dietary interventions as treatment of ASD but suggests a potential role for some specific dietary interventions in the management of some symptoms, functions, and clinical domains in patients with ASD.

        "Adolescent Mental Health and the Choking Game. OBJECTIVES: To examine the demographic and health risk factors associated with participation in the choking game (CG), a dangerous and potentially fatal strangulation activity in which pressure is applied to the carotid artery to temporarily limit blood flow and oxygen. METHODS: We obtained data from 2 cross-sectional studies realized respectively in 2009 and 2013 among French middle school students. The 2009 (n = 746) and 2013 (n = 1025) data sets were merged (N = 1771), and multivariate modeling was conducted to examine demographic and clinical characteristics of youth reporting a lifetime participation in the CG. The 2 studies included questions about risk-taking behaviors and substance use, and standardized assessments were used to collect conduct disorder symptoms and depressive symptoms. RESULTS: In the merged 2009 and 2013 data set, the lifetime prevalence of CG participation was 9.7%, with no statistically significant differences between boys and girls. A multivariate logistic regression revealed that higher levels of conduct disorder symptoms (odds ratio: 2.33; P < .001) and greater rates of depressive symptoms (odds ratio: 2.18; P < .001) were both significantly associated with an increased likelihood of reporting CG participation. CONCLUSIONS: The significant relationship between elevated levels of depressive symptoms and participation in the CG sheds new light on the function of self-asphyxial activities. However, with the finding that higher rates of conduct disorder symptoms were the most important predictor of CG participation, it is suggested that the profile and the underlying motivations of youth who engage in this activity should be reexamined.

        "E-cigarette Use and Subsequent Smoking Frequency Among Adolescents. BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Electronic cigarette (e-cigarette) use is associated with cigarette initiation among adolescents. However, it is unclear whether e-cigarette use is associated with more frequent cigarette use after initiation. Also, the extent to which cigarette or dual cigarette and e-cigarette users transition to exclusive e-cigarette use or to the nonuse of either product is not yet known. Data were pooled from 3 prospective cohort studies in California and Connecticut (baseline: 2013-2014; follow-up: 2014-2016; N = 6258). Polytomous regression models were used to evaluate the association of baseline e-cigarette use (never or ever) with cigarette use frequency at follow-up (experimental: initiation but no past-30-day use; infrequent: 1-2 of the past 30 days; frequent: 3-5 or more of the past 30 days). Polytomous regression models were also used to evaluate transitions between baseline ever or past-30-day single or dual product use and past-30-day single or dual product use at follow-up. Among baseline never smokers, e-cigarette users had greater odds of subsequent experimental (odds ratio [OR] = 4.58; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.56-5.88), infrequent (OR = 4.27; 95% CI: 2.75-6.62) or frequent (OR = 3.51; 95% CI: 1.97-6.24) cigarette use; the 3 OR estimates were not significantly different. Baseline past-30-day exclusive cigarette use was associated with higher odds at follow-up of exclusive cigarette or dual product use than of exclusive e-cigarette use. Tobacco control policy to reduce adolescent use of both e-cigarettes and cigarettes is needed to prevent progression to more frequent tobacco use patterns and reduce combustible cigarette use (with or without concurrent e-cigarette use) to lessen the adverse public health impact of e-cigarettes.

        "Trends in Capability of Hospitals to Provide Definitive Acute Care for Children: 2008 to 2016. BACKGROUND: Provision of high-quality care to acutely ill and injured children is a challenge to US hospitals because many have low pediatric volume. Delineating national trends in definitive pediatric acute care would inform improvements in care. METHODS: We analyzed emergency department (ED) visits by children between 2008 and 2016 in the Nationwide Emergency Department Sample, a weighted sample of 20% of EDs nationally. For each hospital annually, we determined the Hospital Capability Index (HCI) to determine the frequency of definitive acute care, defined as hospitalization instead of ED transfer. Hospitals were classified annually according to 2008 HCI quartiles to understand shifts in pediatric capability. RESULTS: The national median HCI was 0.06 (interquartile range: 0.01-0.17) in 2008 and 0.02 (interquartile range: 0.00-0.09) in 2016 (P < .001). Definitive care became less common regardless of annual pediatric volume, urban or rural designation, or condition frequency. In 2016, 2171 EDs (49.0%) had HCIs <0.013, which represented the lowest 25% of ED HCIs in 2008. Pediatric visits to EDs categorized in the bottom 2008 capability quartile more than doubled from 2.5 million in 2008 to 5.3 million in 2016. Despite decreasing capability, centers with higher annual pediatric volume and urban centers provided more definitive inpatient care and had fewer inter-ED transfers than lower-volume and rural centers. CONCLUSIONS: Across the United States from 2008 to 2016, hospital provision of definitive acute pediatric care decreased, and ED visits to the hospitals least likely to provide definitive care increased. Systems improvements are needed to support hospital-based acute care of children. ",
        "State Gun Laws and Pediatric Firearm-Related Mortality. BACKGROUND: Firearms are the second leading cause of pediatric death in the United States. There is significant variation in firearm legislation at the state level. Recently, 3 state laws were associated with a reduction in overall deaths from firearms: universal background checks for firearm purchases, universal background checks for ammunition purchases, and identification requirement for firearms. We sought to determine if stricter firearm legislation at the state level is associated with lower pediatric firearm-related mortality. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study in which we used 2011-2015 Web-based Injury Statistics Query and Reporting System and Census data. We measured the association of the (1) strictness of firearm legislation (gun law score) and (2) presence of the 3 aforementioned gun laws with pediatric firearm-related mortality. We performed negative binomial regression accounting for differences in state-level characteristics (population-based race and ethnicity, education, income, and gun ownership) to derive mortality rate ratios associated with a 10-point change in each predictor and predicted mortality rates. RESULTS: A total of 21\u2009241 children died of firearm-related injuries during the 5-year period. States with stricter gun laws had lower rates of firearm-related pediatric mortality (adjusted incident rate ratio 0.96 [0.93-0.99]). States with laws requiring universal background checks for firearm purchase in effect for \u22655 years had lower pediatric firearm-related mortality rates (adjusted incident rate ratio 0.65 [0.46-0.90]). CONCLUSIONS: In this 5-year analysis, states with stricter gun laws and laws requiring universal background checks for firearm purchase had lower firearm-related pediatric mortality rates. These findings support the need for further investigation to understand the impact of firearm legislation on pediatric mortality. ",
        "Childhood Obesity and Slipped Capital Femoral Epiphysis. BACKGROUND: Slipped capital femoral epiphysis (SCFE) is believed to be associated with childhood obesity, although the strength of the association is unknown. We performed a cohort study using routine data from health screening examinations at primary school entry (5-6 years old) in Scotland, linked to a nationwide hospital admissions database. A subgroup had a further screening examination at primary school exit (11-12 years old). BMI was available for 597\u2009017 children at 5 to 6 years old in school and 39\u2009468 at 11 to 12 years old. There were 4.26 million child-years at risk for SCFE. Among children with obesity at 5 to 6 years old, 75% remained obese at 11 to 12 years old. There was a strong biological gradient between childhood BMI at 5 to 6 years old and SCFE, with the risk of disease increasing by a factor of 1.7 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.5-1.9) for each integer increase in BMI z score. The risk of SCFE was almost negligible among children with the lowest BMI. Those with severe obesity at 5 to 6 years old had 5.9 times greater risk of SCFE (95% CI 3.9-9.0) compared with those with a normal BMI; those with severe obesity at 11 to 12 years had 17.0 times the risk of SCFE (95% CI 5.9-49.0). High childhood BMI is strongly associated with SCFE. The magnitude of the association, temporal relationship, and dose response added to the plausible mechanism offer the strongest evidence available to support a causal association. ",
        "Parents' Perspectives Regarding Age Restrictions for Tackling in Youth Football. BACKGROUND: In ice hockey and soccer, age restrictions exist for body checking and heading because of injury risk. There are currently no age restrictions for tackling in youth football. METHODS: We surveyed a nationally representative sample of US parents regarding their support for age restrictions on tackling in football with responses of \"yes,\" \"no,\" and \"maybe.\" We then generated regression models, attempting to predict support for age restrictions in tackling using demographic variables, parent perceptions of the risk of concussion in youth football, and the intensity of football support. All analyses were stratified by sex given effect modification. RESULTS: There were 1025 parents who completed the survey (52% response rate; 56% female sex). The majority (61%) supported age restrictions for tackling, and an additional 24% indicated they maybe would support age restrictions. For female respondents, a greater perceived risk of tackle football (odds ratio [OR] 3.83; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.06-13.83) and greater educational attainment (OR 3.97; 95% CI 1.61-9.80) were associated with greater odds of supporting age restrictions for tackling. For male respondents, having a child 6 to 12 years old was associated with greater odds of maybe supporting age restrictions for tackling (OR 2.34; 95% CI 1.19-4.62). CONCLUSIONS: A majority of US parents across sexes would support age restrictions for tackling in football. This information should inform discussions when guidelines about tackling in youth football are revisited. ",
        "Injury Incidence in Youth, High School, and NCAA Men's Lacrosse. BACKGROUND: We compared injury incidence and mechanisms among youth, high school (HS), and National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) boys' and men's lacrosse athletes for the 2014-2015 to 2016-2017 lacrosse seasons. METHODS: Multiple injury surveillance systems were used to capture 21 youth boys', 22 HS boys', and 20 NCAA men's lacrosse team-seasons of data during the 2014-2015 to 2016-2017 seasons. Athletic trainers reported game and practice injuries and athlete exposures (AEs). Injuries included those occurring during a game and/or practice and requiring evaluation from an athletic trainer and/or physician. Injury counts, rates per 1000 AEs, and injury rate ratios (IRRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. RESULTS: The injury rate in youth was higher than those reported in HS (10.3 vs 5.3 per 1000 AEs; IRR = 2.0; 95% CI: 1.6-2.4) and the NCAA (10.3 vs 4.7 per 1000 AEs; IRR = 2.2; 95% CI: 1.9-2.5). When considering time loss injuries only (restricted participation of \u226524 hours), the injury rate in youth was lower than those reported in HS (2.0 vs 2.9 per 1000 AEs; IRR = 0.7; 95% CI: 0.5-0.95) and the NCAA (2.0 vs 3.3 per 1000 AEs; IRR = 0.6; 95% CI: 0.4-0.8). The concussion rate in youth was higher than those in HS (0.7 vs 0.3 per 1000 AEs; IRR = 2.4, 95% CI: 1.1-5.2) and the NCAA (0.7 vs 0.3 per 1000 AEs; IRR = 2.1, 95% CI: 1.2-3.7). Injuries at the youth, HS, and NCAA levels were most commonly associated with stick contact, inflammatory conditions (including bursitis, tendonitis, and other unspecified inflammation), and noncontact mechanisms, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Although the time loss injury rate was lowest in youth boys' lacrosse, the concussion rate was the highest. Injury prevention approaches should be specific to the mechanisms associated with each level of play (eg, equipment skill development in youth). ",
        "Barriers and Stigma Experienced by Gay Fathers and Their Children. BACKGROUND: Gay men have become fathers in the context of a heterosexual relationship, by adoption, by donating sperm to 1 or 2 lesbian women and subsequently sharing parenting responsibilities, and/or by engaging the services of a surrogate pregnancy carrier. Despite legal, medical, and social advances, gay fathers and their children continue to experience stigma and avoid situations because of fear of stigma. Increasing evidence reveals that stigma is associated with reduced well-being of children and adults, including psychiatric symptoms and suicidality. METHODS: Men throughout the United States who identified as gay and fathers completed an online survey. Dissemination of the survey was enhanced via a \"snowball\" method, yielding 732 complete responses from 47 states. The survey asked how the respondent had become a father, whether he had encountered barriers, and whether he and his child(ren) had experienced stigma in various social contexts. RESULTS: Gay men are increasingly becoming fathers via adoption and with assistance of an unrelated pregnancy carrier. Their pathways to fatherhood vary with socioeconomic class and the extent of legal protections in their state. Respondents reported barriers to becoming a father and stigma associated with fatherhood in multiple social contexts, most often in religious institutions. Fewer barriers and less stigma were experienced by fathers living in states with more legal protections. CONCLUSIONS: Despite growing acceptance of parenting by same-gender adults, barriers and stigma persist. States' legal and social protections for lesbian and gay individuals and families appear to be effective in reducing experiences of stigma for gay fathers. ",
        "Epigenetic Programming by Maternal Behavior in the Human Infant. OBJECTIVES: We sought to determine if variations in maternal care alter DNA methylation in term, healthy, 5-month-old infants. This work was based on landmark studies in animal models demonstrating that nurturing care by dams would alter their newborns' stress responses through epigenetic mechanisms. We used breastfeeding as a proxy for animal maternal behavior. We hypothesized alterations in DNA methylation of the glucocorticoid receptor gene and less hypothalamic stress response in infants of mothers who breastfed their infants versus infants of mothers who did not breastfeed. A cohort study of term, healthy infants and their mothers who did (n = 21) or did not (n = 21) breastfeed for the first 5 months was used in this analysis. Cortisol stress reactivity was measured in infant saliva by using a mother-infant interaction procedure and DNA methylation of an important regulatory region of the glucocorticoid receptor gene. Changes in DNA methylation of this gene in humans were compared to homologous regions of the rat gene. DNA samples were prepared from cheek swabs and subjected to quantitative analysis of the extent of methylation by using sensitive sequencing techniques. Breastfeeding was associated with decreased DNA methylation of the glucocorticoid receptor promoter and decreased cortisol reactivity in 5-month-old infants. Decreased DNA methylation occurred in the promoter region involved in regulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal and immune system responses. Maternal care in humans may impact the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal stress response through behavioral programming and manifest as offspring epigenetic change. These results explain, in part, some of the positive effects observed in children who are breastfed. ",
        "In-hospital Neonatal Falls: An Unintended Consequence of Efforts to Improve Breastfeeding. In-hospital neonatal falls are increasingly recognized as a postpartum safety risk, with maternal fatigue contributing to these events. Recommendations to support rooming-in may increase success with breastfeeding; however, this practice may also be associated with maternal fatigue. We report a cluster of in-hospital neonatal falls associated with a hospital program to improve breastfeeding, which included rooming-in practices. Metrics related to breastfeeding were prospectively collected by chart audit or patient survey while ongoing efforts to improve breastfeeding occurred (September 2015-August 2017). Falls were identified through the hospital adverse event reporting system from January 2011 to February 2018. Medical records were reviewed to determine factors associated with the falls, including time of event, pain medication administration, hours of life at fall, method of delivery, or other notable factors that may have contributed to the fall event. Three fall events occurred within 1 year of commencing improvement efforts as process and outcome metrics associated with breastfeeding improved. All events were associated with mothers falling asleep while feeding their infant, and all occurred between midnight and 6 am Falls occurred from 38.0 to 75.7 hours after birth. No sedating pain medications were administered within 4 hours of any event. In 2 of 3 cases, mothers experienced notable ongoing social stressors. Rooming-in was the most significant change involved in our health care delivery during the programmatic effort to improve breastfeeding. Monitoring for in-hospital neonatal falls may be needed during projects aimed at improving breastfeeding, particularly if rooming-in practices are involved. ",
        "Adolescent and Young Adult Cancer Patients' Experiences With Treatment Decision-making. BACKGROUND: Adolescents and young adults (AYAs) with cancer generally want to engage in decision-making but are not always able to do so. We evaluated cancer treatment decision-making among AYAs, including decisional engagement and regret. METHODS: We surveyed 203 AYA patients with cancer aged 15 to 29 (response rate 74%) treated at a large academic center and their oncologists. Patients were approached within 6 weeks of diagnosis and asked to report decision-making preferences and experiences (Decisional Roles Scale) and the extent to which they regretted their initial treatment decision (Decisional Regret Scale) assessed at baseline and 4 and 12 months later. RESULTS: A majority of AYAs (58%) wanted to share responsibility for decision-making with oncologists; half (51%) preferred limited involvement from parents. Although most AYAs held roles they preferred, those who did not reported holding more passive roles relative to oncologists (P < .0001) and parents (P = .002) than they desired. Nearly one-quarter of patients (24%; 47 of 195) experienced regret about initial cancer treatment decisions at baseline, with similar rates at 4 (23%) and 12 (19%) months. In a multivariable model adjusted for age, decisional roles were not associated with regret; instead, regret was less likely among patients who trusted oncologists completely (odds ratio 0.17 [95% confidence interval 0.06-0.46]; P < .001) and who reported that oncologists understood what was important to them when treatment started (odds ratio 0.13 [95% confidence interval 0.04-0.42]; P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Nearly one-fourth of AYA patients expressed regret about initial treatment decisions. Although some AYAs have unmet needs for decisional engagement, attributes of the patient-oncologist relationship, including trust and mutual understanding, may be most protective against regret. ",
        "Ethical Issues in Newborn Sequencing Research: The Case Study of BabySeq. The BabySeq Project is a study funded by the National Institutes of Health and aimed at exploring the medical, behavioral, and economic impacts of integrating genomic sequencing into the care of both healthy newborns and newborns who are sick. Infants were randomly assigned to receive standard of care or standard of care plus sequencing. The protocol and consent specified that only childhood-onset conditions would be returned. When 1 child was found to carry a BRCA2 mutation despite a negative family history, the research team experienced moral distress about nondisclosure and sought institutional review board permission to disclose. The protocol was then modified to require participants to agree to receive results for adult-onset-only conditions as a precondition to study enrollment. The BabySeq team asserted that their new protocol was in the child's best interest because having one's parents alive and well provides both an individual child benefit and a \"family benefit.\" We begin with a short description of BabySeq and the controversy regarding predictive genetic testing of children for adult-onset conditions. We then examine the ethical problems with (1) the revised BabySeq protocol and (2) the concept of family benefit as a justification for the return of adult-onset-only conditions. We reject family benefit as a moral reason to expand genomic sequencing of children beyond conditions that present in childhood. We also argue that researchers should design their pediatric studies to avoid, when possible, identifying adult-onset-only genetic variants and that parents should not be offered the return of this information if discovered unless relevant for the child's current or imminent health.

        "Parental Disengagement in Childhood and Adolescent Male Gun Carrying. OBJECTIVES: To examine the association between parental disengagement in childhood and adolescent gun carrying and determine whether this association is accounted for by externalizing problems and affiliation with delinquent peers during early adolescence. METHODS: The sample included 503 boys (55.7% African American, 40.6% white, 3.7% other) recruited from first-grade classrooms in Pittsburgh public schools. Multi-informant assessments were conducted regularly (semiannually then annually) from approximately ages 7.5 to 20 years. Latent factors were constructed by using parent-reported parental disengagement (ie, poor parental involvement, poor parent-son communication, poor parent-son relationship quality) collected from ages 7.5 to 10 years, youth-reported peer delinquency from ages 10.5 to 13 years, and teacher-reported externalizing problems from ages 10.5 to 13 years. The outcome was youth-reported gun carrying from ages 14 to 20 years. RESULTS: Twenty percent of individuals sampled reported carrying a gun during adolescence. Childhood parental disengagement was significantly associated with adolescent gun carrying (\u03b2 = .22; 95% confidence interval: 0.08 to 0.36). Furthermore, the association between parental disengagement and gun carrying was partially mediated through peer delinquency and externalizing problems during early adolescence. The 2 indirect paths accounted for \u223c29% of the total effect of parental disengagement. CONCLUSIONS: Boys exposed to poorer parental engagement during childhood are more likely to affiliate with delinquent peers and exhibit externalizing problems during early adolescence, which (in turn) increases their risk of carrying a firearm in later adolescence. This suggests that gun violence prevention efforts with children should work to enhance aspects of parental engagement. ",
        "Gender Discrepancies Related to Pediatrician Work-Life Balance and Household Responsibilities. BACKGROUND: Physicians must balance career and home responsibilities, yet previous studies on work-life balance are focused primarily on work-based tasks. We examined gender discrepancies and factors related to household responsibilities and work-life balance among pediatricians. METHODS: We used 2015 data from the American Academy of Pediatrics Pediatrician Life and Career Experience Study, a longitudinal study of early-career pediatricians. \u03c72 tests and multivariable logistic regression were used to examine the effects of gender on household responsibilities, satisfaction, and work-life balance attainment. We formally reviewed responses from 2 open-ended questions on work-life balance challenges and strategies for common themes. RESULTS: Seventy-two percent of participants completed the survey (1293 of 1801). Women were more likely than men to report having primary responsibility for 13 of 16 household responsibilities, such as cleaning, cooking, and routine care of children (all P < .001). All gender differences except budget management remained significant when controlling for part-time work status and spouse or partner work status (P < .05). Women were less satisfied with their share of responsibilities relative to others (52% vs 62%; P < .001), and few women and men report being very successful at achieving balance between their job and other life areas (15% vs 19%, respectively; P = .05). Open-ended responses (n = 1145) revealed many barriers to achieving work-life balance. Strategies to increase work-life balance included reducing work hours, outsourcing household-related work, and adjustments to personal responsibilities and relationships. CONCLUSIONS: Female pediatricians spend more time on household responsibilities than male pediatricians, and gender is a key factor associated with work-life balance satisfaction. Gender Differences in Earnings of Early- and Midcareer Pediatricians. BACKGROUND: The US physician workforce includes an increasing number of women, with pediatrics having the highest percentage. In recent research on physicians, it is indicated that men earn more than women. It is unclear how this finding extends to pediatricians. METHODS: We examined cross-sectional 2016 data on earnings from the American Academy of Pediatrics Pediatrician Life and Career Experience Study, a longitudinal study of early- and midcareer pediatricians. To estimate adjusted differences in pediatrician earnings between men and women, we conducted 4 ordinary least squares regression models. Model 1 examined gender, unadjusted; model 2 controlled for labor force characteristics; model 3 controlled for both labor force and physician-specific job characteristics; and model 4 controlled for labor force, physician-specific job, and work-family characteristics. RESULTS: Sixty-seven percent of Pediatrician Life and Career Experience Study participants completed the 2016 surveys (1213 out of 1801). The analytic sample was restricted to participants who completed training and worked in general pediatrics, hospitalist care, or subspecialty care (n = 998). Overall pediatrician-reported mean annual income was $189\u2009804. Before any adjustment, women earned \u223c76% of what men earned, or \u223c$51\u2009000 less. Adjusting for common labor force characteristics such as demographics, work hours, and specialty, women earned \u223c87% of what men earned, or \u223c$26\u2009000 less. Adjusting for a comprehensive set of labor force, physician-specific job, and work-family characteristics, women earned \u223c94% of what men earned, or \u223c$8000 less. CONCLUSIONS: Early- to midcareer female pediatricians earned less than male pediatricians. This difference persisted after adjustment for important labor force, physician-specific job, and work-family characteristics. In future work, researchers should use longitudinal analyses and further explore family obligations and choices. ",
        "Comprehensive Health Evaluation of the Newly Adopted Child. Children who join families through the process of adoption, whether through a domestic or international route, often have multiple health care needs. Pediatricians and other health care personnel are in a unique position to guide families in achieving optimal health for the adopted children as families establish a medical home. Shortly after placement in an adoptive home, it is recommended that children have a timely comprehensive health evaluation to provide care for known medical needs and identify health issues that are unknown. It is important to begin this evaluation with a review of all available medical records and pertinent verbal history. A complete physical examination then follows. The evaluation should also include diagnostic testing based on findings from the history and physical examination as well as the risks presented by the child's previous living conditions. Age-appropriate screenings may include, but are not limited to, newborn screening panels and hearing, vision, dental, and formal behavioral and/or developmental screenings. The comprehensive assessment may occur at the time of the initial visit to the physician after adoptive placement or can take place over several visits. Adopted children can be referred to other medical specialists as deemed appropriate. The Council on Adoption, Foster Care, and Kinship Care is a resource within the American Academy of Pediatrics for physicians providing care for children who are being adopted. ",
        "Safety Interventions and Liquid Laundry Detergent Packet Exposures. OBJECTIVES: To investigate exposures to liquid laundry detergent packets among children <6 years old in the United States and to evaluate the impact of the American Society for Testing and Materials voluntary product safety standard. METHODS: Data from the National Poison Data System involving exposures to liquid laundry detergent packets from 2012 to 2017 were analyzed. RESULTS: From January 2012 to December 2017, there were 72\u2009947 single and polysubstance exposures to liquid laundry detergent packets. Most exposures (91.7%) were documented among children <6 years old. The annual number and rate of exposures for children <6 years old increased by 110.4% and 111.9%, respectively, from 2012 to 2015. From 2015 to 2017, the number and rate of exposures in this age group decreased by 18.0%. Among individuals \u22656 years old, the annual number and rate of exposures increased by 292.7% and 276.7%, respectively, from 2012 to 2017. Annual hospital admissions among children <6 years old increased by 63.4% from 2012 to 2015 and declined by 55.5% from 2015 to 2017. Serious outcomes among children <6 years old increased by 78.5% from 2012 to 2015 and declined by 32.9% from 2015 to 2017. CONCLUSIONS: The number, rate, and severity of liquid laundry detergent packet exposures have decreased modestly in recent years among children <6 years old, likely attributable, in part, to the voluntary product safety standard and public awareness efforts. Exposures among older children and adults are increasing. Opportunities exist to strengthen the current product safety standard to further reduce exposures. ",
        "Survival and Impairment of Extremely Premature Infants: A Meta-analysis. CONTEXT: Survival of infants born at the limit of viability varies between high-income countries. OBJECTIVE: To summarize the prognosis of survival and risk of impairment for infants born at 22 + 0/7 weeks' to 27 + 6/7 weeks' gestational age (GA) in high-income countries. DATA SOURCES: We searched 9 databases for cohort studies published between 2000 and 2017 in which researchers reported on survival or neurodevelopmental outcomes. STUDY SELECTION: GA was based on ultrasound results, the last menstrual period, or a combination of both, and neurodevelopmental outcomes were measured by using the Bayley Scales of Infant Development II or III at 18 to 36 months of age. DATA EXTRACTION: Two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed the risk of bias and quality of evidence. RESULTS: Sixty-five studies were included. Mean survival rates increased from near 0% of all births, 7.3% of live births, and 24.1% of infants admitted to intensive care at 22 weeks' GA to 82.1%, 90.1%, and 90.2% at 27 weeks' GA, respectively. For the survivors, the rates of severe impairment decreased from 36.3% to 19.1% for 22 to 24 weeks' GA and from 14.0% to 4.2% for 25 to 27 weeks' GA. The mean chance of survival without impairment for infants born alive increased from 1.2% to 9.3% for 22 to 24 weeks' GA and from 40.6% to 64.2% for 25 to 27 weeks' GA. LIMITATIONS: The confidence in these estimates ranged from high to very low. CONCLUSIONS: Survival without impairment was substantially lower for children born at <25 weeks' GA than for those born later. ",
        "Prenatal Cotinine Levels and ADHD Among Offspring. OBJECTIVES: An association between maternal smoking during pregnancy and offspring attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) has been shown across several studies based on self-reports. No previous studies have investigated the association of nicotine exposure measured by cotinine levels during pregnancy and offspring ADHD. METHODS: In this population-based study, 1079 patients born between 1998 and 1999 and diagnosed with ADHD according to the International Classification of Diseases and 1079 matched controls were identified from Finnish nationwide registers. Maternal cotinine levels were measured by using quantitative immunoassays from maternal serum specimens collected during the first and second trimesters of pregnancy and archived in the national biobank. RESULTS: There was a significant association between increasing log-transformed maternal cotinine levels and offspring ADHD. The odds ratio was 1.09 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.06-1.12) when adjusting for maternal socioeconomic status, maternal age, maternal psychopathology, paternal age, paternal psychopathology, and child's birth weight for gestational age. In the categorical analyses with cotinine levels in 3 groups, heavy nicotine exposure (cotinine level >50 ng/mL) was associated with offspring ADHD, with an odds ratio of 2.21 (95% CI 1.63-2.99) in the adjusted analyses. Analyses by deciles of cotinine levels revealed that the adjusted odds for offspring ADHD in the highest decile was 3.34 (95% CI 2.02-5.52). CONCLUSIONS: The study reveals an association with and a dose-response relationship between nicotine exposure during pregnancy and offspring ADHD. Future studies incorporating maternal smoking and environmental, genetic, and epigenetic factors are warranted. ",
        "Maternal Smoking Before and During Pregnancy and the Risk of Sudden Unexpected Infant Death. OBJECTIVES: Maternal smoking during pregnancy is an established risk factor for sudden unexpected infant death (SUID). Here, we aim to investigate the effects of maternal prepregnancy smoking, reduction during pregnancy, and smoking during pregnancy on SUID rates. METHODS: We analyzed the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Birth Cohort Linked Birth/Infant Death Data Set (2007-2011: 20\u2009685\u2009463 births and 19\u2009127 SUIDs). SUID was defined as deaths at <1 year of age with International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision codes R95 (sudden infant death syndrome), R99 (ill-defined or unknown cause), or W75 (accidental suffocation or strangulation in bed). RESULTS: SUID risk more than doubled (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 2.44; 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.31-2.57) with any maternal smoking during pregnancy and increased twofold between no smoking and smoking 1 cigarette daily throughout pregnancy. For 1 to 20 cigarettes per day, the probability of SUID increased linearly, with each additional cigarette smoked per day increasing the odds by 0.07 from 1 to 20 cigarettes; beyond 20 cigarettes, the relationship plateaued. Mothers who quit or reduced their smoking decreased their odds compared with those who continued smoking (reduced: aOR = 0.88, 95% CI 0.79-0.98; quit: aOR = 0.77, 95% CI 0.67-0.87). If we assume causality, 22% of SUIDs in the United States can be directly attributed to maternal smoking during pregnancy. CONCLUSIONS: These data support the need for smoking cessation before pregnancy. If no women smoked in pregnancy, SUID rates in the United States could be reduced substantially. ",
        "Automated External Defibrillator Application Before EMS Arrival in Pediatric Cardiac Arrests. BACKGROUND: Little is known about the predictors of pre-emergency medical service (EMS) automated external defibrillator (AED) application in pediatric out-of-hospital cardiac arrests. We sought to determine patient- and neighborhood-level characteristics associated with pre-EMS AED application in the pediatric population. METHODS: We reviewed prospectively collected data from the Cardiac Arrest Registry to Enhance Survival on pediatric patients (age >1 to \u226418 years old) who had out-of-hospital nontraumatic arrest (2013-2015). RESULTS: A total of 1398 patients were included in this analysis (64% boys, 45% white, and median age of 11 years old). An AED was applied in 28% of the cases. Factors associated with pre-EMS AED application in univariable analyses were older age (odds ratio [OR]: 1.9; 12-18 years old vs 2-11 years old; P < .001), white versus African American race (OR: 1.4; P = .04), public location (OR: 1.9; P < .001), witnessed status (OR: 1.6; P < .001), arrests presumed to be cardiac versus respiratory etiology (OR: 1.5; P = .02) or drowning etiology (OR: 2.0; P < .001), white-populated neighborhoods (OR: 1.2 per 20% increase in white race; P = .01), neighborhood median household income (OR: 1.1 per $20\u2009000 increase; P = .02), and neighborhood level of education (OR: 1.3 per 20% increase in high school graduates; P = .006). However, only age, witnessed status, arrest location, and arrests of presumed cardiac etiology versus drowning remained significant in the multivariable model. The overall cohort survival to hospital discharge was 19%. CONCLUSIONS: The overall pre-EMS AED application rate in pediatric patients remains low. ",
        "Social Media Influencer Marketing and Children's Food Intake: A Randomized Trial. OBJECTIVES: To examine the impact of social media influencer marketing of foods (healthy and unhealthy) on children's food intake. METHODS: In a between-subjects design, 176 children (9-11 years, mean 10.5 \u00b1 0.7 years) were randomly assigned to view mock Instagram profiles of 2 popular YouTube video bloggers (influencers). Profiles featured images of the influencers with unhealthy snacks (participants: n = 58), healthy snacks (n = 59), or nonfood products (n = 59). Subsequently, participants' ad libitum intake of unhealthy snacks, healthy snacks, and overall intake (combined intake of healthy and unhealthy snacks) were measured. RESULTS: Children who viewed influencers with unhealthy snacks had significantly increased overall intake (448.3 kilocalories [kcals]; P = .001), and significantly increased intake of unhealthy snacks specifically (388.8 kcals; P = .001), compared with children who viewed influencers with nonfood products (357.1 and 292.2 kcals, respectively). Viewing influencers with healthy snacks did not significantly affect intake. CONCLUSIONS: Popular social media influencer promotion of food affects children's food intake. Influencer marketing of unhealthy foods increased children's immediate food intake, whereas the equivalent marketing of healthy foods had no effect. Increasing the promotion of healthy foods on social media may not be an effective strategy to encourage healthy dietary behaviors in children. More research is needed to understand the impact of digital food marketing and inform appropriate policy action. ",
        "Income Disparities and Cardiovascular Risk Factors Among Adolescents. BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Socioeconomic disparities in cardiovascular health among adults have been documented, but disparities during adolescence are less understood. In this study, we examined secular trends in cardiovascular risk factors and disparities among US adolescents. METHODS: We analyzed NHANES data from 1999 to 2014, including 11\u2009557 (4854 fasting) participants aged 12 to 19 years. To examine trends in cardiovascular risk factors, adolescents were stratified into 3 groups on the basis of family poverty-income ratio: low income (poverty-income ratio, <1.3), middle income (\u22651.3 and <3.5), and high income (\u22653.5). RESULTS: From 1999 to 2014, the prevalence of obesity increased (16.3%-20.9%, P = .001) but only among low- and middle-income adolescents, with significant disparities in prevalence by income (21.6% vs 14.6% among low- versus high-income adolescents, respectively, in 2011-2014). In addition, there were significant and persistent disparities in the prevalence of smoking (20.7% vs 7.3% among low- versus high-income adolescents, respectively, in 2011-2014), low-quality diet (68.9% vs 55.4%), and physical inactivity (25.6% vs 17.0%). No significant disparities were observed in the prevalence of prediabetes and diabetes, hypertension, or hypercholesterolemia, although the prevalence of prediabetes and diabetes nearly doubled (11.9%-23.1%, P < .001) among all adolescents from 1999 to 2014. Overall, the prevalence of adolescents with 2 or more risk factors declined, but this decline was only significant for high-income adolescents (44.1%-29.1%, P = .02). CONCLUSIONS: Recent improvements in cardiovascular health have not been equally shared by US adolescents of varying socioeconomic status. ",
        "Concussion Incidence and Trends in 20 High School Sports. BACKGROUND: Ongoing monitoring of concussion rates and distributions is important in assessing temporal patterns. Examinations of high school sport-related concussions need to be updated. This study describes the epidemiology of concussions in 20 high school sports during the 2013-2014 to 2017-2018 school years. METHODS: In this descriptive epidemiology study, a convenience sample of high school athletic trainers provided injury and athlete exposure (AE) data to the National High School Sports-Related Injury Surveillance Study (High School Reporting Information Online). Concussion rates per 10\u2009000 AEs with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and distributions were calculated. Injury rate ratios and injury proportion ratios examined sex differences in sex-comparable sports (soccer, basketball, baseball and softball, cross country, track, and swimming). We also assessed temporal trends across the study period. RESULTS: Overall, 9542 concussions were reported for an overall rate of 4.17 per 10\u2009000 AEs (95% CI: 4.09 to 4.26). Football had the highest concussion rate (10.40 per 10\u2009000 AEs). Across the study period, football competition-related concussion rates increased (33.19 to 39.07 per 10\u2009000 AEs); practice-related concussion rates decreased (5.47 to 4.44 per 10\u2009000 AEs). In all sports, recurrent concussion rates decreased (0.47 to 0.28 per 10\u2009000 AEs). Among sex-comparable sports, concussion rates were higher in girls than in boys (3.35 vs 1.51 per 10\u2009000 AEs; injury rate ratio = 2.22; 95% CI: 2.07 to 2.39). Also, among sex-comparable sports, girls had larger proportions of concussions that were recurrent than boys did (9.3% vs 6.4%; injury proportion ratio = 1.44; 95% CI: 1.11 to 1.88). CONCLUSIONS: Rates of football practice-related concussions and recurrent concussions across all sports decreased. Changes in concussion rates may be associated with changes in concussion incidence, diagnosis, and management. Future research should continue to monitor trends and examine the effect of prevention strategies. ",
        "Diabetes-Related Emotional Distress Over Time. BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Many adolescents with type 1 diabetes experience diabetes-related distress (DRD; the negative emotional reactions specific to managing diabetes), but most research on DRD among adolescents relies on cross-sectional data. We assess adolescents' longitudinal DRD patterns and predictors of chronic DRD. METHODS: This secondary analysis of data from a depression prevention clinical trial included 264 adolescents with type 1 diabetes randomly assigned to a resilience or education intervention (mean age: 15.7 \u00b1 1.1 years; 59.8% female). Youth reported their DRD at 5 assessments over 16 months. Using latent class growth analysis, we classified adolescents into trajectory groups according to baseline starting point (intercept) and rate of change (slope) of DRD. We examined bivariate associations between trajectory group membership and demographic and clinical factors. Baseline predictors of chronic DRD were assessed via multiple logistic regression. RESULTS: Participants were classified into 4 groups: stable high DRD (7.2%; high intercept, flat slope), stable moderate DRD (28.0%; above-average intercept, flat slope), improving DRD (33.7%; average intercept, downward slope), and low DRD (31.1%; below-average intercept, downward slope). Lower hemoglobin A1c, greater adherence, fewer socioemotional difficulties, and more adaptive coping distinguished the improving and low DRD trajectories. Chronic DRD patterns were associated with female sex and higher depressive symptoms and hemoglobin A1c. CONCLUSIONS: In this study of adolescents' DRD trajectories during and after a psychoeducational intervention, one-third of youth were classified as having chronic, elevated DRD. Links with multiple clinical factors support efforts for routine DRD screening and comprehensive interventions for distressed youth. ",
        "Musculoskeletal Pain, Physical Function, and Quality of Life After Bariatric Surgery. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the longitudinal effects of metabolic and bariatric surgery (MBS) on the prevalence of musculoskeletal and lower extremity (LE) pain, physical function, and health-related quality of life. METHODS: The Teen Longitudinal Assessment of Bariatric Surgery study (NCT00474318) prospectively collected data on 242 adolescents undergoing MBS at 5 centers over a 3-year follow-up. Joint pain and physical function outcomes were assessed by using the Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index, Impact of Weight on Quality of Life - Kids, and the Short Form 36 Health Survey. Adolescents with Blount disease (n = 9) were excluded. RESULTS: Prevalent musculoskeletal and LE pain were reduced by 40% within 12 months and persisted over 3 years. Adjusted models revealed a 6% lower odds of having musculoskeletal pain (odds ratio = 0.94, 95% confidence interval: 0.92-0.99) and a 10% lower odds of having LE pain (odds ratio = 0.90, 95% confidence interval: 0.86-0.95) per 10% reduction of BMI. The prevalence of poor physical function (Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index score >0) declined from 49% to <20% at 6 months (P < .05), Physical comfort and the physical component scores, measured by the Impact of Weight on Quality of Life - Kids and the Short Form 36 Health Survey, improved at 6 months postsurgery and beyond (P < .01). Poor physical function predicted persistent joint pain after MBS. CONCLUSIONS: Joint pain, impaired physical function, and impaired health-related quality of life significantly improve after MBS. These benefits in patient-reported outcomes support the use of MBS in adolescents with severe obesity and musculoskeletal pain and suggest that MBS in adolescence may reverse and reduce multiple risk factors for future joint disease.

        "Prescription Opioid Misuse and Risky Adolescent Behavior. OBJECTIVES: Misuse of opioid medications (ie, using opioids differently than how a doctor prescribed the medication) is common among US adolescents and associated with preventable health consequences (eg, severe respiratory depression, seizures, heart failure, and death).1 New guidelines and recommendations have made providers more attuned to overprescribing and more vigilant about screening for opioid misuse.2 We hypothesized that youth who misused prescription opioids were more likely to report engaging in a broad range of other risky behaviors. METHODS: We used the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's 2017 Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance Survey (n = 14\u2009765), a cross-sectional, nationally representative survey of high school students. Students were sampled by using a 3-stage random cluster design. We conducted weighted logistic regressions to determine the strength of the association between our independent variable, ever misusing prescription opioids, and 22 dependent variables in the following categories: risky driving behaviors (4 variables), violent behaviors (3 variables), risky sexual behaviors (4 variables), substance use (10 variables), and suicide attempt (1 variable). RESULTS: In 2017, 14% of US adolescents reported ever misusing opioids. Those who misused prescription opioids were significantly more likely to have engaged in all 22 risky behaviors (adjusted odds ratios ranged from 2.0 to 22.3; P < .0001 for all tests) compared with other adolescents. CONCLUSIONS: Adolescents reporting ever misusing prescription opioids were more likely to have engaged in a broad range of risky behaviors. Health care providers screening for prescription opioid misuse may be ideally positioned to identify these high-risk youth and initiate early interventions. Longitudinal Associations of 12th-Grade Binge Drinking With Risky Driving and High-Risk Drinking. OBJECTIVE: To study the longitudinal associations of 12th-grade binge drinking with driving while impaired (DWI), riding with an impaired driver (RWI), blackouts, extreme binge drinking, and risky driving (self-reported Checkpoints Risky Driving Scale) among emerging adults up to 4 years after leaving high school. METHODS: The data were all 7 waves (W 1 to W 7 of the NEXT Generation Health Study; a US nationally representative study (N = 2785) with a probability cohort of 10th-graders (mean age = 16.2 years; SE = 0.03) starting in the 2009-2010 year. Binary and ordinal logistic regressions were used for the analysis. RESULTS: Binge drinking prevalence in W1 to W3 was 27.2%, 23.8%, and 26.8%, respectively. Twelfth-grade binge drinking was associated with a higher likelihood of DWI, RWI, blackouts, and risky driving in W4 to W7 and extreme binge drinking in W7. Adolescents who binged \u22653 times in high school were more likely to DWI, RWI, blackout (W4 to W7), be involved in extreme binge drinking (W7), and report riskier driving several years after high school. In some waves, parental practices appeared to have enduring effects in protecting against DWI, RWI, and blackouts. CONCLUSIONS: Twelfth-grade binge drinking is a robust predictor of early adulthood DWI, RWI, blackout, extreme binge drinking, and risky driving. Our study suggests that ongoing parental practices could be protective against DWI, RWI, and blackouts once adolescents transition from high school into early adulthood. Prevention programs that incorporate binge drinking-focused screening and bolster parental practices may reduce the likelihood of later major alcohol-related health-risk behaviors and consequences in emerging adults.

        "Teenagers, Sexting, and the Law. The phenomenon of teen sexting emerged as a result of the proliferation of digital technology. More than 40 studies have established that teen sexting occurs relatively frequently and is a rising trend, commensurate with the ubiquity of smartphone ownership in teens. Studies have shown that sexting is associated with incidences of increased sexual behavior. US state laws on sexting vary widely, from decriminalization to misdemeanor charges or prosecution for child pornography with harsh sentences. Teen behavior and digital invention have outpaced the development of new laws, and this has the potential to have dire legal ramifications for teens. Separating consensual sexting from nonconsensual sexting and actual child pornography is a critical next step for law enforcement agencies and policy makers to catch up to technology. In this article, we argue that consensual teen-to-teen sexting does not warrant law enforcement involvement but rather is a health and education issue that is better addressed at home, in schools, and in primary care.

        "Parent-Adolescent Agreement About Adolescents' Suicidal Thoughts. OBJECTIVES: To examine agreement between parent and adolescent reports of adolescents' suicidal thoughts and explore demographic and clinical factors associated with agreement in a large community sample. Participants included 5137 adolescents 11 to 17 years old (52.1% girls; 43.0% racial minority) and a collateral informant (97.2% parent or stepparent) from the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort. Families were recruited from a large pediatric health care network. Adolescents and parents completed a clinical interview that included questions about adolescents' lifetime suicidal thoughts. Agreement was moderate for thoughts of killing self (\u03ba = 0.466) and low for thoughts of death or dying (\u03ba = 0.171). Discrepancies stemmed from both parental unawareness of suicidal thoughts reported by adolescents and adolescent denial of suicidal thoughts reported by parents. Fifty percent of parents were unaware of adolescents' thoughts of killing themselves, and 75.6% of parents were unaware of adolescents' recurrent thoughts of death. Forty-eight percent of adolescents denied thoughts of killing themselves, and 67.5% of adolescents denied thoughts of death reported by parents. Several demographic (eg, age) and clinical (eg, treatment history) characteristics were associated with agreement. Early identification and intervention hinge on reliable and valid assessment of suicide risk. The high prevalence of parental unawareness and adolescent denial of suicidal thoughts found in this study suggests that many adolescents at risk for suicide may go undetected. These findings have important clinical implications for pediatric settings, including the need for a multi-informant approach to suicide screening and a personalized approach to assessment based on empirically derived risk factors for unawareness and denial.

        "Trends of Suicidal Behaviors Among High School Students in the United States: 1991-2017. OBJECTIVES: To determine if racial and ethnic subgroups of adolescents are at high risk for engagement in suicidal behaviors. METHODS: Using the nationally representative school-based Youth Risk Behavior Survey from the years 1991 to 2017, we conducted logistic regression analyses to examine trends by different racial and ethnic groups, with each suicide indicator serving as a dichotomous outcome. Participants included 198\u2009540 high school students. RESULTS: Across all sex and race and ethnic groups, there were significant linear decreases in self-reported suicidal ideation and suicide plans from 1991 to 2017. Female adolescents (odds ratio [OR], 0.98; P < .001) had significant decreases in attempts over time. Black adolescents had positive linear trends for suicide attempts among both boys (OR, 1.04; P < .001) and girls (OR, 1.02; P = .003). Black adolescent boys (OR, 1.04; P = .048) had a significant linear increase in injury by attempt. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that, over time, black youth have experienced an increase in suicide attempts, which is troubling because attempts are the most prominent risk factor associated with suicide death. For black boys, a significant increase in injury by attempt occurred, which suggests that black boys may be engaging in increasingly lethal means when attempting suicide. Examining trends of suicidal thoughts and behaviors over time by sex and race and ethnicity allow us to determine where to focus prevention and intervention efforts. Future research should examine the underlying reasons for these changes observed in US high school students. ",
        "Growth and Distribution of Child Psychiatrists in the United States: 2007-2016. BACKGROUND: Historically, there has been a shortage of child psychiatrists in the United States, undermining access to care. This study updated trends in the growth and distribution of child psychiatrists over the past decade. METHODS: Data from the Area Health Resource Files were used to compare the number of child psychiatrists per 100\u2009000 children ages 0 to 19 between 2007 and 2016 by state and county. We also examined sociodemographic characteristics associated with the density of child psychiatrists at the county level over this period using negative binomial multivariable models. RESULTS: From 2007 to 2016, the number of child psychiatrists in the United States increased from 6590 to 7991, a 21.3% gain. The number of child psychiatrists per 100\u2009000 children also grew from 8.01 to 9.75, connoting a 21.7% increase. County- and state-level growth varied widely, with 6 states observing a decline in the ratio of child psychiatrists (ID, IN, KS, ND, SC, and SD) and 6 states increasing by >50% (AK, AR, NH, NV, OK, and RI). Seventy percent of counties had no child psychiatrists in both 2007 and 2016. Child psychiatrists were significantly more likely to practice in high-income counties (P < .001), counties with higher levels of postsecondary education (P < .001), and metropolitan counties compared with those adjacent to metropolitan regions (P < .05). CONCLUSIONS: Despite the increased ratio of child psychiatrists per 100\u2009000 children in the United States over the past decade, there remains a dearth of child psychiatrists, particularly in parts of the United States with lower levels of income and education.

        "Antibiotic Prescribing During Pediatric Direct-to-Consumer Telemedicine Visits. BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Use of commercial direct-to-consumer (DTC) telemedicine outside of the pediatric medical home is increasing among children, and acute respiratory infections (ARIs) are the most commonly diagnosed condition at DTC telemedicine visits. Our objective was to compare the quality of antibiotic prescribing for ARIs among children across 3 settings: DTC telemedicine, urgent care, and the primary care provider (PCP) office. METHODS: In a retrospective cohort study using 2015-2016 claims data from a large national commercial health plan, we identified ARI visits by children (0-17 years old), excluding visits with comorbidities that could affect antibiotic decisions. Visits were matched on age, sex, chronic medical complexity, state, rurality, health plan type, and ARI diagnosis category. Within the matched sample, we compared the percentage of ARI visits with any antibiotic prescribing and the percentage of ARI visits with guideline-concordant antibiotic management. RESULTS: There were 4604 DTC telemedicine, 38\u2009408 urgent care, and 485\u2009201 PCP visits for ARIs in the matched sample. Antibiotic prescribing was higher for DTC telemedicine visits than for other settings (52% of DTC telemedicine visits versus 42% urgent care and 31% PCP visits; P < .001 for both comparisons). Guideline-concordant antibiotic management was lower at DTC telemedicine visits than at other settings (59% of DTC telemedicine visits versus 67% urgent care and 78% PCP visits; P < .001 for both comparisons). CONCLUSIONS: At DTC telemedicine visits, children with ARIs were more likely to receive antibiotics and less likely to receive guideline-concordant antibiotic management compared to children at PCP visits and urgent care visits.

        "Differences in Parent-Toddler Interactions With Electronic Versus Print Books. OBJECTIVES: Previous research has documented less dialogic interaction between parents and preschoolers during electronic-book reading versus print. Parent-toddler interactions around commercially available tablet-based books have not been described. We examined parent-toddler verbal and nonverbal interactions when reading electronic versus print books. METHODS: We conducted a videotaped, laboratory-based, counterbalanced study of 37 parent-toddler dyads reading on 3 book formats (enhanced electronic [sound effects and/or animation], basic electronic, and print). We coded verbalizations in 10-second intervals for parents (dialogic, nondialogic, text reading, format related, negative format-related directives, and off task) and children (book related, negative, and off task). Shared positive affect and collaborative book reading were coded on a scale of 1 to 5 (5 = high). Proc Genmod and Proc Mixed analyzed within-subjects variance by book format. RESULTS: Parents showed significantly more dialogic (print 11.9; enhanced 6.2 [P < .001]; basic 8.3 [P < .001]), text-reading (print 14.3; enhanced 10.6 [P = .003]; basic 14.4 [P < .001]), off-task (print 2.3; enhanced 1.3 [P = .007]), and total (29.5; enhanced 28.1 [P = .003]; basic 29.3 [P = .005]) verbalizations with print books and fewer format-related verbalizations (print 1.9; enhanced 10.0 [P < .001]; basic 8.3 [P < .001]). Toddlers showed more book-related verbalizations (print 15.0; enhanced 11.5 [P < .001]; basic 12.5 [P = .005]), total verbalizations (print 18.8; enhanced 13.8 [P < .001]; basic 15.3 [P < .001]), and higher collaboration scores (print 3.1; enhanced 2.7 [P = .004]; basic 2.8 [P = .02]) with print-book reading. CONCLUSIONS: Parents and toddlers verbalized less with electronic books, and collaboration was lower. Future studies should examine specific aspects of tablet-book design that support parent-child interaction. Pediatricians may wish to continue promoting shared reading of print books, particularly for toddlers and younger children. ",
        "Cognition After Early Tonsillectomy for Mild OSA. OBJECTIVES: It remains uncertain whether treatment with adenotonsillectomy for obstructive sleep apnea in children improves cognitive function. The Preschool Obstructive Sleep Apnea Tonsillectomy and Adenoidectomy study was a prospective randomized controlled study in which researchers evaluated outcomes 12 months after adenotonsillectomy compared with no surgery in preschool children symptomatic for obstructive sleep apnea. METHODS: A total of 190 children (age 3-5 years) were randomly assigned to early adenotonsillectomy (within 2 months) or to routine wait lists (12-month wait, no adenotonsillectomy [NoAT]). Baseline and 12-month assessments included cognitive and behavioral testing, medical assessment, polysomnography, and audiology. The primary outcome was global IQ at 12-month follow-up, measured by the Woodcock Johnson III Brief Intellectual Ability (BIA). Questionnaires included the Pediatric Sleep Questionnaire, Parent Rating Scale of the Behavioral Assessment System for Children-II, and Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function, Preschool Version. RESULTS: A total of 141 children (75.8%) attended baseline and 12-month assessments, and BIA was obtained at baseline and 12-month follow-up for 61 and 60 participants in the adenotonsillectomy versus NoAT groups, respectively. No cognitive gain was found after adenotonsillectomy compared with NoAT, adjusted for baseline; BIA scores at 12-month follow-up were as follows: adenotonsillectomy, 465.46 (17.9) versus NoAT, 463.12 (16.6) (mean [SD]). Improvements were seen for polysomnogram arousals and apnea indices and for parent reports of symptoms (Pediatric Sleep Questionnaire), behavior (Behavior Assessment System for Children behavioral symptoms, P = .04), overall health, and daytime napping. CONCLUSIONS: Structured testing showed no treatment-attributable improvement in cognitive functioning of preschool children 12 months after adenotonsillectomy compared with NoAT. Improvements were seen after adenotonsillectomy in sleep and behavior by using polysomnogram monitoring and parental questionnaires. ",
        "Parental Smoking and E-cigarette Use in Homes and Cars. OBJECTIVES: To determine how smoke-free and vape-free home and car policies differ for parents who are dual users of cigarettes and electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes), who only smoke cigarettes, or who only use e-cigarettes. To identify factors associated with not having smoke-free or vape-free policies and how often smoke-free advice is offered at pediatric offices. METHODS: Secondary analysis of 2017 parental interview data collected after their children's visit in 5 control practices participating in the Clinical Effort Against Secondhand Smoke Exposure trial. RESULTS: Most dual users had smoke-free home policies, yet fewer had a vape-free home policies (63.8% vs 26.3%; P < .01). Dual users were less likely than cigarette users to have smoke-free car (P < .01), vape-free home (P < .001), or vape-free car (P < .001) policies. Inside cars, dual users were more likely than cigarette users to report smoking (P < .001), e-cigarette use (P < .001), and e-cigarette use with children present (P < .001). Parental characteristics associated with not having smoke-free or vape-free home and car policies include smoking \u226510 cigarettes per day, using e-cigarettes, and having a youngest child >10 years old. Smoke-free home and car advice was infrequently delivered. CONCLUSIONS: Parents may perceive e-cigarette aerosol as safe for children. Dual users more often had smoke-free policies than vape-free policies for the home. Dual users were less likely than cigarette-only smokers to report various child-protective measures inside homes and cars. These findings reveal important opportunities for intervention with parents about smoking and vaping in homes and cars. ",
        "School Restroom and Locker Room Restrictions and Sexual Assault Risk Among Transgender Youth. BACKGROUND: Transgender and gender nonbinary adolescents experience high rates of peer victimization, but the prevalence of sexual assault in this population has not been established. Some schools restrict transgender and nonbinary students from using restrooms and locker rooms that match their gender identity, with unknown effects on sexual assault risk. We tested whether these restrictions were associated with the 12-month prevalence of sexual assault victimization. METHODS: Survey responses were analyzed from 3673 transgender and nonbinary US adolescents in grades 7 through 12 who participated in the cross-sectional 2017 LGBTQ Teen Study. We estimated the association between school restroom and locker room restrictions and sexual assault, adjusting for potential social and behavioral confounders, using logistic regression. We also tested potential mediators. RESULTS: The 12-month prevalence of sexual assault was 26.5% among transgender boys, 27.0% among nonbinary youth assigned female at birth, 18.5% among transgender girls, and 17.6% among nonbinary youth assigned male at birth. Youth whose restroom and locker room use was restricted were more likely to experience sexual assault compared with those without restrictions, with risk ratios of 1.26 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.02-1.52) in transgender boys, 1.42 (95% CI: 1.10-1.78) in nonbinary youth assigned female at birth, and 2.49 (95% CI: 1.11-4.28) in transgender girls. Restrictions were not associated with sexual assault among nonbinary youth assigned male at birth. CONCLUSIONS: Pediatricians should be aware that sexual assault is highly prevalent in transgender and nonbinary youth and that restrictive school restroom and locker room policies may be associated with risk.

        "Characteristics and Workload of Pediatricians in China. OBJECTIVES: Although it is widely believed that China is facing a major shortage of pediatricians, the real situation of the current national status of pediatric human resources and their working conditions has not been evaluated to date. METHODS: We administered a survey to 54\u2009214 hospitals from all 31 provinces in mainland China from 2015 to 2016. Hospital directors of all secondary and tertiary hospitals with pediatric services and a random sample (10%) of primary hospitals provided information on number of pediatricians and their educational levels, specialties, workloads, dropout rates, and other hospital characteristics. A data set of medical resources and socioeconomic information regarding each region (1997-2016) was constructed from the Chinese National Statistics Bureau. The Gini coefficient was used to describe the geographical distributions of pediatricians and hospitals. RESULTS: There were 135\u2009524 pediatricians in China or \u223c4 pediatricians per 10\u2009000 children. Pediatricians' average educational level was low, with \u223c32% having only 3 years of junior college training after high school. The distribution of pediatricians was extremely skewed (Gini coefficient 0.61), and the imbalance of highly educated pediatricians was even more skewed (Gini coefficient 0.68). The dropout rate of pediatricians was 12.6%. Despite an increase in the Chinese government's financial investment in health over the last decade, physicians have been burdened with a greater workload. CONCLUSIONS: Uneven development of the pediatric care system, inadequately trained pediatricians, low job satisfaction, and unmet demand for pediatric care are the major challenges facing China's pediatric health care system.

        "Factors Associated With Unrestrained Young Passengers in Motor Vehicle Crashes. BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Unrestrained child passengers are at significant risk of crash-related injury. Previous researchers using nationally representative crash data from 1992 to 1993 found an association between driver and passenger safety-belt use. Our objective in this study is to investigate factors associated with young, unrestrained passengers in fatal and nonfatal motor vehicle crashes using updated national crash data. We analyzed 2011-2015 Fatality Analysis Reporting System and National Automotive Sampling System data and included vehicles with a young passenger (\u226419 years old) in a crash. Driver and passenger characteristics were compared by using bivariate analyses separately for fatal and nonfatal crashes. Logistic regression analyses were performed on a combined data set to predict passenger restraint use. In unadjusted bivariate models, unrestrained drivers had a higher probability of having an unrestrained passenger across all passenger age groups for both fatal and nonfatal crashes. In multivariate logistic regression models that included both fatal and nonfatal crashes and were adjusted for several driver and passenger characteristics, unrestrained drivers had a higher risk of having an unrestrained young passenger across all age groups. In both fatal and nonfatal crashes, a driver being unrestrained is a strong predictor of the child passenger also being unrestrained. Policy and regulation to better ensure that drivers are properly restrained (eg, expanding primary seat-belt laws to all states) may serve as effective means for increasing rates of proper child-occupant-restraint use.

        "Meningococcal Disease Among College-Aged Young Adults: 2014-2016. BACKGROUND: Freshman college students living in residence halls have previously been identified as being at an increased risk for meningococcal disease. In this evaluation, we assess the incidence and characteristics of meningococcal disease in college-aged young adults in the United States. The incidence and relative risk (RR) of meningococcal disease among college students compared with noncollege students aged 18 to 24 years during 2014-2016 were calculated by using data from the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System and enhanced meningococcal disease surveillance. Differences in demographic characteristics and clinical features of meningococcal disease cases were assessed. Available meningococcal isolates were characterized by using slide agglutination, polymerase chain reaction, and whole genome sequencing. From 2014 to 2016, 166 cases of meningococcal disease occurred in persons aged 18 to 24 years, with an average annual incidence of 0.17 cases per 100\u2009000 population. Six serogroup B outbreaks were identified on college campuses, accounting for 31.7% of serogroup B cases in college students during this period. The RR of serogroup B meningococcal (MenB) disease in college students versus noncollege students was 3.54 (95% confidence interval: 2.21-5.41), and the RR of serogroups C, W, and Y combined was 0.56 (95% confidence interval: 0.27-1.14). The most common serogroup B clonal complexes identified were CC32/ET-5 and CC41/44 lineage 3. Although the incidence is low, among 18- to 24-year-olds, college students are at an increased risk for sporadic and outbreak-associated MenB disease. Providers, college students, and parents should be aware of the availability of MenB vaccines. ",
        "Lactate Is a Natural Suppressor of RLR Signaling by Targeting MAVS. RLR-mediated type I IFN production plays a pivotal role in elevating host immunity for viral clearance and cancer immune surveillance. Here, we report that glycolysis, which is inactivated during RLR activation, serves as a barrier to impede type I IFN production upon RLR activation. RLR-triggered MAVS-RIG-I recognition hijacks hexokinase binding to MAVS, leading to the impairment of hexokinase mitochondria localization and activation. Lactate serves as a key metabolite responsible for glycolysis-mediated RLR signaling inhibition by directly binding to MAVS transmembrane (TM) domain and\u00a0preventing MAVS aggregation. Notably, lactate restoration reverses increased IFN production caused by lactate deficiency. Using pharmacological and genetic approaches, we show that lactate reduction by lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA) inactivation heightens type I IFN production to protect mice from viral infection. Our study establishes a critical role of glycolysis-derived lactate in limiting RLR signaling and identifies MAVS as a direct sensor of lactate, which functions to connect energy metabolism and innate immunity.

        "Phylogeography of the second plague pandemic revealed through analysis of historical Yersinia pestis genomes. The second plague pandemic, caused by Yersinia pestis, devastated Europe and the\u00a0nearby regions between the 14th and 18th centuries AD. Here we analyse human remains from ten European archaeological sites spanning this period and reconstruct 34 ancient Y. pestis genomes. Our data support an initial entry of the bacterium through eastern Europe, the absence of genetic diversity during the Black Death, and low within-outbreak diversity thereafter. Analysis of post-Black Death genomes shows the diversification of a Y. pestis lineage into multiple genetically distinct clades that may have given rise to more than one disease reservoir in, or close to, Europe. In addition, we show the loss of a genomic region that includes virulence-related genes in strains associated with late stages of the pandemic. The deletion was also identified in genomes connected with the first plague pandemic (541-750 AD), suggesting a comparable evolutionary trajectory of Y. pestis during both events. ",
        "Evolutionary pathways to antibiotic resistance are dependent upon environmental structure and bacterial lifestyle. Bacterial populations vary in their stress tolerance and population structure depending upon whether growth occurs in well-mixed or structured environments. We hypothesized that evolution in biofilms would generate greater genetic diversity than well-mixed environments and lead to different pathways of antibiotic resistance. We used experimental evolution and whole genome sequencing to test how the biofilm lifestyle influenced the rate, genetic mechanisms, and pleiotropic effects of resistance to ciprofloxacin in Acinetobacter baumannii populations. Both evolutionary dynamics and the identities of mutations differed between lifestyle. Planktonic populations experienced selective sweeps of mutations including the primary topoisomerase drug targets, whereas biofilm-adapted populations acquired mutations in regulators of efflux pumps. An overall trade-off between fitness and resistance level emerged, wherein biofilm-adapted clones were less resistant than planktonic but more fit in the absence of drug. However, biofilm populations developed collateral sensitivity to cephalosporins, demonstrating the clinical relevance of lifestyle on the evolution of resistance. ",
        "Engineering orthogonal signalling pathways reveals the sparse occupancy of sequence space. Gene duplication is a common and powerful mechanism by which cells create new signalling pathways1,2, but recently duplicated proteins typically must become insulated from each other and from other paralogues to prevent unwanted crosstalk3. A similar challenge arises when new sensors or synthetic signalling pathways are engineered within cells or transferred between genomes. How easily new pathways can be introduced into cells depends on the density and distribution of paralogous pathways in the sequence space that is defined by their specificity-determining residues4,5. Here we directly investigate how crowded this sequence space is, by generating novel two-component signalling proteins in Escherichia coli using cell sorting coupled to deep\u00a0sequencing to analyse large libraries designed on the basis of coevolutionary patterns. We produce 58\u00a0insulated pathways\u00a0comprising functional kinase-substrate pairs that have different specificities than their parent proteins, and demonstrate that several of these new pairs are orthogonal to all 27\u00a0paralogous pathways in E.\u00a0coli. Additionally, from the kinase-substrate pairs generated, we identify sets consisting of six pairs that are mutually orthogonal to each other, which considerably increases the two-component signalling capacity of E.\u00a0coli. These results indicate that sequence space is not densely occupied. The relative sparsity of paralogues in sequence space suggests that new insulated pathways can arise easily during evolution, or be designed de novo. We demonstrate the latter by engineering a signalling pathway in E.\u00a0coli that responds to a plant cytokinin, without crosstalk to extant pathways. Our work also demonstrates how coevolution-guided mutagenesis and the mapping of sequence space can be used to design large sets of orthogonal protein-protein interactions. ",
        "Sustained wood burial in the Bengal Fan over the last 19 My. The Ganges-Brahmaputra (G-B) River system transports over a billion tons of sediment every year from the Himalayan Mountains to the Bay of Bengal and has built the world's largest active sedimentary deposit, the Bengal Fan. High sedimentation rates drive exceptional organic matter preservation that represents a long-term sink for atmospheric CO2 While much attention has been paid to organic-rich fine sediments, coarse sediments have generally been overlooked as a locus of organic carbon (OC) burial. However, International Ocean Discovery Program Expedition 354 recently discovered abundant woody debris (millimeter- to centimeter-sized fragments) preserved within the coarse sediment layers of turbidite beds recovered from 6 marine drill sites along a transect across the Bengal Fan (\u223c8\u00b0N, \u223c3,700-m water depth) with recovery spanning 19 My. Analysis of bulk wood and lignin finds mostly lowland origins of wood delivered episodically. In the last 5 My, export included C4 plants, implying that coarse woody, lowland export continued after C4 grassland expansion, albeit in reduced amounts. Substantial export of coarse woody debris in the last 1 My included one wood-rich deposit (\u223c0.05 Ma) that encompassed coniferous wood transported from the headwaters. In coarse layers, we found on average 0.16 weight % OC, which is half the typical biospheric OC content of sediments exported by the modern G-B Rivers. Wood burial estimates are hampered by poor drilling recovery of sands. However, high-magnitude, low-frequency wood export events are shown to be a key mechanism for C burial in turbidites. ",
        "A small molecule interacts with VDAC2 to block mouse BAK-driven apoptosis. Activating the intrinsic apoptosis pathway with small molecules is now a clinically validated approach to cancer therapy. In contrast, blocking apoptosis to prevent the death of healthy cells in disease settings has not been achieved. Caspases have been favored, but they act too late in apoptosis to provide long-term protection. The critical step in committing a cell to death is activation of BAK or BAX, pro-death BCL-2 proteins mediating mitochondrial damage. Apoptosis cannot proceed in their absence. Here we show that WEHI-9625, a novel tricyclic sulfone small molecule, binds to VDAC2 and promotes its ability to inhibit apoptosis driven by mouse BAK. In contrast to caspase inhibitors, WEHI-9625 blocks apoptosis before mitochondrial damage, preserving cellular function and long-term clonogenic potential. Our findings expand on the key role of VDAC2 in regulating apoptosis and demonstrate that blocking apoptosis at an early stage is both advantageous and pharmacologically tractable. ",
        "Scalar Dark Matter in the Radio-Frequency Band: Atomic-Spectroscopy Search Results. Among the prominent candidates for dark matter are bosonic fields with small scalar couplings to the standard-model particles. Several techniques are employed to search for such couplings, and the current best constraints are derived from tests of gravity or atomic probes. In experiments employing atoms, observables would arise from expected dark-matter-induced oscillations in the fundamental constants of nature. These studies are primarily sensitive to underlying particle masses below 10^{-14}\u2009\u2009eV. We present a method to search for fast oscillations of fundamental constants using atomic spectroscopy in cesium vapor. We demonstrate sensitivity to scalar interactions of dark matter associated with a particle mass in the range 8\u00d710^{-11} to 4\u00d710^{-7}\u2009\u2009eV. In this range our experiment yields constraints on such interactions, which within the framework of an astronomical-size dark matter structure are comparable with, or better than, those provided by experiments probing deviations from the law of gravity.

        "Evidence for the reproduction of social class in brief speech. Economic inequality is at its highest point on record and is linked to poorer health and well-being across countries. The forces that perpetuate inequality continue to be studied, and here we examine how a person's position within the economic hierarchy, their social class, is accurately perceived and reproduced by mundane patterns embedded in brief speech. Studies 1 through 4 examined the extent that people accurately perceive social class based on brief speech patterns. We find that brief speech spoken out of context is sufficient to allow respondents to discern the social class of speakers at levels above chance accuracy, that adherence to both digital and subjective standards for English is associated with higher perceived and actual social class of speakers, and that pronunciation cues in speech communicate social class over and above speech content. In study 5, we find that people with prior hiring experience use speech patterns in preinterview conversations to judge the fit, competence, starting salary, and signing bonus of prospective job candidates in ways that bias the process in favor of applicants of higher social class. Overall, this research provides evidence for the stratification of common speech and its role in both shaping perceiver judgments and perpetuating inequality during the briefest interactions. ",
        "Programmable Inhibition and Detection of RNA Viruses Using Cas13. The CRISPR effector Cas13 could be an effective antiviral for single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) viruses because it programmably cleaves RNAs complementary to its CRISPR RNA (crRNA). Here, we computationally identify thousands of potential Cas13 crRNA target sites in hundreds of ssRNA viral species that can potentially infect humans. We experimentally demonstrate Cas13's potent activity against three distinct ssRNA viruses: lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV); influenza A virus (IAV); and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV). Combining this antiviral activity with Cas13-based diagnostics, we develop Cas13-assisted restriction of viral expression and readout (CARVER), an end-to-end platform that uses Cas13 to detect and destroy viral RNA. We further screen hundreds of crRNAs along the LCMV genome to evaluate how conservation and target RNA nucleotide content influence Cas13's antiviral activity. Our results demonstrate that Cas13 can be harnessed to target a wide range of ssRNA viruses and CARVER's potential broad utility for rapid diagnostic and antiviral drug development. ",
        "Commonly Used Insect Repellents Hide Human Odors from Anopheles Mosquitoes. The mode of action for most mosquito repellents is unknown. This is primarily due to the difficulty in monitoring how the mosquito olfactory system responds to repellent odors. Here, we used the Q-system of binary expression to enable activity-dependent Ca2+ imaging in olfactory neurons of the African malaria mosquito Anopheles coluzzii. This system allows neuronal responses to common insect repellents to be directly visualized in living mosquitoes from all olfactory organs, including the antenna. The synthetic repellents N,N-diethyl-meta-toluamide (DEET) and IR3535 did not activate Anopheles odorant receptor co-receptor (Orco)-expressing olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) at any concentration, and picaridin weakly activated ORNs only at high concentrations. In contrast, natural repellents (i.e. lemongrass oil and eugenol) strongly activated small numbers of ORNs in the Anopheles mosquito antennae at low concentrations. We determined that DEET, IR3535, and picaridin decrease the response of Orco-expressing ORNs when these repellents are physically mixed with activating human-derived odorants. We present evidence that synthetic repellents may primarily exert their olfactory mode of action by decreasing the amount of volatile odorants reaching ORNs. These results suggest that synthetic repellents disruptively change the chemical profile of host scent signatures on the skin surface, rendering humans invisible to Anopheles mosquitoes. ",
        "Combining Transient Expression and Cryo-EM to Obtain High-Resolution Structures of Luteovirid Particles. The Luteoviridae are pathogenic plant viruses responsible for significant crop losses worldwide. They infect a wide range of food crops, including cereals, legumes, cucurbits, sugar beet, sugarcane, and potato and, as such, are a major threat to global food security. Viral replication is strictly limited to the\u00a0plant vasculature, and this phloem limitation, coupled with the need for aphid transmission of virus particles, has made it difficult to generate virus in the quantities needed for high-resolution structural studies. Here, we exploit recent advances in heterologous expression in plants to produce sufficient quantities of virus-like particles for structural studies. We have determined their structures to high resolution by cryoelectron microscopy, providing the molecular-level insight required to rationally interrogate luteovirid capsid formation and aphid transmission, thereby providing a platform for the development of preventive agrochemicals for this important family of plant viruses.

        "Mice with hyper-long telomeres show less metabolic aging and longer lifespans. Short telomeres trigger age-related pathologies and shorter lifespans in mice and humans. In the past, we generated mouse embryonic (ES) cells with longer telomeres than normal (hyper-long telomeres) in the absence of genetic manipulations, which contributed to all mouse tissues. To address whether hyper-long telomeres have deleterious effects, we generated mice in which 100% of their cells are derived from hyper-long telomere ES cells. We observe that these mice have longer telomeres and less DNA damage with aging. Hyper-long telomere mice are lean and show low cholesterol and LDL levels, as well as improved glucose and insulin tolerance. Hyper-long telomere mice also have less incidence of\u00a0cancer and an increased longevity. These findings demonstrate that longer telomeres than normal in a given species are not deleterious but instead, show beneficial effects. ",
        "Inducing conformational preference of the membrane protein transporter EmrE through conservative mutations. Transporters from bacteria to humans contain inverted repeat domains thought to arise evolutionarily from the fusion of smaller membrane protein genes. Association between these domains forms the functional unit that enables transporters to adopt distinct conformations necessary for function. The small multidrug resistance (SMR) family provides an ideal system to explore the role of mutations in altering conformational preference since transporters from this family consist of antiparallel dimers that resemble the inverted repeats present in larger transporters. Here, we show using NMR spectroscopy how a single conservative mutation introduced into an SMR dimer is sufficient to change the resting conformation and function in bacteria. These results underscore the dynamic energy landscape for transporters and demonstrate how conservative mutations can influence structure and function. ",
        "Time for a change: patterns of sex expression, health and mortality in a sex-changing tree. BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The ability of individuals to change sex during their lifetime is known as environmental sex determination (ESD). This represents a unique life history trait, allowing plants to allocate resources differentially to male and female functions across lifetimes, potentially maximizing fitness in response to changing environmental or internal cues. In this study, Acer pensylvanicum, a species with an unconfirmed sex determination system, was investigated to see what patterns in sex expression existed across multiple years, if there were sex-based differences in growth and mortality, and whether this species conformed to theoretical predictions that females are larger and in better condition. METHODS: Patterns of sex expression were documented over 4 years in a phenotypically subdioecious A. pensylvanicum population located in New Jersey, USA, and data on size, mortality, health and growth were collected. A machine-learning algorithm known as a boosted classification tree was used to develop a model to predict the sex of a tree based on its condition, size and previous sex. RESULTS: In this study, 54 % of the trees switched sex expression during a 4-year period, with 26 % of those trees switching sex at least twice. Consistently monoecious trees could change relative sex expression by as much as 95 %. Both size and condition were influential in predicting sex, with condition exerting three times more relative influence than size on expressed sex. Contrary to theoretical predictions, the model showed that full female sex expression did not increase with size. Healthy trees were more likely to be male; predicted female sex expression increased with deteriorating health. Growth rate negatively correlated with multiple years of female sex expression. Populations maintained similar male-skewed sex ratios across years and locations and may result from differential mortality: 75 % of dead trees flowered female immediately before death. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows conclusively that A. pensylvanicum exhibits ESD and that femaleness correlates with decreased health, in contrast to prevailing theory. The mortality findings advance our understanding of puzzling non-equilibrium sex ratios and life history trade-offs resulting from male and female sex expression. ",
        "Efficient inter-species conjugative transfer of a CRISPR nuclease for targeted bacterial killing. The selective regulation of bacteria in complex microbial populations is key to controlling pathogenic bacteria. CRISPR nucleases can be programmed to kill bacteria, but require an efficient and broad-host range delivery system to be effective. Here, using an Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica co-culture system, we show that plasmids based on the IncP RK2 conjugative system can be used as delivery vectors for a TevSpCas9 dual nuclease. Notably, a cis-acting plasmid that encodes the conjugation and CRISPR machinery conjugates from E. coli to S. enterica with high frequency compared to a trans system that separates conjugation and CRISPR machinery. In culture conditions that enhance cell-to-cell contact, conjugation rates approach 100% with the cis-acting plasmid. Targeting of single or multiplexed sgRNAs to non-essential genes results in high S. enterica killing efficiencies. Our data highlight the potential of cis-acting conjugative plasmids as a delivery system for CRISPR nucleases or other microbial-altering agents for targeted bacterial killing. ",
        "Enriched environment exposure accelerates rodent driving skills. Although rarely used, long-term behavioral training protocols provide opportunities to shape complex skills in rodent laboratory investigations that incorporate cognitive, motor, visuospatial and temporal functions to achieve desired goals. In the current study, following preliminary research establishing that rats could be taught to drive a rodent operated vehicle (ROV) in a forward direction, as well as steer in more complex navigational patterns, male rats housed in an enriched environment were exposed to the rodent driving regime. Compared to standard-housed rats, enriched-housed rats demonstrated more robust learning in driving performance and their interest in the ROV persisted through extinction trials. Dehydroepiandrosterone/corticosterone (DHEA/CORT) metabolite ratios in fecal samples increased in accordance with training in all animals, suggesting that driving training, regardless of housing group, enhanced markers of emotional resilience. These results confirm the importance of enriched environments in preparing animals to engage in complex behavioral tasks. Further, behavioral models that include trained motor skills enable researchers to assess subtle alterations in motivation and behavioral response patterns that are relevant for translational research related to neurodegenerative disease and psychiatric illness.

        "Manipulating Solid Forms of Contact Insecticides for Infectious Disease Prevention. Malaria control is under threat by the development of vector resistance to pyrethroids in long-lasting insecticidal nets, which has prompted calls for a return to the notorious crystalline contact insecticide DDT. A faster acting difluoro congener, DFDT, was developed in Germany during World War II, but in 1945 Allied inspectors dismissed its superior performance and reduced toxicity to mammals. It vanished from public health considerations. Herein, we report the discovery of amorphous and crystalline forms of DFDT and a mono-fluorinated chiral congener, MFDT. These solid forms were evaluated against Drosophila as well as Anopheles and Aedes mosquitoes, the former identified as disease vectors for malaria and the latter for Zika, yellow fever, dengue, and chikungunya. Contact insecticides are transmitted to the insect when its feet contact the solid surface of the insecticide, resulting in absorption of the active agent. Crystalline DFDT and MFDT were much faster killers than DDT, and their amorphous forms were even faster. The speed of action (a.k.a. knockdown time), which is critical to mitigating vector resistance, depends inversely on the thermodynamic stability of the solid form. Furthermore, one enantiomer of the chiral MFDT exhibits faster knockdown speeds than the other, demonstrating chiral discrimination during the uptake of the insecticide or when binding at the sodium channel, the presumed destination of the neurotoxin. These observations demonstrate an unambiguous link between thermodynamic stability and knockdown time for important disease vectors, suggesting that manipulation of the solid-state chemistry of contact insecticides, demonstrated here for DFDT and MFDT, is a viable strategy for mitigating insect-borne diseases, with an accompanying benefit of reducing environmental impact.

        "A mechanistic examination of salting out in protein-polymer membrane interactions. Developing a mechanistic understanding of protein dynamics and conformational changes at polymer interfaces is critical for a range of processes including industrial protein separations. Salting out is one example of a procedure that is ubiquitous in protein separations yet is optimized empirically because there is no mechanistic description of the underlying interactions that would allow predictive modeling. Here, we investigate peak narrowing in a model transferrin-nylon system under salting out conditions using a combination of single-molecule tracking and ensemble separations. Distinct surface transport modes and protein conformational changes at the negatively charged nylon interface are quantified as a function of salt concentration. Single-molecule kinetics relate macroscale improvements in chromatographic peak broadening with microscale distributions of surface interaction mechanisms such as continuous-time random walks and simple adsorption-desorption. Monte Carlo simulations underpinned by the stochastic theory of chromatography are performed using kinetic data extracted from single-molecule observations. Simulations agree with experiment, revealing a decrease in peak broadening as the salt concentration increases. The results suggest that chemical modifications to membranes that decrease the probability of surface random walks could reduce peak broadening in full-scale protein separations. More broadly, this work represents a proof of concept for combining single-molecule experiments and a mechanistic theory to improve costly and time-consuming empirical methods of optimization. ",
        "Kids these days: Why the youth of today seem lacking. In five preregistered studies, we assess people's tendency to believe \"kids these days\" are deficient relative to those of previous generations. Across three traits, American adults (N=3,458; Mage = 33-51 years) believe today's youth are in decline; however, these perceptions are associated with people's standing on those traits. Authoritarian people especially think youth are less respectful of their elders, intelligent people especially think youth are less intelligent, well-read people especially think youth enjoy reading less. These beliefs are not predicted by irrelevant traits. Two mechanisms contribute to humanity's perennial tendency to denigrate kids: (1) a person-specific tendency to notice the limitations of others where one excels, (ii) a memory bias projecting one's current qualities onto the youth of the past. When observing current children, we compare our biased memory to the present and a decline appears. This may explain why the kids these days effect has been happening for millennia. ",
        "RNA ligands activate the Machupo virus polymerase and guide promoter usage. Segmented negative-sense (SNS) RNA viruses initiate infection by delivering into cells a suite of genomic RNA segments, each sheathed by the viral nucleocapsid protein and bound by the RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase (RdRP). For the orthomyxovirus influenza and the bunyavirus La Crosse, the 5' end of the genomic RNA binds as a hook-like structure proximal to the active site of the RdRP. Using an in vitro assay for the RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase (RdRP) of the arenavirus Machupo (MACV), we demonstrate that the 5' genomic and antigenomic RNAs of both small and large genome segments stimulate activity in a promoter-specific manner. Functional probing of the activating RNAs identifies intramolecular base-pairing between positions +1 and +7 and a pseudotemplated 5' terminal guanine residue as key for activation. Binding of structured 5' RNAs is a conserved feature of all SNS RNA virus polymerases, implying that promoter-specific RdRP activation extends beyond the arenaviruses. The 5' RNAs and the RNA binding pocket itself represent targets for therapeutic intervention. ",
        "Engineering Phage Host-Range and Suppressing Bacterial Resistance through Phage Tail Fiber Mutagenesis. The rapid emergence of antibiotic-resistant infections is prompting increased interest in phage-based antimicrobials. However, acquisition of resistance by bacteria is a major issue in the successful development of phage therapies. Through natural evolution and structural modeling, we identified host-range-determining regions (HRDRs) in the T3 phage tail fiber protein and developed a high-throughput strategy to genetically engineer these regions through site-directed mutagenesis. Inspired by antibody specificity engineering, this approach generates deep functional diversity while minimizing disruptions to the overall tail fiber structure, resulting in synthetic \"phagebodies.\" We showed that mutating HRDRs yields phagebodies with altered host-ranges, and select phagebodies enable long-term suppression of bacterial growth in\u00a0vitro, by preventing resistance appearance, and are functional in\u00a0vivo using a murine model. We anticipate that this approach may facilitate the creation of next-generation antimicrobials that slow resistance development and could be extended to other viral scaffolds for a broad range of applications.

        "Covariation of diet and gut microbiome in African megafauna. A major challenge in biology is to understand how phylogeny, diet, and environment shape the mammalian gut microbiome. Yet most studies of nonhuman microbiomes have relied on relatively coarse dietary categorizations and have focused either on individual wild populations or on captive animals that are sheltered from environmental pressures, which may obscure the effects of dietary and environmental variation on microbiome composition in diverse natural communities. We analyzed plant and bacterial DNA in fecal samples from an assemblage of 33 sympatric large-herbivore species (27 native, 6 domesticated) in a semiarid East African savanna, which enabled high-resolution assessment of seasonal variation in both diet and microbiome composition. Phylogenetic relatedness strongly predicted microbiome composition (r = 0.91) and was weakly but significantly correlated with diet composition (r = 0.20). Dietary diversity did not significantly predict microbiome diversity across species or within any species except kudu; however, diet composition was significantly correlated with microbiome composition both across and within most species. We found a spectrum of seasonal sensitivity at the diet-microbiome nexus: Seasonal changes in diet composition explained 25% of seasonal variation in microbiome composition across species. Species' positions on (and deviations from) this spectrum were not obviously driven by phylogeny, body size, digestive strategy, or diet composition; however, domesticated species tended to exhibit greater diet-microbiome turnover than wildlife. Our results reveal marked differences in the influence of environment on the degree of diet-microbiome covariation in free-ranging African megafauna, and this variation is not well explained by canonical predictors of nutritional ecology.

        "Capture of nitrogen dioxide and conversion to nitric acid in a porous metal-organic framework. Air pollution by nitrogen oxides, NOx, is a major problem, and new capture and abatement technologies are urgently required. Here, we report a metal-organic framework (Manchester Framework Material 520 (MFM-520)) that can efficiently confine dimers of NO2, which results in a high adsorption capacity of 4.2\u2009mmol\u2009g-1 (298\u2009K, 0.01\u2009bar) with full reversibility and no loss of capacity over 125 cycles. Treatment of NO2@MFM-520 with water in air leads to a quantitative conversion of the captured NO2 into HNO3, an important feedstock for fertilizer production, and fully regenerates MFM-520. The confinement of N2O4 inside nanopores was established at a molecular level, and the dynamic breakthrough experiments using both dry and humid NO2 gas streams verify the excellent stability and selectivity of MFM-520 and confirm its potential for precious-metal-free deNOx technologies.

        "Implementation of permeation rules leads to a FabI inhibitor with activity against Gram-negative pathogens. Gram-negative bacterial infections are a significant public health concern, and the lack of new drug classes for these pathogens is linked to the inability of most drug leads to accumulate inside Gram-negative bacteria1-7. Here, we report the development of a web application-eNTRyway-that predicts compound accumulation (in Escherichia coli) from its structure. In conjunction with structure-activity relationships and X-ray data, eNTRyway was utilized to re-design Debio-1452-a Gram-positive-only antibiotic8-into versions that accumulate in E. coli and possess antibacterial activity against high-priority Gram-negative pathogens. The lead compound Debio-1452-NH3 operates as an antibiotic via the same mechanism as Debio-1452, namely potent inhibition of the enoyl-acyl carrier protein reductase FabI, as validated by in vitro enzyme assays and the generation of bacterial isolates with spontaneous target mutations. Debio-1452-NH3 is well tolerated in vivo, reduces bacterial burden in mice and rescues mice from lethal infections with clinical isolates of Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella pneumoniae and E. coli. This work provides tools for the facile discovery and development of high-accumulating compounds in E. coli, and a general blueprint for the conversion of Gram-positive-only compounds into broad-spectrum antibiotics.

        "Geometrical reorganization of Dectin-1 and TLR2 on single phagosomes alters their synergistic immune signaling. Receptors of innate immune cells function synergistically to detect pathogens and elicit appropriate immune responses. Many receptor pairs also appear \"colocalized\" on the membranes of phagosomes, the intracellular compartments for pathogen ingestion. However, the nature of the seemingly receptor colocalization and the role it plays in immune regulation are unclear, due to the inaccessibility of intracellular phagocytic receptors. Here, we report a geometric manipulation technique to directly probe the role of phagocytic receptor \"colocalization\" in innate immune regulation. Using particles with spatially patterned ligands as phagocytic targets, we can decouple the receptor pair, Dectin-1 and Toll-like receptor (TLR)2, to opposite sides on a single phagosome or bring them into nanoscale proximity without changing the overall membrane composition. We show that Dectin-1 enhances immune responses triggered predominantly by TLR2 when their centroid-to-centroid proximity is <500 nm, but this signaling synergy diminishes upon receptor segregation beyond this threshold distance. Our results demonstrate that nanoscale proximity, not necessarily colocalization, between Dectin-1 and TLR2 is required for their synergistic regulation of macrophage immune responses. This study elucidates the relationship between the spatial organization of phagocytic receptors and innate immune responses. It showcases a technique that allows spatial manipulation of receptors and their signal cross-talk on phagosomes inside living cells. ",
        "Live fast, die young: Accelerated growth, mortality, and turnover in street trees. Municipalities are embracing greening initiatives as a key strategy for improving urban sustainability and combatting the environmental impacts of expansive urbanization. Many greening initiatives include goals to increase urban canopy cover through tree planting, however, our understanding of street tree ecosystem dynamics is limited and our understanding of vegetation structure and function based on intact, rural forests does not apply well to urban ecosystems. In this study, we estimate size-specific growth, mortality, and planting rates in trees under municipal control, use a box model to forecast short-term changes in street tree aboveground carbon pools under several planting and management scenarios, and compare our findings to rural, forested systems. We find accelerated rates of carbon cycling in street trees with mean diameter growth rates nearly four times faster in Boston, MA, USA (0.78 \u00b1 0.02 cm yr-1) than in rural forest stands of MA (0.21 \u00b1 0.02 cm yr-1) and mean mortality rates more than double rural forested rates (3.06 \u00b1 0.25% yr-1 in street trees; 1.41 \u00b1 0.04% yr-1 in rural trees). Despite the enhanced growth of urban trees, high mortality losses result in a net loss of street tree carbon storage over time (-0.15 \u00b1 0.09 Mg C ha-1 yr-1). Planting initiatives alone may not be sufficient to maintain or enhance canopy cover and biomass due to the unique demographics of urban ecosystems. Initiatives to aid in the establishment and preservation of tree health are central for increasing street tree canopy cover and maintaining/increasing carbon storage in vegetation. Strategic combinations of planting and maintenance will maximize the viability of greening initiatives as an effective climate mitigation tool. ",
        "Generation of stable heading representations in diverse visual scenes. Many animals rely on an internal heading representation when navigating in varied environments1-10. How this representation is linked to the sensory cues that define different surroundings is unclear. In the fly brain, heading is represented by 'compass' neurons that innervate a ring-shaped structure known as the ellipsoid body3,11,12. Each compass neuron receives inputs from 'ring' neurons that are selective for particular visual features13-16; this combination provides an ideal substrate for the extraction of directional information from a visual scene. Here we combine two-photon calcium imaging and optogenetics in tethered flying flies with circuit modelling, and show how the correlated activity of compass and visual neurons drives plasticity17-22, which flexibly transforms two-dimensional visual cues into a stable heading representation. We also describe how this plasticity enables the fly to convert a partial heading representation, established from orienting within part of a novel setting, into a complete heading representation. Our results provide mechanistic insight into the memory-related computations that are essential for flexible navigation in varied surroundings. Sensorimotor experience remaps visual input to a heading-direction network. In the Drosophila brain, 'compass' neurons track the orientation of the body and head (the fly's heading)\u00a0during navigation\u00a01,2. In the absence of visual cues, the compass neuron network estimates heading by integrating self-movement signals over time3,4. When a visual cue is present, the estimate of the network is more accurate1,3. Visual inputs to compass neurons are thought to originate from inhibitory neurons called R neurons (also known as ring neurons); the receptive fields of R neurons tile visual space5. The axon of each R neuron overlaps with the dendrites of every compass neuron6, raising the question of how visual cues are integrated into the compass. Here, using in vivo whole-cell recordings, we show that a visual cue can evoke synaptic inhibition in compass neurons and that R neurons mediate this inhibition. Each compass neuron is inhibited only by specific visual cue positions, indicating that many potential connections from R neurons onto compass neurons are actually weak or silent. We also show that the pattern of visually evoked inhibition can reorganize over minutes as the fly explores an altered virtual-reality environment. Using ensemble calcium imaging, we demonstrate that this reorganization causes persistent changes in the compass coordinate frame. Taken together, our data suggest a model in which correlated pre- and postsynaptic activity triggers associative long-term synaptic depression of visually evoked inhibition in compass neurons. Our findings provide evidence for the theoretical proposal that associative plasticity of sensory inputs, when combined with attractor dynamics, can reconcile self-movement information with changing external cues to generate a coherent sense of direction7-12.

        "Nanoparticles promote in vivo breast cancer cell intravasation and extravasation by inducing endothelial leakiness. While most cancer nanomedicine is designed to eliminate cancer, the nanomaterial per se can lead to the formation of micrometre-sized gaps in the blood vessel endothelial walls. Nanomaterials-induced endothelial leakiness (NanoEL) might favour intravasation of surviving cancer cells into the surrounding vasculature and subsequently extravasation, accelerating metastasis. Here, we show that nanoparticles induce endothelial leakiness through disruption of the VE-cadherin-VE-cadherin homophilic interactions at the adherens junction. We show that intravenously injected titanium dioxide, silica and gold nanoparticles significantly accelerate both intravasation and extravasation of breast cancer cells in animal models, increasing the extent of existing metastasis and promoting the appearance of new metastatic sites. Our results add to the understanding of the behaviour of nanoparticles in complex biological systems. The potential for NanoEL needs to be taken into consideration when designing future nanomedicines, especially nanomedicine to treat cancer. ",
        "The intestinal regionalization of acute norovirus infection is regulated by the microbiota via bile acid-mediated priming of type III interferon. Evidence has accumulated to demonstrate that the intestinal microbiota enhances mammalian enteric virus infections1. For example, we and others previously reported that commensal bacteria stimulate acute and persistent murine norovirus infections2-4. However, in apparent contradiction of these results, the virulence of murine norovirus infection was unaffected by antibiotic treatment. This prompted us to perform a detailed investigation of murine norovirus infection in microbially deplete mice, revealing a more complex picture in which commensal bacteria inhibit viral infection of the proximal small intestine while simultaneously stimulating the infection of distal regions of the gut. Thus, commensal bacteria can regulate viral regionalization along the intestinal tract. We further show that the mechanism underlying bacteria-dependent inhibition of norovirus infection in the proximal gut involves bile acid priming of type III interferon. Finally, the regional effects of the microbiota on norovirus infection may result from distinct regional expression profiles of key bile acid receptors that regulate the type III interferon response. Overall, these findings reveal that the biotransformation of host metabolites by the intestinal microbiota directly and regionally impacts infection by a pathogenic enteric virus. ",
        "Mechanism of Filamentation-Induced Allosteric Activation of the SgrAI Endonuclease. Filament formation by enzymes is increasingly recognized as an important phenomenon with potentially unique regulatory properties and biological roles. SgrAI is an allosterically regulated type II restriction endonuclease that forms filaments with enhanced DNA cleavage activity and altered sequence specificity. Here, we present the cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of the filament of SgrAI in its activated configuration. The structural data illuminate the mechanistic origin of hyperaccelerated DNA cleavage activity and suggests how indirect DNA sequence readout within filamentous SgrAI may enable recognition of substantially more nucleotide sequences than its low-activity form, thereby altering and partially relaxing its DNA sequence specificity. Together, substrate DNA binding, indirect readout, and filamentation simultaneously enhance SgrAI's catalytic activity and modulate substrate preference. This unusual enzyme mechanism may have evolved to perform the specialized functions of bacterial innate immunity in rapid defense against invading phage DNA without causing damage to the host DNA. ",
        "Host resistance factor SLC11A1 restricts Salmonella growth through magnesium deprivation. The pleiotropic host resistance factor SLC11A1 (NRAMP1) defends against diverse intracellular pathogens in mammals by yet-unknown mechanisms. We compared Salmonella infection of coisogenic mice with different SLC11A1 alleles. SLC11A1 reduced Salmonella replication and triggered up-regulation of uptake systems for divalent metal cations but no other stress responses. SLC11A1 modestly diminished iron availability and acutely restricted Salmonella access to magnesium. Growth of Salmonella cells in the presence of SLC11A1 was highly heterogeneous and inversely correlated with expression of the crucial magnesium transporter gene mgtB We observed superimposable single-cell patterns in mice lacking SLC11A1 when we restricted Salmonella access to magnesium by impairing its uptake. Together, these findings identify deprivation of the main group metal magnesium as the main resistance mechanism of SLC11A1 against Salmonella. ",
        "Massively-Parallelized, Deterministic Mechanoporation for Intracellular Delivery. Microfluidic intracellular delivery approaches based on plasma membrane poration have shown promise for addressing the limitations of conventional cellular engineering techniques in a wide range of applications in biology and medicine. However, the inherent stochasticity of the poration process in many of these approaches often results in a trade-off between delivery efficiency and cellular viability, thus potentially limiting their utility. Herein, we present a novel microfluidic device concept that mitigates this trade-off by providing opportunity for deterministic mechanoporation (DMP) of cells en masse. This is achieved by the impingement of each cell upon a single needle-like penetrator during aspiration-based capture, followed by diffusive influx of exogenous cargo through the resulting membrane pore, once the cells are released by reversal of flow. Massive parallelization enables high throughput operation, while single-site poration allows for delivery of small and large-molecule cargos in difficult-to-transfect cells with efficiencies and viabilities that exceed both conventional and emerging transfection techniques. As such, DMP shows promise for advancing cellular engineering practice in general and engineered cell product manufacturing in particular. ",
        "A Simulated Microgravity Environment Causes a Sustained Defect in Epithelial Barrier Function. Intestinal epithelial cell (IEC) junctions constitute a robust barrier to invasion by viruses, bacteria and exposure to ingested agents. Previous studies showed that microgravity compromises the human immune system and increases enteropathogen virulence. However, the effects of microgravity on epithelial barrier function are poorly understood. The aims of this study were to identify if simulated microgravity alters intestinal epithelial barrier function (permeability), and susceptibility to barrier-disrupting agents. IECs (HT-29.cl19a) were cultured on microcarrier beads in simulated microgravity using a rotating wall vessel (RWV) for 18 days prior to seeding on semipermeable supports to measure ion flux (transepithelial electrical resistance (TER)) and FITC-dextran (FD4) permeability over 14 days. RWV cells showed delayed apical junction localization of the tight junction proteins, occludin and ZO-1. The alcohol metabolite, acetaldehyde, significantly decreased TER and reduced junctional ZO-1 localization, while increasing FD4 permeability in RWV cells compared with static, motion and flask control cells. In conclusion, simulated microgravity induced an underlying and sustained susceptibility to epithelial barrier disruption upon removal from the microgravity environment. This has implications for gastrointestinal homeostasis of astronauts in space, as well as their capability to withstand the effects of agents that compromise intestinal epithelial barrier function following return to Earth.

        "Interferon-\u03b2-induced miR-1 alleviates toxic protein accumulation by controlling autophagy. Appropriate regulation of autophagy is crucial for clearing toxic proteins from cells. Defective autophagy results in accumulation of toxic protein aggregates that detrimentally affect cellular function and organismal survival. Here, we report that the microRNA miR-1 regulates the autophagy pathway through conserved targeting of the orthologous Tre-2/Bub2/CDC16 (TBC) Rab GTPase-activating proteins TBC-7 and TBC1D15 in Caenorhabditis elegans and mammalian cells, respectively. Loss of miR-1 causes TBC-7/TBC1D15 overexpression, leading to a block on autophagy. Further, we found that the cytokine interferon-\u03b2 (IFN-\u03b2) can induce miR-1 expression in mammalian cells, reducing TBC1D15 levels, and safeguarding against proteotoxic challenges. Therefore, this work provides a potential therapeutic strategy for protein aggregation disorders. ",
        "In Vivo Sequestration of Innate Small Molecules to Promote Bone Healing. Approaches that enable innate repair mechanisms hold great potential for tissue repair. Herein, biomaterial-assisted sequestration of small molecules is described to localize pro-regenerative signaling at the injury site. Specifically, a synthetic biomaterial containing boronate molecules is designed to sequester adenosine, a small molecule ubiquitously present in the human body. The biomaterial-assisted sequestration of adenosine leverages the transient surge of extracellular adenosine following injury to prolong local adenosine signaling. It is demonstrated that implantation of the biomaterial patch following injury establishes an in situ stockpile of adenosine, resulting in accelerated healing by promoting both osteoblastogenesis and angiogenesis. The adenosine content within the patch recedes to the physiological level as the tissue regenerates. In addition to sequestering endogenous adenosine, the biomaterial is also able to deliver exogenous adenosine to the site of injury, offering a versatile solution to utilizing adenosine as a potential therapeutic for tissue repair.

        "Human sperm displays rapid responses to diet. The global rise in obesity and steady decline in sperm quality are two alarming trends that have emerged during recent decades. In parallel, evidence from model organisms shows that paternal diet can affect offspring metabolic health in a process involving sperm tRNA-derived small RNA (tsRNA). Here, we report that human sperm are acutely sensitive to nutrient flux, both in terms of sperm motility and changes in sperm tsRNA. Over the course of a 2-week diet intervention, in which we first introduced a healthy diet followed by a diet rich in sugar, sperm motility increased and stabilized at high levels. Small RNA-seq on repeatedly sampled sperm from the same individuals revealed that tsRNAs were up-regulated by eating a high-sugar diet for just 1 week. Unsupervised clustering identified two independent pathways for the biogenesis of these tsRNAs: one involving a novel class of fragments with specific cleavage in the T-loop of mature nuclear tRNAs and the other exclusively involving mitochondrial tsRNAs. Mitochondrial involvement was further supported by a similar up-regulation of mitochondrial rRNA-derived small RNA (rsRNA). Notably, the changes in sugar-sensitive tsRNA were positively associated with simultaneous changes in sperm motility and negatively associated with obesity in an independent clinical cohort. This rapid response to a dietary intervention on tsRNA in human sperm is attuned with the paternal intergenerational metabolic responses found in model organisms. More importantly, our findings suggest shared diet-sensitive mechanisms between sperm motility and the biogenesis of tsRNA, which provide novel insights about the interplay between nutrition and male reproductive health.

        "Electrical recognition of the twenty proteinogenic amino acids using an aerolysin nanopore. Efforts to sequence single protein molecules in nanopores1-5 have been hampered by the lack of techniques with sufficient sensitivity to discern the subtle molecular differences among all twenty amino acids. Here we report ionic current detection of all twenty proteinogenic amino acids in an aerolysin nanopore with the help of a short polycationic carrier. Application of molecular dynamics simulations revealed that the aerolysin nanopore has a built-in single-molecule trap that fully confines a polycationic carrier-bound amino acid inside the sensing region of the aerolysin. This structural feature means that each amino acid spends sufficient time in the pore for sensitive measurement of the excluded volume of the amino acid. We show that distinct current blockades in wild-type aerolysin can be used to identify 13 of the 20 natural amino acids. Furthermore, we show that chemical modifications, instrumentation advances and nanopore engineering offer a route toward identification of the remaining seven amino acids. These findings may pave the way to nanopore protein sequencing. ",
        "Postreproductive killer whale grandmothers improve the survival of their grandoffspring. Understanding why females of some mammalian species cease ovulation prior to the end of life is a long-standing interdisciplinary and evolutionary challenge. In humans and some species of toothed whales, females can live for decades after stopping reproduction. This unusual life history trait is thought to have evolved, in part, due to the inclusive fitness benefits that postreproductive females gain by helping kin. In humans, grandmothers gain inclusive fitness benefits by increasing their number of surviving grandoffspring, referred to as the grandmother effect. Among toothed whales, the grandmother effect has not been rigorously tested. Here, we test for the grandmother effect in killer whales, by quantifying grandoffspring survival with living or recently deceased reproductive and postreproductive grandmothers, and show that postreproductive grandmothers provide significant survival benefits to their grandoffspring above that provided by reproductive grandmothers. This provides evidence of the grandmother effect in a nonhuman menopausal species. By stopping reproduction, grandmothers avoid reproductive conflict with their daughters, and offer increased benefits to their grandoffspring. The benefits postreproductive grandmothers provide to their grandoffspring are shown to be most important in difficult times where the salmon abundance is low to moderate. The postreproductive grandmother effect we report, together with the known costs of late-life reproduction in killer whales, can help explain the long postreproductive life spans of resident killer whales.

        "Fate of Hexabromocyclododecane (HBCD), A Common Flame Retardant, In Polystyrene-Degrading Mealworms: Elevated HBCD Levels in Egested Polymer but No Bioaccumulation. As awareness of the ubiquity and magnitude of plastic pollution has increased, so has interest in the long term fate of plastics. To date, however, the fate of potentially toxic plastic additives has received comparatively little attention. In this study, we investigated the fate of the flame retardant hexabromocyclododecane (HBCD) in polystyrene (PS)-degrading mealworms and in mealworm-fed shrimp. Most of the commercial HBCD consumed by the mealworms was egested in frass within 24 h (1-log removal) with nearly a 3-log removal after 48 h. In mealworms fed PS containing high HBCD levels, only 0.27 \u00b1 0.10%, of the ingested HBCD remained in the mealworm body tissue. This value did not increase over the course of the experiment, indicating little or no bioaccumulation. Additionally, no evidence of higher trophic level bioaccumulation or toxicity was observed when L. vannamei (Pacific whiteleg shrimp) were fed mealworm biomass grown with PS containing HBCD. Differences in shrimp survival were attributable to the fraction of mealworm biomass incorporated into the diet, not HBCD. We conclude that the environmental effects of PS ingestion need further evaluation as the generation of smaller, more contaminated particles is possible, and may contribute to toxicity at nanoscale.

        "A sensory appendage protein protects malaria vectors from pyrethroids. Pyrethroid-impregnated bed nets have driven considerable reductions in malaria-associated morbidity and mortality in Africa since the beginning of the century1. The intense selection pressure exerted by bed nets has precipitated widespread and escalating resistance to pyrethroids in African Anopheles populations, threatening to reverse the gains that been made by malaria control2. Here we show that expression of a sensory appendage protein (SAP2), which is enriched in the legs, confers pyrethroid resistance to Anopheles gambiae. Expression of SAP2 is increased in insecticide-resistant populations and is further induced after the mosquito comes into contact with pyrethroids. SAP2 silencing fully restores mortality of the mosquitoes, whereas SAP2 overexpression results in increased resistance, probably owing to high-affinity binding of SAP2 to pyrethroid insecticides. Mining of genome sequence data reveals a selective sweep near the SAP2 locus in the mosquito populations of three West African countries (Cameroon, Guinea and Burkina Faso) with the observed increase in haplotype-associated single-nucleotide polymorphisms mirroring the increasing resistance of mosquitoes to pyrethroids reported in Burkina Faso. Our study identifies a previously undescribed mechanism of insecticide resistance that is likely to be highly relevant to malaria control efforts. ",
        "1,4-Benzoquinone antimicrobial agents against Staphylococcus aureus and Mycobacterium tuberculosis derived from scorpion venom. Two 1,4-benzoquinone derivatives, found in the venom of the scorpion Diplocentrus melici following exposure to air, have been isolated, characterized, synthesized, and assessed for antimicrobial activities. Initially a white, viscous liquid, the extracted venom colors within minutes under ambient conditions. From this colored mixture, two compounds, one red, the other blue, were isolated and purified using chromatography. After a variety of NMR and mass spectrometry experiments, the red compound was determined to be 3,5- dimethoxy-2-(methylthio)cyclohexa-2,5-diene-1,4-dione, and the blue compound was determined to be 5-methoxy-2,3- bis(methylthio)cyclohexa-2,5-diene-1,4-dione. Because extremely small amounts of these compounds were isolated from the scorpion venom, we developed laboratory syntheses from commercially available precursors, allowing us to produce sufficient quantities for crystallization and biological assays. The red benzoquinone is effective against Staphylococcus aureus [minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) = 4 \u00b5g/mL], while the blue benzoquinone is active against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MIC = 4 \u00b5g/mL) and even against a multidrug-resistant (MDR) strain with nearly equal effectiveness. The bactericidal effects of both benzoquinones show comparable activity to commercially available antibiotics used against these pathogens and were cytotoxic to neoplastic cell lines, suggesting their potential as lead compounds for the development of novel antimicrobial and anticancer drugs. Importantly, the blue benzoquinone was also effective in vivo with mouse models of MDR tuberculosis infection. After treatment for 2 mo, four mice with late-stage active MDR tuberculosis had a significant decrease in pulmonary bacillary loads and tissue damage. Healthy mice served as negative controls and tolerated treatment well, without adverse side effects. ",
        "Assessing the sustainability of post-Green Revolution cereals in India. Sustainable food systems aim to provide sufficient and nutritious food, while maximizing climate resilience and minimizing resource demands as well as negative environmental impacts. Historical practices, notably the Green Revolution, prioritized the single objective to maximize production over other nutritional and environmental dimensions. We quantitatively assess outcomes of alternative production decisions across multiple objectives using India's rice-dominated monsoon cereal production as an example. We perform a series of optimizations to maximize nutrient production (i.e., protein and iron), minimize greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and resource use (i.e., water and energy), or maximize resilience to climate extremes. We find that increasing the area under coarse cereals (i.e., millets, sorghum) improves nutritional supply (on average, +1% to +5% protein and +5% to +49% iron), increases climate resilience (1% to 13% fewer calories lost during an extreme dry year), and reduces GHGs (-2% to -13%) and demand for irrigation water (-3% to -21%) and energy (-2% to -12%) while maintaining calorie production and cropped area. The extent of these benefits partly depends on the feasibility of switching cropped area from rice to coarse cereals. Based on current production practices in 2 states, supporting these cobenefits could require greater manure and draft power but similar or less labor, fertilizer, and machinery. National- and state-level strategies considering multiple objectives in decisions about cereal production can move beyond many shortcomings of the Green Revolution while reinforcing the benefits. This ability to realistically incorporate multiple dimensions into intervention planning and implementation is the crux of sustainable food production systems worldwide. ",
        "Predator-informed looming stimulus experiments reveal how large filter feeding whales capture highly maneuverable forage fish. The unique engulfment filtration strategy of microphagous rorqual whales has evolved relatively recently (<5 Ma) and exploits extreme predator/prey size ratios to overcome the maneuverability advantages of swarms of small prey, such as krill. Forage fish, in contrast, have been engaged in evolutionary arms races with their predators for more than 100 million years and have performance capabilities that suggest they should easily evade whale-sized predators, yet they are regularly hunted by some species of rorqual whales. To explore this phenomenon, we determined, in a laboratory setting, when individual anchovies initiated escape from virtually approaching whales, then used these results along with in situ humpback whale attack data to model how predator speed and engulfment timing affected capture rates. Anchovies were found to respond to approaching visual looming stimuli at expansion rates that give ample chance to escape from a sea lion-sized predator, but humpback whales could capture as much as 30-60% of a school at once because the increase in their apparent (visual) size does not cross their prey's response threshold until after rapid jaw expansion. Humpback whales are, thus, incentivized to delay engulfment until they are very close to a prey school, even if this results in higher hydrodynamic drag. This potential exaptation of a microphagous filter feeding strategy for fish foraging enables humpback whales to achieve 7\u00d7 the energetic efficiency (per lunge) of krill foraging, allowing for flexible foraging strategies that may underlie their ecological success in fluctuating oceanic conditions.

        "Translational Regulation of Non-autonomous Mitochondrial Stress Response Promotes Longevity. Reduced mRNA translation delays aging, but the underlying mechanisms remain underexplored. Mutations in both DAF-2 (IGF-1 receptor) and RSKS-1 (ribosomal S6 kinase/S6K) cause synergistic lifespan extension in C.\u00a0elegans. To understand the roles of translational regulation in this process, we performed polysomal profiling and identified translationally regulated ribosomal and cytochrome c (CYC-2.1) genes as key mediators of longevity. cyc-2.1 knockdown significantly extends lifespan by activating the intestinal mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPRmt), mitochondrial fission, and AMP-activated kinase (AMPK). The germline serves as the key tissue for cyc-2.1 to regulate lifespan, and germline-specific cyc-2.1 knockdown non-autonomously activates intestinal UPRmt and AMPK. Furthermore, the RNA-binding protein GLD-1-mediated translational repression of cyc-2.1 in the germline is important for the non-autonomous activation of UPRmt and synergistic longevity of the daf-2 rsks-1 mutant. Altogether, these results illustrate a translationally regulated non-autonomous mitochondrial stress response mechanism in the modulation of lifespan by insulin-like signaling and S6K. ",

The progress in nanomedicine (NM) using nanoparticles (NPs) is mainly based on drug carriers for the delivery of classical chemotherapeutics.

A homologous series of engineered CuO NPs was designed for dual purposes (carrier and drug) with a direct chemical composition-biological functionality relationship. Model-based dissolution kinetics of CuO NPs in the cellular interior at post-exposure conditions were controlled through Fe-doping for intra/extra cellular Cu2+ and biological outcome. Through controlled ion release and reactions taking place in the cellular interior, tumors could be treated selectively, in\u2005vitro and in\u2005vivo.

        "Dopamine Signaling in the Suprachiasmatic Nucleus Enables Weight Gain Associated with Hedonic Feeding. The widespread availability of energy-dense, rewarding foods is correlated with the increased incidence of obesity across the globe. Overeating during mealtimes and unscheduled snacking disrupts timed metabolic processes, which further contribute to weight gain. The neuronal mechanism by which the consumption of energy-dense food restructures the timing of feeding is poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that dopaminergic signaling within the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), the central circadian pacemaker, disrupts the timing of feeding, resulting in overconsumption of food. D1 dopamine receptor (Drd1)-null mice are resistant to diet-induced obesity, metabolic disease, and circadian disruption associated with energy-dense diets. Conversely, genetic rescue of Drd1 expression within the SCN restores diet-induced overconsumption, weight gain, and obesogenic symptoms. Access to rewarding food increases SCN dopamine turnover, and elevated Drd1-signaling decreases SCN neuronal activity, which we posit disinhibits downstream orexigenic responses. These findings define a connection between the reward and circadian pathways in the regulation of pathological calorie consumption. ",
        "Vitamin lipid nanoparticles enable adoptive macrophage transfer for the treatment of multidrug-resistant bacterial sepsis. Sepsis, a condition caused by severe infections, affects more than 30 million people worldwide every year and remains the leading cause of death in hospitals1,2. Moreover, antimicrobial resistance has become an additional challenge in the treatment of sepsis3, and thus, alternative therapeutic approaches are urgently needed2,3. Here, we show that adoptive transfer of macrophages containing antimicrobial peptides linked to cathepsin B in the lysosomes (MACs) can be applied for the treatment of multidrug-resistant bacteria-induced sepsis in mice with immunosuppression. The MACs are constructed by transfection of vitamin C lipid nanoparticles that deliver antimicrobial peptide and cathepsin B (AMP-CatB) mRNA. The vitamin C lipid nanoparticles allow the specific accumulation of AMP-CatB in macrophage lysosomes, which is the key location for bactericidal activities. Our results demonstrate that adoptive MAC transfer leads to the elimination of multidrug-resistant bacteria, including Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli, leading to the complete recovery of immunocompromised septic mice. Our work provides an alternative strategy for overcoming multidrug-resistant bacteria-induced sepsis and opens up possibilities for the development of nanoparticle-enabled cell therapy for infectious diseases.

        "Microfluidic smartphone quantitation of Escherichia coli in synthetic urine. In spite of the clinical need, there is a major gap in rapid diagnostics for identification and quantitation of E. coli and other pathogens, also regarded as the biggest bottleneck in the fight against the spread of antimicrobial resistant bacterial strains. This study reports for the first time an optical, smartphone-based microfluidic fluorescence sandwich immunoassay capable of quantifying E. coli in buffer and synthetic urine in less than 25\u202fmin without sample preparation nor concentration. A limit of detection (LoD) up to 240\u202fCFU/mL, comensurate with cut-off for UTIs (103-105\u202fCFUs/mL) was achieved. Replicas of full response curves performed with 100-107\u202fCFUs/mL of E. coli K12 in synthetic urine yielded recovery values in the range 80-120%, assay reproducibility below 30% and precision below 20%, therefore similar to high-performance automated immunoassays. The unrivalled LoD was mainly linked to the 'open fluidics' nature of the 10-bore microfluidic strips used that enabled passing a large volume of sample through the microcapillaries coated with capture antibody. The new smartphone based test has the potential of being as a rapid, point-of-care test for rule-in of E. coli infections that are responsible for around 80% of UTIs, helping to stop the over-prescription of antibiotics and the monitoring of patients with other symptomatic communicable diseases caused by E. coli at global scale.

        "Nucleus-Targeted Organoiridium-Albumin Conjugate for Photodynamic Cancer Therapy. An organoiridium-albumin bioconjugate (Ir1-HSA) was synthesized by reaction of a pendant maleimide ligand with human serum albumin.

The long phosphorescence lifetime and high 1 O2 quantum yield of Ir1-HSA are highly favorable properties for photodynamic therapy. Ir1-HSA mainly accumulated in the nucleus of living cancer cells and showed remarkable photocytotoxicity against a range of cancer cell lines and tumor spheroids (light IC50 ; 0.8-5\u2005\u03bcm, photo-cytotoxicity index PI=40-60), while remaining non-toxic to normal cells and normal cell spheroids, even after photo-irradiation.

        "The Widely Used Antimicrobial Triclosan Induces High Levels of Antibiotic Tolerance In Vitro and Reduces Antibiotic Efficacy up to 100-Fold In Vivo. The antimicrobial triclosan is used in a wide range of consumer products ranging from toothpaste, cleansers, socks, and baby toys. A bacteriostatic inhibitor of fatty acid synthesis, triclosan is extremely stable and accumulates in the environment. Approximately 75% of adults in the United States have detectable levels of the compound in their urine, with a sizeable fraction of individuals (>10%) having urine concentrations equal to or greater than the minimal inhibitory concentration for Escherichia coli and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Previous work has identified connections between defects in fatty acid synthesis and accumulation of the alarmone guanosine tetraphosphate (ppGpp), which has been repeatedly associated with antibiotic tolerance and persistence. Based on these data, we hypothesized that triclosan exposure may inadvertently drive bacteria into a state in which they are able to tolerate normally lethal concentrations of antibiotics. Here we report that clinically relevant concentrations of triclosan increased E. coli and MRSA tolerance to bactericidal antibiotics as much as 10,000-fold in vitro and reduced antibiotic efficacy up to 100-fold in a mouse urinary tract infection model. Genetic analysis indicated that triclosan-mediated antibiotic tolerance requires ppGpp synthesis but is independent of growth. These data highlight an unexpected and certainly unintended consequence of adding high concentrations of antimicrobials in consumer products, supporting an urgent need to reevaluate the costs and benefits of the prophylactic use of triclosan and other bacteriostatic compounds.

        "Mobile platform for rapid sub-picogram-per-milliliter, multiplexed, digital droplet detection of proteins. Digital droplet assays-in which biological samples are compartmentalized into millions of femtoliter-volume droplets and interrogated individually-have generated enormous enthusiasm for their ability to detect biomarkers with single-molecule sensitivity. These assays have untapped potential for point-of-care diagnostics but are currently mainly confined to laboratory settings, due to the instrumentation necessary to serially generate, control, and measure tens of millions of droplets/compartments. To address this challenge, we developed an optofluidic platform that miniaturizes digital assays into a mobile format by parallelizing their operation. This technology is based on three key innovations: (i) the integration and parallel operation of a hundred droplet generators onto a single chip that operates >100\u00d7 faster than a single droplet generator, (ii) the fluorescence detection of droplets at >100\u00d7 faster than conventional in-flow detection using time domain-encoded mobile phone imaging, and (iii) the integration of on-chip delay lines and sample processing to allow serum-to-answer device operation. To demonstrate the power of this approach, we performed a duplex digital ELISA. We characterized the performance of this assay by first using spiked recombinant proteins in a complex media (FBS) and measured a limit of detection, 0.004 pg/mL (300 aM), a 1,000\u00d7 improvement over standard ELISA and matching that of the existing laboratory-based gold standard digital ELISA system. We additionally measured endogenous GM-CSF and IL6 in human serum from n = 14 human subjects using our mobile duplex assay, and showed excellent agreement with the gold standard system ([Formula: see text]).

        "Role of forest regrowth in global carbon sink dynamics. Although the existence of a large carbon sink in terrestrial ecosystems is well-established, the drivers of this sink remain uncertain. It has been suggested that perturbations to forest demography caused by past land-use change, management, and natural disturbances may be causing a large component of current carbon uptake. Here we use a global compilation of forest age observations, combined with a terrestrial biosphere model with explicit modeling of forest regrowth, to partition the global forest carbon sink between old-growth and regrowth stands over the period 1981-2010. For 2001-2010 we find a carbon sink of 0.85 (0.66-0.96) Pg year-1 located in intact old-growth forest, primarily in the moist tropics and boreal Siberia, and 1.30 (1.03-1.96) Pg year-1 located in stands regrowing after past disturbance. Approaching half of the sink in regrowth stands would have occurred from demographic changes alone, in the absence of other environmental changes. These age-constrained results show consistency with those simulated using an ensemble of demographically-enabled terrestrial biosphere models following an independent reconstruction of historical land use and management. We estimate that forests will accumulate an additional 69 (44-131) Pg C in live biomass from changes in demography alone if natural disturbances, wood harvest, and reforestation continue at rates comparable to those during 1981-2010. Our results confirm that it is not possible to understand the current global terrestrial carbon sink without accounting for the sizeable sink due to forest demography. They also imply that a large portion of the current terrestrial carbon sink is strictly transient in nature. ",
        "Evaluating Antibiotic Resistance Gene Correlations with Antibiotic Exposure Conditions in Anaerobic Membrane Bioreactors. Anaerobic membrane bioreactors (AnMBRs) are an emerging technology with potential to improve energy efficiency and effluent reuse in mainstream wastewater treatment. However, their contribution to the proliferation of contaminants of emerging concern, such as antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), remains largely unknown. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of select influent antibiotics at varying concentrations on the presence and abundance of ARGs in an AnMBR system and its effluent. Quantification of targeted ARGs revealed distinct profiles in biomass and effluent, with genes conferring resistance to different antibiotic classes dominating in biomass (macrolides) and effluent (sulfonamides). Effluent sul1 gene abundance was strongly correlated with abundance of intl1, signifying the potential importance of mobile genetic elements in ARG release from AnMBR systems. The addition of specific antibiotics also affected normalized abundances of their related ARGs, exemplifying the potential impact of selective pressures at both low (10 \u03bcg/L) and high (250 \u03bcg/L) influent antibiotic concentrations.

        "Microbial communities in hummingbird feeders are distinct from floral nectar and influenced by bird visitation. Human provisioning can shape resource availability for wildlife, but consequences for microbiota availability and exchange remain relatively unexplored. Here, we characterized microbial communities on bills and faecal material of hummingbirds and their food resources, including feeders and floral nectar. We experimentally manipulated bird visitation to feeders and examined effects on sucrose solution microbial communities. Birds, feeders and flowers hosted distinct bacterial and fungal communities. Proteobacteria comprised over 80% of nectar bacteria but feeder solutions contained a high relative abundance of Proteobacteria, Firmicutes and Actinobacteria. Hummingbirds hosted bacterial taxa commonly found in other birds and novel genera including Zymobacter [Proteobacteria] and Ascomycete fungi. For feeders, bird-visited and unvisited solutions both accumulated abundant microbial populations that changed solution pH, but microbial composition was largely determined by visitation treatment. Our results reveal that feeders host abundant microbial populations, including some bird-associated microbial taxa. Microbial taxa in feeders were primarily non-pathogenic bacteria and fungi but differed substantially from those in floral nectar. These results demonstrate that human provisioning influences microbial intake by free-ranging hummingbirds; however, it is unknown how these changes impact hummingbird gastrointestinal flora or health.

        "Genetic diversity of CHC22 clathrin impacts its function in glucose metabolism. CHC22 clathrin plays a key role in intracellular membrane traffic of the insulin-responsive glucose transporter GLUT4 in humans. We performed population genetic and phylogenetic analyses of the CHC22-encoding CLTCL1 gene, revealing independent gene loss in at least two vertebrate lineages, after arising from gene duplication. All vertebrates retained the paralogous CLTC gene encoding CHC17 clathrin, which mediates endocytosis. For vertebrates retaining CLTCL1, strong evidence for purifying selection supports CHC22 functionality. All human populations maintained two high frequency CLTCL1 allelic variants, encoding either methionine or valine at position 1316. Functional studies indicated that CHC22-V1316, which is more frequent in farming populations than in hunter-gatherers, has different cellular dynamics than M1316-CHC22 and is less effective at controlling GLUT4 membrane traffic, altering its insulin-regulated response. These analyses suggest that ancestral human dietary change influenced selection of allotypes that affect CHC22's role in metabolism and have potential to differentially influence the human insulin response.

        "AP-1cFos/JunB/miR-200a regulate the pro-regenerative glial cell response during axolotl spinal cord regeneration. Salamanders have the remarkable ability to functionally regenerate after spinal cord transection. In response to injury, GFAP+ glial cells in the axolotl spinal cord proliferate and migrate to replace the missing neural tube and create a permissive environment for axon regeneration. Molecular pathways that regulate the pro-regenerative axolotl glial cell response are poorly understood. Here we show axolotl glial cells up-regulate AP-1cFos/JunB after injury, which promotes a pro-regenerative glial cell response. Injury induced upregulation of miR-200a in glial cells supresses c-Jun expression in these cells. Inhibition of miR-200a during regeneration causes defects in axonal regrowth and transcriptomic analysis revealed that miR-200a inhibition leads to differential regulation of genes involved with reactive gliosis, the glial scar, extracellular matrix remodeling and axon guidance. This work identifies a unique role for miR-200a in inhibiting reactive gliosis in axolotl glial cells during spinal cord regeneration. ",
        "Trogocytosis by Entamoeba histolytica Mediates Acquisition and Display of Human Cell Membrane Proteins and Evasion of Lysis by Human Serum. We previously showed that Entamoeba histolytica kills human cells through a mechanism that we termed trogocytosis (\"trogo-\" means \"nibble\"), due to its resemblance to trogocytosis in other organisms. In microbial eukaryotes like E. histolytica, trogocytosis is used to kill host cells. In multicellular eukaryotes, trogocytosis is used for cell killing and cell-cell communication in a variety of contexts. Thus, nibbling is an emerging theme in cell-cell interactions both within and between species. When trogocytosis occurs between mammalian immune cells, cell membrane proteins from the nibbled cell are acquired and displayed by the recipient cell. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that through trogocytosis, amoebae acquire and display human cell membrane proteins. We demonstrate that E. histolytica acquires and displays human cell membrane proteins through trogocytosis and that this leads to protection from lysis by human serum. Protection from human serum occurs only after amoebae have undergone trogocytosis of live cells but not phagocytosis of dead cells. Likewise, mutant amoebae defective in phagocytosis, but unaltered in their capacity to perform trogocytosis, are protected from human serum. Our studies are the first to reveal that amoebae can display human cell membrane proteins and suggest that the acquisition and display of membrane proteins is a general feature of trogocytosis. These studies have major implications for interactions between E. histolytica and the immune system and also reveal a novel strategy for immune evasion by a pathogen. Since other microbial eukaryotes use trogocytosis for cell killing, our findings may apply to the pathogenesis of other infections.IMPORTANCEEntamoeba histolytica causes amoebiasis, a potentially fatal diarrheal disease. Abscesses in organs such as the liver can occur when amoebae are able to breach the intestinal wall and travel through the bloodstream to other areas of the body. Therefore, understanding how E. histolytica evades immune detection is of great interest. Here, we demonstrate for the first time that E. histolytica acquires and displays human cell membrane proteins by taking \"bites\" of human cell material in a process named trogocytosis (\"trogo-\" means \"nibble\"), and that this allows amoebae to survive in human serum. Display of acquired proteins through trogocytosis has been previously characterized only in mammalian immune cells. Our study suggests that this is a more general feature of trogocytosis not restricted to immune cells and broadens our knowledge of eukaryotic biology. These findings also reveal a novel strategy for immune evasion by a pathogen and may apply to the pathogenesis of other infections. ",
        "Validation of a 16th Century Traditional Chinese Medicine Use of Ginkgo biloba as a Topical Antimicrobial. In the search for new therapeutic solutions to address an increasing number of multidrug-resistant bacterial pathogens, secondary metabolites from plants have proven to be a rich source of antimicrobial compounds. Ginkgo biloba, a tree native to China, has been spread around the world as an ornamental tree. Its seeds have been used as snacks and medical materials in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), while over the last century its leaf extracts emerged as a source of rising pharmaceutical commerce related to brain health in Western medicine. Besides studies on the neuro-protective effects of Ginkgo, its antibacterial activities have gained more attention from researchers in the past decades, though its leaves were the main focus. We reviewed a 16th-century Chinese text, the Ben Cao Gang Mu by Li Shi-Zhen, to investigate the ancient prescription of Ginkgo seeds for skin infections. We performed antibacterial assays on various Ginkgo seed extracts against pathogens (Staphylococcus aureus, Cutibacterium acnes, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Streptococcus pyogenes) relevant to skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs). We demonstrate here that Ginkgo seed coats and immature seeds exhibit antibacterial activity against Gram-positive skin pathogens (C. acnes, S. aureus, and S. pyogenes), and thus validated its use in TCM. We also identified one compound tied to the antibacterial activity observed, ginkgolic acid C15:1, and examine its toxicity to human keratinocytes. These results highlight the relevance of ancient medical texts as leads for the discovery of natural products with antimicrobial activities. ",
        "Exposure risks and ineffectiveness of total release foggers (TRFs) used for cockroach control in residential settings. BACKGROUND: The German cockroach, Blattella germanica, is one of the most challenging pests to eradicate from indoor environments. Professional pest control is often prohibitively expensive, prompting low-income residents to turn to over-the-counter consumer products, including total release foggers (TRFs, \"bug bombs\"). Despite their widespread use, little is known regarding either the associated pesticide exposure risks or the efficacy of TRFs. METHODS: Cockroach-infested homes were recruited into the study. Wipe samples were collected from various surfaces before TRFs were discharged, immediately after, and one month later to determine pesticide exposure risks in 20 homes (divided equally among four different TRF products). Simultaneously, cockroach populations were monitored in all homes to assess the efficacy of TRFs. In parallel, 10 homes were treated with gel baits (divided equally between two bait products), to compare TRFs to a more targeted, low-risk, do-it-yourself intervention strategy. RESULTS: TRFs failed to reduce cockroach populations, whereas similarly priced gel baits caused significant declines in the cockroach populations. Use of TRFs resulted in significant pesticide deposits throughout the kitchen. Across all products, pesticides, and horizontal kitchen surfaces, pesticide residues following TRF discharge were 603-times (SEM \u00b1184) higher than baseline, with a median increase of 85 times. CONCLUSIONS: The high risks of pesticide exposure associated with TRFs combined with their ineffectiveness in controlling German cockroach infestations call into question their utility in the marketplace, especially because similarly priced and much safer bait products are highly effective in the indoor environment.

        "Genome sequencing and transcriptome analyses of the Siberian hamster hypothalamus identify mechanisms for seasonal energy balance. Synthesis of triiodothyronine (T3) in the hypothalamus induces marked seasonal neuromorphology changes across taxa. How species-specific responses to T3 signaling in the CNS drive annual changes in body weight and energy balance remains uncharacterized. These experiments sequenced and annotated the Siberian hamster (Phodopus sungorus) genome, a model organism for seasonal physiology research, to facilitate the dissection of T3-dependent molecular mechanisms that govern predictable, robust, and long-term changes in body weight. Examination of the Phodopus genome, in combination with transcriptome sequencing of the hamster diencephalon under winter and summer conditions, and in vivo-targeted expression analyses confirmed that proopiomelanocortin (pomc) is a primary genomic target for the long-term T3-dependent regulation of body weight. Further in silico analyses of pomc promoter sequences revealed that thyroid hormone receptor 1\u03b2-binding motif insertions have evolved in several genera of the Cricetidae family of rodents. Finally, experimental manipulation of food availability confirmed that hypothalamic pomc mRNA expression is dependent on longer-term photoperiod cues and is unresponsive to acute, short-term food availability. These observations suggest that species-specific responses to hypothalamic T3, driven in part by the receptor-binding motif insertions in some cricetid genomes, contribute critically to the long-term regulation of energy balance and the underlying physiological and behavioral adaptations associated with the seasonal organization of behavior.

        "Insights into the timing, intensity and natural setting of Neanderthal occupation from the geoarchaeological study of combustion structures: A micromorphological and biomarker investigation of El Salt, unit Xb, Alcoy, Spain. Middle Paleolithic lithic and faunal assemblages throughout Eurasia reflect short-term Neanderthal occupations, which suggest high group mobility. However, the timing of these short-term occupations, a key factor to assess group mobility and territorial range, remains unresolved. Anthropogenic combustion structures are prominent in the Middle Paleolithic record and conceal information on the timing and intensity and natural setting of their associated human occupations. This paper examines a concentration of eleven combustion structures from unit Xb of El Salt, a Middle Paleolithic site in Spain through a geoarchaeological approach, in search of temporal, human impact and paleoenvironmental indicators to assess the timing, intensity and natural setting of the associated human occupations. The study was conducted using micromorphology, lipid biomarker analysis and compound specific isotope analysis. Results show in situ hearths built on different diachronic topsoils rich in herbivore excrements and angiosperm plant residues with rare anthropogenic remains. These data are suggestive of low impact, short-term human occupations separated by relatively long periods of time, with possible indicators of seasonality. Results also show an absence of conifer biomarkers in the mentioned topsoils and presence of conifer charcoal among the fuel residues (ash), indicating that fire wood was brought to the site from elsewhere. A microscopic and molecular approach in the study of combustion structures allows us to narrow down the timescale of archaeological analysis and contributes valuable information towards an understanding of Neanderthal group mobility and settlement patterns.

        "Nanobody-based CAR T cells that target the tumor microenvironment inhibit the growth of solid tumors in immunocompetent mice. Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy has been successful in clinical trials against hematological cancers, but has experienced challenges in the treatment of solid tumors. One of the main difficulties lies in a paucity of tumor-specific targets that can serve as CAR recognition domains. We therefore focused on developing VHH-based, single-domain antibody (nanobody) CAR T cells that target aspects of the tumor microenvironment conserved across multiple cancer types. Many solid tumors evade immune recognition through expression of checkpoint molecules, such as PD-L1, that down-regulate the immune response. We therefore targeted CAR T cells to the tumor microenvironment via the checkpoint inhibitor PD-L1 and observed a reduction in tumor growth, resulting in improved survival. CAR T cells that target the tumor stroma and vasculature through the EIIIB+ fibronectin splice variant, which is expressed by multiple tumor types and on neovasculature, are likewise effective in delaying tumor growth. VHH-based CAR T cells can thus function as antitumor agents for multiple targets in syngeneic, immunocompetent animal models. Our results demonstrate the flexibility of VHH-based CAR T cells and the potential of CAR T cells to target the tumor microenvironment and treat solid tumors. ",
        "Engineering an Artificial T-Cell Stimulating Matrix for Immunotherapy. T cell therapies require the removal and culture of T cells ex vivo to expand several thousand-fold. However, these cells often lose the phenotype and cytotoxic functionality for mediating effective therapeutic responses. The extracellular matrix (ECM) has been used to preserve and augment cell phenotype; however, it has not been applied to cellular immunotherapies. Here, a hyaluronic acid (HA)-based hydrogel is engineered to present the two stimulatory signals required for T-cell activation-termed an artificial T-cell stimulating matrix (aTM). It is found that biophysical properties of the aTM-stimulatory ligand density, stiffness, and ECM proteins-potentiate T cell signaling and skew phenotype of both murine and human T cells. Importantly, the combination of the ECM environment and mechanically sensitive TCR signaling from the aTM results in a rapid and robust expansion of rare, antigen-specific CD8+ T cells. Adoptive transfer of these tumor-specific cells significantly suppresses tumor growth and improves animal survival compared with T cells stimulated by traditional methods. Beyond immediate immunotherapeutic applications, demonstrating the environment influences the cellular therapeutic product delineates the importance of the ECM and provides a case study of how to engineer ECM-mimetic materials for therapeutic immune stimulation in the future.

Graphene quantum dots (GQDs) have recently been employed in various fields including medicine as antioxidants, primarily because of favorable biocompatibility in comparison to common inorganic quantum dots, although the structural features that lead to the biological activities of GQDs are poorly understood. Here, we report that coal-derived GQDs and their poly(ethylene glycol)-functionalized derivatives serve as efficient antioxidants, and we evaluate their electrochemical, chemical, and in vitro biological activities.

        "Stimulus-Responsive Anti-Oxidizing Drug Crystals and their Ecological Implication. Various antioxidants are being used to neutralize the harmful effects of reactive oxygen species (ROS) overproduced in diseased tissues and contaminated environments. Polymer-directed crystallization of antioxidants has attracted attention as a way to control drug efficacy through molecular dissolution. However, most recrystallized antioxidants undertake continuous dissolution independent of the ROS level, thus causing side-effects. This study demonstrates a unique method to assemble antioxidant crystals that modulate their dissolution rate in response to the ROS level. We hypothesized that antioxidants recrystallized using a ROS-labile polymer would be triggered to dissolve when the ROS level increases. We examined this hypothesis by using catechin as a model antioxidant. Catechin was recrystallized using polyethylenimine cross-linked with ROS-labile diselanediylbis-(ethane-2,1-diyl)-diacrylate. Catechin crystallized with the ROS-labile polymer displays accelerated dissolution proportional to the H2 O2 concentration. The ROS-responsive catechin crystals protect vascular cells from oxidative insults by activating intracellular glutathione peroxidase expression and, in turn, inhibiting an increase in the intracellular oxidative stress. In addition, ROS-responsive catechin crystals alleviate changes in the heart rate of Daphnia magna in oxidative media. We propose that the results of this study would be broadly useful for improving the therapeutic efficacy of a broad array of drug compounds. ",
        "Proanthocyanidin Interferes with Intrinsic Antibiotic Resistance Mechanisms of Gram-Negative Bacteria. Antibiotic resistance is spreading at an alarming rate among pathogenic bacteria in both medicine and agriculture. Interfering with the intrinsic resistance mechanisms displayed by pathogenic bacteria has the potential to make antibiotics more effective and decrease the spread of acquired antibiotic resistance. Here, it is demonstrated that cranberry proanthocyanidin (cPAC) prevents the evolution of resistance to tetracycline in Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, rescues antibiotic efficacy against antibiotic-exposed cells, and represses biofilm formation. It is shown that cPAC has a potentiating effect, both in vitro and in vivo, on a broad range of antibiotic classes against pathogenic E. coli, Proteus mirabilis, and P. aeruginosa. Evidence that cPAC acts by repressing two antibiotic resistance mechanisms, selective membrane permeability and multidrug efflux pumps, is presented. Failure of cPAC to potentiate antibiotics against efflux pump-defective mutants demonstrates that efflux interference is essential for potentiation. The use of cPAC to potentiate antibiotics and mitigate the development of resistance could improve treatment outcomes and help combat the growing threat of antibiotic resistance. ",
        "Living on the edge: Was demographic weakness the cause of Neanderthal demise?. The causes of disappearance of the Neanderthals, the only human population living in Europe before the arrival of Homo sapiens, have been debated for decades by the scientific community. Different hypotheses have been advanced to explain this demise, such as cognitive, adaptive and cultural inferiority of Neanderthals. Here, we investigate the disappearance of Neanderthals by examining the extent of demographic changes needed over a period of 10,000 years (yrs) to lead to their extinction. In regard to such fossil populations, we inferred demographic parameters from present day and past hunter-gatherer populations, and from bio-anthropological rules. We used demographic modeling and simulations to identify the set of plausible demographic parameters of the Neanderthal population compatible with the observed dynamics, and to explore the circumstances under which they might have led to the disappearance of Neanderthals. A slight (<4%) but continuous decrease in the fertility rate of younger Neanderthal women could have had a significant impact on these dynamics, and could have precipitated their demise. Our results open the way to non-catastrophic events as plausible explanations for Neanderthal extinction. ",
        "A Transmissible RNA Pathway in Honey Bees. Systemic RNAi, initiated by double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) ingestion, has been reported in diverse invertebrates, including honey bees, demonstrating environmental RNA uptake that undermines homologous gene expression. However, the question why any organism would take up RNA from the environment has remained largely unanswered. Here, we report on horizontal RNA flow among honey bees mediated by secretion and ingestion of worker and royal jelly diets. We demonstrate that transmission of jelly-secreted dsRNA to larvae is biologically active and triggers gene knockdown that lasts into adulthood. Worker and royal jellies harbor differential naturally occurring RNA populations. Jelly RNAs corresponded to honey bee protein-coding genes, transposable elements, and non-coding RNA, as well as bacteria, fungi, and viruses. These results reveal an inherent property of honey bees to share RNA among individuals and generations. Our findings suggest a transmissible RNA pathway, playing a role in social immunity and signaling between members of the hive. A Secreted RNA Binding Protein Forms RNA-Stabilizing Granules in the Honeybee Royal Jelly. RNA flow between organisms has been documented\u00a0within and among different kingdoms of life. Recently, we demonstrated horizontal RNA transfer between honeybees involving secretion and ingestion of worker and royal jellies. However, how the jelly facilitates transfer of RNA is still unknown. Here, we show that worker and royal jellies harbor robust RNA-binding activity. We report that a highly abundant jelly component, major royal jelly protein 3 (MRJP-3), acts as an extracellular non-sequence-specific RNA-aggregating factor. Multivalent RNA binding stimulates higher-order assembly of MRJP-3 into extracellular ribonucleoprotein granules that protect RNA from degradation and enhance RNA bioavailability. These findings reveal that honeybees have evolved a secreted dietary RNA-binding factor to concentrate, stabilize, and share RNA among individuals. Our work identifies high-order ribonucleoprotein assemblies with functions outside cells and organisms. ",
        "Stem Cell-Derived Exosomes as Nanotherapeutics for Autoimmune and Neurodegenerative Disorders. To dissect therapeutic mechanisms of transplanted stem cells and develop exosome-based nanotherapeutics in treating autoimmune and neurodegenerative diseases, we assessed the effect of exosomes secreted from human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in treating multiple sclerosis using an experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) mouse model. We found that intravenous administration of exosomes produced by MSCs stimulated by IFN\u03b3 (IFN\u03b3-Exo) (i) reduced the mean clinical score of EAE mice compared to PBS control, (ii) reduced demyelination, (iii) decreased neuroinflammation, and (iv) upregulated the number of CD4+CD25+FOXP3+ regulatory T cells (Tregs) within the spinal cords of EAE mice. Co-culture of IFN\u03b3-Exo with activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) cells in vitro reduced PBMC proliferation and levels of pro-inflammatory Th1 and Th17 cytokines including IL-6, IL-12p70, IL-17AF, and IL-22 yet increased levels of immunosuppressive cytokine indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase. IFN\u03b3-Exo could also induce Tregs in vitro in a murine splenocyte culture, likely mediated by a third-party accessory cell type. Further, IFN\u03b3-Exo characterization by deep RNA sequencing suggested that IFN\u03b3-Exo contains anti-inflammatory RNAs, where their inactivation partially hindered the exosomes potential to induce Tregs. Furthermore, we found that IFN\u03b3-Exo harbors multiple anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective proteins. These results not only shed light on stem cell therapeutic mechanisms but also provide evidence that MSC-derived exosomes can potentially serve as cell-free therapies in creating a tolerogenic immune response to treat autoimmune and central nervous system disorders.

        "Polymer-Coated Gold Nanospheres Do Not Impair the Innate Immune Function of Human B Lymphocytes in Vitro. Gold nanoparticles (GNPs) are intended for use within a variety of biomedical applications due to their physicochemical properties. Although, in general, biocompatibility of GNPs with immune cells such as macrophages and dendritic cells is well established, the impact of GNPs on B lymphocyte immune function remains to be determined. Since B lymphocytes play an important role in health and disease, the suitability of GNPs as a B cell-targeting tool is of high relevance. Thus, we provide information on the interactions of GNPs with B lymphocytes. Herein, we exposed freshly isolated human B lymphocytes to a set of well-characterized and biomedically relevant GNPs with distinct surface (polyethylene glycol (PEG), PEG/poly(vinyl alcohol) (PEG/PVA)) and shape (spheres, rods) characteristics. Polymer-coated GNPs poorly interacted with B lymphocytes, in contrast to uncoated GNPs. Importantly, none of the GNPs significantly affected cell viability, even at the highest concentration of 20 \u03bcg/mL over a 24 h suspension exposure period. Furthermore, none of the nanosphere formulations affected the expression of activation markers (CD69, CD86, MHC II) of the naive B lymphocytes, nor did they cause an increase in the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines ( i.e. , IL-6, IL-1\u03b2). However, the absence of polymer coating on the sphere GNPs and the rod shape caused a decrease in IL-6 cytokine production by activated B lymphocytes, suggesting a functional impairment. With these findings, the present study contributes imperative knowledge toward the safe-by-design approaches being conducted to benefit the development of nanomaterials, specifically those as theranostic tools.

        "An Apple a Day: Which Bacteria Do We Eat With Organic and Conventional Apples?. Apples are among the most consumed fruits world-wide. They represent a source of direct human exposure to bacterial communities, which is less studied. We analyzed the apple microbiome to detect differences between tissues and the impact of organic and conventional management by a combined approach of 16S rRNA gene amplicon analysis and qPCR, and visualization using fluorescence in situ hybridization and confocal laser scanning microscopy (FISH-CLSM). Each apple fruit harbors different tissues (stem, peel, fruit pulp, seeds, and calyx), which were colonized by distinct bacterial communities. Interestingly, fruit pulp and seeds were bacterial hot spots, while the peel was less colonized. In all, approximately 108 16S rRNA bacterial gene copy numbers were determined in each g apple. Abundances were not influenced by the management practice but we found a strong reduction in bacterial diversity and evenness in conventionally managed apples. In addition, despite the similar structure in general dominated by Proteobacteria (80%), Bacteroidetes (9%), Actinobacteria (5%), and Firmicutes (3%), significant shifts of almost 40% of bacterial genera and orders were monitored. Among them, especially bacterial signatures known for health-affecting potential were found to be enhanced in conventionally managed apples. Our results suggest that we consume about 100 million bacterial cells with one apple. Although this amount was the same, the bacterial composition was significantly different in conventionally and organically produced apples. ",
        "Female bed bugs (Cimex lectularius L) anticipate the immunological consequences of traumatic insemination via feeding cues. Not all encounters with pathogens are stochastic and insects can adjust their immune management in relation to cues associated with the likelihood of infection within a life cycle as well as across generations. In this study we show that female insects (bed bugs) up-regulate immune function in their copulatory organ in anticipation of mating by using feeding cues. Male bed bugs only mate with recently fed females and do so by traumatic insemination (TI). Consequently, there is a tight temporal correlation between female feeding and the likelihood of her being infected via TI. Females that received predictable access to food (and therefore predictable insemination and infection cycles) up-regulated induced immunity (generic antibacterial activity) in anticipation of feeding and mating. Females that received unpredictable (but the same mean periodicity) access to food did not. Females that anticipated mating-associated immune insult received measurable fitness benefits (survival and lifetime reproductive success) despite laying eggs at the same rate as females that were not able to predict these cycles. Given that mating is a time of increased likelihood of infection in many organisms, and is often associated with temporal cues such as courtship and/or feeding, we propose that anticipation of mating-associated infection in females may be more widespread than is currently evidenced.

        "Antioxidant Activities in vitro of Water and Liposoluble Extracts Obtained by Different Species of Edible Insects and Invertebrates. A new global interest in entomophagy, the practice of eating insects, and invertebrates, arise from the impellent necessity of preserving agriculture resources and to obtain a drastic reduction of the ecological impact of animal food on the planet. The composite nutritional content, direct consequences of a plant-based feeding, associated with the undoubtedly ecological properties, suggest for insects a role as sustainable and functional foods. We aim to investigate the ability of water and liposoluble extracts, obtained by 12 commercially available edible insects and two invertebrates, to display an antioxidant effect in vitro. Results show that water-soluble extracts of grasshoppers, silkworm, and crickets display the highest values of antioxidant capacity (TEAC), 5-fold higher than fresh orange juice, while evening cicada, giant water bugs, Thai zebra tarantula, and black scorpions have negligible values. Grasshoppers, African caterpillars, and crickets have the highest levels of reducing power (FRAP), double than fresh orange juice. Grasshoppers, black ants, and mealworms contain the highest levels of total polyphenols, while Thai zebra tarantula, black scorpions, and giant water bugs are positioned at the bottom of the ranking. The liposoluble fraction of silkworm, evening cicada, and African caterpillars shows highest level of TEAC, twice than olive oil, while Thai zebra tarantula, palm worm, and black ants are placed at the bottom of the ranking. Edible insects and invertebrates represent a potential source of antioxidant ingredients with an efficiency related to their taxonomy and eating habits. More evidences are needed in order to understand if the practice of eating insects and invertebrates might contribute to modulate oxidative stress in humans. ",
        "Bacteria: A novel source for potent mosquito feeding-deterrents. Antibiotic and insecticidal bioactivities of the extracellular secondary metabolites produced by entomopathogenic bacteria belonging to genus Xenorhabdus have been identified; however, their novel applications such as mosquito feeding-deterrence have not been reported. Here, we show that a mixture of compounds isolated from Xenorhabdus budapestensis in vitro cultures exhibits potent feeding-deterrent activity against three deadly mosquito vectors: Aedes aegypti, Anopheles gambiae, and Culex pipiens. We demonstrate that the deterrent active fraction isolated from replicate bacterial cultures is highly enriched in two compounds consistent with the previously described fabclavines, strongly suggesting that these are the molecular species responsible for feeding-deterrence. The mosquito feeding-deterrent activity in the putative fabclavine-rich fraction is comparable to or better than that of N,N-diethyl-3-methylbenzamide (also known as DEET) or picaridin in side-by-side assays. These findings lay the groundwork for research into biologically derived, peptide-based, low-molecular weight compounds isolated from bacteria for exploitation as mosquito repellents and feeding-deterrents.

Residue-residue coevolution has been observed across a number of protein-protein interfaces, but the extent of residue coevolution between protein families on the whole-proteome scale has not been systematically studied. We investigate coevolution between 5.4 million pairs of proteins in Escherichia coli and between 3.9 millions pairs in Mycobacterium tuberculosis We find strong coevolution for binary complexes involved in metabolism and weaker coevolution for larger complexes playing roles in genetic information processing. We take advantage of this coevolution, in combination with structure modeling, to predict protein-protein interactions (PPIs) with an accuracy that benchmark studies suggest is considerably higher than that of proteome-wide two-hybrid and mass spectrometry screens. We identify hundreds of previously uncharacterized PPIs in E. coli and M. tuberculosis that both add components to known protein complexes and networks and establish the existence of new ones. ",
        "Nozzle-free electrospinning of Polyvinylpyrrolidone/Poly(glycerol sebacate) fibrous scaffolds for skin tissue engineering applications. A novel composite for skin tissue engineering applications by use of blends of Poly(vinylpyrrolidone) (PVP) and Poly (glycerol sebacate) (PGS) was fabricated via the scalable nozzle-free electrospinning technique. The formed PVP:PGS blends were morphologically, thermochemically and mechanically characterized. The morphology of the developed fibers correlated to the blend ratio. The tensile modulus appeared to be affected by the concentration of PGS within the blends, with an apparent decrease in the elastic modulus of the electrospun mats and an exponential increase of the elongation at break. Ultraviolet (UV) crosslinking of the composite fibers significantly decreased the construct's wettability and stabilized the formed fiber mats, which was indicated by contact angle measurements. In vitro examination showed good viability and proliferation of human dermal fibroblast cells. The present findings provide valuable insights for tuning the elastic properties of electrospun material by incorporating this unique elastomer as a promising future candidate for skin substitute constructs.

        "Evolution and ecology of plant viruses. The discovery of the first non-cellular infectious agent, later determined to be tobacco mosaic virus, paved the way for the field of virology. In the ensuing decades, research focused on discovering and eliminating viral threats to plant and animal health. However, recent conceptual and methodological revolutions have made it clear that viruses are not merely agents of destruction but essential components of global ecosystems. As plants make up over 80% of the biomass on Earth, plant viruses likely have a larger impact on ecosystem stability and function than viruses of other kingdoms. Besides preventing overgrowth of genetically homogeneous plant populations such as crop plants, some plant viruses might also promote the adaptation of their hosts to changing environments. However, estimates of the extent and frequencies of such mutualistic interactions remain controversial. In this Review, we focus on the origins of plant viruses and the evolution of interactions between these viruses and both their hosts and transmission vectors. We also identify currently unknown aspects of plant virus ecology and evolution that are of practical importance and that should be resolvable in the near future through viral metagenomics. ",
        "Phylogenetic reconciliation reveals the natural history of glycopeptide antibiotic biosynthesis and resistance. Glycopeptide antibiotics are produced by Actinobacteria through biosynthetic gene clusters that include genes supporting their regulation, synthesis, export and resistance. The chemical and biosynthetic diversities of glycopeptides are the product of an intricate evolutionary history. Extracting this history from genome sequences is difficult as conservation of the individual components of these gene clusters is variable and each component can have a different trajectory. We show that glycopeptide biosynthesis and resistance in Actinobacteria maps to approximately 150-400 million years ago. Phylogenetic reconciliation reveals that the precursors of glycopeptide biosynthesis are far older than other components, implying that these clusters arose from a pre-existing pool of genes. We find that resistance appeared contemporaneously with biosynthetic genes, raising the possibility that the mechanism of action of glycopeptides was a driver of diversification in these gene clusters. Our results put antibiotic biosynthesis and resistance into an evolutionary context and can guide the future discovery of compounds possessing new mechanisms of action, which are especially needed as the usefulness of the antibiotics available at present is imperilled by human activity.

        "Ancient pigs reveal a near-complete genomic turnover following their introduction to Europe. Archaeological evidence indicates that pig domestication had begun by \u223c10,500 y before the present (BP) in the Near East, and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) suggests that pigs arrived in Europe alongside farmers \u223c8,500 y BP. A few thousand years after the introduction of Near Eastern pigs into Europe, however, their characteristic mtDNA signature disappeared and was replaced by haplotypes associated with European wild boars. This turnover could be accounted for by substantial gene flow from local European wild boars, although it is also possible that European wild boars were domesticated independently without any genetic contribution from the Near East. To test these hypotheses, we obtained mtDNA sequences from 2,099 modern and ancient pig samples and 63 nuclear ancient genomes from Near Eastern and European pigs. Our analyses revealed that European domestic pigs dating from 7,100 to 6,000 y BP possessed both Near Eastern and European nuclear ancestry, while later pigs possessed no more than 4% Near Eastern ancestry, indicating that gene flow from European wild boars resulted in a near-complete disappearance of Near East ancestry. In addition, we demonstrate that a variant at a locus encoding black coat color likely originated in the Near East and persisted in European pigs. Altogether, our results indicate that while pigs were not independently domesticated in Europe, the vast majority of human-mediated selection over the past 5,000 y focused on the genomic fraction derived from the European wild boars, and not on the fraction that was selected by early Neolithic farmers over the first 2,500 y of the domestication process.

        "Coagulation factors VII, IX and X are effective antibacterial proteins against drug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria. Infections caused by drug-resistant \"superbugs\" pose an urgent public health threat due to the lack of effective drugs; however, certain mammalian proteins with intrinsic antibacterial activity might be underappreciated. Here, we reveal an antibacterial property against Gram-negative bacteria for factors VII, IX and X, three proteins with well-established roles in initiation of the coagulation cascade. These factors exert antibacterial function via their light chains (LCs). Unlike many antibacterial agents that target cell metabolism or the cytoplasmic membrane, the LCs act by hydrolyzing the major components of bacterial outer membrane, lipopolysaccharides, which are crucial for the survival of Gram-negative bacteria. The LC of factor VII exhibits in vitro efficacy towards all Gram-negative bacteria tested, including extensively drug-resistant (XDR) pathogens, at nanomolar concentrations. It is also highly effective in combating XDR Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii infections in vivo. Through decoding a unique mechanism whereby factors VII, IX and X behave as antimicrobial proteins, this study advances our understanding of the coagulation system in host defense, and suggests that these factors may participate in the pathogenesis of coagulation disorder-related diseases such as sepsis via their dual functions in blood coagulation and resistance to infection. Furthermore, this study may offer new strategies for combating Gram-negative \"superbugs\". ",
        "Kinetics and Identities of Extracellular Peptidases in Subsurface Sediments of the White Oak River Estuary, North Carolina. Anoxic subsurface sediments contain communities of heterotrophic microorganisms that metabolize organic carbon at extraordinarily low rates. In order to assess the mechanisms by which subsurface microorganisms access detrital sedimentary organic matter, we measured kinetics of a range of extracellular peptidases in anoxic sediments of the White Oak River Estuary, NC. Nine distinct peptidase substrates were enzymatically hydrolyzed at all depths. Potential peptidase activities (Vmax) decreased with increasing sediment depth, although Vmax expressed on a per-cell basis was approximately the same at all depths. Half-saturation constants (Km ) decreased with depth, indicating peptidases that functioned more efficiently at low substrate concentrations. Potential activities of extracellular peptidases acting on molecules that are enriched in degraded organic matter (d-phenylalanine and l-ornithine) increased relative to enzymes that act on l-phenylalanine, further suggesting microbial community adaptation to access degraded organic matter. Nineteen classes of predicted, exported peptidases were identified in genomic data from the same site, of which genes for class C25 (gingipain-like) peptidases represented more than 40% at each depth. Methionine aminopeptidases, zinc carboxypeptidases, and class S24-like peptidases, which are involved in single-stranded-DNA repair, were also abundant. These results suggest a subsurface heterotrophic microbial community that primarily accesses low-quality detrital organic matter via a diverse suite of well-adapted extracellular enzymes.IMPORTANCE Burial of organic carbon in marine and estuarine sediments represents a long-term sink for atmospheric carbon dioxide. Globally, \u223c40% of organic carbon burial occurs in anoxic estuaries and deltaic systems. However, the ultimate controls on the amount of organic matter that is buried in sediments, versus oxidized into CO2, are poorly constrained. In this study, we used a combination of enzyme assays and metagenomic analysis to identify how subsurface microbial communities catalyze the first step of proteinaceous organic carbon degradation. Our results show that microbial communities in deeper sediments are adapted to access molecules characteristic of degraded organic matter, suggesting that those heterotrophs are adapted to life in the subsurface.

        "Two-photon images reveal unique texture features for label-free identification of ovarian cancer peritoneal metastases. For cancer patients, treatment selection fundamentally relies on staging, with \"under-staging\" considered a common problem. Imaging modalities that can complement conventional white-light laparoscopy are needed to detect more accurately small metastatic lesions in patients undergoing operative cancer care. Biopsies from healthy parietal peritoneum and ovarian peritoneal metastases obtained from 8 patients were imaged employing a two-photon laser scanning microscope to generate collagen-second harmonic generation (SHG) and fluorescence images at 755\u2005nm and 900\u2005nm excitation and 460\u2009\u00b1\u200920\u2005nm and 525\u2009\u00b1\u200925\u2005nm emission. Forty-one images were analyzed by automated image processing algorithms and statistical textural analysis techniques, namely gray level co-occurrence matrices. Two textural features (contrast and correlation) were employed to describe the spatial intensity variations within the captured images and outcomes were used for discriminant analysis. We found that healthy tissues displayed large variations in contrast and correlation features as a function of distance, corresponding to repetitive, increased local intensity fluctuations. Metastatic tissue images exhibited decreased contrast and correlation related values, representing more uniform intensity patterns and smaller fibers, indicating the destruction of the healthy stroma by the cancerous infiltration. The textural outcomes resulted in high classification accuracy as evaluated quantitatively by discriminant analysis. ",
        "Guiding of visible photons at the \u00e5ngstr\u00f6m thickness limit. Optical waveguides are vital components of data communication system technologies, but their scaling down to the nanoscale has remained challenging despite advances in nano-optics and nanomaterials. Recently, we theoretically predicted that the ultimate limit of visible photon guiding can be achieved in monolayer-thick transition metal dichalcogenides. Here, we present an experimental demonstration of light guiding in an atomically thick tungsten disulfide membrane patterned as a photonic crystal structure. In this scheme, two-dimensional tungsten disulfide excitonic photoluminescence couples into quasi-guided photonic crystal modes known as resonant-type Wood's anomalies. These modes propagate via total internal reflection with only a small portion of the light diffracted to the far field. Such light guiding at the ultimate limit provides more possibilities to miniaturize optoelectronic devices and to test fundamental physical concepts. ",

However, the mechanisms by which vitamin A regulates skin immunity remain unclear. Here, we show that resistin-like molecule \u03b1 (RELM\u03b1), a small secreted cysteine-rich protein, is expressed by epidermal keratinocytes and sebocytes and serves as an antimicrobial protein that is required for vitamin-A-dependent resistance to skin infection. RELM\u03b1 was induced by microbiota colonization of the murine skin, was bactericidal in\u00a0vitro, and was protected against bacterial infection of the skin in\u00a0vivo. RELM\u03b1 expression required dietary vitamin A and was induced by the therapeutic vitamin A analog isotretinoin, which protected against skin infection in a RELM\u03b1-dependent manner. The RELM family member Resistin was expressed in human skin, was induced by vitamin A analogs, and killed skin bacteria, indicating a conserved function for RELM proteins in skin innate immunity. Our findings provide insight into how vitamin A promotes resistance to skin infection. ",
        "Mediation of the Acute Stress Response by the Skeleton. We hypothesized that bone evolved, in part, to enhance the ability of bony vertebrates to escape danger in the wild. In support of this notion, we show here that a bone-derived signal is necessary to develop an acute stress response (ASR). Indeed, exposure to various types of stressors in mice, rats (rodents), and humans leads to a rapid and selective surge of circulating bioactive osteocalcin because stressors favor the uptake by osteoblasts of glutamate, which prevents inactivation of osteocalcin prior to its secretion. Osteocalcin permits manifestations of the ASR to unfold by signaling in post-synaptic parasympathetic neurons to inhibit their activity, thereby leaving the sympathetic tone unopposed. Like wild-type animals, adrenalectomized rodents and adrenal-insufficient patients can develop an ASR, and genetic studies suggest that this is due to their high circulating osteocalcin levels. We propose that osteocalcin defines a bony-vertebrate-specific endocrine mediation of the ASR. ",
        "A new method for investigating the relationship between diet and mortality: hazard analysis using dietary isotopes. Background: The population of Roman Britain are renowned for having elevated nitrogen (\u03b415) stable isotope values, which have been interpreted as evidence for the increased consumption of marine products. However, such results are now understood to also reflect episodes of stress and disease, suggesting that new interpretations are warranted. Aim: To test a novel approach which combines hazard mortality analysis and stable isotope data to determine whether there is a relationship between age-at-death, elevated \u03b415N values and mortality risk. Subjects and methods: This study used published osteological and dietary stable isotope data for nitrogen (\u03b415N) and carbon (\u03b413C) of 659 1st-5th century AD individuals aged >12 years old excavated from Roman cemeteries in Britain. The relationship between diet and mortality risk was assessed using the Gompertz hazard model, and differences in median reported isotope values between the sexes was determined using a Mann Whitney test. Results: It was discovered that higher \u03b415N levels are associated with elevated risks of mortality, whereas the opposite pattern was observed for \u03b413C, and males had higher median \u03b413C and \u03b415N values. Conclusion: This study successfully demonstrated that stable isotope data can be integrated into hazard models, allowing one to connect diet and mortality in past populations. It supports the findings of other isotope studies which have established that individuals with childhood stress/trauma will have different isotope patterns. ",
        "A triple drug combination targeting components of the nutrient-sensing network maximizes longevity. Increasing life expectancy is causing the prevalence of age-related diseases to rise, and there is an urgent need for new strategies to improve health at older ages. Reduced activity of insulin/insulin-like growth factor signaling (IIS) and mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) nutrient-sensing signaling network can extend lifespan and improve health during aging in diverse organisms. However, the extensive feedback in this network and adverse side effects of inhibition imply that simultaneous targeting of specific effectors in the network may most effectively combat the effects of aging. We show that the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) inhibitor trametinib, the mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) inhibitor rapamycin, and the glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) inhibitor lithium act additively to increase longevity in Drosophila Remarkably, the triple drug combination increased lifespan by 48%. Furthermore, the combination of lithium with rapamycin cancelled the latter's effects on lipid metabolism. In conclusion, a polypharmacology approach of combining established, prolongevity drug inhibitors of specific nodes may be the most effective way to target the nutrient-sensing network to improve late-life health.

        "Human Salivary Amylase Gene Copy Number Impacts Oral and Gut Microbiomes. Host genetic variation influences microbiome composition. While studies have focused on associations between the gut microbiome and specific alleles, gene copy number (CN) also varies. We relate microbiome diversity to CN variation of the AMY1 locus, which encodes salivary amylase, facilitating starch digestion. After imputing AMY1-CN for \u223c1,000 subjects, we identified taxa differentiating fecal microbiomes of high and low AMY1-CN hosts. In a month-long diet intervention study, we show that diet standardization drove gut microbiome convergence, and AMY1-CN correlated with oral and gut microbiome composition and function. The microbiomes of low-AMY1-CN subjects had enhanced capacity to break down complex carbohydrates. High-AMY1-CN subjects had higher levels of salivary Porphyromonas; their gut microbiota had increased abundance of resistant starch-degrading microbes, produced higher levels of short-chain fatty acids, and drove higher adiposity when transferred to germ-free mice. This study establishes AMY1-CN as a genetic factor associated with microbiome composition and function. ",
        "Natural diets promote retention of the native gut microbiota in captive rodents. Wild animals entering captivity experience radical lifestyle changes resulting in microbiome alterations. However, little is known about the factors that drive microbial community shifts in captivity, and what actions could mitigate microbial changes. Using white-throated woodrats (Neotoma albigula), we tested whether offering natural diets in captivity facilitates retention of native microbial communities of captive animals. Wild-caught woodrats were brought to laboratory conditions. Woodrats received either a natural diet of Opuntia cactus or an artificial diet of commercial chow over three weeks. Microbial inventories from woodrat feces at the time of capture and in captivity were generated using Illumina 16S rRNA sequencing. We found that providing woodrats with wild-natural diets significantly mitigated alterations in their microbiota, promoting a 90% retention of native microbial communities across the experiment. In contrast, the artificial diet significantly impacted microbial structure to the extent that 38% of the natural microflora was lost. Core bacteria including Bifidobacterium and Allobaculum were lost, and abundances of microbes related to oxalate degradation decreased in individuals fed artificial but not natural diets. These results highlight the importance of supplementing captive diets with natural foods to maintain native microbiomes of animals kept in artificial conditions for scientific or conservation purposes.

        "Encapsulation, Visualization and Expression of Genes with Biomimetically Mineralized Zeolitic Imidazolate Framework-8 (ZIF-8). Recent work in biomolecule-metal-organic framework (MOF) composites has proven to be an effective strategy for the protection of proteins. However, for other biomacromolecules such as nucleic acids, the encapsulation into nano MOFs and the related characterizations are in their infancy. Herein, encapsulation of a complete gene-set in zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 (ZIF-8) MOFs and cellular expression of the gene delivered by the nano MOF composites are reported. Using a green fluorescent protein (GFP) plasmid (plGFP) as a proof-of-concept genetic macromolecule, successful transfection of mammalian cancer cells with plGFP for up to 4 days is shown. Cell transfection assays and soft X-ray cryo-tomography (cryo-SXT) demonstrate the feasibility of DNA@MOF biocomposites as intracellular gene delivery vehicles. Expression occurs over relatively prolonged time points where the cargo nucleic acid is released gradually in order to maintain sustained expression. ",
        "Plastic Teabags Release Billions of Microparticles and Nanoparticles into Tea. The increasing presence of micro- and nano-sized plastics in the environment and food chain is of growing concern. Although mindful consumers are promoting the reduction of single-use plastics, some manufacturers are creating new plastic packaging to replace traditional paper uses, such as plastic teabags. The objective of this study was to determine whether plastic teabags could release microplastics and/or nanoplastics during a typical steeping process. We show that steeping a single plastic teabag at brewing temperature (95 \u00b0C) releases approximately 11.6 billion microplastics and 3.1 billion nanoplastics into a single cup of the beverage. The composition of the released particles is matched to the original teabags (nylon and polyethylene terephthalate) using Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The levels of nylon and polyethylene terephthalate particles released from the teabag packaging are several orders of magnitude higher than plastic loads previously reported in other foods. An initial acute invertebrate toxicity assessment shows that exposure to only the particles released from the teabags caused dose-dependent behavioral and developmental effects. ",
        "Versatile biomanufacturing through stimulus-responsive cell-material feedback. Small-scale production of biologics has great potential for enhancing the accessibility of biomanufacturing. By exploiting cell-material feedback, we have designed a concise platform to achieve versatile production, analysis and purification of diverse proteins and protein complexes. The core of our technology is a microbial swarmbot, which consists of a stimulus-sensitive polymeric microcapsule encapsulating engineered bacteria. By sensing the confinement, the bacteria undergo programmed partial lysis at a high local density. Conversely, the encapsulating material shrinks responding to the changing chemical environment caused by cell growth, squeezing out the protein products released by bacterial lysis. This platform is then integrated with downstream modules to enable quantification of enzymatic kinetics, purification of diverse proteins, quantitative control of protein interactions and assembly of functional protein complexes and multienzyme metabolic pathways. Our work demonstrates the use of the cell-material feedback to engineer a modular and flexible platform with sophisticated yet well-defined programmed functions. ",
        "Cooking shapes the structure and function of the gut microbiome. Diet is a critical determinant of variation in gut microbial structure and function, outweighing even host genetics1-3. Numerous microbiome studies have compared diets with divergent ingredients1-5, but the everyday practice of cooking remains understudied. Here, we show that a plant diet served raw versus cooked reshapes the murine gut microbiome, with effects attributable to improvements in starch digestibility and degradation of plant-derived compounds. Shifts in the gut microbiota modulated host energy status, applied across multiple starch-rich plants, and were detectable in humans. Thus, diet-driven host-microbial interactions depend on the food as well as its form. Because cooking is human-specific, ubiquitous and ancient6,7, our results prompt the hypothesis that humans and our microbiomes co-evolved under unique cooking-related pressures. ",
        "Alcoholics Anonymous and other 12-step programs for alcohol use disorder. BACKGROUND: Alcohol use disorder (AUD) confers a prodigious burden of disease, disability, premature mortality, and high economic costs from lost productivity, accidents, violence, incarceration, and increased healthcare utilization. For over 80 years, Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) has been a widespread AUD recovery organization, with millions of members and treatment free at the point of access, but it is only recently that rigorous research on its effectiveness has been conducted. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate whether peer-led AA and professionally-delivered treatments that facilitate AA involvement (Twelve-Step Facilitation (TSF) interventions) achieve important outcomes, specifically: abstinence, reduced drinking intensity, reduced alcohol-related consequences, alcohol addiction severity, and healthcare cost offsets. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Drugs and Alcohol Group Specialized Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), PubMed, Embase, CINAHL and PsycINFO from inception to 2 August 2019. We searched for ongoing and unpublished studies via ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) on 15 November 2018. All searches included non-English language literature. We handsearched references of topic-related systematic reviews and bibliographies of included studies. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs), quasi-RCTs and non-randomized studies that compared AA or TSF (AA/TSF) with other interventions, such as motivational enhancement therapy (MET) or cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), TSF treatment variants, or no treatment. We also included healthcare cost offset studies. Participants were non-coerced adults with AUD. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We categorized studies by: study design (RCT/quasi-RCT; non-randomized; economic); degree of standardized manualization (all interventions manualized versus some/none); and comparison intervention type (i.e. whether AA/TSF was compared to an intervention with a different theoretical orientation or an AA/TSF intervention that varied in style or intensity). For analyses, we followed Cochrane methodology calculating the standard mean difference (SMD) for continuous variables (e.g. percent days abstinent (PDA)) or the relative risk (risk ratios (RRs)) for dichotomous variables. We conducted random-effects meta-analyses to pool effects wherever possible. MAIN RESULTS: We included 27 studies containing 10,565 participants (21 RCTs/quasi-RCTs, 5 non-randomized, and 1 purely economic study). The average age of participants within studies ranged from 34.2 to 51.0 years. AA/TSF was compared with psychological clinical interventions, such as MET and CBT, and other 12-step program variants. We rated selection bias as being at high risk in 11 of the 27 included studies, unclear in three, and as low risk in 13. We rated risk of attrition bias as high risk in nine studies, unclear in 14, and low in four, due to moderate (> 20%) attrition rates in the study overall (8 studies), or in study treatment group (1 study). Risk of bias due to inadequate researcher blinding was high in one study, unclear in 22, and low in four. Risks of bias arising from the remaining domains were predominantly low or unclear. AA/TSF (manualized) compared to treatments with a different theoretical orientation (e.g. CBT) (randomized/quasi-randomized evidence) RCTs comparing manualized AA/TSF to other clinical interventions (e.g. CBT), showed AA/TSF improves rates of continuous abstinence at 12 months (risk ratio (RR) 1.21, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.03 to 1.42; 2 studies, 1936 participants; high-certainty evidence). This effect remained consistent at both 24 and 36 months. For percentage days abstinent (PDA), AA/TSF appears to perform as well as other clinical interventions at 12 months (mean difference (MD) 3.03, 95% CI -4.36 to 10.43; 4 studies, 1999 participants; very low-certainty evidence), and better at 24 months (MD 12.91, 95% CI 7.55 to 18.29; 2 studies, 302 participants; low-certainty evidence) and 36 months (MD 6.64, 95% CI 1.54 to 11.75; 1 study, 806 participants; low-certainty evidence). For longest period of abstinence (LPA), AA/TSF may perform as well as comparison interventions at six months (MD 0.60, 95% CI -0.30 to 1.50; 2 studies, 136 participants; low-certainty evidence). For drinking intensity, AA/TSF may perform as well as other clinical interventions at 12 months, as measured by drinks per drinking day (DDD) (MD -0.17, 95% CI -1.11 to 0.77; 1 study, 1516 participants; moderate-certainty evidence) and percentage days heavy drinking (PDHD) (MD -5.51, 95% CI -14.15 to 3.13; 1 study, 91 participants; low-certainty evidence). For alcohol-related consequences, AA/TSF probably performs as well as other clinical interventions at 12 months (MD -2.88, 95% CI -6.81 to 1.04; 3 studies, 1762 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). For alcohol addiction severity, one study found evidence of a difference in favor of AA/TSF at 12 months (P < 0.05; low-certainty evidence). AA/TSF (non-manualized) compared to treatments with a different theoretical orientation (e.g. CBT) (randomized/quasi-randomized evidence) For the proportion of participants completely abstinent, non-manualized AA/TSF may perform as well as other clinical interventions at three to nine months follow-up (RR 1.71, 95% CI 0.70 to 4.18; 1 study, 93 participants; low-certainty evidence). Non-manualized AA/TSF may also perform slightly better than other clinical interventions for PDA (MD 3.00, 95% CI 0.31 to 5.69; 1 study, 93 participants; low-certainty evidence). For drinking intensity, AA/TSF may perform as well as other clinical interventions at nine months, as measured by DDD (MD -1.76, 95% CI -2.23 to -1.29; 1 study, 93 participants; very low-certainty evidence) and PDHD (MD 2.09, 95% CI -1.24 to 5.42; 1 study, 286 participants; low-certainty evidence). None of the RCTs comparing non-manualized AA/TSF to other clinical interventions assessed LPA, alcohol-related consequences, or alcohol addiction severity. Cost-effectiveness studies In three studies, AA/TSF had higher healthcare cost savings than outpatient treatment, CBT, and no AA/TSF treatment. The fourth study found that total medical care costs decreased for participants attending CBT, MET, and AA/TSF treatment, but that among participants with worse prognostic characteristics AA/TSF had higher potential cost savings than MET (moderate-certainty evidence). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is high quality evidence that manualized AA/TSF interventions are more effective than other established treatments, such as CBT, for increasing abstinence. Non-manualized AA/TSF may perform as well as these other established treatments. AA/TSF interventions, both manualized and non-manualized, may be at least as effective as other treatments for other alcohol-related outcomes. AA/TSF probably produces substantial healthcare cost savings among people with alcohol use disorder. ",
        "Glucocorticoid prescribing habits of sports medicine physicians working in high-performance sport: a 30-nation survey. OBJECTIVES: Glucocorticoids are commonly prescribed in medicine. When administered via certain routes, glucocorticoids are prohibited for incompetition use by WADA. The glucocorticoid prescribing habits of sports medicine doctors have not been reported. METHODS: An online survey was distributed internationally to physicians working in high-performance sports. The survey queried the doctors about their use of glucocorticoids with athletes and their understanding of WADA's regulations regarding glucocorticoid use in competition. RESULTS: 603 sports medicine doctors from 30 different countries participated. The majority (>85%) routinely injected glucocorticoids and/or prescribed glucocorticoids by other routes. There were substantial differences in the common routes of injection as well as types of glucocorticoid used among the physicians from various countries. A relatively small percentage of sports doctors (<25%) accurately identified which routes of glucocorticoid administration are prohibited in competition by WADA. There was a great variation in how long before competition the use of glucocorticoids would cause the doctor to consider applying for a therapeutic use exemption (TUE). A better understanding of the clearance rates of glucocorticoids from athletes' bodies would greatly aid sports medicine doctors' decisions on how and when to apply for a TUE. A small number of doctors had observed side effects of glucocorticoid administration, with the majority of side effects being minor in nature. CONCLUSION: Glucocorticoids are widely prescribed by sports physicians. There is a need to better educate sports physicians on the current WADA regulations in relation to glucocorticoid administration. ",
        "Suicide Rates by Industry and Occupation - National Violent Death Reporting System, 32 States, 2016. In 2017, nearly 38,000 persons of working age (16-64 years) in the United States died by suicide, which represents a 40% rate increase (12.9 per 100,000 population in 2000 to 18.0 in 2017) in less than 2 decades.* To inform suicide prevention, CDC analyzed suicide data by industry and occupation among working-age decedents presumed to be employed at the time of death from the 32 states participating in the 2016 National Violent Death Reporting System (NVDRS).\u2020,\u00a7 Compared with rates in the total study population, suicide rates were significantly higher in five major industry groups: 1) Mining, Quarrying, and Oil and Gas Extraction (males); 2) Construction (males); 3) Other Services (e.g., automotive repair) (males); 4) Agriculture, Forestry, Fishing, and Hunting (males); and 5) Transportation and Warehousing (males and females). Rates were also significantly higher in six major occupational groups: 1) Construction and Extraction (males and females); 2) Installation, Maintenance, and Repair (males); 3) Arts, Design, Entertainment, Sports, and Media (males); 4) Transportation and Material Moving (males and females); 5) Protective Service (females); and 6) Healthcare Support (females). Rates for detailed occupational groups (e.g., Electricians or Carpenters within the Construction and Extraction major group) are presented and provide insight into the differences in suicide rates within major occupational groups.

        "Sexual Orientation and Suicide Attempt Disparities Among US Adolescents: 2009-2017. BACKGROUND: Sexual minority adolescents face mental health disparities relative to heterosexual adolescents. We evaluated temporal changes in US adolescent reported sexual orientation and suicide attempts by sexual orientation. METHODS: We used Youth Risk Behavioral Surveillance data from 6 states that collected data on sexual orientation identity and 4 states that collected data on sex of sexual contacts continuously between 2009 and 2017. We estimated odds ratios using logistic regression models to evaluate changes in reported sexual orientation identity, sex of consensual sexual contacts, and suicide attempts over time and calculated marginal effects (MEs). RESULTS: The proportion of adolescents reporting minority sexual orientation identity nearly doubled, from 7.3% in 2009 to 14.3% in 2017 (ME: 0.8 percentage points [pp] per year; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.6 to 0.9 pp). The proportion of adolescents reporting any same-sex sexual contact increased by 70%, from 7.7% in 2009 to 13.1% in 2017 (ME: 0.6 pp per year; 95% CI: 0.4 to 0.8 pp). Although suicide attempts declined among students identifying as sexual minorities (ME: -0.8 pp per year; 95% CI: -1.4 to -0.2 pp), these students remained >3 times more likely to attempt suicide relative to heterosexual students in 2017. Sexual minority adolescents accounted for an increasing proportion of all adolescent suicide attempts. CONCLUSIONS: The proportion of adolescents reporting sexual minority identity and same-sex sexual contacts increased between 2009 and 2017. Disparities in suicide attempts persist. Developing and implementing approaches to reducing sexual minority youth suicide is critically important. Suicidal Ideation and Behavior Among Sexual Minority and Heterosexual Youth: 1995-2017. OBJECTIVES: In this study, we determined trends in prevalence of suicidal thoughts and behaviors among lesbian, gay, bisexual, and heterosexual youth from 1995 to 2017 using population-based surveillance data. METHODS: Data were drawn from the Massachusetts Youth Risk Behavior Survey from 1995 to 2017 (unweighted N = 41\u2009636). The annual percent change (APC) in prevalence of suicidal ideation, plans, and attempts was stratified by sexual orientation as indexed by sexual identity and sexual behavior. RESULTS: Among sexual minority youth, prevalence rates declined over the entire study period for suicidal ideation (APCsexual identity = -1.25; APCsexual behavior = -1.83), plans (APCsexual identity = -1.88; APCsexual behavior = -1.95), and attempts (APCsexual identity = -2.64; APCsexual behavior = -2.47). Among heterosexual youth, prevalence rates declined from 1995 to 2007 for suicidal ideation (APCsexual identity = -6.67; APCsexual behavior = -6.77) and plans (APCsexual identity = -5.73; APCsexual behavior = -6.25). These declines in ideation and plans were steeper than those for sexual minority youth. Prevalence of suicide attempts declined across the entire study period among heterosexual youth (APCsexual identity = -3.66; APCsexual behavior = -4.01). Prevalence of all 3 outcomes remained markedly high among sexual minority youth across the 23-year study period. CONCLUSIONS: Although suicidal thoughts and behavior have generally declined among sexual minority and heterosexual youth, disparities in these outcomes persist, and their prevalence among sexual minority youth has remained consistently elevated. Prioritized screening for risk for suicidal thoughts and behaviors in this vulnerable population is imperative to reduce disparities and prevalence of these outcomes. ",
        "Impact of banning smoking in cars with children on exposure to second-hand smoke: a natural experiment in England and Scotland. England banned smoking in cars carrying children in 2015 and Scotland in 2016. We used survey data from 3\u2009years for both countries (NEngland=3483-6920, NScotland=232-319) to assess effects of the English ban using logistic regression within a difference-in-differences framework. Among children aged 13-15 years, self-reported levels of regular exposure to smoke in cars for Scotland were 3.4% in 2012, 2.2% in 2014 and 1.3% in 2016 and for England 6.3%, 5.9% and 1.6%. The ban in England was associated with a -4.1% (95% CI -4.9% to -3.3%) absolute reduction (72% relative reduction) in exposure to tobacco smoke among children. ",
        "Later school start times in a flexible system improve teenage sleep. Sleep deprivation in teenage students is pervasive and a public-health concern, but evidence is accumulating that delaying school start times may be an effective countermeasure. Most studies so far assessed static changes in schools start time, using cross-sectional comparisons and one-off sleep measures. When a high school in Germany introduced flexible start times for their senior students - allowing them to choose daily between an 8AM or 9AM-start (\u226508:50) - we monitored students' sleep longitudinally using subjective and objective measures. Students (10-12th grade, 15-19y) were followed 3 weeks prior and 6 weeks into the flexible system via daily sleep diaries (n=65) and a sub-cohort via continuous wrist-actimetry (n=37). Satisfaction and perceived cognitive outcomes were surveyed at study end. Comparisons between 8AM and \u22659AM-starts within the flexible system demonstrated that students slept 1.1h longer when starting school later - independent of gender, grade, chronotype and frequency of later starts; sleep offsets were delayed but, importantly, onsets remained unchanged. Sleep quality was increased and alarm-driven waking reduced. However, overall sleep duration in the flexible system was not extended compared to baseline - likely because students did not start later frequently enough. Nonetheless, students were highly satisfied with the flexible system and reported cognitive and sleep improvements. Therefore, flexible systems may present a viable alternative for implementing later school starts to improve teenage sleep - if students can be encouraged to use the late-option frequently enough. Flexibility may increase acceptance of school start changes and speculatively even prevent delays in sleep onsets through occasional early starts. ",
        "Trends in Smoking Behaviors Among US Adolescent Cigarette Smokers. INTRODUCTION: Identifying trends in smoking behaviors among youth cigarette smokers could inform youth policy and interventions. METHODS: Using 2011-2018 National Youth Tobacco Survey data, logistic/linear regressions were used to analyze trends in smoking frequency, intensity, age of first cigarette use, and electronic cigarette (e-cigarette) use frequency among current smokers. Stratified analyses were conducted among male, female, middle school, and high school students and race and ethnicity subgroups separately. RESULTS: From 2011 to 2018, there was a decrease in smoking \u226510 days (50.0% to 38.3%), \u226520 days (37.2% to 26.3%), and 30 days (26.6% to 18.2%) among current smokers. Smoking prevalence decreased among male, female, high school, non-Hispanic white, and non-Hispanic other students. Overall, light smoking (\u22645 cigarettes per day [CPDs]) increased (76.6% to 82.7%), and moderate smoking (6-10 CPDs) decreased (10.7% to 8.3%). Trends in light, moderate, and heavy smoking varied by demographic groups. Age at first cigarette use increased among female (12.28 to 13.29), high school (12.91 to 13.18), and non-Hispanic other students (11.64 to 12.83) and decreased among male students (12.90 to 12.57). From 2014 to 2018, there was an increase in e-cigarette use frequency for \u226510 days (20.8% to 40.9%), \u226520 days (13.5% to 31.7%), and all 30 days (9.3% to 22%). CONCLUSIONS: From 2011 to 2018, current youth cigarette smokers smoked fewer days and fewer CPDs, and age of first cigarette use increased. However, over time, male youth smoked more heavily and started smoking earlier. E-cigarette use increased from 2014 to 2018. Differences by demographic characteristics can inform future research and interventions. The great decline in adolescent cigarette smoking since 2000: consequences for drug use among US adolescents. OBJECTIVE: Adolescent cigarette smoking declined steadily and substantially from 2000 to 2018. This paper considers the potential consequences of this 'great decline' for the prevalence of other drug use among adolescents. METHODS: Data are annual, cross-sectional, nationally representative Monitoring the Future surveys of more than 1.2\u2009million US students in 12th, 10th and 8th grades from 2000 to 2018. Analyses include trends in the past 12 months' non-medical amphetamine, tranquillisers and opioid use overall, among ever and never cigarette smokers, and projected if adolescent cigarette smoking levels had remained at 2000 levels. RESULTS: Within groups of ever and never cigarette smokers, the prevalence for each of the three substances has either changed little or overall increased in 2018 as compared with 2000. When the two groups were combined into one pool, the overall prevalence for each of the drugs declined by about half. The decline resulted from the growing group of never smokers, whose levels of non-medical drug use over the study period were at least four times lower than the levels of ever smokers. CONCLUSIONS: The results support the 'gateway' prediction that declines in cigarette smoking among adolescents pull downward their non-medical use of amphetamines, tranquillisers and opioids. Continuing to reduce adolescent smoking through policy and programmatic prevention efforts should have further positive spillover effects on adolescent drug use. ",
        "Plight of the distracted pedestrian: a research synthesis and meta-analysis of mobile phone use on crossing behaviour. BACKGROUND: Pedestrians are commonly involved in vehicle collisions that result in injuries and fatalities. Pedestrian distraction has become an emerging safety issue as more pedestrians use their mobile phones while walking and crossing the street. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this research synthesis and meta-analysis is to determine the extent to which cell phone conversation, text messaging or browsing, and listening to music affect a number of common pedestrian behavioural measures. METHODS: A keyword search was developed with a subject librarian that used MeSH terms from selected databases including PsycINFO, SPORTDiscus, Medline and TRID. Supplemental searches were also conducted with Google Scholar and Mendeley. EFFECT SIZE CODING: Thirty-three studies met inclusion criteria and were subjected to data extraction. Statistical information (ie, M, SD, SE, 95%\u2009CI, OR, F, t) was extracted to generate standardised mean difference effect sizes (ie, Cohen's d) and r effect sizes. RESULTS: Fourteen experimental studies were ultimately included in an N-weighted meta-analysis (k=81 effect sizes), and eight observational studies were included in a qualitative overview. Both mobile phone conversation and text messaging increased rates of hits and close calls. Texting decreased rates of looking left and right prior to and/or during street crossing. As might be expected, text messaging was generally found to have the most detrimental effect on multiple behavioural measures.

        "Review of Published Curriculum on Sex Trafficking for Undergraduate Medical Trainees. Educational councils and medical societies recommend that medical students learn to recognize and care for victims of sex trafficking. Previous research has found that healthcare providers are one of the few professionals to interact with sex trafficking victims during exploitation. This review evaluates currently published curricular and extracurricular U.S. medical education resources. A literature review of MEDLINE, PubMed, Embase, MedEdPORTAL, Google Scholar, and Google was conducted in December 2018 to January 2019 using the search terms: human trafficking OR sex traffic OR sex violence OR sex work OR sex exploitation OR child prostitution AND education, medical, undergraduate OR students, medical OR medical student or medical education OR education, medical. The inclusion criteria included informational educational materials for medical students on sex trafficking. Studies were excluded for: non-English language, empirical research on sex trafficking, nonhealth or nonundergraduate medical students, and resources focused on other sexual health topics. The database literature search uncovered 64 scholarly articles. Inclusion criteria were met by 4 articles; 2 articles were added from a reference review, and an additional 5 articles were found from an Internet search. These 11 resources provided educational materials relevant to medical students on sex trafficking themes, including scope, consequences, identification, treatment, referral, legal, security, and prevention. The curricula demonstrated a wide variability in delivery method, length, and scope. A limited published sex trafficking curriculum exists for medical student learners. Future research evaluating unpublished curricula within U.S. medical schools is necessary to coordinate efforts for standardized and robust sex trafficking education. ",
        "Parent coaching increases conversational turns and advances infant language development. Parental language input is one of the best predictors of children's language achievement. Parentese, a near-universal speaking style distinguished by higher pitch, slower tempo, and exaggerated intonation, has been documented in speech directed toward young children in many countries. Previous research shows that the use of parentese and parent-child turn-taking are both associated with advances in children's language learning. We conducted a randomized controlled trial to determine whether a parent coaching intervention delivered when the infants are 6, 10, and 14 mo of age can enhance parental language input and whether this, in turn, changes the trajectory of child language development between 6 and 18 mo of age. Families of typically developing 6-mo-old infants (n = 71) were randomly assigned to intervention and control groups. Naturalistic first-person audio recordings of the infants' home language environment and vocalizations were recorded when the infants were 6, 10, 14, and 18 mo of age. After the 6-, 10-, and 14-mo recordings, intervention, but not control parents attended individual coaching appointments to receive linguistic feedback, listen to language input in their own recordings, and discuss age-appropriate activities that promote language growth. Intervention significantly enhanced parental use of parentese and parent-child turn-taking between 6 and 18 mo. Increases in both variables were significantly correlated with children's language growth during the same period, and children's language outcomes at 18 mo. Using parentese, a socially and linguistically enhanced speaking style, improves children's social language turn-taking and language skills. Research-based interventions targeting social aspects of parent-child interactions can enhance language outcomes. ",
        "Transgender Youth's Disclosure of Gender Identity to Providers Outside of Specialized Gender Centers. PURPOSE: Transgender youth face significant health disparities and multiple barriers to receiving quality health care. Gender identity disclosure to health care providers (HCPs) is an important step in creating affirming relationships for transgender youth. The objectives of this study were to (1)\u00a0determine the prevalence of voluntary disclosure and intentional avoidance to HCPs outside of gender clinics, (2) identify factors associated with voluntary disclosure and intentional avoidance, and (3) elucidate strategies to increase comfort with disclosure. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was administered to transgender youth aged 12-26\u00a0years. Bivariate analyses were conducted using \u03c72 or Fisher's exact tests. Two logistic regression models for each outcome variable were used to examine factors associated with voluntary disclosure and intentional avoidance. RESULTS: Two thirds (65%) of youth (N\u00a0= 153) identified as transmasculine, and 57% were under 18\u00a0years. Three-quarters (78%) had voluntarily disclosed their gender identity to an HCP outside of gender clinic, whereas 46% had intentionally avoided disclosure. Odds ratios (ORs) of ever having disclosed were lower for participants \u226518 years (OR\u00a0= .33; 95% confidence interval [CI]: .11-.98), those out to fewer people (OR\u00a0= .12; 95% CI: .02-.81) and out for <1\u00a0year (OR\u00a0= .03; 95% CI: .004-.31). Odds of intentional avoidance were lower among youth with higher perceived parental support (OR\u00a0= .83; 95% CI: .70-.98). CONCLUSION: A majority of transgender youth reported having voluntarily disclosed their gender identity to an HCP outside of gender clinic, but almost half reported having intentionally avoided disclosure when they felt it was important. Parental support may play a protective role in mitigating avoidance. ",
        "Changes in Motor Skill Proficiency After Equine-Assisted Activities and Brain-Building Tasks in Youth With Neurodevelopmental Disorders. There is a lack of current research to support the efficacy of a combination of equine-assisted activities (EAA) and brain building activities to influence motor skill competencies in youth with neurodevelopmental disorders (ND). The primary objective of this study was to quantify changes in motor skill proficiency before and after 8 weeks of EAA and brain-building activities in youth with ND. A secondary objective was to quantify changes in motor skill proficiency before and after 1 year of EAA and brain-building activities in youth with ND. Twenty-five youth completed the same 32-week protocol that was separated into 4, 8-week blocks, in the following order: (1) control; (2) EAA-only; (3) washout; (4) GaitWay block (EAA and brain building activities). Before and after each block, motor skills were assessed using the Short Form of the Bruininks-Oseretsky Test of Motor Proficiency-Version 2 (BOT-2). Seven youth continued with the GaitWay intervention for one additional year, and the BOT-2 Short Form was also administered following this intervention. A repeated-measures analysis-of-variance was performed to compare BOT-2 subtest and overall scores between interventions with a significance of 0.05. Manual dexterity was higher at Post-Washout [3.3 (2.4)] vs. Pre-Control [2.2 (2.1); p = 0.018] and Post-Control [2.6 (2.0); p = 0.024], and at Post-GaitWay vs. Pre-Control [3.2 (2.4) vs. 2.2 (2.1); p = 0.037]. Upper-limb coordination was higher at Post-GaitWay vs. Post-Control [6.0 (4.1) vs. 3.9 (3.8); p = 0.050]. When compared to Pre-Control [3.2 (3.0)], strength was higher at Post-EAA [4.9 (3.5); p = 0.028] and at Post-GaitWay [5.2 (2.9); p = 0.015]. Overall scores were higher at Post-GaitWay [39.1 (22.2)] when compared to Pre-Control [32.4 (21.6); p = 0.003] and Post-Control [32.5 (21.9); p = 0.009]. Additionally, motor skills were maintained for 1 year following the Post-GaitWay testing session among seven participants. This is the first known study to include and demonstrate the short-term and long-term effects of a combination of EAA and brain building activities with motor proficiency in youth with ND.

        "Colorectal cancer statistics, 2020. Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second most common cause of cancer death in the United States. Every 3\u00a0years, the American Cancer Society provides an update of CRC occurrence based on incidence data (available through 2016) from population-based cancer registries and mortality data (through 2017) from the National Center for Health Statistics. In 2020, approximately 147,950 individuals will be diagnosed with CRC and 53,200 will die from the disease, including 17,930 cases and 3,640 deaths in individuals aged younger than 50\u00a0years. The incidence rate during 2012 through 2016 ranged from 30 (per 100,000 persons) in Asian/Pacific Islanders to 45.7 in blacks and 89 in Alaska Natives. Rapid declines in incidence among screening-aged individuals during the 2000s continued during 2011 through 2016 in those aged 65\u00a0years and older (by 3.3% annually) but reversed in those aged 50 to 64\u00a0years, among whom rates increased by 1% annually. Among individuals aged younger than 50\u00a0years, the incidence rate increased by approximately 2% annually for tumors in the proximal and distal colon, as well as the rectum, driven by trends in non-Hispanic whites. CRC death rates during 2008 through 2017 declined by 3% annually in individuals aged 65\u00a0years and older and by 0.6% annually in individuals aged 50 to 64\u00a0years while increasing by 1.3% annually in those aged younger than 50\u00a0years. Mortality declines among individuals aged 50\u00a0years and older were steepest among blacks, who also had the only decreasing trend among those aged younger than 50\u00a0years, and excluded American Indians/Alaska Natives, among whom rates remained stable. Progress against CRC can be accelerated by increasing access to guideline-recommended screening and high-quality treatment, particularly among Alaska Natives, and elucidating causes for rising incidence in young and middle-aged adults.

        "CRISPR-engineered T cells in patients with refractory cancer. CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing provides a powerful tool to enhance the natural ability of human T cells to fight cancer. We report a first-in-human phase 1 clinical trial to test the safety and feasibility of multiplex CRISPR-Cas9 editing to engineer T cells in three patients with refractory cancer. Two genes encoding the endogenous T cell receptor (TCR) chains, TCR\u03b1 (TRAC) and TCR\u03b2 (TRBC), were deleted in T cells to reduce TCR mispairing and to enhance the expression of a synthetic, cancer-specific TCR transgene (NY-ESO-1). Removal of a third gene encoding programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1; PDCD1), was performed to improve antitumor immunity. Adoptive transfer of engineered T cells into patients resulted in durable engraftment with edits at all three genomic loci. Although chromosomal translocations were detected, the frequency decreased over time. Modified T cells persisted for up to 9 months, suggesting that immunogenicity is minimal under these conditions and demonstrating the feasibility of CRISPR gene editing for cancer immunotherapy. ",
        "Declining Use of Primary Care Among Commercially Insured Adults in the United States, 2008-2016. Background: Primary care is known to improve outcomes and lower health care costs, prompting recent U.S. policy efforts to expand its role. Nonetheless, there is early evidence of a decline in per capita primary care visit rates, and little is understood about what is contributing to the decline. Objective: To describe primary care provider (PCP) visit trends among adults enrolled with a large, national, commercial insurer and assess factors underlying a potential decline in PCP visits. Design: Descriptive repeated cross-sectional study using 100% deidentified claims data from the insurer, 2008-2016. A 5% claims sample was used for Poisson regression models to quantify visit trends. Setting: National, population-based. Participants: Adult health plan members aged 18 to 64 years. Measurements: PCP visit rates per 100 member-years. Results: In total, 142 million primary care visits among 94 million member-years were examined. Visits to PCPs declined by 24.2%, from 169.5 to 134.3 visits per 100 member-years, while the proportion of adults with no PCP visits in a given year rose from 38.1% to 46.4%. Rates of visits addressing low-acuity conditions decreased by 47.7% (95% CI, -48.1% to -47.3%). The decline was largest among the youngest adults (-27.6% [CI, -28.2% to -27.1%]), those without chronic conditions (-26.4% [CI, -26.7% to -26.1%]), and those living in the lowest-income areas (-31.4% [CI, -31.8% to -30.9%]). Out-of-pocket cost per problem-based visit rose by $9.4 (31.5%). Visit rates to specialists remained stable (-0.08% [CI, -0.56% to 0.40%]), and visits to alternative venues, such as urgent care clinics, increased by 46.9% (CI, 45.8% to 48.1%). Limitation: Data were limited to a single commercial insurer and did not capture nonbilled clinician-patient interactions. Conclusion: Commercially insured adults have been visiting PCPs less often, and nearly one half had no PCP visits in a given year by 2016. Our results suggest that this decline may be explained by decreased real or perceived visit needs, financial deterrents, and use of alternative sources of care. Primary Funding Source: None. ",
        "Trends in late mortality among adolescent and young adult (AYA) cancer survivors. BACKGROUND: Over the past several decades, treatment of cancer in adolescents and young adults (AYAs) has evolved substantially, leading to steady improvements in estimated five-year survival at diagnosis. However, the impact on late mortality in this population is largely unexamined. We investigated temporal trends in mortality among five-year AYA cancer survivors. METHODS: The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database was used to identify AYAs (age 15-39) diagnosed with cancer during 1975-2011 who survived \u22655 years beyond diagnosis. Survival months were accrued from five years post-diagnosis until death or end of 2016. Cumulative mortality from all causes, the primary cancer, other cancers, and noncancer/nonexternal causes (i.e. excluding accidents, suicide, homicide) were estimated according to diagnosis era. RESULTS: Among 282,969 five-year AYA cancer survivors, five-year mortality (i.e. from 5 through 10 years post-diagnosis) from all causes decreased from 8.3% (95% CI: 8.0%-8.6%) among those diagnosed in 1975-1984 to 5.4% (95% CI: 5.3%-5.6%) among those diagnosed in 2005-2011. This was largely explained by decreases in mortality from the primary cancer (6.8% to 4.2%) between these periods. However, for specific cancer types, including colorectal, bone, sarcomas, cervical/uterine, and bladder, cumulative mortality curves demonstrated little improvement in primary cancer-mortality over time. Some reduction in late mortality from noncancer/nonexternal causes was apparent for Hodgkin lymphoma, leukemia, kidney cancer, head and neck cancers, and trachea, lung, and bronchus cancers. CONCLUSION: Over the past four decades, all-cause and cancer-specific mortality have decreased among five-year AYA cancer survivors overall, but several cancer types have not shared in these improvements.

        "Medical marijuana and workers' compensation claiming. We study the effect of state medical marijuana laws (MMLs) on workers' compensation (WC) claiming among adults. Medical marijuana is plausibly related to WC claiming by allowing improved symptom management, and thus reduced need for the benefit, among injured or ill workers. We use data on claiming drawn from the Annual Social and Economic supplement to the Current Population Survey over the period 1989 to 2012, coupled with a differences-in-differences design to provide the first evidence on this relationship. Our estimates show that, post MML, WC claiming declines, both the propensity to claim and the level of income from WC. These findings suggest that medical marijuana can allow workers to better manage symptoms associated with workplace injuries and illnesses and, in turn, reduce need for WC. However, the reductions in WC claiming post MML are very modest in size. ",
        "Mouthguard use in youth ice hockey and the risk of concussion: nested case-control study of 315 cases. BACKGROUND: Concussion is the most common injury in youth ice hockey. Whether mouthguard use lowers the odds of concussion remains an unanswered question. OBJECTIVE: To determine the association between concussion and mouthguard use in youth ice hockey. METHODS: Nested case-control design. Cases and controls were identified from two prospective cohort studies using valid injury surveillance methods. Cases were players concussed during a game or practice; controls were players who sustained a non-concussion injury during a game or practice. The primary exposure was mouthguard use at time of injury; mouthguard type (dental custom fit or off the shelf) was a secondary exposure. Physician-diagnosed or therapist-suspected concussion was the primary outcome. Dental injury was a secondary outcome. Multilevel logistic regression with random effect at a team level was used to obtain ORs for the mouthguard effect, adjusted for level of play, age group, position, concussion history, mechanism of injury, cohort, session type and body checking policy. RESULTS: Among cases, 236/315 (75%) were wearing a mouthguard at time of injury, while 224/270 (83%) controls were wearing a mouthguard at time of injury. Any mouthguard use was associated with an adjusted OR for concussion of 0.36 (95% CI 0.17 to 0.73). Off-the-shelf mouthguards were associated with a 69% lower odds of concussion (adjusted OR: 0.31; 95%\u2009CI 0.14 to 0.65). Dental custom-fit mouthguards were associated with a non-significant 49% lower odds of concussion (adjusted OR: 0.51; 95%\u2009CI 0.22 to 1.10). No dental injuries were identified in either cohort. CONCLUSION: Mouthguard use was associated with lower odds of concussion. Players should be required to wear mouthguards in youth ice hockey. ",
        "Association of egg intake with blood lipids, cardiovascular disease, and mortality in 177,000 people in 50 countries. BACKGROUND: Eggs are a rich source of essential nutrients, but they are also a source of dietary cholesterol. Therefore, some guidelines recommend limiting egg consumption. However, there is contradictory evidence on the impact of eggs on diseases, largely based on studies conducted in high-income countries. OBJECTIVES: Our aim was to assess the association of egg consumption with blood lipids, cardiovascular disease (CVD), and mortality in large global studies involving populations from low-, middle-, and high-income countries. METHODS: We studied 146,011 individuals from 21 countries in the Prospective Urban Rural Epidemiology (PURE) study. Egg consumption was recorded using country-specific validated FFQs. We also studied 31,544 patients with vascular disease in 2 multinational prospective studies: ONTARGET (Ongoing Telmisartan Alone and in Combination with Ramipril Global End Point Trial) and TRANSCEND (Telmisartan Randomized Assessment Study in ACEI Intolerant Subjects with Cardiovascular Disease). We calculated HRs using multivariable Cox frailty models with random intercepts to account for clustering by study center separately within each study. RESULTS: In the PURE study, we recorded 14,700 composite events (8932 deaths and 8477 CVD events). In the PURE study, after excluding those with history of CVD, higher intake of egg (\u22657 egg/wk compared with <1 egg/wk intake) was not significantly associated with blood lipids, composite outcome (HR: 0.96; 95% CI: 0.89, 1.04; P-trend\u00a0=\u00a00.74), total mortality (HR: 1.04; 95% CI: 0.94, 1.15; P-trend\u00a0=\u00a00.38), or major CVD (HR: 0.92; 95% CI: 0.83, 1.01; P-trend\u00a0=\u00a00.20). Similar results were observed in ONTARGET/TRANSCEND studies for composite outcome (HR 0.97; 95% CI: 0.76, 1.25; P-trend\u00a0=\u00a00.09), total mortality (HR: 0.88; 95% CI: 0.62, 1.24; P-trend\u00a0=\u00a00.55), and major CVD (HR: 0.97; 95% CI: 0.73, 1.29; P-trend\u00a0=\u00a00.12). CONCLUSIONS: In 3 large international prospective studies including \u223c177,000 individuals, 12,701 deaths, and 13,658 CVD events from 50 countries in 6 continents, we did not find significant associations between egg intake and blood lipids, mortality, or major CVD events. The ONTARGET and TRANSCEND trials were registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00153101. The PURE trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT03225586. ",
        "Sociodemographic Characteristics, Financial Worries and Serious Psychological Distress in U.S. Adults. Economic recessions have been well studied in relationship to poor mental health. However, subjective financial worries have not been examined relative to serious psychological distress (SPD), a measure of poor mental health. Adults 18 to 64\u00a0years in the cross-sectional 2016 National Health Interview Survey (n\u2009=\u200924,126) were examined for worries about paying for bills, serious medical events, expected medical costs, retirement, children's college tuition and maintaining a standard of living; by sociodemographic such as sex and race/ethnicity. Over 50% of adults reported two or more financial worries. In multivariate models, financial worries were associated with SPD. White adults at the lowest education level had the greatest proportion with SPD compared with all other race/ethnic groups. Women had greater risk for SPD and for each financial worry compared with men. Financial worries were prevalent in U.S. adults, were associated with increased risk for SPD, and varied by sex. ",
        "Human Rabies - Utah, 2018. On November 3, 2018, the Utah Department of Health (UDOH) was notified of a suspected human rabies case in a man aged 55 years. The patient's symptoms had begun 18 days earlier, and he was hospitalized for 15 days before rabies was suspected. As his symptoms worsened, he received supportive care, but he died on November 4. On November 7, a diagnosis of rabies was confirmed by CDC. This was the first documented rabies death in a Utah resident since 1944. This report summarizes the patient's clinical course and the subsequent public health investigation, which determined that the patient had handled several bats in the weeks preceding symptom onset. Public health agencies, in partnership with affected health care facilities, identified and assessed the risk to potentially exposed persons, facilitated receipt of postexposure prophylaxis (PEP), and provided education to health care providers and the community about the risk for rabies associated with bats. Human rabies is rare and almost always fatal. The findings from this investigation highlight the importance of early recognition of rabies, improved public awareness of rabies in bats, and the use of innovative tools after mass rabies exposure events to ensure rapid and recommended risk assessment and provision of PEP.

        "Chronic medical conditions and their association with crash risk and changes in driving habits: a prospective study of the GAZEL cohort. OBJECTIVES: To assess crash risk and driving habits associated with chronic medical conditions among drivers entering old age. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: French cohort GAZEL. PARTICIPANTS: 12\u2009460 drivers in the analysis of road traffic crash, among whom 11\u2009670 completed the follow-up period (2007-2014). We assessed driving cessation among 11\u2009633 participants over the same period, and mileage and driving avoidance among the 4973 participants who returned a road safety questionnaire in 2015. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Yearly occurrence of at least one road crash as a driver; time to driving cessation; mileage; driving avoidance: at night, with bad weather, in heavy traffic, with glare conditions, over long distances. RESULTS: Several potentially risky conditions (angina, myocardial infarction, coronary disease; stroke; nephritic colic, urinary stones; glaucoma) were associated with lower mileage and/or driving avoidance and did not increase crash risk. Neither driving avoidance nor lower mileage was found for other conditions associated with an increased crash risk: hearing difficulties (adjusted OR 1.19, 95%\u2009CI 1.06 to 1.34); joint disorders (1.17, 95%\u2009CI 1.06 to 1.30). Depression, anxietyandstress was associated with an increased crash risk (1.23, 95%\u2009CI 1.01 to 1.49) despite increased driving avoidance. Parkinson's disease was associated with driving cessation (adjusted HR 32.61, 95%\u2009CI 14.21 to 65.17). CONCLUSIONS: Depending on their condition, and probably on the associated risk perception, drivers entering old age report diverse driving habits. For example, hearing difficulties is a frequent condition, rarely considered a threat to road safety, and nonetheless associated with an increased crash risk. ",
        "Factors Associated with Physician Moral Distress Caring for Hospitalized Elderly Patients Needing a Surrogate Decision-maker: a Prospective Study. BACKGROUND: When working with surrogate decision-makers, physicians often encounter ethical challenges that may cause moral distress which can have negative consequences for physicians. OBJECTIVE: To determine frequency of and factors associated with physicians' moral distress caring for patients requiring a surrogate. DESIGN: Prospective survey. PARTICIPANTS: Physicians (n\u2009=\u2009154) caring for patients aged 65\u00a0years and older and their surrogate decision-makers (n\u2009=\u2009362 patient/surrogate dyads). Patients were admitted to medicine or medical intensive care services, lacked decisional capacity and had an identified surrogate. MAIN MEASURES: Moral distress thermometer. KEY RESULTS: Physicians experienced moral distress in the care of 152 of 362 patients (42.0%). In analyses adjusted for physician, patient, and surrogate characteristics, physician/surrogate discordance in preferences for the plan of care was not significantly associated with moral distress. Physicians were more likely to experience moral distress when caring for older patients (1.06, 1.02-1.10), and facing a decision about life-sustaining treatment (3.58, 1.54-8.32). Physicians were less likely to experience moral distress when caring for patients residing in a nursing home (0.40, 0.23-0.69), patients who previously discussed care preferences (0.56, 0.35-0.90), and higher surrogate ratings of emotional support from clinicians (0.94, 0.89-0.99). Physicians' internal discordance when they prefer a more comfort-focused plan than the patient is receiving was associated with significantly higher moral distress (2.22, 1.33-3.70) after adjusting for patient, surrogate, and physician characteristics. CONCLUSIONS: Physician moral distress occurs more frequently when the physician is male, the patient is older or requires decisions about life-sustaining treatments. These findings may help target interventions to support physicians. Prior discussions about patient wishes is associated with lower distress and may be a target for patient-centered interventions. ",
        "Characteristics and Health Status of Informal Unpaid Caregivers - 44 States, District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico, 2015-2017. In 2015, an estimated 17.7 million U.S. persons were informal caregivers who provided substantial services through in-home, unpaid assistance to their family members and friends (1). Caregiving can have many benefits, such as enhancing the bond between caregiver and recipient, but it can also place an emotional and physical strain on caregivers, leading to higher rates of depression, lower quality of life, and poorer overall health (2). As the U.S. population continues to age (3), the need for informal caregivers will likely increase. However, little nationally representative information on prevalence of caregivers is available. This study examined demographic characteristics and health status of informal caregivers from 44 states,* the District of Columbia (DC), and Puerto Rico, based on data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) collected during 2015-2017. Overall, approximately one in five adults reported that they had provided care to a family member or friend in the preceding 30 days. Fifty-eight percent of caregivers were women, and a majority were non-Hispanic white, with at least some college education, and married or living with a partner. Across all states, 19.2% of caregivers reported being in fair or poor health, although significant state-to-state variation occurred. Caregivers provide important support to family members, friends, and the health care system and might compromise their own health to provide this support (1,2). Better understanding of caregivers and the challenges they face could inform implementation of improvements in support systems that could enhance not only the health of the caregiver, but that of the care recipient as well. For example, additional data regarding demographics at the state level might aid in more effective planning and support of caregivers with evidence-based programs and assistance (https://www.cdc.gov/aging/publications/features/caring-for-yourself.html).

        "Evolving public views on the value of one's DNA and expectations for genomic database governance: Results from a national survey. We report results from a large survey of public attitudes regarding genomic database governance. Prior surveys focused on the context of academic-sponsored biobanks, framing data provision as altruistic donation; our survey is designed to reflect four growing trends: genomic databases are found across many sectors; they are used for more than academic biomedical research; their value is reflected in corporate transactions; and additional related privacy risks are coming to light. To examine how attitudes may evolve in response to these trends, we provided survey respondents with information from mainstream media coverage of them. We then found only 11.7% of respondents willing to altruistically donate their data, versus 50.6% willing to provide data if financially compensated, and 37.8% unwilling to provide data regardless of compensation. Because providing one's genomic data is sometimes bundled with receipt of a personalized genomic report, we also asked respondents what price they would be willing to pay for a personalized report. Subtracting that response value from one's expected compensation for providing data (if any) yields a net expected payment. For the altruistic donors, median net expected payment was -$75 (i.e. they expected to pay $75 for the bundle). For respondents wanting compensation for their data, however, median net expected payment was +$95 (i.e. they expected to receive $95). When asked about different genomic database governance policies, most respondents preferred options that allowed them more control over their data. In particular, they favored policies restricting data sharing or reuse unless permission is specifically granted by the individual. Policy preferences were also relatively consistent regardless of the sector in which the genomic database was located. Together these findings offer a forward-looking window on individual preferences that can be useful for institutions of all types as they develop governance approaches in this area of large-scale data sharing.

        "Brief Report: Accuracy in Self-Report of Viral Suppression Among HIV-Positive Men With HIV-Negative Male Partners. BACKGROUND: Among men who have sex with men, there is now clear evidence that the risk of HIV transmission through condomless sex when the HIV-positive partner is virally suppressed is effectively zero. However, an understanding of the accuracy of reporting of viral load among serodiscordant same-sex male couples is missing from the literature. SETTING: This analysis uses data from the baseline sample of Stronger Together, a randomized controlled efficacy trial of an innovative dyadic intervention to enhance antiretroviral therapy adherence for HIV serodiscordant male couples in 3 US cities (Atlanta, Boston, and Chicago). METHODS: Biomarker-confirmed and self-reported measures of viral load were used to assess the accuracy of self-report of viral suppression. In this descriptive analysis, the percentage of men who inaccurately reported being virally suppressed is compared across demographic, relationship, and HIV care characteristics. RESULTS: Results confirm those of other recent studies that have shown relatively high levels of inaccuracy in reporting of viral suppression. Although 72.5% of men could accurately report their viral load status, 20% reported that they were virally suppressed when they did not have a biomarker-confirmed measure of viral suppression. CONCLUSION: These results highlight the need to provide interventions to men who have sex with men living with HIV to support access to care and ensure current knowledge of viral load and to continue to support primary prevention of HIV through condom use and pre-exposure prophylaxis. For couples, particularly serodiscordant male couples, interventions that can teach the couple how to collaborate to achieve and maintain viral suppression for the positive partner are an urgent and pragmatic programmatic priority that can equip couples with the knowledge required to correctly implement U = U strategies.

        "Habitual physical activity, renal function and chronic kidney disease: a cohort study of nearly 200\u2009000 adults. BACKGROUND: There is limited information on the association between habitual physical activity (PA) and renal function. OBJECTIVE: To report the longitudinal association between self-reported habitual PA and measures of renal function in a large cohort in Taiwan. METHODS: A total of 199\u2009421 participants (aged \u226520 years) were selected from a Taiwan cohort between 1996 and 2014. All participants underwent at least two standardised medical examinations between 1996 and 2014. Self-administrated questionnaires were used to collect information on habitual PA. We used a generalised linear mixed model to investigate the associations between habitual PA and yearly change in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). The Cox proportional hazard regression model was used to investigate the associations between habitual PA and incident chronic kidney disease (CKD). RESULTS: Participants had a median follow-up duration of 4.2 years (0.2-18.9). The yearly mean (\u00b1SD) decrease in eGFR in participants with baseline very low-PA, low-PA, moderate-PA and high-PA was 0.46\u00b11.01, 0.36\u00b10.97, 0.30\u00b10.94\u2009and 0.27\u00b10.91\u2009mL/min/1.73\u2009m2, respectively. Relative to the participants with very low-PA, the coefficients of yearly eGFR change were -43.93 (95% CI -79.18 to -8.68), 35.20 (95% CI -2.56 to 72.96) and 53.56 (95% CI 10.42 to 96.70)\u2009\u00b5L/min/1.73\u2009m2, respectively, for the participants with low-PA, moderate-PA and high-PA, after controlling for a wide range of covariates. Relative to the very low-PA participants, those who had low-PA, moderate-PA and high-habitual PA had HRs of 0.93 (95% CI 0.88 to 0.98), 0.94 (95% CI 0.89 to 0.99) and 0.91 (95% CI 0.85 to 0.96) to develop CKD, respectively, after controlling for the covariates. CONCLUSIONS: A higher level of habitual PA is associated with a smaller decrease in the level of eGFR and a lower risk of developing CKD. ",
        "Pediatric obesity treatment, self-esteem, and body image: A systematic review with meta-analysis. BACKGROUND: Pediatric obesity impacts on multiple domains of psychological health, including self-esteem and body image. OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of multicomponent pediatric obesity treatment interventions on self-esteem and body image. METHODS: A systematic search of published literature up to June 2019 was undertaken using electronic databases MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and PsychINFO. Eligible studies implemented an obesity treatment intervention, including a dietary and physical activity component with/without a behavioral component, in children and adolescents with overweight/obesity, and assessed self-esteem and/or body image. Data were extracted by one reviewer and cross-checked. Meta-analysis was used to combine outcome data and moderator analysis conducted to identify intervention characteristics influencing outcomes. RESULTS: 64 studies were identified. Meta-analysis of 49 studies (n = 10471) indicated that pediatric obesity treatment results in increased self-esteem postintervention (standardized mean difference, [SE] 0.34 [0.03], P < .001, I2 87%), maintained at follow-up (0.35 [0.05] P < .001, I2 79%, 17 studies). Similarly, meta-analysis of 40 studies (n = 2729) indicated improvements in body image postintervention (0.40 [0.03], P < .001, I2 73%), maintained at follow-up (0.41 [0.08], P < .001, I2 89%, 16 studies). CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric obesity treatment improves self-esteem and body image in the short and medium term. These findings may underpin improvements in other psychological outcomes. ",
        "Effect of Sodium Supplements and Climate on Dysnatremia During Ultramarathon Running. OBJECTIVE: Analyze the effect of sodium supplementation, hydration, and climate on dysnatremia in ultramarathon runners. DESIGN: Prospective observational study. SETTING: The 2017 80 km (50 mile) stage of the 250 km (150 mile) 6-stage RacingThePlanet ultramarathon in 2017 Chilean, Patagonian, and 2018 Namibian, Mongolian, and Chilean deserts. PARTICIPANTS: All race entrants who could understand English were invited to participate, with 266 runners enrolled, mean age of 43 years (\u00b1 9), 61 (36%) females, average weight 74 kg (\u00b1 12.5), and average race time 14.5 (\u00b1 4.1) hours. Post-race sodium collected on 174 (74%) and 164 (62%) participants with both the blood sample and post-race questionnaire. INTERVENTION: Weight change and finish line serum sodium levels were gathered. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Incidence of exercise-associated hyponatremia (EAH; <135 mmol\u00b7L) and hypernatremia (>145 mmol\u00b7L) by sodium ingestion and climate. RESULTS: Eleven (6.3%) runners developed EAH, and 30 (17.2%) developed hypernatremia. Those with EAH were 14 kg heavier at baseline, had significantly less training distances, and averaged 5 to 6 hours longer to cover 50 miles (80 km) than the other participants. Neither rate nor total ingested supplemental sodium was correlated with dysnatremia, without significant differences in drinking behaviors or type of supplement compared with normonatremic runners. Hypernatremic runners were more often dehydrated [8 (28%), -4.7 kg (\u00b1 9.8)] than EAH [4 (14%), -1.1 kg (\u00b1 3.8)] (P < 0.01), and EAH runners were more frequently overhydrated (6, 67%) than hypernatremia (1, 11%) (P < 0.01). In the 98 (56%) runners from hot races, there was EAH OR = 3.5 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.9-25.9] and hypernatremia OR = 8.8 (95% CI, 2.9-39.5) compared with cold races. CONCLUSIONS: This was the first study to show that hot race climates are an independent risk factor for EAH and hypernatremia. Sodium supplementation did not prevent EAH nor cause hypernatremia. Longer training distances, lower body mass, and avoidance of overhydration were shown to be the most important factors to prevent EAH and avoidance of dehydration to prevent hypernatremia. ",
        "Cutaneous melanomas attributable to ultraviolet radiation exposure by state. Information on cutaneous melanoma (melanoma) burden attributable to ultraviolet (UV) radiation by state could inform state and local public health policies to mitigate the burden. We estimated numbers, proportions and age-standardized incidence rates of malignant melanomas attributable to UV radiation in each US state by calculating the difference between observed melanomas during 2011-2015 and expected cases based on historically low incidence rates among whites in Connecticut from 1942 to 1954. The low melanoma burden in Connecticut during this period likely reflected UV exposure accumulated in the 1930s or earlier, when exposure was likely minimized by clothing style and limited recreational exposure. The estimated number of melanoma cases attributable to UV exposure during 2011-2015 in the United States was 338,701, or 91.0% of the total cases (372,335); 94.3% (319,412) of UV-attributable cases occurred in non-Hispanic whites. By state, the attributable proportion among non-Hispanic whites ranged from 87.6% in the District of Columbia to 97.3% in Hawaii. The attributable age-standardized rate (per 100,000) among non-Hispanic whites ranged from 15.1 (95% CI, 13.4-16.7) in Alaska to 65.1 (95% CI, 61.4-68.9) in Hawaii and was \u226523.3 in half of states. Considerable proportions and incidence rates of melanoma attributable to UV radiation in all states underscores the need for broad implementation or enforcement of preventive measures across states, with priority for states with higher burden.

        "Survival of African American and non-Hispanic white men with prostate cancer in an equal-access health care system. BACKGROUND: African American (AA) men in the general US population are more than twice as likely to die of prostate cancer (PC) compared with non-Hispanic white (NHW) men. The authors hypothesized that receiving care through the Veterans Affairs (VA) health system, an equal-access medical system, would attenuate this disparity. METHODS: A longitudinal, centralized database of >20\u00a0million veterans was used to assemble a cohort of 60,035 men (18,201 AA men [30.3%] and 41,834 NHW men [69.7%]) who were diagnosed with PC between 2000 and 2015. RESULTS: AA men were more likely to live in regions with a lower median income ($40,871 for AA men vs $48,125 for NHW men; P\u00a0<\u00a0.001) and lower high school graduation rates (83% for AA men vs 88% for NHW men; P\u00a0<\u00a0.001). At the time of diagnosis, AA men were younger (median age, 63.0\u00a0years vs 66.0\u00a0years; P\u00a0<\u00a0.001) and had a higher prostate-specific antigen level (median, 6.7\u00a0ng/mL vs 6.2\u00a0ng/mL; P\u00a0<\u00a0.001), but were less likely to have Gleason score 8 to 10 disease (18.8% among AA men vs 19.7% among NHW men; P\u00a0<\u00a0.001), a clinical T classification \u22653 (2.2% vs 2.9%; P\u00a0<\u00a0.001), or distant metastatic disease (2.7% vs 3.1%; P\u00a0=\u00a00.01). The 10-year PC-specific mortality rate was slightly lower for AA men (4.4% vs 5.1%; P\u00a0=\u00a0.005), which was confirmed in multivariable competing-risk analysis (subdistribution hazard ratio, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.78-0.93; P\u00a0<\u00a0.001). CONCLUSIONS: AA men diagnosed with PC in the VA health system do not appear to present with more advanced disease or experience worse outcomes compared with NHW men, in contrast to national trends, suggesting that access to care is an important determinant of racial equity.

        "Obstetrician-gynecologists' screening and management of depression during perimenopause. OBJECTIVE: Depression in women is more common during perimenopause (the time period around and during menopause) than pre and postmenopause. Obstetrician-gynecologists (ob-gyns) play a vital role in the detection and management of depression symptoms in women because for many women ob-gyns are the first and most frequent point of medical contact. This study assessed ob-gyns' screening practices and management of depression in perimenopause. METHODS: A survey regarding depression during perimenopause was sent to 500 practicing ob-gyns who were fellows of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and members of the Collaborative Ambulatory Research Network. RESULTS: The survey response rate was 41.8% (209 of 500 surveys returned). Over a third of respondents (34.1%) reported that they did not regularly screen perimenopausal patients for depression. Higher-quality education about depression, respondent sex, and personal experience with depression were associated with higher rates of screening. While 85.7% of respondents believed that they could recognize depression in perimenopausal women, only about half (55.8%) were confident in their ability to treat these patients. CONCLUSION: Increased education of ob-gyn physicians related to depression during perimenopause may increase the screening and treatment of women during this phase of life. ",
        "Association of blood mercury levels with nonmelanoma skin cancer in the U.S.A. using National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey data (2003-2016). BACKGROUND: Some studies have reported increased incidence or mortality of lung and brain cancers associated with occupations involving potential mercury exposure. Epidemiological evidence related to skin cancer is also limited. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the association between blood mercury (Hg) levels and nonmelanoma skin cancer (NMSC). METHODS: We used National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey data from 2003 to 2016. The exposures were blood total (tHg), inorganic (iHg) and methylmercury (MeHg). The outcome was a self-reported diagnosis of NMSC. We included participants aged \u2265 20 years who had information on blood mercury and sociodemographic factors. We conducted a logistic regression analysis to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the risk of NMSC associated with quartiles of blood Hg, after adjusting for the sociodemographic factors and survey year. RESULTS: The number of participants was 29 413; mean age was 49 years and 52% were female. Compared with those with a tHg \u2264 0\u00b747 \u03bcg L-1 (Q1), those with a tHg > 1\u00b774 \u03bcg L-1 (Q4) had nearly double the odds of NMSC (OR 1\u00b779, 95% CI 1\u00b719-2\u00b771; Ptrend = 0\u00b7004). Similarly, those in the highest quartile of MeHg (> 1\u00b744 \u03bcg L-1 ) had 1\u00b77 times greater odds of NMSC (OR 1\u00b774, 95% CI 1\u00b713-2\u00b770; Ptrend = 0\u00b701) than those in the lowest quartile (\u2264 0\u00b721 \u03bcg L-1 ). iHg levels were nonsignificantly positively associated with NMSC (Ptrend = 0\u00b708). CONCLUSIONS: We found that higher blood tHg and MeHg levels were associated with a higher prevalence of NMSC. ",
        "Instagram Users' Experiences of Miscarriage. OBJECTIVE: To explore the shared experiences of miscarriage using a qualitative analysis of social media posts on Instagram. METHODS: We performed this qualitative study by collecting text, photos, hashtags, and emoji from 200 Instagram posts on five arbitrarily selected days in 2019. Key eligibility criteria included posts that described a personal experience of miscarriage and that used the hashtag #ihadamiscarriage. Through directed content analysis, our multidisciplinary team conducted open coding to identify common topics in the data, developed a code book, and coded all posts. Twenty-five percent of posts were double-coded by two team members and analyzed for agreement. The codes were organized into overarching themes. RESULTS: Intercoder reliability was excellent (kappa 0.95). Themes included medical and physical experiences of miscarriage, social experiences of miscarriage, the emotional spectrum of experiencing a miscarriage, family identity and the effects of miscarriage, and mechanisms of processing and coping through a miscarriage. We observed complex and often conflicted emotional states and noted that the effects of miscarriage were felt for months and years by many Instagram users. Use of social media and disclosure of miscarriage was a source of coping for many users. CONCLUSION: Women post about their miscarriages on social media for a variety of reasons, especially to find support and community and to help break the silence around miscarriage. Health care providers may consider discussing use of this platform as a support and coping mechanism in the setting of pregnancy loss. ",
        "Association of use of cleaning products with respiratory health in a Canadian birth cohort. BACKGROUND: Comprehensive longitudinal studies are important for understanding the complex risk factors, pathways, exposures and interactions that lead to the development and persistence of asthma. We aimed to examine associations between use of household cleaning products in early life and childhood respiratory and allergic disease using data from the Canadian Healthy Infant Longitudinal Development (CHILD) Cohort Study. METHODS: We summed responses from parental questionnaires that indicated the frequency of use of 26 household cleaning products in the homes of 2022 children from this birth cohort when they were 3-4 months of age to create a cumulative Frequency of Use Score (FUS). We used multivariable logistic regression models to assess whether frequent compared with less frequent use was associated with recurrent wheeze, atopy or asthma diagnosis, as defined by the questionnaire and clinical assessments at age 3 years. Data were collected between 2008 and 2015. RESULTS: Children in homes with a higher frequency of use of cleaning products in infancy, as determined by an interquartile range increase, had higher odds of recurrent wheeze (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 1.35, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.11-1.64), recurrent wheeze with atopy (adjusted OR 1.49, 95% CI 1.02-2.16) and asthma diagnosis (adjusted OR 1.37, 95% CI 1.09-1.70), but no increase in the odds of atopy at age 3 years (adjusted OR 1.14, 95% CI 0.96-1.35). Compared with the lowest tertile of FUS exposure, infants in the highest tertile had higher odds of acquiring asthma. Stratification of the results showed that females had higher ORs than males for all outcomes, although the p values for this sex difference did not reach statistical significance. INTERPRETATION: Frequent use of household cleaning products in early life was associated with an increased risk for childhood wheeze and asthma but not atopy at age 3 years. Our findings add to the understanding of how early life exposures to cleaning products may be associated with the development of allergic airway disease and help to identify household behaviours as a potential area for intervention.

        "Body mass index and weight change are associated with adult lung function trajectories: the prospective ECRHS study. BACKGROUND: Previous studies have reported an association between weight increase and excess lung function decline in young adults followed for short periods. We aimed to estimate lung function trajectories during adulthood from 20-year weight change profiles using data from the population-based European Community Respiratory Health Survey (ECRHS). METHODS: We included 3673 participants recruited at age 20-44 years with repeated measurements of weight and lung function (forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1)) in three study waves (1991-93, 1999-2003, 2010-14) until they were 39-67 years of age. We classified subjects into weight change profiles according to baseline body mass index (BMI) categories and weight change over 20 years. We estimated trajectories of lung function over time as a function of weight change profiles using population-averaged generalised estimating equations. RESULTS: In individuals with normal BMI, overweight and obesity at baseline, moderate (0.25-1\u2009kg/year) and high weight gain (>1\u2009kg/year) during follow-up were associated with accelerated FVC and FEV1 declines. Compared with participants with baseline normal BMI and stable weight (\u00b10.25\u2009kg/year), obese individuals with high weight gain during follow-up had -1011\u2009mL (95%\u2009CI -1.259 to -763) lower estimated FVC at 65 years despite similar estimated FVC levels at 25 years. Obese individuals at baseline who lost weight (<-0.25\u2009kg/year) exhibited an attenuation of FVC and FEV1 declines. We found no association between weight change profiles and FEV1/FVC decline. CONCLUSION: Moderate and high weight gain over 20\u2009years was associated with accelerated lung function decline, while weight loss was related to its attenuation. Control of weight gain is important for maintaining good lung function in adult life. ",
        "The rise in non-fatal and fatal overdoses involving stimulants with and without opioids in the United States. AIMS: To examine trends and recent changes in non-fatal and fatal stimulant overdose rates with and without opioids to improve the descriptive characterization of the US overdose epidemic. DESIGN: Secondary analysis of non-fatal (2006-16) and fatal (2006-17) drug overdose trends, focusing on the most recent years of data available to examine rate changes by demographics (2015-16 for non-fatal and 2016-17 for fatal). SETTING: Non-fatal drug overdoses from the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project's Nationwide Emergency Department Sample; drug overdose deaths from the National Vital Statistics System. PARTICIPANTS/CASES: International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) and Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification/Procedure Coding System (ICD-10-CM/PCS) codes for cocaine, psychostimulants and opioids were used to classify non-fatal drug overdoses. Drug overdose deaths were identified using ICD-10 multiple cause-of-death codes for cocaine, psychostimulants, all opioids, heroin and synthetic opioids. MEASUREMENTS: Percentage of changes in age-adjusted non-fatal and fatal rates of cocaine and psychostimulant-involved drug overdose with and without opioids. FINDINGS: Overall, cocaine-involved non-fatal overdose rates with an opioid increased from 2006 to 2016 [annual percentage change (APC)\u00a0=\u00a014.7], while rates without an opioid increased from 2006 to 2012 (APC\u00a0=\u00a011.3) and then remained stable (APC\u00a0=\u00a0-7.5). Psychostimulant-involved non-fatal rates with and without an opioid increased from 2006 to 2016 (APC\u00a0=\u00a049.9 with opioids; 13.9 without opioids). Cocaine-involved death rates with and without opioids increased from 2014 to 2017 (APC\u00a0=\u00a046.0 with opioids, 23.6 without opioids). Psychostimulant-involved death rates with opioids increased from 2010 to 2015 (APC\u00a0=\u00a028.6), with a dramatic increase from 2015 to 2017 (APC\u00a0=\u00a050.5), while rates without opioids increased from 2008 to 2017 (APC\u00a0=\u00a022.6). In 2016, 27% of non-fatal cocaine- and 14% of psychostimulant-involved overdoses included a reported opioid; 72.7% of cocaine- and 50.3% of psychostimulant-involved deaths involved an opioid in 2017. From 2015 to 2016, cocaine-involved and psychostimulant-involved non-fatal overdose rates with an opioid increased 17.0 and 5.9%, respectively; cocaine-involved and psychostimulant-involved non-fatal overdoses without opioids decreased 13.6 and increased 18.9%, respectively. Death rates involving stimulants increased with and without opioids from 2016 to 2017 (cocaine with and without opioids\u00a0=\u00a037.7 and 23.3%; psychostimulants with and without opioids\u00a0=\u00a052.2 and 23.0%). Death rates involving stimulants with synthetic opioids increased dramatically from 2016 to 2017 (1.3-2.3 per 100\u2009000 for cocaine and 0.3-0.8 for psychostimulants). CONCLUSIONS: While increases in cocaine-involved deaths in the United States from 2006 seem to be driven by opioids, particularly synthetic opioids, increases in non-fatal and fatal overdoses involving psychostimulants are occurring with and without opioids.

        "What Parents Know Matters: Parental Knowledge at Birth Predicts Caregiving Behaviors at 9\u00a0Months. OBJECTIVE: To examine the mediating role of socioeconomically disadvantaged parents' knowledge of early cognitive and language development at the first postpartum visit in the relation between education and caregiving behaviors at 9\u00a0months. STUDY DESIGN: Parental knowledge was assessed at the 1-week newborn visit (n\u00a0=\u00a0468); anticipatory guidance received and desired at 1-month (n\u00a0=\u00a0212) and 6-month (n\u00a0=\u00a0191) visits were reported; and caregiving behaviors toward infants during a teaching task were observed at 9-month visit (n\u00a0=\u00a0173). RESULTS: We found substantial variation in knowledge and caregiving behaviors. Parents who had more knowledge of infant development at 1\u00a0week were more likely to respond to cues (r\u00a0=\u00a00.18; P\u00a0<\u00a0.05) and foster social-emotional (r\u00a0=\u00a00.17; P\u00a0<\u00a0.05) and cognitive growth (r\u00a0=\u00a00.20; P\u00a0<\u00a0.05) at 9\u00a0months. Importantly, the indirect effect of education on cognitive growth fostering at 9\u00a0months through knowledge at 1\u00a0week was significant, controlling for primary language and number of other children in the home (infancy: \u03b2\u00a0=\u00a00.06; B\u00a0=\u00a00.07; SE\u00a0=\u00a00.04; 95% CI, 0.007-0.165; early childhood: \u03b2\u00a0=\u00a00.04; B\u00a0=\u00a00.06; SE\u00a0=\u00a00.03; 95% CI, 0.008-0.152). Open-ended responses indicated that anticipatory guidance in the first 6\u00a0months focused on infant physical growth; however, parents did not request additional anticipatory guidance from their pediatricians. CONCLUSIONS: This study sheds light on the importance of promoting parental knowledge about cognitive and language development to foster parental cognitive stimulations and language inputs during the first year of life. This study highlights the important role of anticipatory guidance on cognitive and language development during the earliest well-child visits and the need to better understand parental baseline knowledge to tailor anticipatory guidance to the family strengths and needs.

        "Premature mortality related to United States cross-state air pollution. Outdoor air pollution adversely affects human health and is estimated to be responsible for five to ten per cent of the\u00a0total annual premature mortality in the contiguous United States1-3. Combustion emissions from a variety of sources, such as power generation or road traffic, make a large contribution to harmful air pollutants such as ozone and fine particulate matter (PM2.5)4. Efforts to mitigate air pollution have focused mainly\u00a0on the relationship between local emission sources and local air quality2. Air quality can also be\u00a0affected by distant emission sources, however, including emissions from neighbouring federal states5,6. This cross-state exchange of pollution poses additional regulatory challenges. Here we quantify the exchange of air pollution among the contiguous United States, and assess its impact on premature mortality that is linked to increased human exposure to PM2.5 and ozone from seven emission sectors for 2005 to 2018. On average, we find that 41 to 53 per cent of air-quality-related premature mortality resulting from a state's emissions occurs outside that state. We also find variations in the cross-state contributions of different emission sectors and chemical species to premature mortality, and changes in these variations over time. Emissions from electric power generation have the greatest cross-state impacts as a fraction of their total impacts, whereas commercial/residential emissions have the smallest. However, reductions in emissions from electric power generation since 2005 have meant that, by 2018, cross-state premature mortality associated with the commercial/residential sector was twice that associated with power generation. In terms of the chemical species emitted, nitrogen oxides and sulfur dioxide emissions caused the most cross-state premature deaths in 2005, but by 2018 primary PM2.5 emissions led to cross-state premature deaths equal to three times those associated with sulfur dioxide emissions. These reported shifts in emission sectors and emission species that contribute to premature mortality may help to guide improvements to air quality in the contiguous United States. ",
        "Association between maternal Human Papillomavirus infection and adverse pregnancy outcomes: systematic review and meta-analysis. BACKGROUND: Experimental studies provide evidence of harmful effect of Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection on pregnancy, but observational studies are inconclusive. We systematically assessed the association between HPV and adverse pregnancy outcomes. METHODS: We searched electronic databases up to December 1st, 2019. We included observational studies on the association between HPV and adverse pregnancy outcomes. We conducted a random-effect meta-analysis for each outcome and assessed heterogeneity between studies. RESULTS: From 3034 citations, we included 38 studies and quantitatively synthesized 36 studies. HPV was significantly associated with preterm birth (age-adjusted odd ratio (aOR) 1.50, 95%CI:1.19-1.88), preterm premature rupture of membranes (aOR 1.96, 95%CI:1.11-3.45), premature rupture of membranes (aOR 1.42, 95%CI:1.08-1.86), intrauterine growth restriction (aOR 1.17, 95%CI:1.01-1.37), low birth weight (aOR 1.91, 95%CI:1.33 -2.76), and fetal death (aOR 2.23, 95%CI:1.14-4.37). No significant association was found for spontaneous abortion (aOR 1.14, 95%CI:0.40-3.22) and pregnancy-induced hypertensive disorders (aOR 1.24, 95%CI:0.80-1.92). Most of the studies were of moderate or low quality and substantial between-studies heterogeneity remained unexplained. CONCLUSION: We found a consistent and significant association between HPV and preterm birth and preterm premature rupture of membranes. HPV may also be associated with intrauterine growth restriction, low birth weight and fetal death, but findings are limited by suboptimal control of biases. ",
        "Maternal paraben exposure triggers childhood overweight development. Parabens are preservatives widely used in consumer products including cosmetics and food. Whether low-dose paraben exposure may cause adverse health effects has been discussed controversially in recent years. Here we investigate the effect of prenatal paraben exposure on childhood overweight by combining epidemiological data from a mother-child cohort with experimental approaches. Mothers reporting the use of paraben-containing cosmetic products have elevated urinary paraben concentrations. For butyl paraben (BuP) a positive association is observed to overweight within the first eight years of life with a stronger trend in girls. Consistently, maternal BuP exposure of mice induces a higher food intake and weight gain in female offspring. The effect is accompanied by an epigenetic modification in the neuronal Pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) enhancer 1 leading to a reduced hypothalamic POMC expression. Here we report that maternal paraben exposure may contribute to childhood overweight development by altered POMC-mediated neuronal appetite regulation. ",
        "Bias and stereotyping among research and clinical professionals: Perspectives on minority recruitment for oncology clinical trials. BACKGROUND: In recent years, extensive attention has been paid to the possibility that bias among health care professionals contributes to health disparities. In its 2003 report, the Institute of Medicine concluded that bias against racial minorities may affect communication or care offered. However, to the authors' knowledge, the role of bias within the context of recruitment of racial and ethnic minorities to cancer clinical trials has not been explored to date. Therefore, the authors assessed the experiences of clinical and research personnel related to factors influencing the recruitment of racial and ethnic minorities for cancer clinical trials. METHODS: A total of 91 qualitative interviews were conducted at 5 US cancer centers among 4 stakeholder groups: 1) cancer center leaders; 2) principal investigators; 3) referring clinicians; and 4) research staff. Data analysis was conducted using a content analysis approach to generate themes from the transcribed interviews. RESULTS: Five prominent themes emerged: 1) recruitment interactions with potential minority participants were perceived to be challenging; 2) potential minority participants were not perceived to be ideal study candidates; 3) a combination of clinic-level barriers and negative perceptions of minority study participants led to providers withholding clinical trial opportunities from potential minority participants; 4) when clinical trial recruitment practices were tailored to minority patients, addressing research misconceptions to build trust was a common strategy; 5) for some respondents, race was perceived as irrelevant when screening and recruiting potential minority participants for clinical trials. CONCLUSIONS: Not only did some respondents view racial and ethnic minorities as less promising participants, some respondents reported withholding trial opportunities from minorities based on these perceptions. Some providers endorsed using tailored recruitment strategies whereas others eschewed race as a factor in trial recruitment. The presence of bias and stereotyping among clinical and research professionals recruiting for cancer clinical trials should be considered when designing interventions to increase minority enrollment.

        "Variation in Tdap and Influenza Vaccination Coverage Among Pregnant Women by Insurance Type - Florida, 2016-2018. Infants are at increased risk for pertussis-associated morbidity and mortality, and pregnant women and their infants are more likely than other patient populations to experience severe influenza-related illness (1,2). The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends that all women receive the tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid, and acellular pertussis (Tdap) vaccine during each pregnancy, preferably during the early part of gestational weeks 27-36 (3). ACIP also recommends that women who are or might be pregnant during the influenza season receive the inactivated influenza vaccine at any time during pregnancy (4). Despite these recommendations, coverage with Tdap and influenza vaccines during pregnancy has been low, with approximately one half of women receiving each vaccine and only one third receiving both, based on a survey during March-April 2019 (5). Data obtained through a retrospective chart review of randomly selected pregnant women who delivered at the University of Florida Health Shands Hospital in Gainesville, Florida, from January 1, 2016, to December 31, 2018, were analyzed to assess vaccination coverage by insurance type. Because the Florida Medicaid policy at that time did not cover these vaccines during pregnancy, the hospital system offered Tdap and influenza vaccines at no additional cost to mothers during the immediate postpartum hospital stay. Among 341 women, 68.6% of privately insured and 13.4% with Medicaid received Tdap during pregnancy, and among 316 women, 70.4% of privately insured and 35.6% with Medicaid received influenza vaccine during pregnancy. Many women, especially those with Medicaid, were vaccinated in the immediate postpartum period, when vaccination was available at no cost, increasing Tdap vaccination rates to 79.3% for privately insured and 51.7% for women with Medicaid; influenza vaccination rates rose to 72.0% for privately insured and 43.5% for women with Medicaid. These data suggest that the state Medicaid policy to not cover these vaccines during pregnancy might have significantly reduced coverage among its enrollees. ",
        "The impact of childbirth education classes on delivery outcome. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether participating in childbirth classes is associated with pregnancy outcomes. METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted to review the medical records of all nulliparous women who participated in childbirth classes during their pregnancy and delivered in the authors' institute, between January 2014 and December 2017 (CB class group). The control group comprised nulliparous women who delivered in the same time period, but who did not participate in any education classes (Not attended CB class group). The controls were matched in a ratio of 1:1 for gestational age at delivery and neonatal birth weight. RESULTS: Overall, 159 patients were included in each group. The class group was characterized with above average income (28 [23.9%] vs 19 [16.7%]; P=0.001) and higher education level (80 [64.0%] vs 60 [45.1%]; P=0.002), higher rate of normal vaginal delivery (128 [80.5%] vs 93 [58.5%]; P<0.001), and lower rate of vacuum extraction (12 [7.5%] vs 36 [22.6%]; P<0.001) compared to the Not attended CB class group. By logistic regression analysis, after controlling for obstetrics and socioeconomic variables, participation in childbirth classes was found to be independently associated with successful normal vaginal delivery (odds ratio 2.90; 95% confidence interval 1.13-7.38; P=0.024). CONCLUSION: Participation in childbirth classes has a positive impact on pregnancy outcome. ",
        "Comparative Pricing of Branded Tenofovir Alafenamide-Emtricitabine Relative to Generic Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate-Emtricitabine for HIV Preexposure Prophylaxis: A Cost-Effectiveness Analysis. Background: Tenofovir alafenamide-emtricitabine (F/TAF) was recently approved as a noninferior and potentially safer option than tenofovir disoproxil fumarate-emtricitabine (F/TDF) for HIV preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) in the United States. Objective: To estimate the greatest possible clinical benefits and economic savings attributable to the improved safety profile of F/TAF and the maximum price payers should be willing to pay for F/TAF over generic F/TDF. Design: Cost-effectiveness analysis. Data Sources: Published literature on F/TDF safety (in persons with and those without HIV) and the cost and quality-of-life effects of fractures and end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Target Population: Age-stratified U.S. men who have sex with men (MSM) using PrEP. Time Horizon: Five years. Perspective: Health care sector. Intervention: Preexposure prophylaxis with F/TAF versus F/TDF. Outcome Measures: Fractures averted, cases of ESRD averted, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) saved, costs, incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs), and maximum justifiable price for F/TAF compared with generic F/TDF. Results of Base-Case Analysis: Over a 5-year horizon, compared with F/TDF, F/TAF averted 2101 fractures and 25 cases of ESRD for the 123\u00a0610 MSM receiving PrEP, with an ICER of more than $7 million per QALY. At a 50% discount for generic F/TDF ($8300 per year) and a societal willingness to pay up to $100\u00a0000 per QALY, the maximum fair price for F/TAF was $8670 per year. Results of Sensitivity Analysis: Among persons older than 55 years, the ICER for F/TAF remained more than $3 million per QALY and the maximum permissible fair price for F/TAF was $8970 per year. Results were robust to alternative time horizons and PrEP-using population sizes. Limitation: Intermittent use and on-demand PrEP were not considered. Conclusion: In the presence of a generic F/TDF alternative, the improved safety of F/TAF is worth no more than an additional $370 per person per year.

        "Pubertal Suppression for Transgender Youth and Risk of Suicidal Ideation. BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogues are commonly prescribed to suppress endogenous puberty for transgender adolescents. There are limited data regarding the mental health benefits of this treatment. Our objective for this study was to examine associations between access to pubertal suppression during adolescence and adult mental health outcomes. METHODS: Using a cross-sectional survey of 20\u2009619 transgender adults aged 18 to 36 years, we examined self-reported history of pubertal suppression during adolescence. Using multivariable logistic regression, we examined associations between access to pubertal suppression and adult mental health outcomes, including multiple measures of suicidality. RESULTS: Of the sample, 16.9% reported that they ever wanted pubertal suppression as part of their gender-related care. Their mean age was 23.4 years, and 45.2% were assigned male sex at birth. Of them, 2.5% received pubertal suppression. After adjustment for demographic variables and level of family support for gender identity, those who received treatment with pubertal suppression, when compared with those who wanted pubertal suppression but did not receive it, had lower odds of lifetime suicidal ideation (adjusted odds ratio = 0.3; 95% confidence interval = 0.2-0.6). CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study in which associations between access to pubertal suppression and suicidality are examined. There is a significant inverse association between treatment with pubertal suppression during adolescence and lifetime suicidal ideation among transgender adults who ever wanted this treatment. These results align with past literature, suggesting that pubertal suppression for transgender adolescents who want this treatment is associated with favorable mental health outcomes. Long-term Puberty Suppression for a Nonbinary Teenager. Many transgender and gender-diverse people have a gender identity that does not conform to the binary categories of male or female; they have a nonbinary gender. Some nonbinary individuals are most comfortable with an androgynous gender expression. For those who have not yet fully progressed through puberty, puberty suppression with gonadotrophin-releasing hormone agonists can support an androgynous appearance. Although such treatment is shown to ameliorate the gender dysphoria and serious mental health issues commonly seen in transgender and gender-diverse young people, long-term use of puberty-suppressing medications carries physical health risks and raises various ethical dilemmas. In this Ethics Rounds, we analyze a case that raised issues about prolonged pubertal suppression for a patient with a nonbinary gender. ",
        "Scheduled afternoon-evening sleep leads to better night shift performance in older adults. OBJECTIVES: This study investigated whether an intervention designed to reduce homeostatic sleep pressure would improve night shift performance and alertness in older adults. METHODS: Non-shift workers aged 57.9\u00b14.6 (mean\u00b1SD) worked four\u2009day (07:00-15:00) and four night shifts (23:00-07:00). Two intervention groups were instructed to remain awake until ~13:00\u2009after each night shift: the sleep timing group (ST; n=9) was instructed to spend 8\u2009hours in bed attempting sleep, and the sleep ad-lib group (n=9) was given no further sleep instructions. A control group (n=9) from our previous study was not given any sleep instructions. Hourly Karolinska Sleepiness Scales and Psychomotor Vigilance Tasks assessed subjective sleepiness and performance. RESULTS: The ST group maintained their day shift sleep durations on night shifts, whereas the control group slept less. The ST group were able to maintain stable performance and alertness across the initial part of the night shift, while the control group's alertness and performance declined across the entire night. Wake duration before a night shift negatively impacted sustained attention and self-reported sleepiness but not reaction time, whereas sleep duration before a night shift affected reaction time and ability to sustain attention but not self-reported sleepiness. CONCLUSIONS: A behavioural change under the control of the individual worker, spending 8\u2009hours in bed and waking close to the start of the night shift, allowed participants to acquire more sleep and improved performance on the night shift in older adults. Both sleep duration and timing are important factors for night shift performance and self-reported sleepiness. ",
        "Dietary behaviors and poor sleep quality among young adult women: Watch that sugary caffeine!. PURPOSE: Associations of dietary patterns with sleep quality have not been sufficiently studied, particularly among young adults. Studying factors associated with sleep quality among young adults are especially important given the significant life changes they are experiencing, which can influence not only sleep quality but also dietary behaviors. METHODS: We examined the cross-sectional association of sleep quality among 462 women at age 23 years. We used the Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) to define sleep quality. Intake over the previous 7 days of fruits and vegetables, soda, sports drinks, other sweetened drinks, and coffee drinks was assessed by a self-report questionnaire. Linear regression analysis examined the association between PSQI scores and dietary intake. RESULTS: About 47% of participants were White, 25% Black, 10% Hispanic, and 18% Other. Almost \u00bd (45%) reported poor sleep quality. Compared with participants reporting consuming no energy drinks, participants who reported consuming any energy drinks had PSQI scores that were 0.84 points higher (7.08 \u00b1 0.51 vs 6.24 \u00b1 0.39; p=0.04) (indicating poorer sleep quality). Participants who reported drinking one or more high-calorie coffee drinks had PSQI scores that were 1.00 points higher compared with those reporting drinking no high-calorie coffee drinks (7.14 \u00b1 0.51 vs 6.14 \u00b1 0.42; p=0.02). Fruit or vegetable intake was not associated with PSQI score. CONCLUSIONS: Poor sleep quality is prevalent among young women. Young women with poor sleep quality should consider their sugary caffeine use to determine if it may be associated with their sleep. ",
        "Changes in Smoking Behavior Before and After Gastric Bypass: A 7-year Study. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate smoking history and change in smoking behavior, from 1 year before through 7 years after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery, and to identify risk factors for post-surgery smoking. BACKGROUND: Smoking behavior in the context of bariatric surgery is poorly described. METHODS: Adults undergoing RYGB surgery entered a prospective cohort study between 2006 and 2009 and were followed up to 7 years until \u22642015. Participants (N = 1770; 80% female, median age 45 years, median body mass index 47\u200akg/m) self-reported smoking history pre-surgery, and current smoking behavior annually. RESULTS: Almost half of participants (45.2%) reported a pre-surgery history of smoking. Modeled prevalence of current smoking decreased in the year before surgery from 13.7% [95% confidence interval (CI) = 12.1-15.4] to 2.2% (95% CI = 1.5-2.9) at surgery, then increased to 9.6% (95% CI = 8.1-11.2) 1-year post-surgery and continued to increase to 14.0% (95% CI = 11.8-16.0) 7-years post-surgery. Among smokers, mean packs/day was 0.60 (95% CI = 0.44-0.77) at surgery, 0.70 (95% CI = 0.62-0.78) 1-year post-surgery and 0.77 (95% CI = 0.68-0.88) 7-years post-surgery. At 7-years, smoking was reported by 61.7% (95% CI = 51.9-70.8) of participants who smoked 1-year pre-surgery (n = 221), 12.3% (95% CI = 8.5-15.7) of participants who formerly smoked but quit >1 year pre-surgery (n = 507), and 3.8% (95% CI = 2.1-4.9) of participants who reported no smoking history (n = 887). Along with smoking history (ie, less time since smoked), younger age, household income <$25,000, being married or living as married, and illicit drug use were independently associated with increased risk of post-surgery smoking. CONCLUSION: Although most adults who smoked 1-year before RYGB quit pre-surgery, smoking prevalence rebounded across 7-years, primarily due to relapse. ",
        "Human transport of thirdhand tobacco smoke: A prominent source of hazardous air pollutants into indoor nonsmoking environments. The contamination of indoor nonsmoking environments with thirdhand smoke (THS) is an important, poorly understood public health concern. Real-time THS off-gassing from smokers into a nonsmoking movie theater was observed with online and offline high-resolution mass spectrometry. Prominent emission events of THS tracers (e.g., 2,5-dimethylfuran, 2-methylfuran, and acetonitrile) and other tobacco-related volatile organic compounds (VOCs) coincided with the arrival of certain moviegoers and left residual contamination. These VOC emission events exposed occupants to the equivalent of 1 to 10 cigarettes of secondhand smoke, including multiple hazardous air pollutants (e.g., benzene and formaldehyde) at parts-per-billion concentrations. Nicotine and related intermediate-volatility nitrogen-containing compounds, which vaporized from clothes/bodies and recondensed onto aerosol, comprised 34% of observed functionalized organic aerosol abundance. Exposure to THS VOC emission events will be considerably enhanced in poorly ventilated or smaller spaces in contrast with a large, well-ventilated theater-amplifying concentrations and potential impacts on health and indoor chemistry.

        "Association of Office and Ambulatory Blood Pressure With Mortality and Cardiovascular Outcomes. Importance: Blood pressure (BP) is a known risk factor for overall mortality and cardiovascular (CV)-specific fatal and nonfatal outcomes. It is uncertain which BP index is most strongly associated with these outcomes. Objective: To evaluate the association of BP indexes with death and a composite CV event. Design, Setting, and Participants: Longitudinal population-based cohort study of 11\u202f135 adults from Europe, Asia, and South America with baseline observations collected from May 1988 to May 2010 (last follow-ups, August 2006-October 2016). Exposures: Blood pressure measured by an observer or an automated office machine; measured for 24 hours, during the day or the night; and the dipping ratio (nighttime divided by daytime readings). Main Outcomes and Measures: Multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) expressed the risk of death or a CV event associated with BP increments of 20/10 mm Hg. Cardiovascular events included CV mortality combined with nonfatal coronary events, heart failure, and stroke. Improvement in model performance was assessed by the change in the area under the curve (AUC). Results: Among 11\u202f135 participants (median age, 54.7 years, 49.3% women), 2836 participants died (18.5 per 1000 person-years) and 2049 (13.4 per 1000 person-years) experienced a CV event over a median of 13.8 years of follow-up. Both end points were significantly associated with all single systolic BP indexes (P\u2009<\u2009.001). For nighttime systolic BP level, the HR for total mortality was 1.23 (95% CI, 1.17-1.28) and for CV events, 1.36 (95% CI, 1.30-1.43). For the 24-hour systolic BP level, the HR for total mortality was 1.22 (95% CI, 1.16-1.28) and for CV events, 1.45 (95% CI, 1.37-1.54). With adjustment for any of the other systolic BP indexes, the associations of nighttime and 24-hour systolic BP with the primary outcomes remained statistically significant (HRs ranging from 1.17 [95% CI, 1.10-1.25] to 1.87 [95% CI, 1.62-2.16]). Base models that included single systolic BP indexes yielded an AUC of 0.83 for mortality and 0.84 for the CV outcomes. Adding 24-hour or nighttime systolic BP to base models that included other BP indexes resulted in incremental improvements in the AUC of 0.0013 to 0.0027 for mortality and 0.0031 to 0.0075 for the composite CV outcome. Adding any systolic BP index to models already including nighttime or 24-hour systolic BP did not significantly improve model performance. These findings were consistent for diastolic BP. Conclusions and Relevance: In this population-based cohort study, higher 24-hour and nighttime blood pressure measurements were significantly associated with greater risks of death and a composite CV outcome, even after adjusting for other office-based or ambulatory blood pressure measurements. Thus, 24-hour and nighttime blood pressure may be considered optimal measurements for estimating CV risk, although statistically, model improvement compared with other blood pressure indexes was small.

        "Plant-Based Diets Are Associated With a Lower Risk of Incident Cardiovascular Disease, Cardiovascular Disease Mortality, and All-Cause Mortality in a General Population of Middle-Aged Adults. Background: Previous studies have documented the cardiometabolic health benefits of plant-based diets; however, these studies were conducted in selected study populations that had narrow generalizability. . Methods and Results: We used data from a community-based cohort of middle-aged adults (n=12\u00a0168) in the ARIC (Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities) study who were followed up from 1987 through 2016. Participants' diet was classified using 4 diet indexes. In the overall plant-based diet index and provegetarian diet index, higher intakes of all or selected plant foods received higher scores; in the healthy plant-based diet index, higher intakes of only the healthy plant foods received higher scores; in the less healthy plant-based diet index, higher intakes of only the less healthy plant foods received higher scores. In all indexes, higher intakes of animal foods received lower scores. Results from Cox proportional hazards models showed that participants in the highest versus lowest quintile for adherence to overall plant-based diet index or provegetarian diet had a 16%, 31% to 32%, and 18% to 25% lower risk of cardiovascular disease, cardiovascular disease mortality, and all-cause mortality, respectively, after adjusting for important confounders (all P<0.05 for trend). Higher adherence to a healthy plant-based diet index was associated with a 19% and 11% lower risk of cardiovascular disease mortality and all-cause mortality, respectively, but not incident cardiovascular disease (P<0.05 for trend). No associations were observed between the less healthy plant-based diet index and the outcomes. . Conclusions: Diets higher in plant foods and lower in animal foods were associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in a general population. ",
        "Prospective Cohort Study of Caffeinated Beverage Intake as a Potential Trigger of Headaches among Migraineurs. PURPOSE: We aimed to evaluate the role of caffeinated beverage intake as a potential trigger of migraine headaches on that day or on the following day. METHODS: In this prospective cohort study, 101 adults with episodic migraine completed electronic diaries every morning and evening. Ninety-eight participants completed at least 6 weeks of diaries in March 2016-October 2017. Every day, participants reported caffeinated beverage intake, other lifestyle factors, and the timing and characteristics of each migraine headache. We compared a participant's incidence of migraines on days with caffeinated beverage intake to the incidence of migraines among the same individual on days with no intake, accounting for day of week. We used conditional logistic regression to estimate odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals. RESULTS: Among 98 participants (86 women, 12 men) with mean age 35.1 years, 83% white, and 10% Hispanic or Latino, the average age when headaches started was 16.3 years. In total, the participants reported 825 migraines during 4467 days of observation. There was a statistically significant nonlinear association between the number of caffeinated beverages and the odds of migraine headache occurrence on that day (P-quadratic trend = .024), though estimates for each level of intake were not statistically significant. The associations varied according to habitual intake and oral contraceptive use. CONCLUSIONS: There was a nonlinear association between caffeinated beverage intake and the odds of migraine headache occurrence on that day. This suggests that high levels of caffeinated beverage intake may be a trigger of migraine headaches on that day. ",
        "A carbohydrate-reduced high-protein diet improves HbA1c and liver fat content in weight stable participants with type 2 diabetes: a randomised controlled trial. AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Dietary recommendations for treating type 2 diabetes are unclear but a trend towards recommending a diet reduced in carbohydrate content is acknowledged. We compared a carbohydrate-reduced high-protein (CRHP) diet with an iso-energetic conventional diabetes (CD) diet to elucidate the effects on glycaemic control and selected cardiovascular risk markers during 6\u00a0weeks of full food provision of each diet. METHODS: The primary outcome of the study was change in HbA1c. Secondary outcomes reported in the present paper include glycaemic variables, ectopic fat content and 24\u00a0h blood pressure. Eligibility criteria were: men and women with type 2 diabetes, HbA1c 48-97\u00a0mmol/mol (6.5-11%), age >18\u00a0years, haemoglobin >6/>7\u00a0mmol/l (women/men) and eGFR >30\u00a0ml\u00a0min-1 (1.73\u00a0m)-2. Participants were randomised by drawing blinded ballots to 6\u2009+\u20096\u00a0weeks of an iso-energetic CRHP vs CD diet in an open label, crossover design aiming at body weight stability. The CRHP/CD diets contained carbohydrate 30/50 energy per cent (E%), protein 30/17E% and fat 40/33E%, respectively. Participants underwent a meal test at the end of each diet period and glycaemic variables, lipid profiles, 24\u00a0h blood pressure and ectopic fat including liver and pancreatic fat content were assessed at baseline and at the end of each diet period. Data were collected at Copenhagen University Hospital, Bispebjerg and Copenhagen University Hospital, Herlev. RESULTS: Twenty-eight participants completed the study. Fourteen participants carried out 6\u00a0weeks of the CRHP intervention followed by 6\u00a0weeks of the CD intervention, and 14 participants received the dietary interventions in the reverse order. Compared with a CD diet, a CRHP diet reduced the primary outcome of HbA1c (mean \u00b1 SEM: -6.2\u2009\u00b1\u20090.8\u00a0mmol/mol (-0.6\u2009\u00b1\u20090.1%) vs -0.75\u2009\u00b1\u20091.0\u00a0mmol/mol (-0.1\u2009\u00b1\u20090.1%); p\u2009<\u20090.001). Nine (out of 37) pre-specified secondary outcomes are reported in the present paper, of which five were significantly different between the diets, (p\u2009<\u20090.05); compared with a CD diet, a CRHP diet reduced the secondary outcomes (mean \u00b1 SEM or medians [interquartile range]) of fasting plasma glucose (-0.71\u2009\u00b1\u20090.20\u00a0mmol/l vs 0.03\u2009\u00b1\u20090.23\u00a0mmol/l; p\u2009<\u20090.05), postprandial plasma glucose AUC (9.58\u2009\u00b1\u20090.29\u00a0mmol/l\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0240\u00a0min vs 11.89\u2009\u00b1\u20090.43\u00a0mmol/l\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0240\u00a0min; p\u2009<\u20090.001) and net AUC (1.25\u2009\u00b1\u20090.20\u00a0mmol/l\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0240\u00a0min vs 3.10\u2009\u00b1\u20090.25\u00a0mmol/l\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0240\u00a0min; p\u2009<\u20090.001), hepatic fat content (-2.4% [-7.8% to -1.0%] vs 0.2% [-2.3% to 0.9%]; p\u2009<\u20090.01) and pancreatic fat content (-1.7% [-3.5% to 0.6%] vs 0.5% [-1.0% to 2.0%]; p\u2009<\u20090.05). Changes in other secondary outcomes, i.e. 24\u00a0h blood pressure and muscle-, visceral- or subcutaneous adipose tissue, did not differ between diets. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: A moderate macronutrient shift by substituting carbohydrates with protein and fat for 6\u00a0weeks reduced HbA1c and hepatic fat content in weight stable individuals with type 2 diabetes.

        "Adaptation of host transmission cycle during Clostridium difficile speciation. Bacterial speciation is a fundamental evolutionary process characterized by diverging genotypic and phenotypic properties. However, the selective forces that affect genetic adaptations and how they relate to the biological changes that underpin the formation of a new bacterial species remain poorly understood. Here, we show that the spore-forming, healthcare-associated enteropathogen Clostridium difficile is actively undergoing speciation. Through large-scale genomic analysis of 906 strains, we demonstrate that the ongoing speciation process is linked to positive selection on core genes in the newly forming species that are involved in sporulation and the metabolism of simple dietary sugars. Functional validation shows that the new C. difficile produces spores that are more resistant and have increased sporulation and host colonization capacity when glucose or fructose is available for metabolism. Thus, we report the formation of an emerging C. difficile species, selected for metabolizing simple dietary sugars and producing high levels of resistant spores, that is adapted for healthcare-mediated transmission.

        "Flavonoid intake is associated with lower mortality in the Danish Diet Cancer and Health Cohort. Flavonoids, plant-derived polyphenolic compounds, have been linked with health benefits. However, evidence from observational studies is incomplete; studies on cancer mortality are scarce and moderating effects of lifestyle risk factors for early mortality are unknown. In this prospective cohort study including 56,048 participants of the Danish Diet, Cancer, and Health cohort crosslinked with Danish nationwide registries and followed for 23 years, there are 14,083 deaths. A moderate habitual intake of flavonoids is inversely associated with all-cause, cardiovascular- and cancer-related mortality. This strong association plateaus at intakes of approximately 500\u2009mg/day. Furthermore, the inverse associations between total flavonoid intake and mortality outcomes are stronger and more linear in smokers than in non-smokers, as well as in heavy (>20\u2009g/d) vs. low-moderate (<20\u2009g/d) alcohol consumers. These findings highlight the potential to reduce mortality through recommendations to increase intakes of flavonoid-rich foods, particularly in smokers and high alcohol consumers. ",
        "Physiological and Molecular Dissection of Daily Variance in Exercise Capacity. Physical performance relies on the concerted action of myriad responses, many of which are under circadian clock control. Little is known, however, regarding the time-dependent effect on exercise performance at the molecular level. We found that both mice and humans exhibit daytime variance in exercise capacity between the early and late part of their active phase. The daytime variance in mice was dependent on exercise intensity and relied on the circadian clock proteins PER1/2. High-throughput gene expression and metabolic profiling of skeletal muscle revealed metabolic pathways that are differently activated upon exercise in a daytime-dependent manner. Remarkably, we discovered that ZMP, an endogenous AMPK activator, is induced by exercise in a time-dependent manner to regulate key steps in glycolytic and fatty acid oxidation pathways and potentially enhance exercise capacity. Overall, we propose that time of day is a major modifier of exercise capacity and associated metabolic pathways. Time of Exercise Specifies the Impact on Muscle Metabolic Pathways and Systemic Energy Homeostasis. While the timing of food intake is important, it is unclear whether the effects of exercise on energy metabolism are restricted to unique time windows. As circadian regulation is key to controlling metabolism, understanding the impact of exercise performed at different times of the day is relevant for physiology and homeostasis. Using high-throughput transcriptomic and metabolomic approaches, we identify distinct responses of metabolic oscillations that characterize exercise in either the early rest phase or the early active phase in mice. Notably, glycolytic activation is specific to exercise at the active phase. At the molecular level, HIF1\u03b1, a central regulator of glycolysis during hypoxia, is selectively activated in a time-dependent manner upon exercise, resulting in carbohydrate exhaustion, usage of alternative energy sources, and adaptation of systemic energy expenditure. Our findings demonstrate that the time\u00a0of day is a critical factor to amplify the beneficial\u00a0impact of exercise on both metabolic pathways\u00a0within skeletal muscle and systemic energy homeostasis.

        "Gut-associated IgA+ immune cells regulate obesity-related insulin resistance. The intestinal immune system is emerging as an important contributor to obesity-related insulin resistance, but the role of intestinal B cells in this context is unclear. Here, we show that high fat diet (HFD) feeding alters intestinal IgA+ immune cells and that IgA is a critical immune regulator of glucose homeostasis. Obese mice have fewer IgA+ immune cells and less secretory IgA and IgA-promoting immune mediators. HFD-fed IgA-deficient mice have dysfunctional glucose metabolism, a phenotype that can be recapitulated by adoptive transfer of intestinal-associated pan-B cells. Mechanistically, IgA is a crucial link that controls intestinal and adipose tissue inflammation, intestinal permeability, microbial encroachment and the composition of the intestinal microbiome\u00a0during HFD. Current glucose-lowering therapies, including metformin, affect intestinal-related IgA+ B cell populations in mice, while bariatric surgery regimen alters the level of fecal secretory IgA in humans. These findings identify intestinal IgA+ immune cells as mucosal mediators of whole-body glucose regulation in diet-induced metabolic disease. ",
        "In Vivo Restoration of Myocardial Conduction With Carbon Nanotube Fibers. BACKGROUND: Impaired myocardial conduction is the underlying mechanism for re-entrant arrhythmias. Carbon nanotube fibers (CNTfs) combine the mechanical properties of suture materials with the conductive properties of metals and may form a restorative solution to impaired myocardial conduction. METHODS: Acute open chest electrophysiology studies were performed in sheep (n=3). Radiofrequency ablation was used to create epicardial conduction delay after which CNTf and then silk suture controls were applied. CNTfs were surgically sewn across the right atrioventricular junction in rodents, and acute (n=3) and chronic (4-week, n=6) electrophysiology studies were performed. Rodent toxicity studies (n=10) were performed. Electrical analysis of the CNTf-myocardial interface was performed. RESULTS: In all cases, the large animal studies demonstrated improvement in conduction velocity using CNTf. The acute rodent model demonstrated ventricular preexcitation during sinus rhythm. All chronic cases demonstrated resumption of atrioventricular conduction, but these required atrial pacing. There was no gross or histopathologic evidence of toxicity. Ex vivo studies demonstrated contact impedance significantly lower than platinum iridium. CONCLUSIONS: Here, we show that in sheep, CNTfs sewn across epicardial scar acutely improve conduction. In addition, CNTf maintain conduction for 1 month after atrioventricular nodal ablation in the absence of inflammatory or toxic responses in rats but only in the paced condition. The CNTf/myocardial interface has such low impedance that CNTf can facilitate local, downstream myocardial activation. CNTf are conductive, biocompatible materials that restore electrical conduction in diseased myocardium, offering potential long-term restorative solutions in pathologies interrupting efficient electrical transduction in electrically excitable tissues.

        "Omega-3 Fatty Acids for the Management of Hypertriglyceridemia: A Science Advisory From the American Heart Association. Hypertriglyceridemia (triglycerides 200-499 mg/dL) is relatively common in the United States, whereas more severe triglyceride elevations (very high triglycerides, \u2265500 mg/dL) are far less frequently observed. Both are becoming increasingly prevalent in the United States and elsewhere, likely driven in large part by growing rates of obesity and diabetes mellitus. In a 2002 American Heart Association scientific statement, the omega-3 fatty acids (n-3 FAs) eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) were recommended (at a dose of 2-4 g/d) for reducing triglycerides in patients with elevated triglycerides. Since 2002, prescription agents containing EPA+DHA or EPA alone have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for treating very high triglycerides; these agents are also widely used for hypertriglyceridemia. The purpose of this advisory is to summarize the lipid and lipoprotein effects resulting from pharmacological doses of n-3 FAs (>3 g/d total EPA+DHA) on the basis of new scientific data and availability of n-3 FA agents. In treatment of very high triglycerides with 4 g/d, EPA+DHA agents reduce triglycerides by \u226530% with concurrent increases in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, whereas EPA-only did not raise low-density lipoprotein cholesterol in very high triglycerides. When used to treat hypertriglyceridemia, n-3 FAs with EPA+DHA or with EPA-only appear roughly comparable for triglyceride lowering and do not increase low-density lipoprotein cholesterol when used as monotherapy or in combination with a statin. In the largest trials of 4 g/d prescription n-3 FA, non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and apolipoprotein B were modestly decreased, indicating reductions in total atherogenic lipoproteins. The use of n-3 FA (4 g/d) for improving atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk in patients with hypertriglyceridemia is supported by a 25% reduction in major adverse cardiovascular events in REDUCE-IT (Reduction of Cardiovascular Events With EPA Intervention Trial), a randomized placebo-controlled trial of EPA-only in high-risk patients treated with a statin. The results of a trial of 4 g/d prescription EPA+DHA in hypertriglyceridemia are anticipated in 2020. We conclude that prescription n-3 FAs (EPA+DHA or EPA-only) at a dose of 4 g/d (>3 g/d total EPA+DHA) are an effective and safe option for reducing triglycerides as monotherapy or as an adjunct to other lipid-lowering agents.

        "Randomized controlled trial of vitamin D supplementation in older people to optimize bone health. Background: Vitamin D insufficiency is common in older people and may lead to increased bone resorption, bone loss, and increased falls and fractures. However, clinical trials assessing the effect of vitamin D supplementation on bone mineral density (BMD) have yielded conflicting results. Objectives: This study examined the effect of vitamin D supplementation on BMD at the hip, using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Methods: A total of 379 adults aged \u226570 y (48% women; mean age: 75\u00a0y) from the northeast of England were randomly allocated to 1 of 3 doses of vitamin D3 [12,000 international units (IU), 24,000 IU, or 48,000 IU] given once a month. The primary outcome was change in BMD (\u0394BMD) at the hip. Secondary endpoints comprised the dose effects on femoral neck BMD, falls, circulating calciotropic hormones, bone turnover markers, and adverse events. Results: The mean \u00b1 SD baseline plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] concentration was 40.0 \u00b1 20.1 nmol/L, which increased after 12 mo to a mean 25(OH)D of 55.9, 64.6, or 79.0 nmol/L for participants receiving a monthly dose of 12,000, 24,000, or 48,000 IU, respectively (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01 for difference). There was no between-group difference in \u0394BMD. However, parathyroid hormone concentrations decreased in all 3 groups, with a significantly greater decrease in the 48,000-IU group compared with the 12,000-IU group (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01). There were no differences in any adverse events between groups, with 3 cases of hypercalcemia, none of nephrolithiasis, and 249 falls observed. Conclusions: There was no difference in change in BMD over 12 mo between the 3 doses of vitamin D, suggesting no effect of the intervention or a similar attenuation of the anticipated decrease in BMD over 12 mo. The treatment was safe and effective in increasing plasma 25(OH)D concentrations, with no dose-related adverse events. This trial was registered at the EU Clinical Trials Register (EudraCT 2011-004890-10) and the ISRCTN Registry (ISRCTN35648481). ",
        "Sleep Duration and Myocardial Infarction. BACKGROUND: Observational studies suggest associations between extremes of sleep duration and myocardial infarction (MI), but the causal contribution of sleep to MI and its potential to mitigate genetic predisposition to coronary disease is unclear. OBJECTIVES: This study sought to investigate associations between sleep duration and incident MI, accounting for joint effects with other sleep traits and genetic risk of coronary artery disease, and to assess causality using Mendelian randomization (MR). METHODS: In 461,347 UK Biobank (UKB) participants free of relevant cardiovascular disease, the authors estimated multivariable adjusted hazard ratios (HR) for MI (5,128 incident cases) across habitual self-reported short (<6 h) and long (>9 h) sleep duration, and examined joint effects with sleep disturbance traits and a coronary artery disease genetic risk score. The authors conducted 2-sample MR for short (24 single nucleotide polymorphisms) and continuous (71 single nucleotide polymorphisms) sleep duration with MI (n\u00a0=\u00a043,676 cases/128,199 controls), and replicated results in UKB (n\u00a0=\u00a012,111/325,421). RESULTS: Compared with sleeping 6 to 9 h/night, short sleepers had a 20% higher multivariable-adjusted risk of incident MI (HR: 1.20; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.07 to 1.33), and long sleepers had a 34% higher risk (HR: 1.34; 95%\u00a0CI: 1.13 to 1.58); associations were independent of other sleep traits. Healthy sleep duration mitigated MI risk even among individuals with high genetic liability (HR: 0.82; 95%\u00a0CI: 0.68 to 0.998). MR was consistent with a causal effect of short sleep duration on MI in CARDIoGRAMplusC4D (Coronary ARtery DIsease Genome wide Replication and Meta-analysis plus Coronary Artery Disease Genetics Consortium) (HR: 1.19; 95%\u00a0CI: 1.09 to 1.29) and UKB (HR: 1.21; 95%\u00a0CI: 1.08 to 1.37). CONCLUSIONS: Prospective observational and MR analyses support short sleep duration as a potentially causal risk factor for MI. Investigation of sleep extension to prevent MI may be warranted. ",
        "Post-exercise hypotension and skeletal muscle oxygenation is regulated by nitrate-reducing activity of oral bacteria. Post-exercise hypotension (PEH) is a common physiological phenomenon leading to lower blood pressure after acute exercise, but it is not fully understood how this intriguing response occurs. This study investigated whether the nitrate-reducing activity of oral bacteria is a key mechanism to trigger PEH. Following a randomized, double blind and crossover design, twenty-three healthy individuals (15 males/8 females) completed two treadmill trials at moderate intensity. After exercise, participants rinsed their mouth with antibacterial mouthwash to inhibit the activity of oral bacteria or a placebo mouthwash. Blood pressure was measured before, 1h and 2\u202fh after exercise. The microvascular response to a reactive hyperaemia test, as well as blood and salivary samples were taken before and 2\u202fh after exercise to analyse nitrate and nitrite concentrations and the oral microbiome. As expected, systolic blood pressure (SBP) was lower (1\u202fh: -5.2\u202f\u00b1\u202f1.0\u202fmmHg; P\u202f<\u202f0.001); 2\u202fh: -3.8\u202f\u00b1\u202f1.1\u202fmmHg, P\u202f=\u202f0.005) after exercise compared to baseline in the placebo condition. This was accompanied by an increase of circulatory nitrite 2\u202fh after exercise (2h: 100\u202f\u00b1\u202f13\u202fnM) compared to baseline (59\u202f\u00b1\u202f9\u202fnM; P\u202f=\u202f0.013). Additionally, an increase in the peak of the tissue oxygenation index (TOI) during the reactive hyperaemia response was observed after exercise (86.1\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.6%) compared to baseline levels (84.8\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.5%; P\u202f=\u202f0.010) in the placebo condition. On the other hand, the SBP-lowering effect of exercise was attenuated by 61% at 1\u202fh in the recovery period, and it was fully attenuated 2\u202fh after exercise with antibacterial mouthwash. This was associated with a lack of changes in circulatory nitrite (P\u202f>\u202f0.05), and impaired microvascular response (peak TOI baseline: 85.1\u202f\u00b1\u202f3.1%; peak TOI post-exercise: 84.6\u202f\u00b1\u202f3.2%; P\u202f>\u202f0.05). Diversity of oral bacteria did not change after exercise in any treatment. These findings show that nitrite synthesis by oral commensal bacteria is a key mechanism to induce the vascular response to exercise over the first period of recovery thereby promoting lower blood pressure and greater muscle oxygenation.

        "Modified Mediterranean-ketogenic diet modulates gut microbiome and short-chain fatty acids in association with Alzheimer's disease markers in subjects with mild cognitive impairment. BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) prevalence is increasing, but its etiology remains elusive. Gut microbes can contribute to AD pathology and may help identifying novel markers and therapies against AD. Herein, we examine how the gut microbiome differs in older adults with mild cognitive impairment compared to cognitively normal counterparts, and whether and how a modified Mediterranean-ketogenic diet (MMKD) alters the gut microbiome signature in association with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) AD biomarkers. METHODS: A randomized, double-blind, cross-over, single-center pilot study of MMKD versus American Heart Association Diet (AHAD) intervention is performed on 17 subjects (age: 64.6\u202f\u00b1\u202f6.4\u202fyr), of which 11 have mild cognitive impairment, while 6 are cognitively normal. Subjects undergo MMKD and AHAD intervention for 6-weeks separated by 6-weeks washout periods. Gut microbiome, fecal short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), and markers of AD in CSF including amyloid \u03b2 (A\u03b2)-40 and A\u00df-42, total tau, and phosphorylated tau-181 (tau-p181) are measured at before and after diet interventions. FINDINGS: At baseline, subjects with normal vs. impaired cognition show no notable difference in microbiome diversity but several unique microbial signatures are detected in subjects with mild cognitive impairment. Proteobacteria correlate positively with A\u03b2-42: A\u03b2-40 while fecal propionate and butyrate correlates negatively with A\u03b2-42 in subjects with mild cognitive impairment. Several bacteria are differently affected by the two diets with distinct patterns between cognitively normal and impaired subjects. Notably, the abundance of Enterobacteriaceae, Akkermansia, Slackia, Christensenellaceae and Erysipelotriaceae increases while that of Bifidobacterium and Lachnobacterium reduces on MMKD, while AHAD increases Mollicutes. MMKD slightly reduces fecal lactate and acetate while increasing propionate and butyrate. Conversely, AHAD increases acetate and propionate while reducing butyrate. INTERPRETATION: The data suggest that specific gut microbial signatures may depict the mild cognitive impairment and that the MMKD can modulate the gut microbiome and metabolites in association with improved AD biomarkers in CSF.

        "Association Between Soft Drink Consumption and Mortality in 10 European Countries. Importance: Soft drinks are frequently consumed, but whether this consumption is associated with mortality risk is unknown and has been understudied in European populations to date. Objective: To examine the association between total, sugar-sweetened, and artificially sweetened soft drink consumption and subsequent total and cause-specific mortality. Design, Setting, and Participants: This population-based cohort study involved participants (n\u2009=\u2009451\u202f743 of the full cohort) in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC), an ongoing, large multinational cohort of people from 10 European countries (Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom), with participants recruited between January 1, 1992, and December 31, 2000. Excluded participants were those who reported cancer, heart disease, stroke, or diabetes at baseline; those with implausible dietary intake data; and those with missing soft drink consumption or follow-up information. Data analyses were performed from February 1, 2018, to October 1, 2018. Exposure: Consumption of total, sugar-sweetened, and artificially sweetened soft drinks. Main Outcomes and Measures: Total mortality and cause-specific mortality. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs were estimated using multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression models adjusted for other mortality risk factors. Results: In total, 521 330 individuals were enrolled. Of this total, 451\u202f743 (86.7%) were included in the study, with a mean (SD) age of 50.8 (9.8) years and with 321\u202f081 women (71.1%). During a mean (range) follow-up of 16.4 (11.1 in Greece to 19.2 in France) years, 41\u202f693 deaths occurred. Higher all-cause mortality was found among participants who consumed 2 or more glasses per day (vs consumers of <1 glass per month) of total soft drinks (hazard ratio [HR],\u20091.17; 95% CI, 1.11-1.22; P\u2009<\u2009.001), sugar-sweetened soft drinks (HR, 1.08; 95% CI, 1.01-1.16; P\u2009=\u2009.004), and artificially sweetened soft drinks (HR,\u20091.26; 95% CI, 1.16-1.35; P\u2009<\u2009.001). Positive associations were also observed between artificially sweetened soft drinks and deaths from circulatory diseases (\u22652 glasses per day vs <1 glass per month; HR,\u20091.52; 95% CI, 1.30-1.78; P\u2009<\u2009.001) and between sugar-sweetened soft drinks and deaths from digestive diseases (\u22651 glass per day vs <1 glass per month; HR,\u20091.59; 95% CI, 1.24-2.05; P\u2009<\u2009.001). Conclusions and Relevance: This study found that consumption of total, sugar-sweetened, and artificially sweetened soft drinks was positively associated with all-cause deaths in this large European cohort; the results are supportive of public health campaigns aimed at limiting the consumption of soft drinks.

        "Social Misfit or Normal Development? Students Who Do Not Date. OBJECTIVE: Prior research identified 4 distinct dating trajectories from 6th to 12th grade: Low, Increasing, High Middle School, and Frequent. The purpose of this study was to examine whether 10th graders in the Low dating group differed on emotional, interpersonal, and adaptive skills from youth in the other trajectories. METHODS: The sample consisted of 594 10th graders. We compared the 4 dating groups using teacher ratings (social skills, leadership, depression) and student self-reports (positive relationships with friends, at home, and at school; depression, suicidal ideation). To compare scores by dating trajectory, we used chi-square test and analysis of variance. RESULTS: Students in the Low dating group had significantly higher teacher ratings of social skills and leadership, and lower ratings of depression compared to the other groups. Self-reports of positive relationships did not differ by dating groups. Self-reported depression was significantly lower in the Low dating group, but suicidal ideations did not differ. CONCLUSION: Adolescents who were not in a romantic relationship had good social skills and low depression, and fared better or equal to peers who dated. These results refute the notion that non-daters are maladjusted. Health promotion interventions in schools should include non-dating as one option of healthy development. ",
        "Microglial UCP2 Mediates Inflammation and Obesity Induced by High-Fat Feeding. Microglia play a crucial role in immune responses, including inflammation. Diet-induced obesity (DIO) triggers microglia activation and hypothalamic inflammation as early as 3\u00a0days after high-fat diet (HFD) exposure, before changes in body weight occur. The intracellular mechanism(s) responsible for HFD-induced microglia activation is ill defined. Here, we show that in\u00a0vivo, HFD induced a rapid and transient increase in uncoupling protein 2 (Ucp2) mRNA expression together with changes in mitochondrial dynamics. Selective microglial deletion of Ucp2 prevented changes in mitochondrial dynamics and function, microglia activation, and hypothalamic inflammation. In association with these, male and female mice were protected from HFD-induced obesity, showing decreased feeding and increased energy expenditure that were associated with changes in the synaptic input organization and activation of the anorexigenic hypothalamic POMC neurons and astrogliosis. Together, our data point to a fuel-availability-driven mitochondrial mechanism as a major player of microglia activation in the central regulation of DIO. ",
        "Oral Fluoroquinolones and Risk\u00a0of\u00a0Mitral\u00a0and Aortic Regurgitation. BACKGROUND: Recent studies have linked fluoroquinolones (FQs) to cardiac adverse events, including aortic dissection and aneurysm. To date, whether FQs can increase the risk of aortic or mitral regurgitation has not been studied. OBJECTIVES: This disproportionality analysis and case-control study examined whether FQs increase the risk of aortic and mitral regurgitation. METHODS: Data from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's adverse reporting system database was used to undertake a disproportionality analysis, and a random sample of 9,053,240 patients from the U.S. PharMetrics Plus database (IQVIA) was used for the matched nested case-control study. Current FQ exposure implied an active prescription at the index date or 30\u00a0days prior to the event date. Recent FQ exposure was defined as FQ use within days 31 to 60 and past within days 61 to 365 prior to the event date. Rate ratios (RRs) were compared to users of amoxicillin and azithromycin. Conditional logistic regression was used to compute RRs adjusting for confounders. RESULTS: The reported odds ratio for the disproportionality analysis was 1.45 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.20 to 1.77). A total of 12,505 cases and 125,020 control subjects were identified in the case-control study. The adjusted RRs for current users of FQ compared with amoxicillin and azithromycin users were 2.40 (95%\u00a0CI: 1.82 to 3.16) and 1.75 (95%\u00a0CI: 1.34 to 2.29), respectively. The adjusted RRs for recent and past FQ users when compared with amoxicillin were 1.47 (95%\u00a0CI: 1.03 to 2.09) and 1.06 (95%\u00a0CI: 0.91 to 1.21), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: These results show that the risk of aortic and mitral regurgitation is highest with current use followed by recent use. No risk was observed with past use of FQs. Future studies are necessary to confirm or refute these associations. ",
        "Habitual tea drinking modulates brain efficiency: evidence from brain connectivity evaluation. The majority of tea studies have relied on neuropsychological measures, and much fewer on neuroimaging measures, especially for interregional connections. To date, there has been no exploration of the effect of tea on system-level brain networks. We recruited healthy older participants to two groups according to their history of tea drinking frequency and investigated both functional and structural networks to reveal the role of tea drinking on brain organization. The results showed that tea drinking gave rise to the more efficient structural organization, but had no significant beneficial effect on the global functional organization. The suppression of hemispheric asymmetry in the structural connectivity network was observed as a result of tea drinking. We did not observe any significant effects of tea drinking on the hemispheric asymmetry of the functional connectivity network. In addition, functional connectivity strength within the default mode network (DMN) was greater for the tea-drinking group, and coexistence of increasing and decreasing connective strengths was observed in the structural connectivity of the DMN. Our study offers the first evidence of the positive contribution of tea drinking to brain structure and suggests a protective effect on age-related decline in brain organisation. ",
        "Abdominal Etching: Surgical Technique and Outcomes. BACKGROUND: The ideal body is characterized by a muscular physique and defined anterior abdominal wall. Despite diet and exercise, many are unable to achieve this desired result. Liposuction with abdominal etching is used to achieve high-definition abdominal aesthetics. The etching technique is performed with liposuction in a superficial plane, to create indentures consistent with \"six-pack abs,\" or definition of vertical abdominal lines. METHODS: The authors' abdominal etching preoperative markings, surgical technique, and postoperative care are discussed. The surgeons' experience with abdominal etching in 50 consecutive patients is reviewed, including rate of complications and patient satisfaction. RESULTS: The average patient age was 36.4 years. We had an almost equal number of men (n = 26) and women (n = 24), with an average body mass index of 26.7 kg/m. The average blood loss was 275 ml, the average tumescence was 6 liters, and the average lipoaspirate was 5 liters. There were no major complications such as fat embolus, deep venous thrombosis, or intraabdominal injury. The most common minor postoperative complications were contour irregularities (12 percent), seromas (10 percent), and hyperpigmentation (2 percent). The majority of patients were satisfied (98 percent). The average length of postoperative follow-up was 27 months. CONCLUSIONS: Abdominal etching is a safe and effective method of creating a defined anterior abdominal wall for patients who desire the muscular definition of vertical abdominal lines. Almost all of our patients reviewed were satisfied with this procedure, maintained long-term results, and had an acceptable rate of complications. CLINICAL QUESTION/LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic, IV. ",
        "Four nights of sleep restriction suppress the postprandial lipemic response and decrease satiety. Chronic sleep restriction, or inadequate sleep, is associated with increased risk of cardiometabolic disease. Laboratory studies demonstrate that sleep restriction causes impaired whole-body insulin sensitivity and glucose disposal. Evidence suggests that inadequate sleep also impairs adipose tissue insulin sensitivity and the NEFA rebound during intravenous glucose tolerance tests, yet no studies have examined the effects of sleep restriction on high-fat meal lipemia. We assessed the effect of 5 h time in bed (TIB) per night for four consecutive nights on postprandial lipemia following a standardized high-fat dinner (HFD). Furthermore, we assessed whether one night of recovery sleep (10 h TIB) was sufficient to restore postprandial metabolism to baseline. We found that postprandial triglyceride (TG) area under the curve was suppressed by sleep restriction (P = 0.01), but returned to baseline values following one night of recovery. Sleep restriction decreased NEFAs throughout the HFD (P = 0.02) and NEFAs remained suppressed in the recovery condition (P = 0.04). Sleep restriction also decreased participant-reported fullness or satiety (P = 0.03), and decreased postprandial interleukin-6 (P < 0.01). Our findings indicate that four nights of 5 h TIB per night impair postprandial lipemia and that one night of recovery sleep may be adequate for recovery of TG metabolism, but not for markers of adipocyte function.

        "Associations of short stature and components of height with incidence of type 2 diabetes: mediating effects of cardiometabolic risk factors. AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: This study aimed to evaluate associations of height as well as components of height (sitting height and leg length) with risk of type 2 diabetes and to explore to what extent associations are explainable by liver fat and cardiometabolic risk markers. METHODS: A case-cohort study within the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC)-Potsdam study comprising 26,437 participants who provided blood samples was designed. We randomly selected a subcohort of 2500 individuals (2029 diabetes-free at baseline and with anamnestic, anthropometrical and metabolic data for analysis). Of the 820 incident diabetes cases identified in the full cohort during 7\u00a0years of follow-up, 698 remained for analyses after similar exclusions. RESULTS: After adjustment for age, potential lifestyle confounders, education and waist circumference, greater height was related to lower diabetes risk (HR per 10\u00a0cm, men 0.59 [95% CI 0.47, 0.75] and women 0.67 [0.51, 0.88], respectively). Leg length was related to lower risk among men and women, but only among men if adjusted for total height. Adjustment for liver fat and triacylglycerols, adiponectin and C-reactive protein substantially attenuated associations between height and diabetes risk, particularly among women. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: We observed inverse associations between height and risk of type 2 diabetes, which was largely related to leg length among men. The inverse associations may be partly driven by lower liver fat content and a more favourable cardiometabolic profile. ",
        "Muscle strength is increased in mice that are colonized with microbiota from high-functioning older adults. Evidence in support of a gut-muscle axis has been reported in rodents, but studies in older adult humans are limited. Accordingly, the primary goals of the present study were to compare gut microbiome composition in older adults that differed in terms of the percentage of whole body lean mass and physical functioning (high-functioning, HF, n\u202f=\u202f18; low-functioning, LF, n\u202f=\u202f11), and to evaluate the causative role of the gut microbiome on these variables by transferring fecal samples from older adults into germ-free mice. Family-level Prevotellaceae, genus-level Prevotella and Barnesiella, and the bacterial species Barnesiella intestinihominis were higher in HF older adults at the initial study visit, at a 1-month follow-up visit, in HF human fecal donors, and in HF-colonized mice, when compared with their LF counterparts. Grip strength was significantly increased by 6.4% in HF-, when compared with LF-colonized mice. In contrast, despite significant differences for the percentage of whole body lean mass and physical functioning when comparing the human fecal donors, the percentage of whole body lean mass and treadmill endurance capacity were not different when comparing human microbiome-containing mice. In sum, these data suggest a role for gut bacteria on the maintenance of muscle strength, but argue against a role for gut bacteria on the maintenance of the percentage of whole body lean mass or endurance capacity, findings that collectively add to elucidation of the gut-muscle axis in older adults.

        "U.S. obesity as delayed effect of excess sugar. In the last century, U.S. diets were transformed, including the addition of sugars to industrially-processed foods. While excess sugar has often been implicated in the dramatic increase in U.S. adult obesity over the past 30 years, an unexplained question is why the increase in obesity took place many years after the increases in U.S. sugar consumption. To address this, here we explain adult obesity increase as the cumulative effect of increased sugar calories consumed over time. In our model, which uses annual data on U.S. sugar consumption as the input variable, each age cohort inherits the obesity rate in the previous year plus a simple function of the mean excess sugar consumed in the current year. This simple model replicates three aspects of the data: (a) the delayed timing and magnitude of the increase in average U.S. adult obesity (from about 15% in 1970 to almost 40% by 2015); (b) the increase of obesity rates by age group (reaching 47% obesity by age 50) for the year 2015 in a well-documented U.S. state; and (c) the pre-adult increase of obesity rates by several percent from 1988 to the mid-2000s, and subsequent modest decline in obesity rates among younger children since the mid-2000s. Under this model, the sharp rise in adult obesity after 1990 reflects the delayed effects of added sugar calories consumed among children of the 1970s and 1980s. ",
        "Lifelong choline supplementation ameliorates Alzheimer's disease pathology and associated cognitive deficits by attenuating microglia activation. Currently, there are no effective therapies to ameliorate the pathological progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Evidence suggests that environmental factors may contribute to AD. Notably, dietary nutrients are suggested to play a key role in mediating mechanisms associated with brain function. Choline is a B-like vitamin nutrient found in common foods that is important in various cell functions. It serves as a methyl donor and as a precursor for production of cell membranes. Choline is also the precursor for acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter which activates the alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (\u03b17nAchR), and also acts as an agonist for the Sigma-1 R (\u03c31R). These receptors regulate CNS immune response, and their dysregulation contributes to AD pathogenesis. Here, we tested whether dietary choline supplementation throughout life reduces AD-like pathology and rescues memory deficits in the APP/PS1 mouse model of AD. We exposed female APP/PS1 and NonTg mice to either a control choline (1.1\u00a0g/kg choline chloride) or a choline-supplemented diet (5.0\u00a0g/kg choline chloride) from 2.5 to 10\u00a0months of age. Mice were tested in the Morris water maze to assess spatial memory followed by neuropathological evaluation. Lifelong choline supplementation significantly reduced amyloid-\u03b2 plaque load and improved spatial memory in APP/PS1 mice. Mechanistically, these changes were linked to a decrease of the amyloidogenic processing of APP, reductions in disease-associated microglial activation, and a downregulation of the \u03b17nAch and \u03c31 receptors. Our results demonstrate that lifelong choline supplementation produces profound benefits and suggest that simply modifying diet throughout life may reduce AD pathology. ",
        "The intestinal microbiota programs diurnal rhythms in host metabolism through histone deacetylase 3. Circadian rhythmicity is a defining feature of mammalian metabolism that synchronizes metabolic processes to day-night light cycles. Here, we show that the intestinal microbiota programs diurnal metabolic rhythms in the mouse small intestine through histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3). The microbiota induced expression of intestinal epithelial HDAC3, which was recruited rhythmically to chromatin, and produced synchronized diurnal oscillations in histone acetylation, metabolic gene expression, and nutrient uptake. HDAC3 also functioned noncanonically to coactivate estrogen-related receptor \u03b1, inducing microbiota-dependent rhythmic transcription of the lipid transporter gene Cd36 and promoting lipid absorption and diet-induced obesity. Our findings reveal that HDAC3 integrates microbial and circadian cues for regulation of diurnal metabolic rhythms and pinpoint a key mechanism by which the microbiota controls host metabolism. ",
        "The paradox of relaxation training: Relaxation induced anxiety and mediation effects of negative contrast sensitivity in generalized anxiety disorder and major depressive disorder. BACKGROUND: The Contrast Avoidance Model postulates that individuals with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) fear a sharp spike in negative emotion, and thus, prefer to worry to maintain their negative affect rather than being in a more euthymic state, such as relaxation. Relaxation induced anxiety (RIA) is a paradoxical phenomenon wherein people experience a spike in their anxiety during relaxation training. Because these phenomena may be related and may also operate among individuals with major depressive disorder (MDD), we attempted to test whether negative contrast sensitivity was a mediator of GAD or MDD in the prediction of RIA. METHODS: Individuals with GAD (n\u202f=\u202f32), MDD (n\u202f=\u202f34), and healthy controls (n\u202f=\u202f30) were exposed to a negative emotional contrast by engaging with relaxation practice and then watching a negative emotional video. This was followed by the assessment of their negative contrast sensitivity. After this, participants engaged again with relaxation and RIA was measured. We examined mediation effects of negative contrast on the relationship between diagnostic status and RIA. RESULTS: Negative contrast sensitivity fully mediated GAD and partially mediated MDD in predicting RIA. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings support the hypotheses that negative contrast sensitivity is the mediator of both GAD and MDD in predicting RIA. This may have implications for assessment and treatment of GAD and MDD. ",
        "Mushroom consumption and incident risk of prostate cancer in Japan: A pooled analysis of the Miyagi Cohort Study and the Ohsaki Cohort Study. In vivo and in vitro evidence has shown that mushrooms have the potential to prevent prostate cancer. However, the relationship between mushroom consumption and incident prostate cancer in humans has never been investigated. In the present study, a total of 36,499 men, aged 40-79\u2009years, who participated in the Miyagi Cohort Study in 1990 and in the Ohsaki Cohort Study in 1994 were followed for a median of 13.2 years. Data on mushroom consumption (categorized as <1, 1-2 and \u22653 times/week) was collected using a validated food frequency questionnaire. Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was used to estimate multivariate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for prostate cancer incidence. During 574,397 person-years of follow-up, 1,204 (3.3%) cases of prostate cancer were identified. Compared to participants with mushroom consumption <1 time/week, frequent mushroom intake was associated with a decreased risk of prostate cancer (1-2 times/week: HRs [95% CIs] = 0.92 [0.81, 1.05]; \u22653 times/week: HRs [95% CIs] = 0.83 [0.70, 0.98]; p-trend = 0.023). This inverse relationship was especially obvious among participants aged \u226550\u2009years and did not differ by clinical stage of cancer and intake of vegetables, fruit, meat and dairy products. The present study showed an inverse relationship between mushroom consumption and incident prostate cancer among middle-aged and elderly Japanese men, suggesting that habitual mushroom intake might help to prevent prostate cancer.

        "RGS4 Maintains Chronic Pain Symptoms in Rodent Models. Regulator of G-protein signaling 4 (RGS4) is a potent modulator of G-protein-coupled receptor signal transduction that is expressed throughout the pain matrix. Here, we use genetic mouse models to demonstrate a role of RGS4 in the maintenance of chronic pain states in male and female mice. Using paradigms of peripheral inflammation and nerve injury, we show that the prevention of RGS4 action leads to recovery from mechanical and cold allodynia and increases the motivation for wheel running. Similarly, RGS4KO eliminates the duration of nocifensive behavior in the second phase of the formalin assay. Using the Complete Freud's Adjuvant (CFA) model of hindpaw inflammation we also demonstrate that downregulation of RGS4 in the adult ventral posterolateral thalamic nuclei promotes recovery from mechanical and cold allodynia. RNA sequencing analysis of thalamus (THL) from RGS4WT and RGS4KO mice points to many signal transduction modulators and transcription factors that are uniquely regulated in CFA-treated RGS4WT cohorts. Ingenuity pathway analysis suggests that several components of glutamatergic signaling are differentially affected by CFA treatment between RGS4WT and RGS4KO groups. Notably, Western blot analysis shows increased expression of metabotropic glutamate receptor 2 in THL synaptosomes of RGS4KO mice at time points at which they recover from mechanical allodynia. Overall, our study provides information on a novel intracellular pathway that contributes to the maintenance of chronic pain states and points to RGS4 as a potential therapeutic target.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT There is an imminent need for safe and efficient chronic pain medications. Regulator of G-protein signaling 4 (RGS4) is a multifunctional signal transduction protein, widely expressed in the pain matrix. Here, we demonstrate that RGS4 plays a prominent role in the maintenance of chronic pain symptoms in male and female mice. Using genetically modified mice, we show a dynamic role of RGS4 in recovery from symptoms of sensory hypersensitivity deriving from hindpaw inflammation or hindlimb nerve injury. We also demonstrate an important role of RGS4 actions in gene expression patterns induced by chronic pain states in the mouse thalamus. Our findings provide novel insight into mechanisms associated with the maintenance of chronic pain states and demonstrate that interventions in RGS4 activity promote recovery from sensory hypersensitivity symptoms.

        "Maternal prenatal stress phenotypes associate with fetal neurodevelopment and birth outcomes. Maternal prenatal stress influences offspring neurodevelopment and birth outcomes including the ratio of males to females born; however, there is limited understanding of what types of stress matter, and for whom. Using a data-driven approach with 27 variables from questionnaires, ambulatory diaries, and physical assessments collected early in the singleton pregnancies of 187 women, 3 latent profiles of maternal prenatal stress emerged that were differentially associated with sex at birth, birth outcomes, and fetal neurodevelopment. Most women (66.8%) were in the healthy group (HG); 17.1% were in the psychologically stressed group (PSYG), evidencing clinically meaningful elevations in perceived stress, depression, and anxiety; and 16% were in the physically stressed group (PHSG) with relatively higher ambulatory blood pressure and increased caloric intake. The population normative male:female secondary sex ratio (105:100) was lower in the PSYG (2:3) and PHSG (4:9), and higher in the HG (23:18), consistent with research showing diminished male births in maternal stress contexts. PHSG versus HG infants were born 1.5 wk earlier (P < 0.05) with 22% compared to 5% born preterm. PHSG versus HG fetuses had decreased fetal heart rate-movement coupling (P < 0.05), which may indicate slower central nervous system development, and PSYG versus PHSG fetuses had more birth complications, consistent with previous findings among offspring of women with psychiatric illness. Social support most strongly differentiated the HG, PSYG, and PHSG groups, and higher social support was associated with increased odds of male versus female births. Stress phenotypes in pregnant women are associated with male vulnerability and poor fetal outcomes. ",
        "Potato ingestion is as effective as carbohydrate gels to support prolonged cycling performance. Carbohydrate (CHO) ingestion is an established strategy to improve endurance performance. Race fuels should not only sustain performance but also be readily digested and absorbed. Potatoes are a whole-food-based option that fulfills these criteria, yet their impact on performance remains unexamined. We investigated the effects of potato pur\u00e9e ingestion during prolonged cycling on subsequent performance vs. commercial CHO gel or a water-only condition. Twelve cyclists (70.7\u2009\u00b1\u20097.7 kg, 173\u2009\u00b1\u20098 cm, 31\u2009\u00b1\u20099 yr, 22\u2009\u00b1\u20095.1% body fat; means\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD) with average peak oxygen consumption (V\u0307o2peak) of 60.7\u2009\u00b1\u20099.0 mL\u00b7kg-1\u00b7min-1 performed a 2-h cycling challenge (60-85% V\u0307o2peak) followed by a time trial (TT; 6 kJ/kg body mass) while consuming potato, gel, or water in a randomized-crossover design. The race fuels were administered with [U-13C6]glucose for an indirect estimate of gastric emptying rate. Blood samples were collected throughout the trials. Blood glucose concentrations were higher (P < 0.001) in potato and gel conditions compared with water condition. Blood lactate concentrations were higher (P = 0.001) after the TT completion in both CHO conditions compared with water condition. TT performance was improved (P = 0.032) in both potato (33.0\u2009\u00b1\u20094.5 min) and gel (33.0\u2009\u00b1\u20094.2 min) conditions compared with water condition (39.5\u2009\u00b1\u20097.9 min). Moreover, no difference was observed in TT performance between CHO conditions (P = 1.00). In conclusion, potato and gel ingestion equally sustained blood glucose concentrations and TT performance. Our results support the effective use of potatoes to support race performance for trained cyclists.NEW & NOTEWORTHY The ingestion of concentrated carbohydrate gels during prolonged exercise has been shown to promote carbohydrate availability and improve exercise performance. Our study aim was to expand and diversify race fueling menus for athletes by providing an evidence-based whole-food alternative to the routine ingestion of gels during training and competition. Our work shows that russet potato ingestion during prolonged cycling is as effective as carbohydrate gels to support exercise performance in trained athletes. ",
        "Voluntary exercise is motivated by ghrelin, possibly related to the central reward circuit. We previously reported that voluntary exercise contributed to the amelioration of abnormal feeding behavior with a concomitant restoration of ghrelin production in a rat model of obesity, suggesting a possible relationship between exercise and appetite-regulating hormones. Ghrelin is known to be involved in the brain reward circuits via dopamine neurons related to motivational properties. We investigated the relevance of ghrelin as an initiator of voluntary exercise as well as feeding behavior. The plasma ghrelin concentration fluctuates throughout the day with its peak at the beginning of the dark period in the wild-type (WT) mice with voluntary exercise. Although predominant increases in wheel running activity were observed accordant to the peak of plasma ghrelin concentration in the WT mice, those were severely attenuated in the ghrelin-knockout (GKO) mice under either ad libitum or time-restricted feeding. A single injection of ghrelin receptor agonist brought about and reproduced a marked enhancement of wheel running activity, in contrast to no effect by the continuous administration of the same drug. Brain dopamine levels (DAs) were enhanced after food consumption in the WT mice under voluntary exercise. Although the acceleration of DAs were apparently blunted in the GKO mice, they were dramatically revived after the administration of ghrelin receptor agonist, suggesting the relevance of ghrelin in the reward circuit under voluntary exercise. These findings emphasize that the surge of ghrelin plays a crucial role in the formation of motivation for the initiation of voluntary exercise possibly related to the central dopamine system. ",
        "Obesity and tooth wear among American adults: the role of sugar-sweetened acidic drinks. BACKGROUND: To explore the association between obesity and tooth wear among American adults and the role of sugar-sweetened acidic drinks consumption in explaining that association. METHODS: We analyzed data from 3541 adult participants in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Obesity was determined using the body mass index and tooth wear was assessed using the modified tooth wear index. Daily intake of four categories of drinks was estimated as the average (drinks/day) of two consecutive 24-h dietary recalls. The association between obesity and number of surfaces with moderate-to-severe tooth wear was assessed in hurdle models adjusting for sociodemographic factors, acid reflux medication, and dental insurance. RESULTS: Overweight and obese adults had more surfaces with moderate-to-severe tooth wear than those with normal body size, after adjusting for confounders. The consumption of sugar-sweetened acidic drinks explained part, but not all the above association. More specifically, the estimate for obesity was fully attenuated, whereas the estimate for overweight was slightly attenuated but remained significant. CONCLUSION: Obesity was positively associated with tooth wear in American adults. This association was only partially accounted for by the consumption of sugar-sweetened acidic drinks, a common risk factor for both conditions. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: Dentists must be aware of the health consequences of sugar-sweetened acidic drinks and advocate for reduction in consumption and/or substitution with healthier alternatives.

        "A Moderate-Fat Diet with One Avocado per Day Increases Plasma Antioxidants and Decreases the Oxidation of Small, Dense LDL in Adults with Overweight and Obesity: A Randomized Controlled Trial. BACKGROUND: Avocados are a nutrient-dense source of MUFAs and are rich in antioxidants. Avocados have an additional LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) lowering effect beyond that observed when their MUFAs are substituted for SFAs, especially on small, dense LDL (sdLDL) particles, which are susceptible to in vivo oxidation and associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). OBJECTIVES: We investigated whether a healthy diet with 1 avocado daily decreased the following secondary outcomes: circulating oxidized LDL (oxLDL) and related oxidative stress markers. METHODS: A randomized, crossover, controlled feeding trial was conducted with 45 men and women, aged 21-70 y, with overweight or obesity and elevated LDL-C (25th-90th percentile). Three cholesterol-lowering diets were provided (5 wk each) in random sequences: a lower-fat (LF) diet (24% calories from fat-7% SFAs, 11% MUFAs, 6% PUFAs) and 2 moderate-fat (MF) diets (34% calories from fat-6% SFAs, 17% MUFAs, 9% PUFAs): the avocado (AV) diet included 1 Hass avocado (\u223c136 g) per day, and the MF diet used high oleic acid oils to match the fatty acid profile of 1 avocado. A general linear mixed model was used to analyze the treatment effects. RESULTS: Compared with baseline, the AV diet significantly decreased circulating oxLDL (-7.0 U/L, -8.8%, P\u00a0=\u00a00.0004) and increased plasma lutein concentration (19.6 nmol/L, 68.7%, P\u00a0<\u00a00.0001), and both changes differed significantly from that after the MF and LF diets (P\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.05). The change in oxLDL caused by the AV diet was significantly correlated with the changes in the number of sdLDL particles (r\u00a0=\u00a00.32, P\u00a0=\u00a00.0002) but not large, buoyant LDL particles. CONCLUSIONS: One avocado a day in a heart-healthy diet decreased oxLDL in adults with overweight and obesity, and the effect was associated with the reduction in sdLDL. This trial was registered at http://www.clinicaltrials.gov as NCT01235832. ",
        "Striped bodypainting protects against horseflies. Bodypainting is widespread in African, Australian and Papua New Guinean indigenous communities. Many bodypaintings use white or bright yellow/grey/beige stripes on brown skin. Where the majority of people using bodypainting presently live, blood-sucking horseflies are abundant, and they frequently attack the naked brown regions of the human body surface with the risk of transmitting the pathogens of dangerous diseases. Since horseflies are deterred by the black and white stripes of zebras, we hypothesized that white-striped paintings on dark brown human bodies have a similar effect. In a field experiment in Hungary, we tested this hypothesis. We show that the attractiveness to horseflies of a dark brown human body model significantly decreases, if it is painted with the white stripes that are used in bodypaintings. Our brown human model was 10 times more attractive to horseflies than the white-striped brown model, and a beige model, which was used as a control, attracted two times more horseflies than the striped brown model. Thus, white-striped bodypaintings, such as those used by African and Australian people, may serve to deter horseflies, which is an advantageous byproduct of these bodypaintings that could lead to reduced irritation and disease transmission by these blood-sucking insects.

        "Memory retrieval modulates spatial tuning of single neurons in the human entorhinal cortex. The medial temporal lobe is critical for both spatial navigation and memory. Although single neurons in the medial temporal lobe activate to represent locations in the environment during navigation, how this spatial tuning relates to memory for events involving those locations remains unclear. We examined memory-related changes in spatial tuning by recording single-neuron activity from neurosurgical patients performing a virtual-reality object-location memory task. We identified 'memory-trace cells' with activity that was spatially tuned to the retrieved location of the specific object that participants were cued to remember. Memory-trace cells in the entorhinal cortex, in particular, encoded discriminable representations of different memories through a memory-specific rate code. These findings indicate that single neurons in the human entorhinal cortex change their spatial tuning to target relevant memories for retrieval. ",
        "Single-cell transcriptomics reveals expansion of cytotoxic CD4 T cells in supercentenarians. Supercentenarians, people who have reached 110 y of age, are a great model of healthy aging. Their characteristics of delayed onset of age-related diseases and compression of morbidity imply that their immune system remains functional. Here we performed single-cell transcriptome analysis of 61,202 peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), derived from 7 supercentenarians and 5 younger controls. We identified a marked increase of cytotoxic CD4 T cells (CD4 cytotoxic T lymphocytes [CTLs]) as a signature of supercentenarians. Furthermore, single-cell T cell receptor sequencing of 2 supercentenarians revealed that CD4 CTLs had accumulated through massive clonal expansion, with the most frequent clonotypes accounting for 15 to 35% of the entire CD4 T cell population. The CD4 CTLs exhibited substantial heterogeneity in their degree of cytotoxicity as well as a nearly identical transcriptome to that of CD8 CTLs. This indicates that CD4 CTLs utilize the transcriptional program of the CD8 lineage while retaining CD4 expression. Indeed, CD4 CTLs extracted from supercentenarians produced IFN-\u03b3 and TNF-\u03b1 upon ex vivo stimulation. Our study reveals that supercentenarians have unique characteristics in their circulating lymphocytes, which may represent an essential adaptation to achieve exceptional longevity by sustaining immune responses to infections and diseases.

        "Antibiotic exposure and risk of Parkinson's disease in Finland: A nationwide case-control study. BACKGROUND: Gut microbiota alterations have been found in prodromal and established Parkinson's disease (PD). Antibiotic exposure can have long-term effects on the composition of human intestinal microbiota, but a potential connection between antibiotic exposure and risk of PD has not been studied previously. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the impact of antibiotic exposure on the risk of PD in a nationwide, register-based, case-control study. METHODS: We identified all patients who were diagnosed with PD in Finland during the years 1998 to 2014. Information was obtained on individual purchases of orally administered antibiotics during the years 1993 to 2014. We assessed the association between prior antibiotic exposure and PD using conditional logistic regression. RESULTS: The study population consisted of 13,976 PD cases and 40,697 controls. The strongest connection with PD risk was found for oral exposure to macrolides and lincosamides (adjusted odds ratio up to 1.416; 95% confidence interval, 1.053-1.904). After correction for multiple comparisons, exposure to antianaerobics and tetracyclines 10 to 15\u2009years before the index date, sulfonamides and trimethoprim 1 to 5\u2009years before the index date, and antifungal medications 1 to 5\u2009years before the index date were positively associated with PD risk. In post hoc analyses, further positive associations were found for broad-spectrum antibiotics. CONCLUSIONS: Exposure to certain types of oral antibiotics seems to be associated with an elevated risk of PD with a delay that is consistent with the proposed duration of a prodromal period. The pattern of associations supports the hypothesis that effects on gut microbiota could link antibiotics to PD, but further studies are needed to confirm this. \u00a9 2019 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.

        "Ten-Hour Time-Restricted Eating Reduces Weight, Blood Pressure, and Atherogenic Lipids in Patients with Metabolic Syndrome. In animal models, time-restricted feeding (TRF) can prevent and reverse aspects of metabolic diseases. Time-restricted eating (TRE) in human pilot studies reduces the risks of metabolic diseases in otherwise healthy individuals. However, patients with diagnosed metabolic syndrome often undergo pharmacotherapy, and it has never been tested whether TRE can act synergistically with pharmacotherapy in animal models or humans. In a single-arm, paired-sample trial, 19 participants with metabolic syndrome and a baseline mean daily eating window of \u226514 h, the majority of whom were on a statin and/or antihypertensive therapy, underwent 10\u00a0h of TRE (all dietary intake within a consistent self-selected 10\u00a0h window) for 12\u00a0weeks. We found this TRE intervention improves cardiometabolic health for patients with metabolic syndrome receiving standard medical care including high rates of statin and anti-hypertensive use. TRE is a potentially powerful lifestyle intervention that can be added to standard medical practice to treat metabolic syndrome. VIDEO ABSTRACT. ",
        "Light to moderate amount of lifetime alcohol consumption and risk of cancer in Japan. BACKGROUND: Even light to moderate alcohol consumption has been shown to increase cancer incidence. However, this association has not been well characterized in Japan. METHODS: Based on a nationwide, hospital-based data set (2005-2016), a multicenter case-control study was conducted (63,232 cancer cases and 63,232 controls matched for sex, age, admission date, and admitting hospital). The total amount of lifetime alcohol consumption (drink-years) was recalled for each patient by multiplication of the daily amount of standardized alcohol use (drinks per day) and the duration of drinking (years). Odds ratios (ORs) were estimated for overall and specific cancer sites via conditional logistic regression with restricted cubic splines, with adjustments made for smoking, occupational class, and comorbidities. Lifetime abstainers served as the reference group. RESULTS: Spline curves showed a dose-response association with overall cancer risk: the minimum risk was at 0\u00a0drink-years, and the OR at 10 drink-years was 1.05 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.04-1.06). In comparison with lifetime abstainers, the OR for >0 to 20\u00a0drink-years was 1.06 (95% CI, 1.01-1.11). Those who drank 2 drinks or fewer per day had elevated odds for overall cancer risk across all duration-of-drinking categories. The same patterns were observed at light to moderate levels of drinking for most gastrointestinal/aerodigestive cancers as well as breast and prostate cancers. Analyses stratified by sex, different drinking/smoking behaviors, and occupational class mostly showed the same patterns for overall cancer incidence associated with light to moderate levels of drinking. CONCLUSIONS: In Japan, even light to moderate alcohol consumption appears to be associated with elevated cancer risks. ",
        "Are U.S. older adults getting lonelier? Age, period, and cohort differences. Media portrayals of a loneliness \"epidemic\" are premised on an increase in the proportion of people living alone and decreases in rates of civic engagement and religious affiliation over recent decades. However, loneliness is a subjective perception that does not correspond perfectly with objective social circumstances. In this study, we examined whether perceived loneliness is greater among the Baby Boomers-individuals born 1948-1965-relative to those born 1920-1947 and whether older adults have become lonelier over the past decade (2005-2016). We used data from the National Social Life, Health and Aging Project and from the Health and Retirement Study collected during 2005-2016 to estimate differences in loneliness associated with age, birth year, and survey time point. Overall, loneliness decreased with age through the early 70s, after which it increased. We found no evidence that loneliness is substantially higher among the Baby Boomers or that it has increased over the past decade. Loneliness is, however, associated with poor health, living alone or without a spouse-partner, and having fewer close family and friends, which together accounted for the overall increase in loneliness after age 75. Although these data do not support the idea that older adults are becoming lonelier, the actual number of lonely individuals may increase as the Baby Boomers age into their 80s and beyond. Our results suggest that attention to social factors and improving health may help to mitigate this. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved). Loneliness declines across birth cohorts: The impact of mastery and self-efficacy. In the public debate and media, it has been suggested that there currently is a \"loneliness epidemic\" in Western societies. To shed light on this pressing issue we investigated whether age-related changes in loneliness found in early studies also pertain to later-born cohorts, and whether mastery and self-efficacy have become increasingly important for explaining differences in loneliness. We used data from the Longitudinal Aging Study Amsterdam. Observations were of 4,880 Dutch people aged 55 and older between 1992 and 2016. We employed multilevel regression analyses incorporating birth cohort while controlling for age. Older adults were less lonely in later-born cohorts, although the effect size was small (d = .11 at Age 65 comparing Cohorts 1918-1927 and 1948-1957; and d = .11 at Age 75 comparing cohorts 1908-1917 and 1938-1947). Furthermore, we found a sharp age-related increase in loneliness; older people were lonelier than younger people (d = .83 comparing Ages 75 and 95 in Cohort 1908-1917; and d = .21 comparing Ages 55 and 78 in Cohort 1938-1947). Age effects thus clearly outweigh cohort effects in size. Increasing levels of mastery and self-efficacy across birth cohorts explain the observed cohort-related decline in loneliness. Mastery contributes similar to the effect size of partner status in the explanation of differences in loneliness. We conclude that there is no evidence of a loneliness epidemic among later-born cohorts of older adults relative to earlier-born cohorts. Also, mastery and self-efficacy are crucial to fully understanding loneliness in today's society. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved). ",
        "Yoga Effects on Brain Health: A Systematic Review of the Current Literature. Yoga is the most popular complementary health approach practiced by adults in the United States. It is an ancient mind and body practice with origins in Indian philosophy. Yoga combines physical postures, rhythmic breathing and meditative exercise to offer the practitioners a unique holistic mind-body experience. While the health benefits of physical exercise are well established, in recent years, the active attentional component of breathing and meditation practice has garnered interest among exercise neuroscientists. As the scientific evidence for the physical and mental health benefits of yoga continues to grow, this article aims to summarize the current knowledge of yoga practice and its documented positive effects for brain structure and function, as assessed with MRI, fMRI, and SPECT. We reviewed 11 studies examining the effects of yoga practice on the brain structures, function and cerebral blood flow. Collectively, the studies demonstrate a positive effect of yoga practice on the structure and/or function of the hippocampus, amygdala, prefrontal cortex, cingulate cortex and brain networks including the default mode network (DMN). The studies offer promising early evidence that behavioral interventions like yoga may hold promise to mitigate age-related and neurodegenerative declines as many of the regions identified are known to demonstrate significant age-related atrophy.

        "Restoration of vision after de novo genesis of rod photoreceptors in mammalian retinas. In zebrafish, M\u00fcller glia (MG) are a source of retinal stem cells that can replenish damaged retinal neurons and restore vision1. In mammals, however, MG do not spontaneously re-enter the cell cycle to generate a population of stem or progenitor cells that differentiate into retinal neurons. Nevertheless, the regenerative machinery may exist in the mammalian retina, as retinal injury can stimulate MG proliferation followed by limited neurogenesis2-7. Therefore, there is still a fundamental question regarding whether MG-derived regeneration can be exploited to restore vision in mammalian retinas. Gene transfer of \u03b2-catenin stimulates MG proliferation in the absence of injury in mouse retinas8. Here we report that following gene transfer of \u03b2-catenin, cell-cycle-reactivated MG can be reprogrammed to generate rod photoreceptors by subsequent gene transfer of transcription factors essential for rod cell fate specification and determination. MG-derived rods restored visual responses in Gnat1rd17Gnat2cpfl3 double mutant mice, a model of congenital blindness9,10, throughout the visual pathway from the retina to the primary visual cortex. Together, our results provide evidence of vision restoration after de novo MG-derived genesis of rod photoreceptors in mammalian retinas. ",
        "Impact of Peppermint Therapy on Dysphagia and Non-cardiac Chest Pain: A Pilot Study. BACKGROUND: Due to its smooth muscle relaxing properties, peppermint oil (PO) may relieve dysphagia and chest pain due to esophageal motility disorders. AIM: To explore the impact of PO on dysphagia and/or chest pain in patients referred for motility testing. METHODS: Patients initiated on PO for dysphagia and/or chest pain from 2013 to 2016 were identified. We excluded patients with obstructing esophageal lesions, patients lost to follow-up, and those with preexisting cardiac conditions. Concentrated PO was given as commercially available dissolvable peppermint tablets; two tablets before meals were prescribed to patients with dysphagia and on an as-needed basis for patients with chest pain. Patient-reported symptom response was assessed using a modified five-point Likert scale. RESULTS: Thirty-eight patients were included. Twenty-four patients (63%) reported improvement; 12 were much better and 12 were slightly better. Fourteen experienced no change and none reported feeling worse. Based on pre-treatment HRM, patients with distal esophageal spasm (DES) (n\u2009=\u200910) and esophagogastric junction outflow obstruction (EGJOO) (n\u2009=\u20098) appeared to demonstrate the best subjective improvement (83% and 100%, respectively)\u00a0(P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). CONCLUSION: PO appears to provide symptomatic relief in some patients with dysphagia and CP. Presence of a well-defined manometric disorder, particularly DES or EGJOO, appeared to predict response.

        "Improvements in Attention Following Cognitive Training With the Novel \"Decoder\" Game on an iPad. Work and study increasingly rely on the use of technologies requiring individuals to switch attention rapidly between emails, texts and tasks. This has led to healthy people having problems of attention and concentration and difficulties getting into the \"flow,\" which impedes goal attainment and task completion. Possibly related to this, there is an increasing diagnosis of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and prescriptions of drugs such as methylphenidate. In addition to ADHD, attention is impaired in other neuropsychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia and in traumatic brain injury (TBI). Based on neuropsychological and neuroimaging evidence, we developed \"Decoder,\" a novel game for targeted cognitive training of visual sustained attention on an iPad. We aimed to investigate the effects of cognitive training in 75 healthy young adults randomly assigned to a Cognitive Training (8 h of playing Decoder over 4 weeks; n = 25), Active Control (8 h of playing Bingo over 4 weeks; n = 25) or Passive Control (continuation of activities of daily living; n = 25) group. Results indicated that cognitive training with Decoder was superior to both control groups in terms of increased target sensitivity (A') on the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery Rapid Visual Information processing (CANTAB RVP) test, indicating significantly improved sustained visual attention. Individuals playing Decoder also showed significantly better performance on the Trail Making Test (TMT) compared with those playing Bingo. Significant differences in visual analogue scales were also found between the two gaming groups, such that Decoder received higher ratings of enjoyment, task-related motivation and alertness across all hours of game play. These data suggest that cognitive training with Decoder is an effective non-pharmacological method for enhancing attention in healthy young adults, which could be extended to clinical populations in which attentional problems persist.

        "Aging-related changes in fluid intelligence, muscle and adipose mass, and sex-specific immunologic mediation: A longitudinal UK Biobank study. BACKGROUND: Obesity in midlife and early late-life is associated with worse normal cognitive aging. Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) suggests that visceral adipose mass (VAM) plays a predominant role, whereas non-visceral adipose mass (NVAM) and lean muscle mass (LMM) have shown conflicting relationships. It is unknown how longitudinal, cognitive changes in age-sensitive domains like fluid intelligence (FI) correspond to VAM, NVAM, and LMM in women and men. Furthermore, changes over time in blood leukocyte sub-populations may partially or fully account for sex-specific associations. METHODS: Data on 4431 late middle-aged, cognitively unimpaired adults (mean\u202f=\u202f64.5\u202fy) was obtained from the UK Biobank prospective cohort across 22 centers. FI scores, blood leukocyte counts, and covariates (age, social class, education) were measured at three 2-year intervals over 6\u202fyears. DEXA collection overlapped with these intervals. Sex-stratified growth curves, structural equations, and Preacher-Hayes mediation were used to estimate direct and indirect effects. \u03b2-weights were standardized. RESULTS: More LMM predicted gains in FI scores among women (\u03b2\u202f=\u202f0.130, p\u202f<\u202f.001) and men (\u03b2\u202f=\u202f0.089, p\u202f<\u202f.001). Conversely, more VAM and NVAM independently predicted FI decline equally among sexes (e.g., NVAM: women: \u03b2\u202f=\u202f-0.082, p\u202f<\u202f.001; men: \u03b2\u202f=\u202f-0.076, p\u202f<\u202f.001). Among women, FI associations were fully mediated by higher eosinophil counts via VAM (\u03bb\u202f=\u202f30.8%, p\u202f=\u202f.028) and lower lymphocyte counts via LMM (\u03bb\u202f=\u202f69.2%, p\u202f=\u202f.021). Among men, FI associations were partially mediated by lower basophils counts via LMM (\u03bb\u202f=\u202f4.5%, p\u202f=\u202f.042) and higher counts via VAM (\u03bb\u202f=\u202f50%, p\u202f=\u202f.037). CONCLUSION: The proportion of LMM and VAM equally influenced male FI changes over 6\u202fyears, whereas higher LMM among women appeared to more strongly influence. FI changes. Leukocyte counts strongly mediated VAM- and LMM-related FI changes in a sex-specific manner, but not for NVAM. For clinical translation, exercise studies in older adults may benefit from assessing sex-specific values of DEXA-based tissue mass, FI, and leukocyte sub-populations to gauge potential cognitive benefits of less VAM and more LMM.

        "Sex differences in cardiometabolic disorders. The prevalence of cardiometabolic disorders in both women and men has increased worldwide and is linked to a rise in obesity and obesity-associated associated clustering of other cardiometabolic risk factors such as hypertension, impaired glucose regulation and dyslipidemia. However, the predominance of common types of cardiometabolic disorders such as heart failure, atrial fibrillation and ischemic heart disease is sex specific, and our identification of these and the underlying mechanisms is only just emerging. New evidence suggests that sex hormones, sex-specific molecular mechanisms and gender influence glucose and lipid metabolisms, as well as cardiac energy metabolism, and function. Here we review sex differences in cardiometabolic risk factors, associated preclinical and clinical cardiac disorders and potential therapeutic avenues. ",
        "Beyond the Calories-Is the Problem in the Processing?. PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The purpose of this review is to describe the trends in dietary patterns and food quality over time along with the possible role of ultra-processed foods in obesity, chronic diseases, and all-cause mortality in the US population. RECENT FINDINGS: There is a rising obesity epidemic, corresponding chronic diseases, and increases in ultra-processed food consumption. In mice and in vitro trials, emulsifiers, found in processed foods, have been found to alter microbiome compositions, elevate fasting blood glucose, cause hyperphagia, increase weight gain and adiposity, and induce hepatic steatosis. Recent human trials have found ultra-processed foods as a contributor to decreased satiety, increased meal eating rates, worsening biochemical markers, and more weight gain. In contrast, Blue Zone, indigenous South American, and Mediterranean populations with low meat intake, high fiber, and minimally processed foods have far less chronic diseases, obesity rates, and live longer disease-free. As the USA continues to industrialize, food has become more processed and cheaper and more convenient along with the coexistent rise in obesity prevalence. This review highlights the overall trends in food: mild improvements in dietary quality in higher socioeconomic populations, but no significant increases in whole fruit, vegetables, legumes, or nuts. Consumption of ultra-processed food is associated with weight gain and may contribute to metabolic syndrome and chronic disease. To combat this epidemic, we must create and disseminate detailed recommendations to improve diet quality and overall nutrition. ",
        "Tea consumption and the risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality: The China-PAR project. AIMS: The role of tea consumption in the primary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease remains unclear in cohort studies. This prospective cohort study aimed to investigate the associations of tea consumption with the risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality. METHODS: We included 100,902 general Chinese adults from the project of Prediction for ASCVD Risk in China (China-PAR) in 15 provinces across China since 1998. Information on tea consumption was collected through standardized questionnaires. Outcomes were identified by interviewing study participants or their proxies, and checking hospital records and/or death certificates. Cox proportional hazard regression models were used to calculate hazard ratios and their corresponding 95% confidence intervals related to tea consumption. RESULTS: During a median follow-up of 7.3 years, 3683 atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease events, 1477 atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease deaths, and 5479 all-cause deaths were recorded. Compared with never or non-habitual tea drinkers, the hazard ratio and 95% confidence interval among habitual tea drinkers was 0.80 (0.75-0.87), 0.78 (0.69-0.88), and 0.85 (0.79-0.90) for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease incidence, atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease mortality, and all-cause mortality, respectively. Habitual tea drinkers had 1.41 years longer of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease-free years and 1.26 years longer of life expectancy at the index age of 50 years. The observed inverse associations were strengthened among participants who kept the habit during the follow-up period. CONCLUSION: Tea consumption was associated with reduced risks of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality, especially among those consistent habitual tea drinkers. ",
        "Associations of anger, vital exhaustion, anti-depressant use, and poor social ties with incident atrial fibrillation: The Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study. BACKGROUND: We examined the relationships of anger, vital exhaustion, anti-depressant use, and poor social ties with incident atrial fibrillation in a biracial cohort of middle and older-aged adults. METHODS: This analysis included 11,445 Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study participants who were free of atrial fibrillation at baseline in 1990-1992. Vital exhaustion was assessed at baseline and defined as a score in the highest quartile on the 21-item Vital Exhaustion Questionnaire. Baseline anti-depressant use was self-reported. The Spielberger Trait Anger Scale to assess anger and both the Interpersonal Support Evaluation List and the Lubben Social Network Scale to assess social ties were also administered at baseline. The primary outcome was incident atrial fibrillation throughout 2016, identified by electrocardiogram, hospital discharge coding of atrial fibrillation, and death certificates. RESULTS: A total of 2220 incident atrial fibrillation cases were detected over a median follow-up of 23.4 years. After adjusting for age, race-center, sex, education, and height, participants in the 4th Vital Exhaustion Questionnaire quartile (referent\u2009=\u20091st Vital Exhaustion Questionnaire quartile) and those reporting anti-depressant use were at increased risk for atrial fibrillation (hazard ratio\u2009=\u20091.45, 95% confidence interval 1.29-1.64 for Vital Exhaustion Questionnaire; hazard ratio\u2009=\u20091.37, 95% confidence interval 1.11-1.69 for anti-depressant use). The increased atrial fibrillation risk observed for 4th Vital Exhaustion Questionnaire quartile participants remained significant after additional adjustment for relevant comorbidities (hazard ratio\u2009=\u20091.20; confidence interval 1.06-1.35). No significant associations were observed for anger or poor social ties with development of atrial fibrillation. CONCLUSIONS: Vital exhaustion is associated with an increased risk of incident atrial fibrillation. ",
        "Walnuts and Vegetable Oils Containing Oleic Acid Differentially Affect the Gut Microbiota and Associations with Cardiovascular Risk Factors: Follow-up of a Randomized, Controlled, Feeding Trial in Adults at Risk for Cardiovascular Disease. BACKGROUND: It is unclear whether the favorable effects of walnuts on the gut microbiota are attributable to the fatty acids, including \u03b1-linolenic acid (ALA), and/or the bioactive compounds and fiber. OBJECTIVE: This study examined between-diet gut bacterial differences in individuals at increased cardiovascular risk following diets that replace SFAs with walnuts or vegetable oils. METHODS: Forty-two adults at cardiovascular risk were included in a randomized, crossover, controlled-feeding trial that provided a 2-wk standard Western diet (SWD) run-in and three 6-wk isocaloric study diets: a diet containing whole walnuts (WD; 57-99\u00a0g/d walnuts; 2.7% ALA), a fatty acid-matched diet devoid of walnuts (walnut fatty acid-matched diet; WFMD; 2.6% ALA), and a diet replacing ALA with oleic acid without walnuts (oleic acid replaces ALA diet; ORAD; 0.4% ALA). Fecal samples were collected following the run-in and study diets to assess gut microbiota with 16S rRNA sequencing and Qiime2 for amplicon sequence variant picking. RESULTS: Subjects had elevated BMI (30\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01\u00a0kg/m2), blood pressure (121\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02/77\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01\u00a0mmHg), and LDL cholesterol (120\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05\u00a0mg/dL). Following the WD, Roseburia [relative abundance (RA)\u00a0=\u00a04.2%, linear discriminant analysis (LDA)\u00a0=\u00a04], Eubacterium eligensgroup (RA\u00a0=\u00a01.4%, LDA\u00a0=\u00a04), LachnospiraceaeUCG001 (RA\u00a0=\u00a01.2%, LDA\u00a0=\u00a03.2), Lachnospiraceae UCG004 (RA\u00a0=\u00a01.0%, LDA\u00a0=\u00a03), and Leuconostocaceae (RA\u00a0=\u00a00.03%, LDA\u00a0=\u00a02.8) were most abundant relative to taxa in the SWD (P\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.05 for all). The WD was also enriched in Gordonibacter relative to the WFMD. Roseburia (3.6%, LDA\u00a0=\u00a04) and Eubacterium eligensgroup (RA\u00a0=\u00a01.5%, LDA\u00a0=\u00a03.4) were abundant following the WFMD, and Clostridialesvadin BB60group (RA\u00a0=\u00a00.3%, LDA\u00a0=\u00a02) and gutmetagenome (RA\u00a0=\u00a00.2%, LDA\u00a0=\u00a02) were most abundant following the ORAD relative to the SWD (P\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.05 for all). Lachnospiraceae were inversely correlated with blood pressure and lipid/lipoprotein measurements following the WD. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate similar enrichment of Roseburia following the WD and WFMD, which could be explained by the fatty acid composition. Gordonibacter enrichment and the inverse association between Lachnospiraceae and cardiovascular risk factors following the WD suggest that the gut microbiota may contribute to the health benefits of walnut consumption in adults at cardiovascular risk. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT02210767. ",
        "Inhibition of EHMT1/2 rescues synaptic and cognitive functions for Alzheimer's disease. Epigenetic dysregulation, which leads to the alteration of gene expression in the brain, is suggested as one of the key pathophysiological bases of ageing and neurodegeneration. Here we found that, in the late-stage familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD) mouse model, repressive histone H3 dimethylation at lysine 9 (H3K9me2) and euchromatic histone methyltransferases EHMT1 and EHMT2 were significantly elevated in the prefrontal cortex, a key cognitive region affected in Alzheimer's disease. Elevated levels of H3K9me2 were also detected in the prefrontal cortex region of post-mortem tissues from human patients with Alzheimer's disease. Concomitantly, H3K9me2 at glutamate receptors was increased in prefrontal cortex of aged FAD mice, which was linked to the diminished transcription, expression and function of AMPA and NMDA receptors. Treatment of FAD mice with specific EHMT1/2 inhibitors reversed histone hyper-methylation and led to the recovery of glutamate receptor expression and excitatory synaptic function in prefrontal cortex and hippocampus. Chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing (ChIP-seq) data indicated that FAD mice exhibited genome-wide increase of H3K9me2 enrichment at genes involved in neuronal signalling (including glutamate receptors), which was reversed by EHMT1/2 inhibition. Moreover, the impaired recognition memory, working memory, and spatial memory in aged FAD mice were rescued by the treatment with EHMT1/2 inhibitors. These results suggest that disrupted epigenetic regulation of glutamate receptor transcription underlies the synaptic and cognitive deficits in Alzheimer's disease, and targeting histone methylation enzymes may represent a novel therapeutic strategy for this prevalent neurodegenerative disorder.

        "A Cocktail-Inspired Male Birth Control Strategy with Physical/Chemical Dual Contraceptive Effects and Remote Self-Cleared Properties. Inspired by cocktails, we designed a medium term (2-20 weeks) male contraceptive strategy. Through a sequential injection process of four reagents (calcium alginate hydrogel, PEG-Au nanoparticles (PEG-AuNps), EDTA, and PEG-AuNps), physical clogging of the vas deferens and chemical inhibition of the sperm motility were realized simultaneously. The contraceptive period could be directly preset by adjusting the injection ratio of each reagent. More interesting, the embolism area could be readily dredged through a short-time noninvasive near-infrared irradiation. The present study offered an effective and reversible manner to fill the gap of current medium-term contraceptive strategy. In addition, the proposed in vivo pipeline plugging technology, with a flexible noninvasive self-cleared characteristic, might also provide a convenient and reliable strategy for some other biomedical engineering researches.

        "The Effects of Dietary Improvement on Symptoms of Depression and Anxiety: A Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials. OBJECTIVE: Poor diet can be detrimental to mental health. However, the overall evidence for the effects of dietary interventions on mood and mental well-being has yet to be assessed. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis examining effects of dietary interventions on symptoms of depression and anxiety. METHODS: Major electronic databases were searched through March 2018 for all randomized controlled trials of dietary interventions reporting changes in symptoms of depression and/or anxiety in clinical and nonclinical populations. Random-effects meta-analyses were conducted to determine effect sizes (Hedges' g with 95% confidence intervals [CI]) for dietary interventions compared with control conditions. Potential sources of heterogeneity were explored using subgroups and meta-regression analyses. RESULTS: Sixteen eligible randomized controlled trials (published in English) with outcome data for 45,826 participants were included; the majority of which examined samples with nonclinical depression (n = 15 studies). Nonetheless, dietary interventions significantly reduced depressive symptoms (g = 0.275, 95% CI = 0.10 to 0.45, p = .002). Similar effects were observed among high-quality trials (g = 0.321, 95% CI = 0.12 to 0.53, p = .002) and when compared with both inactive (g = 0.308, 95% CI = 0.02 to 0.60, p = .038) and active controls (g = 0.174, 95% CI = 0.01 to 0.34, p = .035). No effect of dietary interventions was observed for anxiety (k = 11, n = 2270, g = 0.100, 95% CI = -0.04 to 0.24, p = .148). Studies with female samples observed significantly greater benefits from dietary interventions, for symptoms of both depression and anxiety. CONCLUSIONS: Dietary interventions hold promise as a novel intervention for reducing symptoms of depression across the population. Future research is required to determine the specific components of dietary interventions that improve mental health, explore underlying mechanisms, and establish effective schemes for delivering these interventions in clinical and public health settings.

        "L1 drives IFN in senescent cells and promotes age-associated inflammation. Retrotransposable elements are deleterious at many levels, and the failure of host surveillance systems for these elements can thus have negative consequences. However, the contribution of retrotransposon activity to ageing and age-associated diseases is not known. Here we show that during cellular senescence, L1 (also known as LINE-1) retrotransposable elements become transcriptionally derepressed and activate a type-I interferon (IFN-I) response. The IFN-I response is a phenotype of late senescence and contributes to the maintenance of the senescence-associated secretory phenotype. The IFN-I response is triggered by cytoplasmic L1 cDNA, and is antagonized by inhibitors of the L1 reverse transcriptase. Treatment of aged mice with the nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor lamivudine downregulated IFN-I activation and age-associated inflammation (inflammaging) in several tissues. We propose that the activation of retrotransposons is an important component of sterile inflammation that is a hallmark of ageing, and that L1\u00a0reverse transcriptase is a relevant target for the treatment of age-associated disorders.

        "Small-Molecule Agonists of Ae. aegypti Neuropeptide Y Receptor Block Mosquito Biting. Female Aedes aegypti mosquitoes bite humans to obtain blood to develop their eggs. Remarkably, their strong attraction to humans is suppressed for days after the blood meal by an unknown mechanism. We investigated a role for neuropeptide Y (NPY)-related signaling in long-term behavioral suppression and discovered that drugs targeting human NPY receptors modulate mosquito host-seeking. In a screen of all 49 predicted Ae. aegypti peptide receptors, we identified NPY-like receptor 7 (NPYLR7) as the sole target of these drugs. To obtain small-molecule agonists selective for NPYLR7, we performed a high-throughput cell-based assay of 265,211 compounds and isolated six highly selective NPYLR7 agonists that inhibit mosquito attraction to humans. NPYLR7 CRISPR-Cas9 null mutants are defective in behavioral suppression and resistant to these drugs. Finally, we show that these drugs can inhibit biting and blood-feeding on a live host, suggesting a novel approach to control infectious disease transmission by controlling mosquito behavior.

        "TGF-\u03b22 is an exercise-induced adipokine that regulates glucose and fatty acid metabolism. Exercise improves health and well-being across diverse organ systems, and elucidating mechanisms underlying the beneficial effects of exercise can lead to new therapies. Here, we show that transforming growth factor-\u03b22 (TGF-\u03b22) is secreted from adipose tissue in response to exercise and improves glucose tolerance in mice. We identify TGF-\u03b22 as an exercise-induced adipokine in a gene expression analysis of human subcutaneous adipose tissue biopsies after exercise training. In mice, exercise training increases TGF-\u03b22 in scWAT, serum, and its secretion from fat explants. Transplanting scWAT from exercise-trained wild type mice, but not from adipose tissue-specific Tgfb2-/- mice, into sedentary mice improves glucose tolerance. TGF-\u03b22 treatment reverses the detrimental metabolic effects of high fat feeding in mice. Lactate, a metabolite released from muscle during exercise, stimulates TGF-\u03b22 expression in human adipocytes. Administration of the lactate-lowering agent dichloroacetate during exercise training in mice decreases circulating TGF-\u03b22 levels and reduces exercise-stimulated improvements in glucose tolerance. Thus, exercise training improves systemic metabolism through inter-organ communication with fat via a lactate-TGF-\u03b22-signaling cycle. ",
        "Influenza Virus Vaccination Elicits Poorly Adapted B Cell Responses in Elderly Individuals. Influenza is a leading cause of death in the elderly, and the vaccine protects only a fraction of this population. A key aspect of antibody-mediated anti-influenza virus immunity is adaptation to antigenically distinct epitopes on emerging strains. We examined factors contributing to reduced influenza vaccine efficacy in the elderly and uncovered a dramatic reduction in the accumulation of de novo immunoglobulin gene somatic mutations upon vaccination. This reduction is associated with a significant decrease in the capacity of antibodies to target the viral glycoprotein, hemagglutinin (HA), and critical protective epitopes surrounding the HA receptor-binding domain. Immune escape by antigenic drift, in which viruses generate mutations in key antigenic epitopes, becomes highly exaggerated. Because of this reduced adaptability, most B\u00a0cells activated in the elderly cohort target highly conserved but less potent epitopes. Given these findings, vaccines driving immunoglobulin gene somatic hypermutation should be a priority to protect elderly individuals. ",
        "Single-dose CRISPR-Cas9 therapy extends lifespan of mice with Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome. Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS) is a rare lethal genetic disorder characterized by symptoms reminiscent of accelerated aging. The major underlying genetic cause is a substitution mutation in the gene coding for lamin A, causing the production of a toxic isoform called progerin. Here we show that reduction of lamin A/progerin by a single-dose systemic administration of adeno-associated virus-delivered CRISPR-Cas9 components suppresses HGPS in a mouse model. "
