        "Association Between Dialysis Facility Ownership and Access to Kidney Transplantation. Importance: For-profit (vs nonprofit) dialysis facilities have historically had lower kidney transplantation rates, but it is unknown if the pattern holds for living donor and deceased donor kidney transplantation, varies by facility ownership, or has persisted over time in a nationally representative population. Objective: To determine the association between dialysis facility ownership and placement on the deceased donor kidney transplantation waiting list, receipt of a living donor kidney transplant, or receipt of a deceased donor kidney transplant. Design, Setting, and Participants: Retrospective cohort study that included 1\u202f478\u202f564 patients treated at 6511 US dialysis facilities. Adult patients with incident end-stage kidney disease from the US Renal Data System (2000-2016) were linked with facility ownership (Dialysis Facility Compare) and characteristics (Dialysis Facility Report). Exposures: The primary exposure was dialysis facility ownership, which was categorized as nonprofit small chains, nonprofit independent facilities, for-profit large chains (>1000 facilities), for-profit small chains (<1000 facilities), and for-profit independent facilities. Main Outcomes and Measures: Access to kidney transplantation was defined as time from initiation of dialysis to placement on the deceased donor kidney transplantation waiting list, receipt of a living donor kidney transplant, or receipt of a deceased donor kidney transplant. Cumulative incidence differences and multivariable Cox models assessed the association between dialysis facility ownership and each outcome. Results: Among 1\u202f478\u202f564 patients, the median age was 66 years (interquartile range, 55-76 years), with 55.3% male, and 28.1% non-Hispanic black patients. Eighty-seven percent of patients received care at a for-profit dialysis facility. A total of 109\u202f030 patients (7.4%) received care at 435 nonprofit small chain facilities; 78\u202f287 (5.3%) at 324 nonprofit independent facilities; 483\u202f988 (32.7%) at 2239 facilities of large for-profit chain 1; 482\u202f689 (32.6%) at 2082 facilities of large for-profit chain 2; 225\u202f890 (15.3%) at 997 for-profit small chain facilities; and 98\u202f680 (6.7%) at 434 for-profit independent facilities. During the study period, 121\u202f680 patients (8.2%) were placed on the deceased donor waiting list, 23\u202f762 (1.6%) received a living donor kidney transplant, and 49\u202f290 (3.3%) received a deceased donor kidney transplant. For-profit facilities had lower 5-year cumulative incidence differences for each outcome vs nonprofit facilities (deceased donor waiting list: -13.2% [95% CI, -13.4% to -13.0%]; receipt of a living donor kidney transplant: -2.3% [95% CI, -2.4% to -2.3%]; and receipt of a deceased donor kidney transplant: -4.3% [95% CI, -4.4% to -4.2%]). Adjusted Cox analyses showed lower relative rates for each outcome among patients treated at all for-profit vs all nonprofit dialysis facilities: deceased donor waiting list (hazard ratio [HR], 0.36 [95% CI, 0.35 to 0.36]); receipt of a living donor kidney transplant (HR, 0.52 [95% CI, 0.51 to 0.54]); and receipt of a deceased donor kidney transplant (HR, 0.44 [95% CI, 0.44 to 0.45]). Conclusions and Relevance: Among US patients with end-stage kidney disease, receiving dialysis at for-profit facilities compared with nonprofit facilities was associated with a lower likelihood of accessing kidney transplantation. Further research is needed to understand the mechanisms behind this association. ",
        "Association of Animal and Plant Protein Intake With All-Cause and Cause-Specific Mortality in a Japanese Cohort. Importance: Epidemiological evidence regarding the long-term effects of higher dietary protein intake on mortality outcomes in the general population is not clear. Objective: To evaluate the associations between animal and plant protein intake and all-cause and cause-specific mortality. Design, Setting, and Participants: This prospective cohort study included 70 696 participants in the Japan Public Health Center-based Prospective Cohort who were aged 45 to 74 years and had no history of cancer, cerebrovascular disease, or ischemic heart disease at study baseline. Data were collected from January 1, 1995, through December 31, 1999, with follow-up completed December 31, 2016, during which 12 381 total deaths were documented. Dietary intake information was collected through a validated food frequency questionnaire and used to estimate protein intake in all participants. Participants were grouped into quintile categories based on their protein intake, expressed as a percentage of total energy. Data were analyzed from July 18, 2017, through April 10, 2019. Main Outcomes and Measures: Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs for all-cause and cause-specific mortality were estimated using Cox proportional hazards regression models with adjustment for potential confounding factors. Results: Among the 70 696 participants, 32 201 (45.5%) were men (mean [SD] age, 55.6 [7.6] years) and 38 495 (54.5%) were women (mean [SD] age, 55.8 [7.7] years). Intake of animal protein showed no clear association with total or cause-specific mortality. In contrast, intake of plant protein was associated with lower total mortality, with multivariable-adjusted HRs of 0.89 (95% CI, 0.83-0.95) for quintile 2; 0.88 (95% CI, 0.82-0.95) for quintile 3; 0.84 (95% CI, 0.77-0.92) for quintile 4; and 0.87 (95% CI, 0.78-0.96) for quintile 5, with quintile 1 as the reference category (P\u2009=\u2009.01 for trend). For cause-specific mortality, this association with plant protein intake was evident for cardiovascular disease (CVD)-related mortality (HRs, 0.84 [95% CI, 0.73-0.96] to 0.70 [95% CI, 0.59-0.83]; P\u2009=\u2009.002 for trend). Isocaloric substitution of 3% energy from plant protein for red meat protein was associated with lower total (HR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.55-0.80), cancer-related (HR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.45-0.82), and CVD-related (HR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.39-0.86) mortality; substitution for processed meat protein was associated with lower total (HR, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.38-0.75) and cancer-related (HR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.30-0.85) mortality. Conclusions and Relevance: In this large prospective study, higher plant protein intake was associated with lower total and CVD-related mortality. Although animal protein intake was not associated with mortality outcomes, replacement of red meat protein or processed meat protein with plant protein was associated with lower total, cancer-related, and CVD-related mortality.

        "Association of a Workplace Sales Ban on Sugar-Sweetened Beverages With Employee Consumption of Sugar-Sweetened Beverages and Health. Importance: Reductions in sugar-sweetened beverage (SSB) intake can improve health, but are difficult for individuals to achieve on their own. Objectives: To evaluate whether a workplace SSB sales ban was associated with SSB intake and cardiometabolic health among employees and whether a brief motivational intervention provides added benefits to the sales ban. Design, Setting, and Participants: This before-after study and additional randomized trial conducted from July 28, 2015, to October 16, 2016, at a Northern California university and hospital assessed SSB intake, anthropometrics, and cardiometabolic biomarkers among 214 full-time English-speaking employees who were frequent SSB consumers (\u2265360 mL [\u226512 fl oz] per day) before and 10 months after implementation of an SSB sales ban in a large workplace, with half the employees randomized to receive a brief motivational intervention targeting SSB reduction. Interventions: The employer stopped selling SSBs in all workplace venues, and half the sample was randomized to receive a brief motivational intervention and the other half was a control group that did not receive the intervention. This intervention was modeled on standard brief motivational interventions for alcohol used in the workplace that promote health knowledge and goal setting. Main Outcomes and Measures: Outcomes included changes in SSB intake, Homeostatic Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR), and measures of abdominal adiposity. The primary associations tested were the correlation between changes in SSB intake and changes in HOMA-IR. Results: Among the 214 study participants, 124 (57.9%) were women, with a mean (SD) age of 41.2 (11.0) years and a baseline mean (SD) body mass index of 29.4 (6.5). They reported a mean daily intake of 1050 mL (35 fl oz) of SSBs at baseline and 540 mL (18 fl oz) at follow-up-a 510-mL (17-fl oz) (48.6%) decrease (P\u2009<\u2009.001). Reductions in SSB intake correlated with improvements in HOMA-IR (r\u2009=\u20090.16; P\u2009=\u2009.03). Those not randomized to receive the brief intervention reduced their SSB intake by a mean (SD) of 246.0 (84.0) mL (8.2 [2.8] fl oz), while those also receiving the brief intervention reduced SSB intake by 762.0 (84.0) mL (25.4 [2.8] fl oz). From baseline to follow-up, there were significant reductions in mean (SE) waist circumference (2.1 [2.8] cm; P\u2009<\u2009.001). Conclusions and Relevance: This study's findings suggest that the workplace sales ban was associated with a reduction in SSB intake and a significant reduction in waist circumference among employees within 10 months. The randomized clinical trial portion of this study found that targeting those at high risk with a brief motivational intervention led to additional improvements. Workplace sales bans may offer a promising new private-sector strategy for reducing the health harms of SSB intake. Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02585336. ",
        "Trends in Dietary Carbohydrate, Protein, and Fat Intake and Diet Quality Among US Adults, 1999-2016. Importance: Changes in the economy, nutrition policies, and food processing methods can affect dietary macronutrient intake and diet quality. It is essential to evaluate trends in dietary intake, food sources, and diet quality to inform policy makers. Objective: To investigate trends in dietary macronutrient intake, food sources, and diet quality among US adults. Design, Setting, and Participants: Serial cross-sectional analysis of the US nationally representative 24-hour dietary recall data from 9 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey cycles (1999-2016) among adults aged 20 years or older. Exposure: Survey cycle. Main Outcomes and Measures: Dietary intake of macronutrients and their subtypes, food sources, and the Healthy Eating Index 2015 (range, 0-100; higher scores indicate better diet quality; a minimal clinically important difference has not been defined). Results: There were 43\u202f996 respondents (weighted mean age, 46.9 years; 51.9% women). From 1999 to 2016, the estimated energy from total carbohydrates declined from 52.5% to 50.5% (difference, -2.02%; 95% CI, -2.41% to -1.63%), whereas that of total protein and total fat increased from 15.5% to 16.4% (difference, 0.82%; 95% CI, 0.67%-0.97%) and from 32.0% to 33.2% (difference, 1.20%; 95% CI, 0.84%-1.55%), respectively (all P\u2009<\u2009.001 for trend). Estimated energy from low-quality carbohydrates decreased by 3.25% (95% CI, 2.74%-3.75%; P\u2009<\u2009.001 for trend) from 45.1% to 41.8%. Increases were observed in estimated energy from high-quality carbohydrates (by 1.23% [95% CI, 0.84%-1.61%] from 7.42% to 8.65%), plant protein (by 0.38% [95% CI, 0.28%-0.49%] from 5.38% to 5.76%), saturated fatty acids (by 0.36% [95% CI, 0.20%-0.51%] from 11.5% to 11.9%), and polyunsaturated fatty acids (by 0.65% [95% CI, 0.56%-0.74%] from 7.58% to 8.23%) (all P\u2009<\u2009.001 for trend). The estimated overall Healthy Eating Index 2015 increased from 55.7 to 57.7 (difference, 2.01; 95% CI, 0.86-3.16; P\u2009<\u2009.001 for trend). Trends in high- and low-quality carbohydrates primarily reflected higher estimated energy from whole grains (0.65%) and reduced estimated energy from added sugars (-2.00%), respectively. Trends in plant protein were predominantly due to higher estimated intake of whole grains (0.12%) and nuts (0.09%). Conclusions and Relevance: From 1999 to 2016, US adults experienced a significant decrease in percentage of energy intake from low-quality carbohydrates and significant increases in percentage of energy intake from high-quality carbohydrates, plant protein, and polyunsaturated fat. Despite improvements in macronutrient composition and diet quality, continued high intake of low-quality carbohydrates and saturated fat remained. ",
        "Assessment of Inpatient Time Allocation Among First-Year Internal Medicine Residents Using Time-Motion Observations. Importance: The United States spends more than $12 billion annually on graduate medical education. Understanding how residents balance patient care and educational activities may provide insights into how the modern physician workforce is being trained. Objective: To describe how first-year internal medicine residents (interns) allocate time while working on general medicine inpatient services. Design, Setting, and Participants: Direct observational secondary analysis, including 6 US university-affiliated and community-based internal medicine programs in the mid-Atlantic region, of the Comparative Effectiveness of Models Optimizing Patient Safety and Resident Education (iCOMPARE) trial, a cluster-randomized trial comparing different duty-hour policies. A total of 194 weekday shifts were observed and time motion data were collected, sampled by daytime, nighttime, and call shifts in proportion to the distribution of shifts within each program from March 10 through May 31, 2016. Data were analyzed from June 1, 2016, through January 5, 2019. Main Outcomes and Measures: Mean time spent in direct and indirect patient care, education, rounds, handoffs, and miscellaneous activities within a 24-hour period and in each of four 6-hour periods (morning, afternoon, evening, and night). Time spent multitasking, simultaneously engaged in combinations of direct patient care, indirect patient care, or education, and in subcategories of indirect patient care were tracked. Results: A total of 80 interns (55% men; mean [SD] age, 28.7 [2.3] years) were observed across 194 shifts, totaling 2173 hours. A mean (SD) of 15.9 (0.7) hours of a 24-hour period (66%) was spent in indirect patient care, mostly interactions with the patient's medical record or documentation (mean [SD], 10.3 [0.7] hours; 43%). A mean (SD) of 3.0 (0.1) hours was spent in direct patient care (13%) and 1.8 (0.3) hours in education (7%). This pattern was consistent across the 4 periods of the day. Direct patient care and education frequently occurred when interns were performing indirect patient care. Multitasking with 2 or more indirect patient care activities occurred for a mean (SD) of 3.8 (0.4) hours (16%) of the day. Conclusions and Relevance: This study's findings suggest that within these US teaching programs, interns spend more time participating in indirect patient care than interacting with patients or in dedicated educational activities. These findings provide an essential baseline measure for future efforts designed to improve the workday structure and experience of internal medicine trainees, without making a judgment on the current allocation of time.

        "Comparison of Pedestrian Detection With and Without Yellow-Lens Glasses During Simulated Night Driving With and Without Headlight Glare. Importance: Some marketing materials for yellow-lens night-driving glasses claim that they increase nighttime road visibility and reduce oncoming headlight glare (HLG). However, there is no scientific evidence to support these claims. Objective: To measure the association between yellow-lens glasses and the detection of pedestrians with and without an oncoming HLG, using a driving simulator equipped with a custom HLG simulator. Design, Setting, and Participants: A single-center cohort study was conducted between September 8, 2016, and October 25, 2017, at the Schepens Eye Research Institute. A total of 22 individuals participated in the study, divided into groups to determine response to a pedestrian wearing a navy blue shirt by younger individuals and, to control for participant's age and the interaction of the shirt color with the filter, response to a pedestrian wearing an orange shirt by a group of younger and older participants. Exposures: Participants drove scripted night-driving scenarios, 3 times with 3 commercially available yellow-lens glasses and once with clear-lens glasses, with the HLG simulator turned on and off. A total of 8 conditions were used for each participant. Main Outcomes and Measures: Pedestrian detection response time. Results: The 22 participants who completed the study included 12 younger (mean [SD] age, 28 [7] years; 6 men) individuals who responded to a pedestrian wearing a dark navy blue shirt, as well as 6 younger (mean [SD] age, 27 [4] years; 4 men) and 4 older (mean [SD], 70 [11] years; all men) participants who responded to a pedestrian in an orange shirt. All participants had normal visual acuity (mean [SD], -0.05 [0.06] logMAR). No significant difference in response time with yellow lens was found in all experiment conditions; younger participants for dark navy blue shirt pedestrians (F1,33\u2009=\u20090.59; P\u2009=\u2009.45), orange shirt pedestrians (F1,15\u2009=\u20090.13; P\u2009=\u2009.72), and older participants for orange shirt pedestrians (F1,9\u2009=\u20090.84; P\u2009=\u2009.38). Among all participants (n\u2009=\u200922), no significant main effect of yellow lenses was found (F1,63\u2009=\u20090.64; P\u2009=\u2009.42). In all measuring conditions, the response times with the yellow lenses were not better than with the clear lenses. Significant main effects of HLG were found with dark navy blue shirt pedestrian condition for young participants (F1,33\u2009=\u20097.34; P\u2009<\u2009.001) and with orange shirt pedestrian condition for older individuals (F1,9\u2009=\u200975.32; P\u2009<\u2009.001), where the difference in response time between with and without HLG was larger for older (1.5 seconds) than younger (0.3 seconds) participants. Conclusions and Relevance: Using a driver simulator equipped with an HLG simulator, yellow-lens night-driving glasses did not appear to improve pedestrian detection at night or reduce the negative effects of HLG on pedestrian detection performance. These findings do not appear to support having eye care professionals advise patients to use yellow-lens night-driving glasses. ",
        "Gestational Age and Socioeconomic Achievements in Young Adulthood: A Danish Population-Based Study. Importance: The poor health outcomes associated with preterm birth are well established. However, it is less clear how small variations in gestational age, even within the term range, are associated with long-term opportunities and well-being, as measured by socioeconomic outcomes in adulthood. Objective: To examine the association of gestational age at birth with educational achievement, income, and primary source of income in adulthood. Design, Setting, and Participants: This Danish population-based, register-based cohort study examined all live-born singletons born in Denmark from 1982 to 1986 without congenital anomalies and who lived in Denmark at age 28 years. Data analysis was conducted from November 2, 2017, to June 15, 2018. Exposures: Gestational age at birth in completed weeks (22-45 weeks). Main Outcomes and Measures: Educational attainment, personal income, and primary source of income at age 28 years. Results: In a population of 228\u202f030 singletons (4.0% preterm, 12.1% early term; 49.4% female), 36.3% had a tertiary education at age 28 years. Among adults born at 22 to 27 weeks of gestation, 21.6% had a tertiary education, and 23.2% had an income in the highest tertile. Using 40 weeks of gestation as the reference, the adjusted odds ratio for tertiary education for individuals born at 22 to 27 weeks of gestation was 0.21 (95% CI, 0.13-0.35) and the corresponding figures for 28 to 31, 33, 36, 38, and 43 to 45 weeks of gestation were 0.45 (95% CI, 0.37-0.55), 0.67 (95% CI, 0.54-0.83), 0.84 (95% CI, 0.77-0.93), 0.85 (95% CI, 0.81-0.89), and 0.93 (95% CI, 0.83-1.04), respectively. The adjusted odds ratio for highest income tertile for individuals born at 22 to 27 weeks of gestation was 0.66 (95% CI, 0.41-1.06) and the corresponding figures for 28 to 31, 33, 36, 38, and 43 to 45 weeks of gestation were 0.80 (95% CI, 0.68-0.94), 0.77 (95% CI, 0.63-0.93), 0.89 (95% CI, 0.82-0.96), 0.95 (95% CI, 0.91-0.99), and 1.00 (95% CI, 0.91-1.12), respectively. All estimates were adjusted for sex, birth year, parity, maternal age, maternal education, and maternal country of origin. Conclusions and Relevance: Shorter gestational duration even within the term range was associated with poorer socioeconomic outcomes in adulthood. While adults born at 35 to 38 weeks of gestation experienced only slightly increased risk of adverse socioeconomic outcomes, this may have a significant impact on public health, since a large proportion of all children are born in these weeks.

        "Association Between Electronic Cigarette Use and Smoking Reduction in France. Importance: The electronic cigarette (EC) has become popular among smokers who wish to reduce their tobacco use levels or quit smoking, but its effectiveness as a cessation aid is uncertain. Objective: To examine the association of regular EC use with the number of cigarettes smoked per day, smoking cessation among current smokers, and smoking relapse among former smokers. Design, Setting, and Participants: The CONSTANCES (Consultants des Centres d'Examens de Sant\u00e9) cohort study, based in France, began recruiting participants January 6, 2012, and is currently ongoing. Participants were enrolled in CONSTANCES through 2015, and included 5400 smokers (mean [SD] follow-up of 23.4 [9.3] months) and 2025 former smokers (mean [SD] follow-up of 22.1 [8.6] months) at baseline who quit smoking in 2010, the year in which ECs were introduced in France, or afterward. Analyses were performed from February 8, 2017, to October 15, 2018. Main Outcomes and Measures: The association between EC use and the number of cigarettes smoked during follow-up was studied using mixed regression models. The likelihood of smoking cessation was studied using Poisson regression models with robust sandwich variance estimators. The association between EC use and smoking relapse among former smokers was studied using Cox proportional hazards regression models. All statistical analyses were adjusted for sociodemographic characteristics, duration of follow-up, and smoking characteristics. Results: Among the 5400 daily smokers (2906 women and 2494 men; mean [SD] age, 44.9 [12.4] years), regular EC use was associated with a significantly higher decrease in the number of cigarettes smoked per day compared with daily smokers who did not use ECs (-4.4 [95% CI, -4.8 to -3.9] vs -2.7 [95% CI, -3.1 to -2.4]), as well as a higher adjusted relative risk of smoking cessation (1.67; 95% CI, 1.51-1.84]). At the same time, among the 2025 former smokers (1004 women and 1021 men; mean [SD] age, 43.6 [12.1] years), EC use was associated with an increase in the rate of smoking relapse among former smokers (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.70; 95% CI, 1.25-2.30). Conclusions and Relevance: This study's findings suggest that, among adult smokers, EC use appears to be associated with a decrease in smoking level and an increase in smoking cessation attempts but also with an increase in the level of smoking relapse in the general population after approximately 2 years of follow-up.

        "Association of Electronic Cigarette Use With Subsequent Initiation of Tobacco Cigarettes in US Youths. Importance: The use of electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) and other noncigarette tobacco products may increase the odds of cigarette initiation, even among low-risk youths. Objective: To evaluate the associations of prior e-cigarette use and other tobacco product use with subsequent cigarette initiation within 2 years of follow-up. Design, Setting, and Participants: In this prospective cohort study, data from waves 1 through 3 of the Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health Study (2013-2016) were used to assess youths aged 12 to 15 years who had never used cigarettes, e-cigarettes, or other tobacco products at wave 1. This was a nationally representative study of the US population. Data analysis was conducted in 2018. Exposures: First noncigarette tobacco product used (none, e-cigarette, or other tobacco product) between wave 1 and wave 3. Main Outcomes and Measures: Ever cigarette use and current cigarette use at wave 3. Results: In the sample (N\u2009=\u20096123), respondents were 49.5% female; 54.1% non-Hispanic, white; and the mean (SD) age was 13.4 (1.2) years. Of these, 8.6% reported e-cigarettes as their first tobacco product, while 5.0% reported using another noncigarette product first; 3.3% reported using cigarettes first. Cigarette use at wave 3 was higher among prior e-cigarette users (20.5%) compared with youths with no prior tobacco use (3.8%). Prior e-cigarette use was associated with more than 4 times the odds of ever cigarette use (odds ratio, 4.09; 95% CI, 2.97-5.63) and nearly 3 times the odds of current cigarette use (odds ratio, 2.75; 95% CI, 1.60-4.73) compared with no prior tobacco use. Prior use of other tobacco products was similarly associated with subsequent ever cigarette use (OR, 3.84; 95% CI, 2.63-5.63) and current cigarette use (OR, 3.43; 95% CI, 1.88-6.26) compared with no prior tobacco use. The association of prior e-cigarette use with cigarette initiation was stronger among low-risk youths (OR, 8.57; 95% CI, 3.87-18.97), a pattern not seen for prior other product use. Over the 2 years between 2013 and 2014 and 2015 and 2016, 21.8% of new cigarette ever use (178\u202f850 youths) and 15.3% of current cigarette use (43\u202f446 youths) among US youths aged 12 to 15 years may be attributable to prior e-cigarette use. Conclusions and Relevance: This study's findings support the notion that e-cigarette use is associated with increased risk for cigarette initiation and use, particularly among low-risk youths. At the population level, the use of e-cigarettes may be a contributor to the initiation of cigarette smoking among youths. ",
        "Assessment of Attitudes Toward Deprescribing in Older Medicare Beneficiaries in the United States. Importance: Use of harmful and/or unnecessary medications in older adults is prevalent. This can lead to avoidable harms such as adverse drug reactions, falls, hospitalization, and mortality. Primary care physicians report that patient resistance to discontinuing medication use is a significant barrier to deprescribing. Objective: To describe the attitudes of older adults toward deprescribing and to determine whether individual characteristics are associated with these attitudes. Design, Setting, and Participants: For this population-based survey study of US Medicare beneficiaries 65 years and older, data were obtained from the Medication Attitudes module fielded through in-person interviews in round 6 of the National Health and Aging Trends Study (weighted response rate of round 6 was 88.5%). The questions in this module were drawn from the Patients' Attitudes Towards Deprescribing questionnaire and its revised version. The Medication Attitudes module was fielded to a random one-third (n\u2009=\u20092124) of the National Health and Aging Trends Study participants (weighted response rate of this module was 94.8%). Main Outcomes and Measures: Responses to 2 statements (\"If my doctor said it was possible, I would be willing to stop one or more of my regular medicines\" and \"I would like to reduce the number of medicines I am taking\") were the main outcomes of interest. Results: Of the 1981 Medicare beneficiaries included in the study, 1149 (55.2%, weighted) were women, and the majority (n\u2009=\u2009715 [54.6%, weighted]) were 65 to 74 years old. A total of 1752 (92.0%, weighted) older adults reported being willing to stop taking 1 or more of their medicines if their physician said it was possible, and 1241 (66.6%, weighted) older adults wanted to reduce the number of medicines that they were taking. Older adults taking 6 or more medications had greater odds than those taking fewer than 6 medications of being willing to stop taking 1 or more of their medicines (adjusted odds ratio, 2.90; 95% CI, 1.74-4.82) and wanting to reduce the number of medicines that they were taking (adjusted odds ratio, 2.31; 95% CI, 1.71-3.13). Conclusions and Relevance: Physicians considering deprescribing as part of comprehensive, patient-centered care should be reassured that a majority of older Americans are open to having 1 or more of their medicines deprescribed if their physician says it is possible, and more than two-thirds want to reduce the number of medicines that they are taking.

        "Effect of a Biobehavioral Environmental Approach on Disability Among Low-Income Older Adults: A Randomized Clinical Trial. Importance: Disability among older adults is a strong predictor of health outcomes, health service use, and health care costs. Few interventions have reduced disability among older adults. Objective: To determine whether a 10-session, home-based, multidisciplinary program reduces disability. Design, Setting, and Participants: In this randomized clinical trial of 300 low-income community-dwelling adults with a disability in Baltimore, Maryland, between March 18, 2012, and April 29, 2016, 65 years or older, cognitively intact, and with self-reported difficulty with 1 or more activities of daily living (ADLs) or 2 or more instrumental ADLs (IADLs), participants were interviewed in their home at baseline, 5 months (end point), and 12 months (follow-up) by trained research assistants who were masked to the group allocation. Participants were randomized to either the intervention (CAPABLE) group (n\u2009=\u2009152) or the attention control group (n\u2009=\u2009148) through a computer-based assignment scheme, stratified by sex in randomized blocks. Intention-to-treat analysis was used to assess the intervention. Data were analyzed from September 2017 through August 2018. Interventions: The CAPABLE group received up to 10 home visits over 5 months by occupational therapists, registered nurses, and home modifiers to address self-identified functional goals by enhancing individual capacity and the home environment. The control group received 10 social home visits by a research assistant. Main Outcomes and Measures: Disability with ADLs or IADLs at 5 months. Each ADL and IADL task was self-scored from 0 to 2 according to whether in the previous month the person did not have difficulty and did not need help (0), did not need help but had difficulty (1), or needed help regardless of difficulty (2). The overall score ranged from 0 to 16 points. Results: Of the 300 people randomized to either the CAPABLE group (n\u2009=\u2009152) or the control group (n\u2009=\u2009148), 133 of the CAPABLE participants (87.5%) were women with a mean (SD) age of 75.7 (7.6) years; 126 (82.9%) self-identified as black. Of the controls, 129 (87.2%) were women with a mean (SD) age of 75.4 (7.4) years; 133 (89.9%) self-identified as black. CAPABLE participation resulted in 30% reduction in ADL disability scores at 5 months (relative risk [RR], 0.70; 95% CI, 0.54-0.93; P\u2009=\u2009.01) vs control participation. CAPABLE participation resulted in a statistically nonsignificant 17% reduction in IADL disability scores (RR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.65-1.06; P\u2009=\u2009.13) vs control participation. Participants in the CAPABLE group vs those in the control group were more likely to report that the program made their life easier (82.3% vs 43.1%; P\u2009<\u2009.001), helped them take care of themselves (79.8% vs 35.5%; P\u2009<\u2009.001), and helped them gain confidence in managing daily challenges (79.9% vs 37.7%; P\u2009<\u2009.001). Conclusions and Relevance: Low-income community-dwelling older adults who received the CAPABLE intervention experienced substantial decrease in disability; disability may be modifiable through addressing both the person and the environment.

        "Patient Perceptions of Diabetes Guideline Frameworks for Individualizing Glycemic Targets. Importance: Diabetes guidelines recommend considering specific factors, such as diabetes duration and life expectancy, to individualize treatment in older adults. These individualized glycemic targets inform decisions on whether to intensify or deintensify medication treatment plans. How older adults with diabetes perceive these factors used to individualize glycemic targets is unknown. Objectives: To examine how older adults perceive factors used in diabetes guidelines for individualizing glycemic targets. Design, Setting, and Participants: A cross-sectional national survey was conducted from December 13, 2018, to January 3, 2019, of a nationally representative, probability-based online survey panel (KnowledgePanel). A total of 1364 KnowledgePanel members who were 65 years or older and had type 2 diabetes were invited to participate in the survey; 836 (61.3%) responded, and 818 (60.0%) completed the survey. Main Outcomes and Measures: The study randomized participants to 2 vignettes: one about adding and the other about removing diabetes medications from treatment plans. Participants rated the importance of 7 factors (diabetes duration, established diabetes complications, other health conditions, life expectancy, risk of adverse effects, cost, and treatment effort) in these treatment decisions using binary (yes/no) responses and the best-worst scaling method to quantify the factors' relative importance. All participants then answered questions on how different levels of each factor were associated with aggressiveness of diabetes treatment. Results: The sample included 818 participants (mean [SD] age, 74.0 [6.8] years; 469 [53.7%] male; and 668 [67.7%] white). A total of 410 participants answered questions about adding medicine, whereas 408 participants answered questions about stopping medicine. Of the 7 factors to consider for adding a diabetes medication to the treatment plan, the number who deemed each factor important ranged from 197 (45.6%) to 263 (62.8%). In contrast, these same factors were considered important by only 29 (8.4%) to 146 (37.7%) of participants when deciding to stop use of a diabetes medication. In both decisions, participants perceived the risk of adverse effects as the most important factor (relative importance was 22.8 for adding a medicine and 25.0 for stopping a medicine on a ratio scale in which, for each decision, the relative importance of the 7 factors adds up to 100, with 0 indicating complete indifference and 100 complete priority). In contrast to current guideline recommendations, most participants believed that patients with longer disease duration (498 [60.1%]), more established complications (632 [75.6%]), and greater number of other health conditions (545 [67.5%]) should receive more aggressive diabetes treatment. Conclusions and Relevance: Many older adults do not place high importance on factors recommended by guidelines to individualize diabetes treatment, especially when deciding to stop use of diabetes medications. Moreover, when considering treatment aggressiveness, many older adults weighted several factors in the opposite direction than suggested by the guidelines. Individualizing diabetes care in older adults will require effective communication regarding the benefits and consequences of making changes to treatment plans. ",
        "Association Between Long-term Exposure to Ambient Air Pollution and Change in Quantitatively Assessed Emphysema and Lung Function. Importance: While air pollutants at historical levels have been associated with cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, it is not known whether exposure to contemporary air pollutant concentrations is associated with progression of emphysema. Objective: To assess the longitudinal association of ambient ozone (O3), fine particulate matter (PM2.5), oxides of nitrogen (NOx), and black carbon exposure with change in percent emphysema assessed via computed tomographic (CT) imaging and lung function. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study included participants from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) Air and Lung Studies conducted in 6 metropolitan regions of the United States, which included 6814 adults aged 45 to 84 years recruited between July 2000 and August 2002, and an additional 257 participants recruited from February 2005 to May 2007, with follow-up through November 2018. Exposures: Residence-specific air pollutant concentrations (O3, PM2.5, NOx, and black carbon) were estimated by validated spatiotemporal models incorporating cohort-specific monitoring, determined from 1999 through the end of follow-up. Main Outcomes and Measures: Percent emphysema, defined as the percent of lung pixels less than -950 Hounsfield units, was assessed up to 5 times per participant via cardiac CT scan (2000-2007) and equivalent regions on lung CT scans (2010-2018). Spirometry was performed up to 3 times per participant (2004-2018). Results: Among 7071 study participants (mean [range] age at recruitment, 60 [45-84] years; 3330 [47.1%] were men), 5780 were assigned outdoor residential air pollution concentrations in the year of their baseline examination and during the follow-up period and had at least 1 follow-up CT scan, and 2772 had at least 1 follow-up spirometric assessment, over a median of 10 years. Median percent emphysema was 3% at baseline and increased a mean of 0.58 percentage points per 10 years. Mean ambient concentrations of PM2.5 and NOx, but not O3, decreased substantially during follow-up. Ambient concentrations of O3, PM2.5, NOx, and black carbon at study baseline were significantly associated with greater increases in percent emphysema per 10 years (O3: 0.13 per 3 parts per billion [95% CI, 0.03-0.24]; PM2.5: 0.11 per 2 \u03bcg/m3 [95% CI, 0.03-0.19]; NOx: 0.06 per 10 parts per billion [95% CI, 0.01-0.12]; black carbon: 0.10 per 0.2 \u03bcg/m3 [95% CI, 0.01-0.18]). Ambient O3 and NOx concentrations, but not PM2.5 concentrations, during follow-up were also significantly associated with greater increases in percent emphysema. Ambient O3 concentrations, but not other pollutants, at baseline and during follow-up were significantly associated with a greater decline in forced expiratory volume in 1 second per 10 years (baseline: 13.41 mL per 3 parts per billion [95% CI, 0.7-26.1]; follow-up: 18.15 mL per 3 parts per billion [95% CI, 1.59-34.71]). Conclusions and Relevance: In this cohort study conducted between 2000 and 2018 in 6 US metropolitan regions, long-term exposure to ambient air pollutants was significantly associated with increasing emphysema assessed quantitatively using CT imaging and lung function.

        "Association of Levels of Specialized Care With Risk of Premature Mortality in Patients With Epilepsy. Importance: Patients with epilepsy are at an elevated risk of premature mortality. Interventions to reduce this risk are crucial. Objective: To determine if the level of care (non-neurologist, neurologist, or comprehensive epilepsy program) is negatively associated with the risk of premature mortality. Design, Setting, and Participants: In this retrospective open cohort study, all adult patients 18 years or older who met the administrative case definition for incident epilepsy in linked databases (Alberta Health Services administrative health data and the Comprehensive Calgary Epilepsy Programme Registry [CEP]) inclusive of the years 2002 to 2016 were followed up until death or loss to follow-up. The final analyses were performed on May 1, 2019. Exposures: Evaluation by a non-neurologist, neurologist, or epileptologist. Main Outcomes and Measures: The outcome was all-cause mortality. We used extended Cox models treating exposure to a neurologist or the CEP as time-varying covariates. Age, sex, socioeconomic deprivation, disease severity, and comorbid burden at index date were modeled as fixed-time coefficients. Results: A total 23\u202f653 incident cases were identified (annual incidence of 89 per 100\u202f000); the mean age (SD) at index date was 50.8 (19.1) years and 12\u202f158 (50.3%) were women. A total of 14\u202f099 (60%) were not exposed to specialist neurological care, 9554 (40%) received care by a neurologist, and 2054 (9%) received care in the CEP. In total, 4098 deaths (71%) occurred in the nonspecialist setting, 1481 (26%) for those seen by a neurologist, and 176 (3%) for those receiving CEP care. The standardized mortality rate was 7.2% for the entire cohort, 9.4% for those receiving nonspecialist care, 5.6% for those seen by a neurologist, and 2.8% for those seen in the CEP. The hazard ratio (HR) of mortality was lower in those receiving neurologist (HR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.77-0.93) and CEP (HR, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.38-0.62) care. In multivariable modeling, specialist care, the age at index, and disease severity were retained in the final model of the association between specialist care and mortality. Conclusions and Relevance: Exposure to specialist care is associated with incremental reductions in the hazard of premature mortality. Those referred to a comprehensive epilepsy program received the greatest benefit. ",
        "Association of Long-term Exercise Training With Risk of Falls, Fractures, Hospitalizations, and Mortality in Older Adults: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis. Importance: Long-term exercise benefits on prevalent adverse events in older populations, such as falls, fractures, or hospitalizations, are not yet established or known. Objective: To systematically review and investigate the association of long-term exercise interventions (\u22651 year) with the risk of falls, injurious falls, multiple falls, fractures, hospitalization, and mortality in older adults. Data Sources: PubMed, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, SportDiscus, PsychInfo, and Ageline were searched through March 2018. Study Selection: Exercise randomized clinical trials (RCTs) with intervention length of 1 year or longer, performed among participants 60 years or older. Data Extraction and Synthesis: Two raters independently screened articles, abstracted the data, and assessed the risk of bias. Data were combined with risk ratios (RRs) using DerSimonian and Laird's random-effects model (Mantel-Haenszel method). Main Outcomes and Measures: Six binary outcomes for the risk of falls, injurious falls, multiple falls (\u22652 falls), fractures, hospitalization, and mortality. Results: Forty-six studies (22\u202f709 participants) were included in the review and 40 (21\u202f868 participants) in the meta-analyses (mean [SD] age, 73.1 [7.1] years; 15\u202f054 [66.3%] of participants were women). The most used exercise was a multicomponent training (eg, aerobic plus strength plus balance); mean frequency was 3 times per week, about 50 minutes per session, at a moderate intensity. Comparator groups were often active controls. Exercise significantly decreased the risk of falls (n\u2009=\u200920 RCTs; 4420 participants; RR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.79-0.98) and injurious falls (9 RTCs; 4481 participants; RR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.62-0.88), and tended to reduce the risk of fractures (19 RTCs; 8410 participants; RR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.71-1.00; P\u2009=\u2009.05). Exercise did not significantly diminish the risk of multiple falls (13 RTCs; 3060 participants), hospitalization (12 RTCs; 5639 participants), and mortality (29 RTCs; 11\u202f441 participants). Sensitivity analyses provided similar findings, except the fixed-effect meta-analysis for the risk of fracture, which showed a significant effect favoring exercisers (RR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.70-1.00; P\u2009=\u2009.047). Meta-regressions on mortality and falls suggest that 2 to 3 times per week would be the optimal exercise frequency. Conclusions and Relevance: Long-term exercise is associated with a reduction in falls, injurious falls, and probably fractures in older adults, including people with cardiometabolic and neurological diseases.

        "Accuracy of a Popular Online Symptom Checker for Ophthalmic Diagnoses. Importance: Because more patients are presenting with self-guided research of symptoms, it is important to assess the capabilities and limitations of these available health information tools. Objective: To determine the accuracy of the most popular online symptom checker for ophthalmic diagnoses. Design, Setting, and Participants: In a cross-sectional study, 42 validated clinical vignettes of ophthalmic symptoms were generated and distilled to their core presenting symptoms. Cases were entered into WebMD symptom checker by both medically trained and nonmedically trained personnel blinded to the diagnosis. Output from the symptom checker, including the number of symptoms, ranking and list of diagnoses, and triage urgency were recorded. The study was conducted on October 13, 2017. Analysis was performed between October 15, 2017, and April 30, 2018. Main Outcomes and Measures: Accuracy of the top 3 diagnoses generated by the online symptom checker. Results: The mean (SD) number of symptoms entered was 3.6 (1.6) (range, 1-8). The median (SD) number of diagnoses generated by the symptom checker was 26.8\u2009(21.8) (range, 1-99). The primary diagnosis by the symptom checker was correct in 11 of 42 (26%; 95% CI, 12%-40%) cases. The correct diagnosis was included in the online symptom checker's top 3 diagnoses in 16 of 42 (38%; 95% CI, 25%-56%) cases. The correct diagnosis was not included in the symptom checker's list in 18 of 42 (43%; 95% CI, 32%-63%) cases. Triage urgency based on the top diagnosis was appropriate in 7 of 18 (39%; 95% CI, 14%-64%) emergent cases and 21 of 24 (88%; 95% CI, 73%-100%) nonemergent cases. Interuser variability for the correct diagnosis being in the top 3 listed was at least moderate (Cohen \u03ba\u2009=\u20090.74; 95% CI, 0.54-0.95). Conclusions and Relevance: The most popular online symptom checker may arrive at the correct clinical diagnosis for ophthalmic conditions, but a substantial proportion of diagnoses may not be captured. These findings suggest that further research to reflect the real-life application of internet diagnostic resources is required. ",
        "Association of Statin Therapy With Prevention of Vision-Threatening Diabetic Retinopathy. Importance: Diabetic retinopathy is the leading cause of blindness in working-age adults. Studies have suggested that statins may reduce the risk of developing diabetic retinopathy. Objective: To investigate the association between statin therapy and the development of diabetic retinopathy in patients with diabetes and dyslipidemia. Design, Setting, and Participants: This population-based cohort study, conducted among 37\u202f894 Taiwanese patients between January 1, 1998, and December 31, 2013, used the National Health Insurance Research Database to identify patients with type 2 diabetes and dyslipidemia. Outcomes were compared between those taking statins and those not taking statins. Statistical analysis was performed from May 1 to 31, 2018. Exposure: Statin therapy with a medication possession rate of 80% or more with no other lipid-lowering medications. Main Outcomes and Measures: Any stage of diabetic retinopathy and treatments for vision-threatening diabetic retinopathy. Results: Of 1\u202f648\u202f305 patients with type 2 diabetes, 219\u202f359 were eligible for analysis over the study period, including 199\u202f760 patients taking statins and 19\u202f599 patients not taking statins. After propensity score matching, there were 18\u202f947 patients in the statin group (10 436 women and 8511 men; mean [SD] age, 61.5 [10.8] years) and 18\u202f947 patients in the nonstatin group (10 430 women and 8517 men; mean [SD] age, 61.0 [11.0] years), with a mean follow-up of 7.6 years for the statin group and 7.3 years for the nonstatin group. During the study period, 2004 patients in the statin group (10.6%) and 2269 patients in the nonstatin group (12.0%) developed diabetic retinopathy. Patients in the statin group had a significantly lower rate of diabetic retinopathy (hazard ratio [HR], 0.86; 95% CI, 0.81-0.91), nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy (HR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.86-0.99), proliferative diabetic retinopathy (HR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.58-0.70), vitreous hemorrhage (HR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.54-0.71), tractional retinal detachment (HR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.47-0.79), and macular edema (HR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.46-0.79) than the nonstatin group, as well as lower rates of interventions such as retinal laser treatment (HR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.65-0.77), intravitreal injection (HR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.61-0.89), and vitrectomy (HR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.48-0.69), along with a smaller number of the interventions (retinal lasers: rate ratio, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.59-0.64; intravitreal injections: rate ratio, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.61-0.76; and vitrectomies: rate ratio, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.46-0.63). Statin therapy was also associated with lower risks of major adverse cardiovascular events (HR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.77-0.85), new-onset diabetic neuropathy (HR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.82-0.89), and new-onset diabetic foot ulcers (HR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.68-0.78). Conclusions and Relevance: Statin therapy was associated with a decreased risk of diabetic retinopathy and need for treatments for vision-threatening diabetic retinopathy in Taiwanese patients with type 2 diabetes and dyslipidemia.

        "Association of Race/Ethnicity With Emergency Department Destination of Emergency Medical Services Transport. Importance: Evidence from national studies indicates systematic differences in hospitals in which racial/ethnic minorities receive care, with most care obtained in a small proportion of hospitals. Little is known about the source of these differences. Objectives: To examine the patterns of emergency department (ED) destination of emergency medical services (EMS) transport according to patient race/ethnicity, and to compare the patterns between those transported by EMS and those who did not use EMS. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study of US EMS and EDs used Medicare claims data from January 1, 2006, to December 31, 2012. Enrollees aged 66 years or older with continuous fee-for-service Medicare coverage (N\u2009=\u2009864\u202f750) were selected for the sample. Zip codes with a sizable count (>10) of Hispanic, non-Hispanic black, and non-Hispanic white enrollees were used for comparison of EMS use across racial/ethnic subgroups. Data on all ED visits, with and without EMS use, were obtained. Data analysis was performed from December 18, 2018, to July 7, 2019. Main Outcomes and Measures: The main outcome measure was whether an EMS transport destination was the most frequent ED destination among white patients (reference ED). The secondary outcomes were (1) whether the ED destination was a safety-net hospital and (2) the distance of EMS transport from the ED destination. Results: The study cohort comprised 864\u202f750 Medicare enrollees from 4175 selected zip codes who had 458\u202f701 ED visits using EMS transport. Of these EMS-transported enrollees, 26.1% (127 555) were younger than 75 years, and most were women (302\u202f430 [66.8%]). Overall, the proportion of white patients transported to the reference ED was 61.3% (95% CI, 61.0% to 61.7%); this rate was lower among black enrollees (difference of -5.3%; 95% CI, -6.0% to -4.6%) and Hispanic enrollees (difference of -2.5%; 95% CI, -3.2% to -1.7%). A similar pattern was found among patients with high-risk acute conditions; the proportion transported to the reference ED was 61.5% (95% CI, 60.7% to 62.2%) among white enrollees, whereas this proportion was lower among black enrollees (difference of -6.7%; 95% CI, -8.3% to -5.0%) and Hispanic enrollees (difference of -2.6%; 95% CI, -4.5% to -0.7%). In major US cities, a larger black-white discordance in ED destination was observed (-9.3%; 95% CI, -10.9% to -7.7%). Black and Hispanic patients were more likely to be transported to a safety-net ED compared with their white counterparts; the proportion transported to a safety-net ED among white enrollees (18.5%; 95% CI, 18.1% to 18.7%) was lower compared with that among black enrollees (difference of 2.7%; 95% CI, 2.2% to 3.2%) and Hispanic enrollees (difference of 1.9%; 95% CI, 1.3% to 2.4%). Concordance rates of non-EMS-transported ED visits were statistically significantly lower than for EMS-transported ED visits; the concordance rate among white enrollees of 52.9% (95% CI, 52.1% to 53.6%) was higher compared with that among black enrollees (difference of -4.8%; 95% CI, -6.4% to -3.3%) and Hispanic enrollees (difference of -3.0%; 95% CI, -4.7% to -1.3%). Conclusions and Relevance: This study found race/ethnicity variation in ED destination for patients using EMS transport, with black and Hispanic patients more likely to be transported to a safety-net hospital ED compared with white patients living in the same zip code.

        "Association of Positive Family Relationships With Mental Health Trajectories From Adolescence To Midlife. Importance: National longitudinal studies that examine the linkages between early family experiences and sex-specific development of depression across the life course are lacking despite the urgent need for interventions in family settings to prevent adult depression. Objective: To examine whether positive adolescent family relationships are associated with reduced depressive symptoms among women and men as they enter midlife. Design, Setting, and Participants: This study analyzed data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health, which used a multistage, stratified school-based design to select a prospective cohort of 20\u202f745 adolescents in grades 7 to 12 from January 3, 1994, to December 26, 1995 (wave 1). Respondents were followed up during 4 additional waves from April 14 to September 9, 1996 (wave 2); April 2, 2001, to May 9, 2002 (wave 3); April 3, 2007, to February 1, 2009 (wave 4); and March 3, 2016, to May 8, 2017 (sample 1, wave 5), when the cohort was aged 32 to 42 years. The study sample of 8952 male adolescents and 9233 female adolescents that were analyzed was a US national representation of all population subgroups by sex, race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and geography. Exposures: Adolescent family cohesion and low parent-child conflict. Main Outcomes and Measures: Levels of depressive symptoms (Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression Scale [CES-D]) from ages 12 to 42 years were used to estimate propensity score-weighted growth curve models to assess sex differences in trajectories of depression by levels of positive adolescent family relationships. Results: A total of 18 185 individuals (mean [SD] age at wave 1, 15.42 [0.12] years; 9233 [50.8%] female) participated in the study. Females and males who experienced positive adolescent family relationships had significantly lower levels of depressive symptoms from early adolescence to midlife than did those who experienced less positive adolescent family relationships. For example, depressive symptoms were lower among those with high levels of family cohesion compared with those with low cohesion between 12 (1.26 lower CES-D score; 95% CI, 1.10-1.42) and 40 (0.78 lower CES-D score; 95% CI, 0.50-1.06) years of age among females and between 12 (0.72 lower CES-D score; 95% CI, 0.57-0.86) and 37 (0.21 lower CES-D score; 95% CI, 0.00-0.41) years of age among males. The reduction in depressive symptoms associated with positive adolescent family relationships was greater for females than males during the adolescent and early adulthood years (ie, early 20s) (eg, low-high cohesion difference in mean CES-D score, -1.26 [95% CI, -1.42 to -1.10] for females and -0.72 [95% CI, -0.86 to -0.57] for males at 12 years of age; low-high cohesion difference in mean CES-D score, -0.61 [95% CI, -0.69 to -0.53] for females and -0.40 [95% CI, -0.48 to -0.31] for males at 20 years of age), after which females and males benefited equally from positive adolescent relationships throughout young adulthood to midlife. Conclusions and Relevance: The findings suggest that positive adolescent family relationships are associated with better mental health among females and males from early adolescence to midlife. Interventions in early family life to foster healthy mental development throughout the life course appear to be important. ",
        "Association of Weight Loss Interventions With Changes in Biomarkers of Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis. Importance: Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) affects about 25% of adults worldwide and is associated with obesity. Weight loss may improve biomarkers of liver disease, but its implications have not been systematically reviewed and quantified. Objective: To estimate the association of weight loss interventions with biomarkers of liver disease in NAFLD. Data Sources: MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Cochrane, and Web of Science databases along with 3 trial registries were searched from inception through January 2019. Study Selection: Randomized clinical trials of people with NAFLD were included if they compared any intervention aiming to reduce weight (behavioral weight loss programs [BWLPs], pharmacotherapy, and surgical procedures) with no or lower-intensity weight loss intervention. The review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Data Extraction and Synthesis: Two independent reviewers screened the studies, extracted the data, and assessed the risk of bias using the Cochrane tool. Pooled mean differences or odds ratios (ORs) were obtained from random-effects meta-analyses. Main Outcomes and Measures: Blood, radiologic, and histologic biomarkers of liver disease. Results: Twenty-two studies with 2588 participants (with a mean [SD] age of 45 [14] years and with approximately 66% male) were included. Fifteen studies tested BWLPs, 6 tested pharmacotherapy, and 1 tested a surgical procedure. The median (interquartile range) intervention duration was 6 (3-8) months. Compared with no or lower-intensity weight loss interventions, more-intensive weight loss interventions were statistically significantly associated with greater weight change (-3.61 kg; 95% CI, -5.11 to -2.12; I2\u2009=\u200995%). Weight loss interventions were statistically significantly associated with improvements in biomarkers, including alanine aminotransferase (-9.81 U/L; 95% CI, -13.12 to -6.50; I2\u2009=\u200997%), histologically or radiologically measured liver steatosis (standardized mean difference: -1.48; 95% CI, -2.27 to -0.70; I2\u2009=\u200994%), histologic NAFLD activity score (-0.92; 95% CI, -1.75 to -0.09; I2\u2009=\u200995%), and presence of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (OR, 0.14; 95% CI, 0.04-0.49; I2\u2009=\u20090%). No statistically significant change in histologic liver fibrosis was found (-0.13; 95% CI, -0.54 to 0.27; I2\u2009=\u200968%). Twelve studies were at high risk of bias in at least 1 domain. In a sensitivity analysis of the 3 trials at low risk of bias, the estimates and precision of most outcomes did not materially change. Conclusions and Relevance: The trials, despite some heterogeneity, consistently showed evidence of the association between weight loss interventions and improved biomarkers of liver disease in NAFLD in the short to medium term, although evidence on long-term health outcomes was limited. These findings appear to support the need to change the clinical guidelines and to recommend formal weight loss programs for people with NAFLD. ",
        "FDA Approval and Regulation of Pharmaceuticals, 1983-2018. Importance: US law requires testing of new drugs before approval to ensure that they provide a well-defined benefit that is commensurate with their risks. A major challenge for the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is to achieve an appropriate balance between rigorous testing and the need for timely approval of drugs that have benefits that outweigh their risks. Objective: To describe the evolution of laws and standards affecting drug testing, the use of new approval programs and standards, expansions of the role and authority of the FDA, and changes in the number of drugs approved from the 1980s to 2018. Evidence: Sources of evidence included principal federal laws and FDA regulations (1962-2018) and FDA databases of approved new drugs (1984-2018), generic drugs (1970-2018), biologics (1984-2018), and vaccines (1998-2018); special development and approval programs (Orphan drug [1984-2018], Fast-Track [1988-2018], Priority Review and its predecessors [1984-2018], Accelerated Approval [1992-2018], and Breakthrough Therapy [2012-2018]); expanded access (2010-2017) and Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies (2008-2018); and user fees paid to the FDA by industry (1993-2018). Findings: From 1983 to 2018, legislation and regulatory initiatives have substantially changed drug approval at the FDA. The mean annual number of new drug approvals, including biologics, was 34 from 1990-1999, 25 from 2000-2009, and 41 from 2010-2018. New biologic product approvals increased from a median of 2.5 from 1990-1999, to 5 from 2000-2013, to 12 from 2014-2018. The median annual number of generic drugs approved was 136 from 1970 to the enactment of the Hatch-Waxman Act in 1984; 284 from 1985 to the enactment of the Generic Drug User Fee Act in 2012; and 588 from 2013-2018. Prescription drug user fee funding expanded from new drugs and biologics in 1992 to generic and biosimilar drugs in 2012. The amount of Prescription Drug User Fee Act fees collected from industry increased from an annual mean of $66 million in 1993-1997 to $820 million in 2013-2017, and in 2018, user fees accounted for approximately 80% of the salaries of review personnel responsible for the approval of new drugs. The proportion of drugs approved with an Orphan Drug Act designation increased from 18% (55/304) in 1984-1995, to 22% (82/379) in 1996-2007, to 41% (154/380) in 2008-2018. Use of Accelerated Approval, Fast-Track, and Priority Review for new drugs has increased over time, with 81% (48/59) of new drugs benefiting from at least 1 such expedited program in 2018. The proportion of new approvals supported by at least 2 pivotal trials decreased from 80.6% in 1995-1997 to 52.8% in 2015-2017, based on 124 and 106 approvals, respectively, while the median number of patients studied did not change significantly (774 vs 816). FDA drug review times declined from more than 3 years in 1983 to less than 1 year in 2017, but total time from the authorization of clinical testing to approval has remained at approximately 8 years over that period. Conclusions and Relevance: Over the last 4 decades, the approval and regulation processes for pharmaceutical agents have evolved and increased in complexity as special programs have been added and as the use of surrogate measures has been encouraged. The FDA funding needed to implement and manage these programs has been addressed by expanding industry-paid user fees. The FDA has increasingly accepted less data and more surrogate measures, and has shortened its review times. ",
        "Effectiveness of Self-guided App-Based Virtual Reality Cognitive Behavior Therapy for Acrophobia: A Randomized Clinical Trial. Importance: Globally, access to evidence-based psychological treatment is limited. Innovative self-help methods using smartphone applications and low-cost virtual reality have the potential to significantly improve the accessibility and scalability of psychological treatments. Objective: To examine the effectiveness of ZeroPhobia, a fully self-guided app-based virtual reality cognitive behavior therapy (VR CBT) using low-cost (cardboard) virtual reality goggles compared with a wait-list control group and to determine its user friendliness. Design, Setting, and Participants: In a single-blind randomized clinical trial, participants were enrolled between March 24 and September 28, 2017, and randomly assigned (1:1) by an independent researcher to either VR CBT app or a wait-list control group. A total of 193 individuals aged 18 to 65 years from the Dutch general population with acrophobia symptoms and access to an Android smartphone participated. The 6 animated modules of the VR-CBT app and gamified virtual reality environments were delivered over a 3-week period in participants' natural environment. Assessments were completed at baseline, immediately after treatment, and at 3-month follow-up. Analysis began April 6, 2018, and was intention to treat. Intervention: Self-guided app-based VR CBT. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome measure was the Acrophobia Questionnaire. The hypothesis was formulated prior to data collection. Results: In total, 193 participants (129 women [66.84%]; mean [SD] age,\u200941.33 [13.64] years) were randomly assigned to intervention (n\u2009=\u200996) or a wait-list control group (n\u2009=\u200997). An intent-to-treat analysis showed a significant reduction of acrophobia symptoms at posttest at 3 months for the VR-CBT app compared with the controls (b\u2009=\u2009-26.73 [95% CI, -32.12 to -21.34]; P\u2009<\u2009.001; d\u2009=\u20091.14 [95% CI, 0.84 to 1.44]). The number needed to treat was 1.7. Sensitivity and robustness analysis confirmed these findings. Pretreatment attrition was 22 of 96 (23%) because of smartphone incompatibility. Of the 74 participants who started using the VR-CBT app, 57 (77%) completed the intervention fully. Conclusions and Relevance: A low-cost fully self-guided app-based virtual reality cognitive behavioral therapy with rudimentary virtual reality goggles can produce large acrophobia symptom reductions. To our knowledge, this study is the first to show that virtual reality acrophobia treatment can be done at home without the intervention of a therapist.

        "Association of Statin Use and High Serum Cholesterol Levels With Risk of Primary Open-Angle Glaucoma. Importance: The use of statins (hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A inhibitors) has been associated with a lower risk of primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG); however, results have been conflicting, and little is known about the association between high cholesterol levels and POAG. Objective: To assess the association of elevated cholesterol levels and statin use with incident POAG. Design, Setting, and Participants: This study used data collected biennially from participants aged 40 years or older who were free of glaucoma and reported eye examinations, within 3 population-based cohorts: the Nurses' Health Study (N\u2009=\u200950\u202f710; followed up from 2000 to 2014), the Nurses' Health Study 2 (N\u2009=\u200962\u202f992; 1999-2015), and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study (N\u2009=\u200923\u202f080; 2000-2014). Incident cases of POAG were confirmed by medical record review. The analyses were performed in January 2019. Exposures: Biennially updated self-reported information on elevated cholesterol level status, serum cholesterol levels, and duration of statin use. Main Outcomes and Measures: Multivariable-adjusted relative risks (RRs) and 95% CIs were estimated using Cox proportional hazards regression models on pooled data, with stratification by cohort. Results: Among the 136\u202f782 participants in the 3 cohorts (113\u202f702 women and 23\u202f080 men), 886 incident cases of POAG were identified. Every 20-mg/dL increase in total serum cholesterol was associated with a 7% increase in risk of POAG (RR, 1.07 [95% CI, 1.02-1.11]; P\u2009=\u2009.004). Any self-reported history of elevated cholesterol was also associated with a higher risk of POAG (RR, 1.17 [95% CI, 1.00-1.37]). A history of any statin use was associated with a 15% lower risk of POAG (RR, 0.85 [95% CI, 0.73-0.99]). Use of statins for 5 or more years vs never use of statins was associated with a 21% lower risk of POAG (RR, 0.79 [95% CI, 0.65-0.97]; P\u2009=\u2009.02 for linear trend). The association between use of statins for 5 or more years vs never use of statins and risk of POAG was more inverse in those who were older (\u226565 years: RR, 0.70 [95% CI, 0.56-0.87] vs <65 years: RR, 1.05 [95% CI, 0.68-1.63]; P\u2009=\u2009.01 for interaction). Conclusions and Relevance: Among adults aged 40 years or older, higher serum cholesterol levels were associated with higher risk of POAG, while 5 or more years of statin use compared with never use of statins was associated with a lower risk of POAG.

        "Patterns of Pediatric Firearm-Related Ocular Trauma in the United States. Importance: Gun violence represents a substantial public health issue, and firearm-related injuries rank second among the causes of injury-related deaths in children aged 0 to 17 years in the United States. Ocular trauma from firearm-related injuries can lead to devastating vision loss, but little is known to date about the specific demographics and characteristics of such injuries in children. Objective: To evaluate the epidemiologic pattern of pediatric firearm-related ocular injuries. Design, Setting, and Participants: This retrospective analysis used deidentified data from the National Trauma Data Bank, the largest national registry of hospitalized trauma cases in the United States. The firearm-related ocular injuries (n\u2009=\u20091972) of pediatric patients (defined as those younger than 21 years) hospitalized between January 1, 2008, and December 31, 2014, were analyzed. Statistical analyses were conducted from July 15, 2017, to June 15, 2019. Exposure: Firearm-related ocular trauma. Main Outcomes and Measures: Pediatric patients with firearm-related ocular injuries were identified using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification codes and external causes of injury codes. Patient demographics (age, sex, and race/ethnicity), type of ocular injury, injury intent, geographic location, length of hospital admission, health insurance status, disposition at discharge, Injury Severity Score (ISS), and Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score were collected. Results: A total of 8715 firearm-related ocular injuries were identified. Of these injuries, 1972 (22.6%) occurred in pediatric patients, most of whom were male (1678 [85.1%]) and adolescents (1037 [52.6%]), with a mean (SD) age of 15.2 (5) years. Common locations of injury were home (761 [38.6%]) and street (490 [24.8%]). Mean (SD) hospital length of stay was 7.6 (12) days, ISS was 16 (13.1), and GCS score was 11 (5.1). The most common types of firearm-related ocular injuries were open wound of the eyeball (820 [41.6%]) and ocular adnexa (502 [25.5%]), orbital injuries or fractures (591 [30.0%]), and contusion of the eye or adnexa (417 [21.1%]). Patients aged 0 to 3 years had greater odds of unintentional injuries (odds ratio [OR],\u20094.41; 95% CI,\u20092.51-7.75; P\u2009<\u2009.001) and injuries occurring at home (OR,\u20095.39; 95% CI,\u20092.81-10.38; P\u2009<\u2009.001), and those aged 19 to 21 years had greater odds of assault injuries (OR,\u20092.17; 95% CI,\u20091.77-2.66; P\u2009<\u2009.001) and injuries occurring on the street (OR,\u20091.61; 95% CI,\u20091.3-1.98; P\u2009<\u2009.001). Black patients had the greatest odds of having injuries with assault intention (OR,\u20094.53; 95% CI,\u20093.68-5.59; P\u2009<\u2009.001), and white patients had the greatest likelihood for self-inflicted injury (OR,\u20097.1; 95% CI, 5.92-9.51; P\u2009<\u2009.001). Traumatic brain injury resulted mostly from self-inflicted trauma (OR,\u20095.99; 95% CI,\u20094.16-8.63; P\u2009<\u2009.001), as did visual pathway injuries (OR,\u20092.86; 95% CI,\u20091.95-4.20; P\u2009<\u2009.001). The inpatient mortality rate was 12.2%. Conclusions and Relevance: This study found that pediatric firearm-related ocular injuries from 2008 through 2014 were predominantly sight-threatening and associated with traumatic brain injury. If the possible risk factors, including sex, age, race/ethnicity, and injury intention, can be confirmed for 2015 through 2019, these findings may be useful in developing strategies to prevent pediatric firearm-related ocular injuries.

        "Prevalence of Potentially Unnecessary Bimanual Pelvic Examinations and Papanicolaou Tests Among Adolescent Girls and Young Women Aged 15-20 Years in the United States. Importance: Pelvic examination is no longer recommended for asymptomatic, nonpregnant women and may cause harms such as false-positive test results, overdiagnosis, anxiety, and unnecessary costs. The bimanual pelvic examination (BPE) is an invasive and controversial examination component. Cervical cancer screening is not recommended for women younger than 21 years. Objectives: To estimate prevalence of potentially unnecessary BPE and Papanicolaou (Pap) tests performed among adolescent girls and women younger than 21 years (hereinafter referred to as young women) in the United States and to identify factors associated with receiving these examinations. Design, Setting, and Participants: A cross-sectional analysis of the National Survey of Family Growth from September 2011 through September 2017 focused on a population-based sample of young women aged 15 to 20 years (n\u2009=\u20093410). The analysis used survey weights to estimate prevalence and the number of people represented in the US population. Data were analyzed from December 21, 2018, through September 3, 2019. Main Outcomes and Measures: Receipt of a BPE or a Pap test in the last 12 months and the proportion of potentially unnecessary examinations and tests. Results: Responses from 3410 young women aged 15 to 20 years were included in the analysis with 6-year sampling weights applied. Among US young women aged 15 to 20 years represented during the 2011-2017 study period, 4.8% (95% CI, 3.9%-5.9%) were pregnant, 22.3% (95% CI, 20.1%-24.6%) had undergone STI testing, and 4.5% (95% CI, 3.6%-5.5%) received treatment or medication for an STI in the past 12 months (Table 1). Only 2.0% (95% CI, 1.4%-2.9%) reported using an IUD, and 33.5% (95% CI, 30.8%-36.4%) used at least 1 other type of hormonal contraception in the past 12 months. Among US young women aged 15 to 20 years who were surveyed in the years 2011 through 2017, approximately 2.6 million (22.9%; 95% CI, 20.7%-25.3%) reported having received a BPE in the last 12 months. Approximately half of these examinations (54.4%; 95% CI, 48.8%-59.9%) were potentially unnecessary, representing an estimated 1.4 million individuals. Receipt of a BPE was associated with having a Pap test (adjusted prevalence ratio [aPR], 7.12; 95% CI, 5.56-9.12), testing for sexually transmitted infections (aPR, 1.60; 95% CI, 1.34-1.90), and using hormonal contraception other than an intrauterine device (aPR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.11-1.54). In addition, an estimated 2.2 million young women (19.2%; 95% CI, 17.2%-21.4%) reported having received a Pap test in the past 12 months, and 71.9% (95% CI, 66.0%-77.1%) of these tests were potentially unnecessary. Conclusions and Relevance: This analysis found that more than half of BPEs and almost three-quarters of Pap tests performed among young women aged 15 to 20 years during the years 2011 through 2017 were potentially unnecessary, exposing women to preventable harms. The results suggest that compliance with the current professional guidelines regarding the appropriate use of these examinations and tests may be lacking. ",
        "Association of Subclinical Hearing Loss With Cognitive Performance. Importance: Age-related hearing loss (HL) is a common and treatable condition that has been associated with cognitive impairment. The level of hearing at which this association begins has not been studied to date. Objective: To investigate whether the association between hearing and cognition is present among individuals traditionally classified as having normal hearing. Design, Setting, and Participants: Cross-sectional study of 2 US epidemiologic studies (Hispanic Community Health Study [HCHS], 2008-2011, and National Health and Nutrition Examination Study [NHANES], 1999-2000, 2001-2002, and 2011-2012 cycles). The dates of analysis were November 2018 to August 2019. Multivariable generalized additive model (GAM) regression and linear regression were used to assess the association between HL (exposure) and cognition (outcome). Participants included 6451 individuals aged 50 years or older from the general Hispanic population (HCHS [n\u2009=\u20095190]) and the general civilian, noninstitutionalized US population (NHANES [n\u2009=\u20091261]). Exposures: Audiometric HL (4-frequency pure-tone average). Main Outcomes and Measures: Neurocognitive performance measured by the Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST) (score range, 0-113), Word Frequency Test (range, 0-49), Spanish-English Verbal Learning Test (SEVLT) 3 trials (range, 5-40), SEVLT recall (range, 0-15), and Six-Item Screener (range, 0-6); higher scores indicated better cognitive performance. Results: Among 6451 individuals, the mean (SD) age was 59.4 (6.1) years, and 3841 (59.5%) were women. The GAM regression showed a significant inverse association between hearing and cognition across the entire spectrum of hearing after adjusting for demographics and cardiovascular disease. In separate multivariable linear regressions stratified by the classic binary definition of HL, decreased hearing was independently associated with decreased cognition in adults with normal hearing (pure-tone average \u226425 dB) across all cognitive tests in the HCHS. For example in this group, a 10-dB decrease in hearing was associated with a clinically meaningful 1.97-point (95% CI, 1.18-2.75) decrease in score on the DSST. When using a stricter HL cut point (15 dB), an association was also present in NHANES. The associations between hearing and cognition were stronger or equivalent in individuals with normal hearing than among those with HL. For example, there was a 2.28-point (95% CI, 1.56-3.00) combined cohort DSST score decrease per 10-dB decrease among individuals with normal hearing vs a 0.97-point (95% CI, 0.20-1.75) decrease among those with HL, with a significant interaction term between continuous and binary hearing. Conclusions and Relevance: An independent association was observed between cognition and subclinical HL. The association between hearing and cognition may be present earlier in HL than previously understood. Studies investigating whether treating HL can prevent impaired cognition and dementia should consider a lower threshold for defining HL than the current 25-dB threshold. ",
        "Association of Hearing Loss With Dementia. Importance: Hearing loss (HL) may be a modifiable risk factor for dementia, and longitudinal studies are needed to examine the association of HL and dementia. Objective: To investigate the association of HL with incident dementia in Taiwanese adults in the general population. Design, Setting, and Participants: This population-based cohort study collected data from the National Health Insurance Research Database of Taiwan. Patients newly diagnosed with HL from January 1, 2000, through December 31, 2011 (n\u2009=\u20098135), constituted the exposed (HL) group. The HL group patients were matched by sex, age, residence, and insurance premium to individuals without HL (non-HL group) (n\u2009=\u20098135). Data were analyzed from January 1, 2000, to December 31, 2013. Exposure: Hearing loss defined according to International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) codes. Main Outcomes and Measures: Dementia classified according to ICD-9-CM codes. Results: Of a total of 16 270 participants (9286 [57.1%] men; mean [SD] age, 65.2 [11.1] years), 1868 developed dementia. The dementia incidence rate in the HL group was higher than that in the non-HL group (19.38 [95% CI, 18.25-20.57] per 1000 person-years vs 13.98 [95% CI, 13.01-15.00] per 1000 person-years) during the follow-up period. In the fully adjusted multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression model applied for risk analysis, patients with HL had a significant risk of dementia (hazard ratio [HR],\u20091.17; 95% CI, 1.07-1.29; false discovery rate [FDR] P\u2009=\u2009.003). Subgroup analysis revealed that, among 3 age groups (45-64, 65-74, and \u226575 years), the group aged 45 to 64 years was associated with a risk of dementia (HR,\u20092.21 [95% CI, 1.57-3.12]; FDR P\u2009<\u2009.001). In sensitivity analysis, the presence of HL among those aged 45 to 64 years (HR,\u20091.40; 95% CI, 1.12-1.75; FDR P\u2009=\u2009.01) was associated with a risk of dementia. Conclusions and Relevance: In this study, hearing loss was positively associated with a risk of dementia, especially in patients aged 45 to 64 years. Hearing protection, screening, and treatment may be used as strategies for mitigating this potential risk factor. ",
        "A Historical Examination of Military Records of US Army Suicide, 1819 to 2017. Importance: Suicide rates among active-duty personnel in the US military have increased substantially since 2004, and numerous studies have attempted to contextualize and better understand this phenomenon. Placing contemporary examinations of suicides among active-duty personnel in the US Army in historical context provides opportunities for joint historical and epidemiological research to inform health care professionals and policy makers. Objectives: To consolidate data on suicide rates among active-duty personnel in the US Army as far back as historical records allow and to identify historical trends to separate them from more acute causal factors. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cross-sectional study included all active-duty service members in the US Army from 1819 to 2017 as identified and detailed in US government publications, studies, and journal articles. Empirical data were extracted from US government publications and journal articles published from 1819 to 2017. Data collection and analysis were completed between July and August of 2019. Exposure: Suicide. Main Outcomes and Measures: Suicide rates per 100\u202f000 individuals. Results: Starting in 1843, the overall trend in annual suicide rates among active-duty service members in the US Army increased, with a peak rate of 118.3 per 100\u202f000 in 1883. From that historical high point, the rate decreased in 3 successive waves, each corresponding to the end of the following wars: the Spanish-American War (1898), World War I (1914-1918), and World War II (1939-1945). The latter had the historically lowest rate of 5 per 100\u202f000 in 1944 to 1945. During the Cold War (approximately 1945-1991), the rate generally stabilized in the low teens to midteens (ie, 10-15 per 100\u202f000). The rate increased again during the Afghanistan and Iraq Wars, increasing to 29.7 per 100\u202f000 in 2012. From 2008 to present, the annual rate has remained within the range of 20.2 to 29.7 per 100\u202f000. Conclusions and Relevance: This study represents the most extensive historical examination of suicides in the US Army to date. By taking a long-term historical approach to suicide among active-duty personnel in the US Army, this study affords future researchers a new analytical tool and an additional perspective from which to better differentiate long-term and historical trends from more short-term and temporary causal factors.

        "Association of Cognition and Age-Related Hearing Impairment in the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing. Importance: Evidence has linked age-related hearing impairment (ARHI) with cognitive decline; however, very few studies (none in the United Kingdom) explore this link in large well-characterized groups of community-dwelling individuals. Objective: To investigate the link between ARHI and cognitive decline using a cohort of elderly individuals from the United Kingdom and explore untreated hearing loss and social isolation as potential explanations for the observed link. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cross-sectional analysis of wave 7 (June 2014 through May 2015) of the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA) sampled men and women 50 years or older and living in the United Kingdom in a community setting. Those with a diagnosis of dementia, Alzheimer disease, or Parkinson disease or with ear infections and cochlear implants were excluded. Data were analyzed from August 1, 2017, through May 25, 2018. Main Outcomes and Measures: Memory and executive function as measures of cognitive function and hearing acuity derived from the HearCheck screener device (Siemens). Results: Of a cohort of 9666 members in wave 7 of ELSA, 7385 were eligible for analysis after applying exclusion criteria (55.1% women; mean [SD] age, 67.4 [9.4] years). Of these, 3056 (41.4%) had mild hearing loss and 755 (10.2%) had severe hearing loss; 834 (11.3%) used a hearing aid; and 7155 (96.9%) were white. Hearing loss had a negative association with cognition; for those with moderate to severe loss, the score on memory assessment was a full 1 point less (-1.00; 95% CI, -1.24 to -0.76), ceteris paribus, relative to those with no hearing loss. However, this association was seen only in the individuals with untreated hearing loss (ie, those who did not use hearing aids) (-1.16; 95% CI, -1.45 to -0.87). Evidence suggests that social isolation acts as a mediating factor. Conclusions and Relevance: Although hearing loss and cognition are linked, untreated hearing loss drives the association. Social isolation is a mediating factor in the link for those who have untreated hearing loss. Cognitive decline associated with ARHI is probably preventable by early rehabilitation and increased opportunistic screening for the elderly. ",
        "Geographic Disparities in US Veterans' Access to Cochlear Implant Care Within the Veterans Health Administration System. Importance: Veterans are at high risk for developing sensorineural hearing loss leading to cochlear implant (CI) candidacy; however, the ability to care for these patients is limited by the number and location of Veterans Health Administration (VHA) facilities that provide specialized CI services. Objective: To investigate geographic disparities in access to CI care within the VHA system for US veterans. Design, Setting, and Participants: An analysis of census tract-level data including US veterans was conducted using the nationwide American Community Survey data collected by the US Census Bureau from January to December 2016, which were accessed in 2017. Main Outcomes and Measures: Maps showing the geographic variability in need for specialized CI services, estimated as a function of the number of veterans and the distance to the nearest established VHA-based CI surgical or audiologic facilities. Results: A total of 19.9 million veterans within the continental United States resided at a median distance of 80 miles (interquartile range [IQR], 30.1-140.9; mean [SD], 1002 [465.8] miles) from the nearest VHA facility offering CI care; of these, 3.98 million (20.0%) resided more than 160.7 miles from the nearest VHA facility. When considering only comprehensive facilities offering both surgical and audiologic care, the median distance was 101.3 miles (IQR, 39.4-178.7; mean [SD], 126.0 [448.4] miles), but 20.0% of veterans had to travel more than 201.0 miles to a VHA facility. Veterans residing in urban areas (74.0%) lived a median distance of 61.2 miles (IQR, 23.7-121.3; mean [SD], 83.8 [477.1] miles) from the nearest VHA facility, with 2.9 million (20.0%) living the farthest at 140.7 miles. Veterans residing in rural areas (26.0%) lived a median distance of 119.8 miles (IQR, 79.0-182.4; mean [SD], 146.9 [431.0] miles) from their nearest VHA facility, with 1.04 million (20.0%) living more than 206.2 miles from the nearest VHA facility. Conclusions and Relevance: This study's findings suggest that large disparities exist in the distance to the nearest VHA-based CI facilities. Veterans face considerable geographic barriers to obtaining VHA-based CI care in many parts of the country, including some large metropolitan areas. Those requiring only audiologic services face similar geographic barriers as those requiring surgery. Thoughtful placement of new facilities, along with upcoming advances in remote programming of implants, may help ensure appropriate care for this high-risk population. ",
        "Association of Aspirin Use for Primary Prevention With Cardiovascular Events and Bleeding Events: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis. Importance: The role for aspirin in cardiovascular primary prevention remains controversial, with potential benefits limited by an increased bleeding risk. Objective: To assess the association of aspirin use for primary prevention with cardiovascular events and bleeding. Data Sources: PubMed and Embase were searched on Cochrane Library Central Register of Controlled Trials from the earliest available date through November 1, 2018. Study Selection: Randomized clinical trials enrolling at least 1000 participants with no known cardiovascular disease and a follow-up of at least 12 months were included. Included studies compared aspirin use with no aspirin (placebo or no treatment). Data Extraction and Synthesis: Data were screened and extracted independently by both investigators. Bayesian and frequentist meta-analyses were performed. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary cardiovascular outcome was a composite of cardiovascular mortality, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and nonfatal stroke. The primary bleeding outcome was any major bleeding (defined by the individual studies). Results: A total of 13 trials randomizing 164\u202f225 participants with 1\u202f050\u202f511 participant-years of follow-up were included. The median age of trial participants was 62 years (range, 53-74), 77\u202f501 (47%) were men, 30\u202f361 (19%) had diabetes, and the median baseline risk of the primary cardiovascular outcome was 9.2% (range, 2.6%-15.9%). Aspirin use was associated with significant reductions in the composite cardiovascular outcome compared with no aspirin (57.1 per 10\u202f000 participant-years with aspirin and 61.4 per 10\u202f000 participant-years with no aspirin) (hazard ratio [HR], 0.89 [95% credible interval, 0.84-0.95]; absolute risk reduction, 0.38% [95% CI, 0.20%-0.55%]; number needed to treat, 265). Aspirin use was associated with an increased risk of major bleeding events compared with no aspirin (23.1 per 10\u202f000 participant-years with aspirin and 16.4 per 10\u202f000 participant-years with no aspirin) (HR, 1.43 [95% credible interval, 1.30-1.56]; absolute risk increase, 0.47% [95% CI, 0.34%-0.62%]; number needed to harm, 210). Conclusions and Relevance: The use of aspirin in individuals without cardiovascular disease was associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular events and an increased risk of major bleeding. This information may inform discussions with patients about aspirin for primary prevention of cardiovascular events and bleeding. ",
        "Frequency of Intracranial Hemorrhage With Low-Dose Aspirin in Individuals Without Symptomatic Cardiovascular Disease: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis. Importance: Use of low-dose aspirin for the primary prevention of cardiovascular events remains controversial because increased risk of bleeding may offset the overall benefit. Among major bleeding events, intracranial hemorrhage is associated with high mortality rates and functional dependency. Objective: To assess the risk of intracranial hemorrhage associated with low-dose aspirin among individuals without symptomatic cardiovascular disease. Data Sources: PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and ClinicalTrials.gov were searched from January 1966 to October 30, 2018. Study Selection: Randomized clinical trials that compared low-dose aspirin (daily dose \u2264100 mg) vs control and recorded the end points of intracranial hemorrhage separately for active treatment and control groups were included. Data Extraction and Synthesis: A random-effect estimate was computed based on the Mantel-Haenszel method. Relative risk with 95% CI was used as a measure of aspirin vs control on risk of intracranial hemorrhage. Main Outcomes and Measures: The main outcomes were any intracranial hemorrhage, intracerebral hemorrhage, subdural or extradural hemorrhage, and subarachnoid hemorrhage, for aspirin vs control. Results: The search identified 13 randomized clinical trials of low-dose aspirin use for primary prevention, enrolling 134\u202f446 patients. Pooling the results from the random-effects model showed that low-dose aspirin, compared with control, was associated with an increased risk of any intracranial bleeding (8 trials; relative risk, 1.37; 95% CI, 1.13-1.66; 2 additional intracranial hemorrhages in 1000 people), with potentially the greatest relative risk increase for subdural or extradural hemorrhage (4 trials; relative risk, 1.53; 95% CI, 1.08-2.18) and less for intracerebral hemorrhage and subarachnoid hemorrhage. Patient baseline features associated with heightened risk of intracerebral hemorrhage with low-dose aspirin, compared with control, were Asian race/ethnicity and low body mass index. Conclusions and Relevance: Among people without symptomatic cardiovascular disease, use of low-dose aspirin was associated with an overall increased risk of intracranial hemorrhage, and heightened risk of intracerebral hemorrhage for those of Asian race/ethnicity or people with a low body mass index.

        "Association of Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction and Symptoms With Mortality After Elective Noncardiac Surgery Among Patients With Heart Failure. Importance: Heart failure is an established risk factor for postoperative mortality, but how left ventricular ejection fraction and heart failure symptoms affect surgical outcomes is not fully described. Objectives: To determine the risk of postoperative mortality among patients with heart failure at various levels of echocardiographic (left ventricular systolic dysfunction) and clinical (symptoms) severity compared with those without heart failure and to evaluate how risk varies across levels of surgical complexity. Design, Setting, and Participants: US multisite retrospective cohort study of all adult patients receiving elective, noncardiac surgery in the Veterans Affairs Surgical Quality Improvement Project database from 2009 through 2016. A total of 609\u202f735 patient records were identified and analyzed with 1 year of follow-up after having surgery (final study follow-up: September 1, 2017). Exposures: Heart failure, left ventricular ejection fraction, and presence of signs or symptoms of heart failure within 30 days of surgery. Main Outcome and Measure: The primary outcome was postoperative mortality at 90 days. Results: Outcome data from 47\u202f997 patients with heart failure (7.9%; mean [SD] age, 68.6 [10.1] years; 1391 women [2.9%]) and 561\u202f738 patients without heart failure (92.1%; mean [SD] age, 59.4 [13.4] years; 50\u202f862 women [9.1%]) were analyzed. Compared with patients without heart failure, those with heart failure had a higher risk of 90-day postoperative mortality (2635 vs 6881 90-day deaths; crude mortality risk, 5.49% vs 1.22%; adjusted absolute risk difference [RD], 1.03% [95% CI, 0.91%-1.15%]; adjusted odds ratio [OR], 1.67 [95% CI, 1.57-1.76]). Compared with patients without heart failure, symptomatic patients with heart failure (n\u2009=\u20095906) had a higher risk (597 deaths [10.11%]; adjusted absolute RD, 2.37% [95% CI, 2.06%-2.57%]; adjusted OR, 2.37 [95% CI, 2.14-2.63]). Asymptomatic patients with heart failure (n\u2009=\u200942\u202f091) (2038 deaths [crude risk, 4.84%]; adjusted absolute RD, 0.74% [95% CI, 0.63%-0.87%]; adjusted OR, 1.53 [95% CI, 1.44-1.63]), including the subset with preserved left ventricular systolic function (1144 deaths [4.42%]; adjusted absolute RD, 0.66% [95% CI, 0.54%-0.79%]; adjusted OR, 1.46 [95% CI, 1.35-1.57]), also experienced elevated risk. Conclusions and Relevance: Among patients undergoing elective noncardiac surgery, heart failure with or without symptoms was significantly associated with 90-day postoperative mortality. These data may be helpful in preoperative discussions with patients with heart failure undergoing noncardiac surgery. ",
        "Effect of Aerobic and Resistance Exercise on Cardiac Adipose Tissues: Secondary Analyses From a Randomized Clinical Trial. Importance: Epicardial and pericardial adipose tissues are emerging as important risk factors for cardiovascular disease, and there is a growing interest in discovering strategies to reduce the accumulation of fat in these depots. Objective: To investigate whether a 12-week endurance or resistance training intervention regulates epicardial and pericardial adipose tissue mass. Design, Setting, and Participants: Secondary analysis of a randomized, assessor-blinded clinical trial initiated on August 2016 and completed April 2018. This single-center, community-based study included 50 physically inactive participants with abdominal obesity. Interventions: Participants were randomized to a supervised high-intensity interval endurance training (3\u2009times a week for 45 minutes), resistance training (3\u2009times a week for\u200945 minutes), or no exercise (control group). Main Outcomes and Measures: Change in epicardial and pericardial adipose tissue mass assessed by magnetic resonance imaging, based on a prespecified secondary analysis plan including 3 of 5 parallel groups. Results: Of 50 participants (mean [SD] age, 41 [14] years, 10 men [26%]; mean [SD] body mass index [calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared], 32 [5]), 39 [78%] completed the study. Endurance training and resistance training reduced epicardial adipose tissue mass by 32% (95% CI, 10%-53%) and 24% (95% CI, 1%-46%), respectively, compared with the no exercise control group (56% [95% CI, 24%-88%]; P\u2009=\u2009.001 and 48% [95% CI, 15%-81%]; P\u2009<\u2009.001, respectively). While there was a nonsignificant reduction in pericardial adipose tissue mass after endurance training (11% [95% CI, -5% to 27%]; P\u2009=\u2009.17), resistance training significantly reduced pericardial adipose tissue mass by 31% (95% CI, 16%-47%; P\u2009<\u2009.001) when compared with the no exercise control group. Compared with the no exercise control group, there was an increase in left ventricular mass by endurance (20 g [95% CI, 11%-30%]; P\u2009<\u2009.001) and resistance training (18 g [95% CI, 8%-28%]; P\u2009<\u2009.001). Other cardiometabolic outcomes remained unchanged after the 12-week trial period. Conclusions and Relevance: In individuals with abdominal obesity, both endurance and resistance training reduced epicardial adipose tissue mass, while only resistance training reduced pericardial adipose tissue mass. These data highlight the potential preventive importance of different exercise modalities as means to reduce cardiac fat in individuals with abdominal obesity.

        "Association of Medicaid Expansion With Cardiovascular Mortality. Importance: Medicaid expansion under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act led to one of the largest gains in health insurance coverage for nonelderly adults in the United States. However, its association with cardiovascular mortality is unclear. Objective: To investigate the association of Medicaid expansion with cardiovascular mortality rates in middle-aged adults. Design, Setting, and Participants: This study used a longitudinal, observational design, using a difference-in-differences approach with county-level data from counties in 48 states (excluding Massachusetts and Wisconsin) and Washington, DC, from 2010 to 2016. Adults aged 45 to 64 years were included. Data were analyzed from November 2018 to January 2019. Exposures: Residence in a Medicaid expansion state. Main Outcomes and Measures: Difference-in-differences of annual, age-adjusted cardiovascular mortality rates from before Medicaid expansion to after expansion. Results: As of 2016, 29 states and Washington, DC, had expanded Medicaid eligibility, while 19 states had not. Compared with counties in Medicaid nonexpansion states, counties in expansion states had a greater decrease in the percentage of uninsured residents at all income levels (mean [SD], 7.3% [3.2%] vs 5.6% [2.7%]; P\u2009<\u2009.001) and in low income strata (19.8% [5.5%] vs 13.5% [3.9%]; P\u2009<\u2009.001) between 2010 and 2016. Counties in expansion states had a smaller change in cardiovascular mortality rates after expansion (146.5 [95% CI, 132.4-160.7] to 146.4 [95% CI, 131.9-161.0] deaths per 100\u202f000 residents per year) than counties in nonexpansion states did (176.3 [95% CI, 154.2-198.5] to 180.9 [95% CI, 158.0-203.8] deaths per 100\u202f000 residents per year). After accounting for demographic, clinical, and economic differences, counties in expansion states had 4.3 (95% CI, 1.8-6.9) fewer deaths per 100\u202f000 residents per year from cardiovascular causes after Medicaid expansion than if they had followed the same trends as counties in nonexpansion states. Conclusions and Relevance: Counties in states that expanded Medicaid had a significantly smaller increase in cardiovascular mortality rates among middle-aged adults after expansion compared with counties in states that did not expand Medicaid. These findings suggest that recent Medicaid expansion was associated with lower cardiovascular mortality in middle-aged adults and may be of consideration as further expansion of Medicaid is debated.

        "Association of Optimism With Cardiovascular Events and All-Cause Mortality: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis. Importance: Optimism and pessimism can be easily measured and are potentially modifiable mindsets that may be associated with cardiovascular risk and all-cause mortality. Objective: To conduct a meta-analysis and systematic review of the association between optimism and risk for future cardiovascular events and all-cause mortality. Data Sources and Study Selection: PubMed, Scopus, and PsycINFO electronic databases were systematically searched from inception through July 2, 2019, to identify all cohort studies investigating the association between optimism and pessimism and cardiovascular events and/or all-cause mortality by using the following Medical Subject Heading terms: optimism, optimistic explanatory style, pessimism, outcomes, endpoint, mortality, death, cardiovascular events, stroke, coronary artery disease, coronary heart disease, ischemic heart disease, and cardiovascular disease. Data Extraction and Synthesis: Data were screened and extracted independently by 2 investigators (A.R. and C.B.). Adjusted effect estimates were used, and pooled analysis was performed using the Hartung-Knapp-Sidik-Jonkman random-effects model. Sensitivity and subgroup analyses were performed to assess the robustness of the findings. The Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) reporting guideline was followed. Main Outcomes and Measures: Cardiovascular events included a composite of fatal cardiovascular mortality, nonfatal myocardial infarction, stroke, and/or new-onset angina. All-cause mortality was assessed as a separate outcome. Results: The search yielded 15 studies comprising 229\u202f391 participants of which 10 studies reported data on cardiovascular events and 9 studies reported data on all-cause mortality. The mean follow-up period was 13.8 years (range, 2-40 years). On pooled analysis, optimism was significantly associated with a decreased risk of cardiovascular events (relative risk, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.51-0.78; P\u2009<\u2009.001), with high heterogeneity in the analysis (I2\u2009=\u200987.4%). Similarly, optimism was significantly associated with a lower risk of all-cause mortality (relative risk, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.80-0.92; P\u2009<\u2009.001), with moderate heterogeneity (I2\u2009=\u200973.2%). Subgroup analyses by methods for assessment, follow-up duration, sex, and adjustment for depression and other potential confounders yielded similar results. Conclusions and Relevance: The findings suggest that optimism is associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular events and all-cause mortality. Future studies should seek to better define the biobehavioral mechanisms underlying this association and evaluate the potential benefit of interventions designed to promote optimism or reduce pessimism.

        "Association Between Pharmacy Closures and Adherence to Cardiovascular Medications Among Older US Adults. Importance: It is unknown whether and how pharmacy closures alter medication adherence. Objective: To examine the association between pharmacy closures and adherence to statins, \u03b2-blockers, and oral anticoagulants among adults 50 years or older in the United States. Design, Setting, and Participants: In this retrospective cohort study, comparative interrupted time series analyses were performed using a nationally representative 5% random sample of anonymized, longitudinal, individual-level pharmacy claims from IQVIA LRx LifeLink. Analyses included all prescription claims for individuals followed up between January 1, 2011, and December 31, 2016. Separate cohorts were derived for users of statins, \u03b2-blockers, and oral anticoagulants. The differential association of pharmacy closure was examined as a function of baseline adherence, pharmacy, and individual characteristics. Main Outcomes and Measures: Difference in monthly adherence, measured as proportion of days covered, during 12-month baseline and follow-up periods among patients using a pharmacy that subsequently closed (closure cohort) compared with their counterparts (control cohort). Results: Among 3 089 803 individuals filling at least 1 statin prescription between January 1, 2011, and December 31, 2016 (mean [SD] age, 66.3 [9.3] years; 52.0% female), 3.0% (n\u2009=\u200992\u202f287) filled at a pharmacy that subsequently closed. Before closure, monthly adherence was similar in the closure and control cohorts (mean [SD], 70.5% [26.7%] vs 70.7% [26.5%]). In multivariable models, individuals filling at pharmacies that closed experienced an immediate and significant decline (on average, an absolute change of -5.90%; 95% CI, -6.12% to -5.69%) in statin adherence during the first 3 months after closure compared with their counterparts. This difference persisted over 12 months of follow-up. A similar decline in adherence was observed when examining cohorts using \u03b2-blockers (-5.71%; 95% CI, -5.96% to -5.46%) or oral anticoagulants (-5.63%; 95% CI, -6.24% to -5.01%). The mean association of pharmacy closure with adherence was greater among individuals using independent pharmacies (-7.89%; 95% CI, -8.32% to -7.47%) or living in neighborhoods with fewer pharmacies (-7.98%; 95% CI, -8.50% to -7.47%) compared with their counterparts. Conclusions and Relevance: Pharmacy closures are associated with persistent, clinically significant declines in adherence to cardiovascular medications among older adults in the United States. Efforts to reduce nonadherence to prescription medications should consider the role of pharmacy closures, especially among patients at highest risk. ",
        "Male Abortion Beneficiaries: Exploring the Long-Term Educational and Economic Associations of Abortion Among Men Who Report Teen Pregnancy. PURPOSE: The aim of the study was to determine if men who report avoiding adolescent fatherhood through a partner's use of abortion have different socioeconomic outcomes than men who report a live birth during adolescence. METHODS: We analyzed a subsample of men who reported a pregnancy before the age of 20 years that ended in either a live birth (n\u00a0= 460) or abortion (n\u00a0= 137) in the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health. We used propensity score and exact matching of baseline characteristics from Wave I of the study completed in 1994 to compare college completion and income reported in Wave IV of the study completed between 2007 and\u00a02008. RESULTS: Among men who reported a live birth, 5.8% reported graduating from college, and 32.4% had any post-high school education compared with 22.1%, and 58.5% of men who reported a pregnancy ended in abortion. In the multivariable matching analysis, men whose adolescent pregnancies ended in abortion had an increased probability of graduating from college (average treatment effect\u00a0= 8.6; p < .01) and completing any post-high school education in the treatment group (average treatment effect of the treated\u00a0= 16.5; p < .001) than men whose adolescent pregnancies ended in live birth. We found a positive association between abortion and personal income only compared to men who did not reside with their child born during adolescence. CONCLUSION: Women's use of abortion services were associated with educational benefits for men who report teen pregnancies. ",
        "Early-Life Environmental Exposures and Blood Pressure in Children. BACKGROUND: Growing evidence exists about the fetal and environmental origins of hypertension, but mainly limited to single-exposure studies. The exposome has been proposed as a more holistic approach by studying many exposures simultaneously. OBJECTIVES: This study aims to evaluate the association between a wide range of prenatal and postnatal exposures and blood pressure (BP) in children. METHODS: Systolic and diastolic BP were measured among 1,277 children from the European HELIX (Human Early-Life Exposome) cohort aged 6 to 11 years. Prenatal (n\u00a0=\u00a089) and postnatal (n\u00a0=\u00a0128) exposures include air pollution, built environment, meteorology, natural spaces, traffic, noise, chemicals, and lifestyles. Two methods adjusted for confounders were applied: an exposome-wide association study considering the exposures independently, and the deletion-substitution-addition algorithm considering all the exposures simultaneously. RESULTS: Decreases in systolic BP were observed with facility density (\u03b2 change for an interquartile-range increase in exposure: -1.7\u00a0mm\u00a0Hg [95% confidence interval (CI):\u00a0-2.5 to\u00a0-0.8\u00a0mm\u00a0Hg]), maternal concentrations of polychlorinated biphenyl 118 (-1.4\u00a0mm\u00a0Hg [95%\u00a0CI:\u00a0-2.6 to\u00a0-0.2\u00a0mm\u00a0Hg]) and child concentrations of dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE:\u00a0-1.6\u00a0mm\u00a0Hg [95%\u00a0CI:\u00a0-2.4 to\u00a0-0.7\u00a0mm\u00a0Hg]), hexachlorobenzene (-1.5\u00a0mm\u00a0Hg [95%\u00a0CI:\u00a0-2.4 to\u00a0-0.6\u00a0mm\u00a0Hg]), and mono-benzyl phthalate (-0.7\u00a0mm\u00a0Hg [95%\u00a0CI:\u00a0-1.3 to\u00a0-0.1\u00a0mm\u00a0Hg]), whereas increases in systolic BP were observed with outdoor temperature during pregnancy (1.6\u00a0mm\u00a0Hg [95%\u00a0CI: 0.2 to 2.9\u00a0mm\u00a0Hg]), high fish intake during pregnancy (2.0\u00a0mm\u00a0Hg [95%\u00a0CI: 0.4 to 3.5\u00a0mm\u00a0Hg]), maternal cotinine concentrations (1.2\u00a0mm\u00a0Hg [95%\u00a0CI: -0.3 to 2.8\u00a0mm\u00a0Hg]), and child perfluorooctanoate concentrations (0.9\u00a0mm\u00a0Hg [95%\u00a0CI: 0.1 to 1.6\u00a0mm\u00a0Hg]). Decreases in diastolic BP were observed with outdoor temperature at examination (-1.4\u00a0mm\u00a0Hg [95%\u00a0CI:\u00a0-2.3 to\u00a0-0.5\u00a0mm\u00a0Hg]) and child DDE concentrations (-1.1\u00a0mm\u00a0Hg [95%\u00a0CI:\u00a0-1.9 to\u00a0-0.3\u00a0mm\u00a0Hg]), whereas increases in diastolic BP were observed with maternal bisphenol-A concentrations (0.7\u00a0mm\u00a0Hg [95%\u00a0CI: 0.1 to 1.4\u00a0mm\u00a0Hg]), high fish intake during pregnancy (1.2\u00a0mm\u00a0Hg [95%\u00a0CI:\u00a0-0.2 to 2.7\u00a0mm\u00a0Hg]), and child copper concentrations (0.9\u00a0mm\u00a0Hg [95%\u00a0CI: 0.3 to 1.6\u00a0mm\u00a0Hg]). CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that early-life exposure to several chemicals, as well as built environment and meteorological factors, may affect BP in children. ",
        "Early-life exposome and lung function in children in Europe: an analysis of data from the longitudinal, population-based HELIX cohort. BACKGROUND: Several single-exposure studies have documented possible effects of environmental factors on lung function, but none has relied on an exposome approach. We aimed to evaluate the association between a broad range of prenatal and postnatal lifestyle and environmental exposures and lung function in children. METHODS: In this analysis, we used data from 1033 mother-child pairs from the European Human Early-Life Exposome (HELIX) cohort (consisting of six existing longitudinal birth cohorts in France, Greece, Lithuania, Norway, Spain, and the UK of children born between 2003 and 2009) for whom a valid spirometry test was recorded for the child. 85 prenatal and 125 postnatal exposures relating to outdoor, indoor, chemical, and lifestyle factors were assessed, and lung function was measured by spirometry in children at age 6-12 years. Two agnostic linear regression methods, a deletion-substitution-addition (DSA) algorithm considering all exposures simultaneously, and an exposome-wide association study (ExWAS) considering exposures independently, were applied to test the association with forced expiratory volume in 1 s percent predicted values (FEV1%). We tested for two-way interaction between exposures and corrected for confounding by co-exposures. FINDINGS: In the 1033 children (median age 8\u00b71 years, IQR 6\u00b75-9\u00b70), mean FEV1% was 98\u00b78% (SD 13\u00b72). In the ExWAS, prenatal perfluorononanoate (p=0\u00b7034) and perfluorooctanoate (p=0\u00b7030) exposures were associated with lower FEV1%, and inverse distance to nearest road during pregnancy (p=0\u00b7030) was associated with higher FEV1%. Nine postnatal exposures were associated with lower FEV1%: copper (p=0\u00b7041), ethyl-paraben (p=0\u00b7029), five phthalate metabolites (mono-2-ethyl 5-carboxypentyl phthalate [p=0\u00b7016], mono-2-ethyl-5-hydroxyhexyl phthalate [p=0\u00b7023], mono-2-ethyl-5-oxohexyl phthalate [p=0\u00b70085], mono-4-methyl-7-oxooctyl phthalate [p=0\u00b7040], and the sum of di-ethylhexyl phthalate metabolites [p=0\u00b7014]), house crowding (p=0\u00b7015), and facility density around schools (p=0\u00b7027). However, no exposure passed the significance threshold when corrected for multiple testing in ExWAS, and none was selected with the DSA algorithm, including when testing for exposure interactions. INTERPRETATION: Our systematic exposome approach identified several environmental exposures, mainly chemicals, that might be associated with lung function. Reducing exposure to these ubiquitous chemicals could help to prevent the development of chronic respiratory disease. FUNDING: European Community's Seventh Framework Programme (HELIX project). ",
        "Childhood Tobacco Smoke Exposure and Risk of Atrial Fibrillation in Adulthood. BACKGROUND: Cigarette smoking is known to increase the risk of atrial fibrillation (AF), and a recent cross-sectional analysis suggested that parental smoking may be an AF risk factor. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to assess if parental smoking predicts offspring AF in the Framingham Heart Study. METHODS: This study analyzed Framingham Offspring cohort participants with parents in the Original cohort with known smoking status during the offspring's childhood. Framingham participants were evaluated every 2 to 8 years and were under routine surveillance for incident AF. The authors assessed AF incidence among Offspring participants exposed to parental smoking through age 18 years and performed a mediation analysis to determine the extent to which offspring smoking might explain observed associations. RESULTS: Of 2,816 Offspring cohort participants with at least 1 parent in the Original cohort, 82% were exposed to parental smoking. For every pack/day increase in parental smoking, there was an 18% increase in offspring AF incidence (adjusted hazard ratio [HR]: 1.18; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.00 to 1.39; p\u00a0=\u00a00.04). Additionally, parental smoking was a risk factor for offspring smoking (adjusted odds ratio [OR]: 1.34; 95%\u00a0CI: 1.17 to 1.54; p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Offspring smoking mediated 17% (95%\u00a0CI: 1.5% to 103.3%) of the relationship between parental smoking and offspring AF. CONCLUSIONS: Childhood secondhand smoke exposure predicted increased risk for adulthood AF after adjustment for AF risk factors. Some of this relationship may be mediated by a greater propensity among offspring of smoking parents to\u00a0smoke themselves. These findings highlight potential new pathways for AF risk that begin during childhood, offering\u00a0new evidence to motivate smoking avoidance and cessation. ",
        "Added Sugars Intake among US Infants and Toddlers. BACKGROUND: Limited information is available on added sugars consumption in US infants and toddlers. OBJECTIVES: To present national estimates of added sugars intake among US infants and toddlers by sociodemographic characteristics, to identify top sources of added sugars, and to examine trends in added sugars intake. DESIGN: Cross-sectional analysis of 1 day of 24-hour dietary recall data. PARTICIPANTS/SETTING: A nationally representative sample of US infants aged 0 to 11 months and toddlers aged 12 to 23 months (n=1,211) during the period from 2011 through 2016 from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Trends were assessed from 2005-2006 through 2015-2016 (n=2,795). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Among infants and toddlers, the proportion consuming any added sugars, the average amount of added sugars consumed, percent of total energy from added sugars, and top sources of added sugars intake. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Paired t tests were used to compare differences by age, sex, race/Hispanic origin, family income level, and head of household education level. Trends were tested using orthogonal polynomials. Significance was set at P<0.05. RESULTS: During 2011 to 2016, 84.4% of infants and toddlers consumed added sugars on a given day. A greater proportion of toddlers (98.3%) consumed added sugars than infants (60.6%). The mean amount of added sugars toddlers consumed was also more compared with infants (5.8 vs 0.9 tsp). Non-Hispanic black toddlers (8.2 tsp) consumed more added sugars than non-Hispanic Asian (3.7 tsp), non-Hispanic white (5.3 tsp), and Hispanic (5.9 tsp) toddlers. A similar pattern was observed for percent energy from added sugars. For infants, top sources of added sugars were yogurt, baby food snacks/sweets, and sweet bakery products; top sources among toddlers were fruit drinks, sugars/sweets, and sweet bakery products. The mean amount of added sugars decreased from 2005-2006 through 2015-2016 for both age groups; however, percent energy from added sugars only decreased among infants. CONCLUSION: Added sugars intake was observed among infants/toddlers and varied by age and race and Hispanic origin. Added sugars intake, as a percent of energy, decreased only among infants from 2005 to\u00a02016. ",
        "Barriers to the Implementation of State Concussion Laws Within High Schools. PURPOSE: All 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia enacted concussion laws between 2009 and 2014 to mitigate the consequences of concussion among children and adolescents. In response, many high schools started to implement their respective state law that includes three main tenets: (1) concussion education, (2) removal from play, and (3) return-to-play. We aimed to identify barriers to the implementation of these tenets at the school level. METHODS: We conducted 64 semistructured telephone interviews with high school athletic trainers from 26 states and the District of Columbia whose school participated in High School Reporting Information Online during the 2014-2015 and 2015-2016 academic years. Data were analyzed using thematic analysis. RESULTS: All 64 high schools employed at least one athletic trainer, and most schools were public schools (90.6%). Implementation barriers to the concussion education tenet were (1) lack of quality education, (2) lack of buy-in to educational requirements, and (3) lack of time for and attendance at educational meetings. Implementation barriers to the removal from play tenet included (1) athletes underreporting concussion symptoms, (2) lack of communication, (3) resistance from parents and coaches, and (4) sport culture and \"old school\" mentality. Finally, (1) cost of and access to medical care, (2) resistance from stakeholders, and (3) lack of understanding of concussion were identified as implementation barriers to the return-to-play tenet. CONCLUSIONS: Identification of implementation barriers is key to the successful execution and application of state concussion laws at the school level. Future research should identify strategies to reduce these barriers. ",
        "Physician Ordering of Screening Ultrasound: National Rates and Association With State-Level Breast Density Reporting Laws. PURPOSE: To describe factors associated with screening ultrasound ordering and determine whether adoption of state-level breast density reporting laws was associated with changes in ordering rates. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a cohort study using National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey data for 2007 to 2015. We included preventive office visits for women aged 40 to 74 years without breast symptoms and signs or additional reasons requiring ultrasound ordering. Multivariate logistic regression was used to identify changes in ultrasound ordering rates pre- versus post-state-level density reporting laws, accounting for patient-, physician-, and practice-level characteristics. Analyses were weighted to account for the multistage probability sampling design of National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey. RESULTS: Our sample included 12,787 visits over the 9-year study period. Overall, 28.9% (3,370 of 12,787) of women underwent a breast examination and 22.1% (2,442 of 12,787) had a screening mammogram ordered. Only 3.3% (379 of 12,787) had screening ultrasound ordered. Screening ultrasounds were ordered more frequently for younger women (rate ratio [RR] 0.8 per 10-year increase in age, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.6-0.9, P\u00a0= .003) and at urban practices (RR 2.3, 95% CI: 1.1-5.0, P\u00a0= .028), and less frequently in practices with computer reminders for ordering screening tests (RR 0.6, 95% CI: 0.3-0.9, P\u00a0= .024). In multivariate analyses, the rate of ultrasound ordering did not change after adoption of density notification laws (RR 0.7, 95% CI: 0.3-2.0, P\u00a0= .57). CONCLUSION: The rate of screening ultrasound ordering remains low over time. There was no observed association between adoption of state-level density reporting laws and overall changes in ultrasound ordering. ",
        "Evidence-based clinical practice guideline on antibiotic use for the urgent management of pulpal- and periapical-related dental pain and intraoral swelling: A report from the American Dental Association. BACKGROUND: An expert panel convened by the American Dental Association Council on Scientific Affairs and the Center for Evidence-Based Dentistry conducted a systematic review and formulated clinical recommendations for the urgent management of symptomatic irreversible pulpitis with or without symptomatic apical periodontitis, pulp necrosis and symptomatic apical periodontitis, or pulp necrosis and localized acute apical abscess using antibiotics, either alone or as adjuncts to definitive, conservative dental treatment (DCDT) in immunocompetent adults. TYPES OF STUDIES REVIEWED: The authors conducted a search of the literature in MEDLINE, Embase, the Cochrane Library, and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature to retrieve evidence on benefits and harms associated with antibiotic use. The authors used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach to assess the certainty in the evidence and the Evidence-to-Decision framework. RESULTS: The panel formulated 5 clinical recommendations and 2 good practice statements, each specific to the target conditions, for settings in which DCDT is and is not immediately available. With likely negligible benefits and potentially large harms, the panel recommended against using antibiotics in most clinical scenarios, irrespective of DCDT availability. They\u00a0recommended antibiotics in patients with systemic involvement (for example, malaise or fever) due to the dental conditions or when the risk of experiencing progression to systemic involvement is high. CONCLUSION AND PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: Evidence suggests that antibiotics for the target conditions may provide negligible benefits and probably contribute to large harms. The expert panel suggests that antibiotics for target conditions be used only when systemic involvement is present and that immediate DCDT should be prioritized in all cases. ",
        "Greater social jetlag associates with higher HbA1c in adults with type 2 diabetes: a cross sectional study. BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Later chronotype has been associated with poorer glycemic control in type 2 diabetes. It is unclear whether this is a direct relationship, or if personality factors or social jetlag ([SJL], ie, chronic circadian misalignment reflecting the discrepancy between the entrained phase of the circadian clock and socially-determined behavioural cycles) play a role. This study aimed to determine the relationships among chronotype, SJL, personality factors and glycemic control in type 2 diabetes, independently of sleep disturbances and daily caloric distribution. METHODS: In sum, 252 type 2 diabetes patients attending an annual review outpatients' clinic completed questionnaires, including the Munich Chronotype Questionnaire to assess chronotype and SJL, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality index (PSQI), the Big Five Personality Inventory and the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale. Chart review provided information on diabetes duration, Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), body mass index (BMI) and other clinical variables. Caloric intake was assessed via 24-h dietary recall. RESULTS: Hierarchical linear regression revealed that SJL, but not chronotype or personality factors, was a significant predictor of HbA1c levels (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a00.16, p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). There was a significant relationship between later chronotype and HbA1c levels, but only in patients who had more than 90\u00a0min SJL (r\u00a0=\u00a00.51, p\u00a0=\u00a00.002). Younger age was associated with a higher HbA1c (r\u00a0=\u00a0-0.23, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), and this effect was partially mediated through SJL (Pm\u00a0=\u00a00.22). CONCLUSIONS: We identify SJL as a novel factor that may impact on glycemic control in type 2 diabetes. Further study is needed to determine whether interventions aimed at reducing SJL may lead to improvements in glycemic control. ",
        "Changes in Dietary Intake of Animal and Vegetable Protein and Unhealthy Aging. BACKGROUND: Animal and vegetable-based proteins differ on their effect on many health outcomes, but their relationship with unhealthy aging is uncertain. Thus, we examined the association between changes in animal and vegetable protein intake and unhealthy aging in older adults. METHODS: Data came from 1951 individuals aged \u226560 years recruited in the Seniors-ENRICA cohort in 2008-2010 (wave 0) and followed-up in 2012 (wave 1), 2015 (wave 2), and 2017 (wave 3). Dietary protein intake was measured with a validated diet history at waves 0 and 1, and unhealthy aging was measured with a 52-item health deficit accumulation index at each wave. RESULTS: Compared with participants with a >2% decrease in energy intake from vegetable protein from wave 0 to wave 1, those with a >2% increase showed less deficit accumulation over 3.2 years (multivariable \u03b2 [95% confidence interval (CI)]: -1.05 [-2.03, -0.06]), 6 years (-1.28 [-2.51, -0.03]), and 8.2 years of follow-up (-1.68 [-3.27, -0.09]). No associations were found for animal protein. Less deficit accumulation over 8.2 years was observed when substituting 1% of energy from vegetable protein for an equal amount of carbohydrate or fat (-0.50 [-0.93, -0.07]), animal protein (-0.44 [-0.81, -0.07]), dairy protein (-0.51 [-0.91, -0.12]), or meat protein (-0.44 [-0.84, -0.04]). CONCLUSIONS: Increasing dietary intake of vegetable protein may delay unhealthy aging when replacing carbohydrates, fats, or animal protein, especially from meat and dairy. ",
        "Ultra-Processed Diets Cause Excess Calorie Intake and Weight Gain: An Inpatient Randomized Controlled Trial of Ad Libitum Food Intake. We investigated whether ultra-processed foods affect energy intake in 20 weight-stable adults, aged (mean\u00a0\u00b1 SE) 31.2\u00a0\u00b1 1.6 years and BMI\u00a0= 27\u00a0\u00b1 1.5\u00a0kg/m2. Subjects were admitted to the NIH Clinical Center and randomized to receive either ultra-processed or unprocessed diets for 2\u00a0weeks immediately followed by the alternate diet for 2\u00a0weeks. Meals were designed to be matched for presented calories, energy density, macronutrients, sugar, sodium, and fiber. Subjects were instructed to consume as much or as little as desired. Energy intake was greater during the ultra-processed diet (508\u00a0\u00b1 106\u00a0kcal/day; p\u00a0= 0.0001), with increased consumption of carbohydrate (280\u00a0\u00b1 54\u00a0kcal/day; p\u00a0< 0.0001) and fat (230\u00a0\u00b1 53\u00a0kcal/day; p\u00a0= 0.0004), but not protein (-2\u00a0\u00b1 12\u00a0kcal/day; p\u00a0= 0.85). Weight changes were highly correlated with energy intake (r\u00a0= 0.8, p\u00a0< 0.0001), with participants gaining 0.9\u00a0\u00b1 0.3\u00a0kg (p\u00a0= 0.009) during the ultra-processed diet and losing 0.9\u00a0\u00b1 0.3\u00a0kg (p\u00a0= 0.007) during the unprocessed diet. Limiting consumption of ultra-processed foods may be an effective strategy for obesity prevention and treatment. ",
        "Emotions and decision rightness over five years following an abortion: An examination of decision difficulty and abortion stigma. BACKGROUND: Despite weak theoretical grounding and ample research indicating women feel high levels of decision rightness and relief post-abortion, claims that abortion is inherently stressful and causes emergent negative emotions and regret undergirds state-level laws regulating abortion in the United States. Nonetheless, scholarship does identify factors that put a woman at risk for short-term negative postabortion emotions-including decision difficulty and perceiving abortion stigma in one's community-pointing to a possible mechanism behind later emergent or persistent post-abortion negative emotions. METHODS: Using five years of longitudinal data, collected one week post-abortion and semi-annually for five years from women who sought abortions at 30 US facilities between 2008 and 2010, we examined women's emotions and feeling that abortion was the right decision over five years (n=667). We used mixed effects regression models to examine changes in emotions and abortion decision rightness over time by decision difficulty and perceived community abortion stigma. RESULTS: We found no evidence of emerging negative emotions or abortion decision regret; both positive and negative emotions declined over the first two years and plateaued thereafter, and decision rightness remained high and steady (predicted percent: 97.5% at baseline, 99.0% at five years). At five years postabortion, relief remained the most commonly felt emotion among all women (predicted mean on 0-4 scale: 1.0; 0.6 for sadness and guilt; 0.4 for regret, anger and happiness). Despite converging levels of emotions by decision difficulty and stigma level over time, these two factors remained most important for predicting negative emotions and decision non-rightness years later. CONCLUSIONS: These results add to the scientific evidence that emotions about an abortion are associated with personal and social context, and are not a product of the abortion procedure itself. Findings challenge the rationale for policies regulating access to abortion that are premised on emotional harm claims. ",
        "Recreational cannabis use impairs driving performance in the absence of acute intoxication. BACKGROUND: Across the nation, growing numbers of individuals are exploring the use of cannabis for medical or recreational purposes, and the proportion of cannabis-positive drivers involved in fatal crashes increased from 8 percent in 2013 to 17 percent in 2014, raising concerns about the impact of cannabis use on driving. Previous studies have demonstrated that cannabis use is associated with impaired driving performance, but thus far, research has primarily focused on the effects of acute intoxication. METHODS: The current study assessed the potential impact of cannabis use on driving performance using a customized driving simulator in non-intoxicated, heavy, recreational cannabis users and healthy controls (HCs) without a history of cannabis use. RESULTS: Overall, cannabis users demonstrated impaired driving relative to HC participants with increased accidents, speed, and lateral movement, and reduced rule-following. Interestingly, however, when cannabis users were divided into groups based on age of onset of regular cannabis use, significant driving impairment was detected and completely localized to those with early onset (onset before age 16) relative to the late onset group (onset \u226516 years old). Further, covariate analyses suggest that impulsivity had a significant impact on performance differences. CONCLUSIONS: Chronic, heavy, recreational cannabis use was associated with worse driving performance in non-intoxicated drivers, and earlier onset of use was associated with greater impairment. These results may be related to other factors associated with early exposure such as increased impulsivity. ",
        "Electronic Consultations in Allergy/Immunology. BACKGROUND: Allergic condition management more often requires allergist guidance than allergy testing; necessary testing may be unavailable at initial drug allergy consultations. Electronic consultations (e-consults) provide expedited, problem-focused, potentially cost-saving care in other medical specialties, but have not yet been studied in Allergy/Immunology. OBJECTIVE: To describe e-consult use at an academic allergy/immunology practice. METHODS: E-consult data (August 10, 2016 through July 31, 2018) and in-person consult data (August 1, 2014 through July 31, 2018) were reviewed to determine consult volume, outcomes, indications, and timing. Referral reasons and wait times were compared with chi-square tests. RESULTS: E-consults grew from 1% to 10% of all new consults, with concurrent growth in in-person consults. Of 306 completed e-consults, 41 (13.4%) made diagnostic, therapeutic, or alternative referral recommendations, with 30 (73%) recommendations followed; 183 (59.8%) patients required an in-person Allergy/Immunology consult, and only 5 (<2%) patients saw an allergist without an e-consult recommendation to do so. E-consults were used more often than in-person consults for adverse drug reactions (66% vs 9%; P < .001), especially penicillin allergy (132, 61% of all e-consults) and immunodeficiency (15% vs 2%; P < .001). Allergists completed e-consults in a median of 11 minutes, with a median turnaround time of 22 hours. E-consult implementation was associated with a decreased median in-person consult wait time (1.5 fewer calendar days; P < .05). CONCLUSIONS: E-consults were increasingly used, particularly for historical adverse drug reactions and immunodeficiency. Implementation of an e-consult program resulted in decreased in-person wait times despite an increase in overall consult volume, supporting this model's ability to provide expedited, problem-focused care.

        "Surveillance or Safekeeping? How School Security Officer and Camera Presence Influence Students' Perceptions of Safety, Equity, and Support. PURPOSE: Target hardening, or increasing the use of security measures, is a frequently used response to perceived safety concerns in schools. Studies are mixed as to their effectiveness on students' perceptions of safety and little is known about their influence on other aspects of school climate, particularly for minority students. This study will examine the association between observed security measures in secondary schools and students' perceptions of safety, equity, and support. METHODS: School climate surveys were completed by 54,350 students from 98 middle and high schools across the state of Maryland beginning in Spring 2014. Concurrent observations of the school physical environment, including security measures (i.e., officers and cameras), were conducted by trained outside assessors. Multilevel regression analyses examined the association between school security officers and cameras and students' perceptions of safety, equity, and support, while controlling for school and neighborhood characteristics. Cross-level interactions explored differential effects of security measures for Black students. RESULTS: Greater use of security cameras inside the school was related to lower perceptions of safety, equity, and support. A moderate level of security camera use outside the school was related to higher student perceptions of support. Security officer presence was associated with higher perceptions of safety. For black students, cameras were associated with elevated perceptions of safety and support relative to white students. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings may suggest that outside cameras and security may be perceived by students as safekeeping, whereas inside cameras may evoke feelings of being viewed as potential perpetrators who need surveillance.

        "Shoe design for older adults: Evidence from a systematic review on the elements of optimal footwear. Due to changes in foot morphology and the occurrence of foot deformities and foot pain with ageing, older people frequently wear ill-fitting shoes. This can lead to discomfort and reduced mobility. A review of the literature was performed in Medline, Scopus and Embase with three aims: (a) to evaluate the effects of shoes or shoe elements on the comfort and mobility of older adults, (b) to summarise the evidence-based elements of a safe and comfortable shoe for older adults, and (c) from that, to compile those elements into design recommendations for a safe and comfortable shoe for older adults. Safe elements of footwear include proper anatomical fit, a well-fitting toe box, limited heel height, a broad enough heel, a firm insole and midsole, an outsole with sufficient tread, bevelled heel, firm heel counter with snug fit, and an easy and effective closing mechanism. We conclude that there is a need for shoe design specifically aimed at the foot morphology and demands of older people. The shoe market should increase the availability of well-fitting shoes designed for the older foot and person. ",
        "Capturing Real-Time Emergency Department Sentiment: A Feasibility Study Using Touch-Button Terminals. STUDY OBJECTIVE: Providing care in emergency departments (EDs) affects patients and providers. Providers experience high rates of work-related stress. Little is known about the feasibility of measuring real-time sentiment within busy clinical environments. We test the feasibility of measuring sentiment with touch-button terminals in an academic, urban ED. METHODS: Terminals offered a choice of 4 sentiment buttons (very positive, positive, negative, and very negative). They were placed central to physician workstations, nursing workstations, and the patient exit. Pearson correlation coefficients (r) were calculated to estimate correlation between sentiment and volume metrics (arrivals, length of stay, waiting patients, and number of boarding patients) over time. RESULTS: A total of 13,849 sentiments were recorded (June 2018 to October 2018); 9,472 came from providers (52.6% nursing) and 4,377 from patients. The majority of provider sentiments were negative (58.7%). Negative provider sentiment was associated with increasing number of patients waiting to be seen (r=0.45) and boarding (r=0.68). Positive provider sentiment was associated with increasing numbers of patients who left without being seen (r=0.48). Increased boarding was associated with more recorded sentiments (r=0.73). Negative patient sentiment was associated with increasing number waiting (r=0.55), boarding (r=0.67), and leaving without being seen (r=0.46). CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates the feasibility of a novel approach to measuring \"on-shift\" sentiment in real time and provides a sample comparison to traditional volume metrics. ",
        "Safety of Influenza Vaccination Administered During Hospitalization. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether influenza vaccination during hospitalization increases health care utilization, fever, and infection evaluations postdischarge. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This retrospective cohort study conducted at Kaiser Permanente Southern California included patients aged 6 months or older hospitalized in a Kaiser Permanente Southern California facility with admission and discharge dates between September 1 and March 31 of the following calendar year, from 2011 to 2014. All influenza vaccinations administered during the period of August 1 to April 30 for influenza seasons 2011-2012, 2012-2013, and 2013-2014 were identified. We compared the risk of outcomes of interest between those who received influenza vaccination during their hospitalization vs those who were never vaccinated that season or were vaccinated at other times using propensity score analyses with inverse probability of treatment weighting. Outcomes of interest included rates of outpatient and emergency department visits, readmissions, fever, and clinical laboratory evaluations for infection (urine, blood, and wound culture; complete blood cell count) in the 7 days following discharge. RESULTS: We included in the study 290,149 hospitalizations among 255,737 patients. In adjusted analyses, we found no increased risk of readmissions (relative risk [RR], 0.88; 95% CI, 0.83-0.95), outpatient visits (RR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.95-0.99), fever (RR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.68-0.93), and clinical evaluations for infection (RR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.92-0.98) among those vaccinated during hospitalization compared with those who were never vaccinated or were vaccinated at other times. CONCLUSION: Our findings provide reassurance about the safety of influenza vaccination during hospitalization. Every contact with a health care professional, including during a hospitalization, is an opportunity to vaccinate. ",
        "Financial Stress and Risk of Coronary Heart Disease in the Jackson Heart Study. INTRODUCTION: Financial hardship is associated with coronary heart disease risk factors, and may disproportionately affect some African American groups. This study examines whether stress because of financial hardship is associated with incident coronary heart disease in African Americans. METHODS: The Jackson Heart Study is a longitudinal cohort study of cardiovascular disease risks in African Americans in the Jackson, Mississippi metropolitan statistical area. Participant enrollment began in 2000. Analyses were performed in 2017 and included adjudicated endpoints through December 2012. Financial stress was assessed from the Jackson Heart Study Weekly Stress Inventory and categorized into four levels: (1) did not experience financial stress, (2) no stress, (3) mild stress, and (4) moderate to high stress. Incident coronary heart disease was defined as the first event of definite or probable myocardial infarction, definite fatal myocardial infarction, definite fatal coronary heart disease, or cardiac procedure. There were 2,256 individuals in this analysis. RESULTS: Participants with moderate to high (versus no) financial stress were more likely to have incident coronary heart disease events after controlling for demographics, SES, access to care, and traditional clinical risk factors (hazard ratio=2.42, 95% CI=1.13, 5.17). The association between financial stress and coronary heart disease was no longer statistically significant in a model adjusting for three specific risk factors: depression, smoking status, and diabetes (hazard ratio=1.99, 95% CI=0.91, 4.39). CONCLUSIONS: Financial stress may be an unrecognized risk factor for coronary heart disease for African Americans. Additional research should examine these associations in intervention studies that address perceived stress, in addition to other coronary heart disease risk factors, in patients experiencing financial stress.

        "Review of current evidence and clinical recommendations on the effects of low-carbohydrate and very-low-carbohydrate (including ketogenic) diets for the management of body weight and other cardiometabolic risk factors: A scientific statement from the National Lipid Association Nutrition and Lifestyle Task Force. Historically, low-carbohydrate (CHO) and very-low-CHO diets have been used for weight loss. Recently, these diets have been promoted for type 2 diabetes (T2D) management. This scientific statement provides a comprehensive review of the current evidence base available from recent systematic reviews and meta-analyses on the effects of low-CHO and very-low-CHO diets on body weight, lipoprotein lipids, glycemic control, and other cardiometabolic risk factors. In addition, evidence on emerging risk factors and potential safety concerns of low-CHO and very-low-CHO diets, especially for high-risk individuals, such as those with genetic lipid disorders, was reviewed. Based on the evidence reviewed, low-CHO and very-low-CHO diets are not superior to other dietary approaches for weight loss. These diets may have advantages related to appetite control, triglyceride reduction, and reduction in the use of medication in T2D management. The evidence reviewed showed mixed effects on low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels with some studies showing an increase. There was no clear evidence for advantages regarding effects on other cardiometabolic risk markers. Minimal data are available regarding long-term (>2\u00a0years) efficacy and safety. Clinicians are encouraged to consider the evidence discussed in this scientific statement when counseling patients on the use of low-CHO and very-low-CHO diets. ",
        "Effect of Sedentary Lifestyle on Cardiovascular Disease Risk Among Healthy Adults With Body Mass Indexes 18.5 to 29.9 kg/m2. A substantial proportion of adults at healthy body mass index (BMI) are potentially at high risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD). The objective of this study is to determine if sedentary lifestyle characteristics in healthy weight adults increase their likelihood of being at high CVD risk to that of individuals who are overweight. Adults aged 40 to 79 years in the 2011 to 2016 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey at a healthy BMI (18.5 to 24.9) and overweight BMI (25 to 29.9; unweighted n\u202f=\u202f4,572; weighted n\u202f=\u202f43,919,354) were analyzed. The American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association atherosclerotic CVD risk score was used to assess CVD risk. For individuals with a BMI 18.5 to 24.9, 29.6% had increased risk of a CVD event. In logistic regressions adjusted for age, race, gender, education, poverty/income ratio, insurance status, and number of visits to a healthcare provider in the past year, individuals with unhealthy sagittal abdominal diameter (odds ratio [OR] 2.44; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.97 to 6.14), shortness of breath upon exertion (OR 1.35; 95% CI, 0.65 to 2.79), unhealthy waist circumference (OR 0.99; 95% CI, 0.60 to 1.61), and less than recommended levels of physical activity (OR 0.73; 95% CI, 0.43 to 1.23) were not significantly different than overweight adults in being at high risk for CVD events. Individuals with healthy characteristics and a BMI 18.5 to 24.9 were significantly less likely than overweight adults to be at high risk for CVD. In conclusion, the findings suggest that in individuals at a BMI 18.5 to 24.9, characteristics of a sedentary lifestyle increase the likelihood of being at high risk for CVD to that of overweight individuals.

        "Frequency of Sexual Activity and Long-term Survival after Acute Myocardial Infarction. BACKGROUND: Previous studies have shown an inverse relationship between sexual activity and mortality in the general population. We evaluated the association between sexual activity and long-term survival among patients with acute myocardial infarction. METHODS: Patients aged \u226465 years (n=1120; mean age, 53) discharged from 8 hospitals in central Israel after first myocardial infarction from 1992-1993 were followed for mortality through 2015. Frequency of sexual activity was self-reported during the index hospitalization (baseline; referring to the year preceding the infarct) and after 5 and 10-13 years, along with sociodemographic and clinical data. Cox proportional hazards models were constructed to estimate the association with all-cause mortality in time-dependent sexual activity categories. RESULTS: At baseline, a > once per week frequency of sexual activity was reported by 42% of the patients, whereas no sexual activity was reported by 6%. After 10-13 years, the rates were 21% and 27%, respectively. Lower sexual activity was associated with older age, female sex, lack of a steady partner and more comorbidities. During follow-up, 524 deaths (47%) occurred. An inverse relationship was observed between sexual activity frequency and death, with hazard ratios (95% confidence intervals) of 0.30 (0.23-0.38) for > once per week, 0.36 (0.28-0.46) for once per week, and 0.53 (0.42-0.66) for < once per week, compared with none. After adjusting for relevant confounding factors, the estimates were attenuated to 0.68 (0.50-0.91), 0.63 (0.48-0.83), and 0.72 (0.57-0.93), respectively (P for trend = .004). CONCLUSIONS: Using repeated assessments of sexual activity after myocardial infarction, an inverse association was demonstrated with mortality, which was only partly accounted for by measured potential confounders.

        "Confusion Instead of Clarity: Publicly Reported Cardiac Surgery Ratings for Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting and Aortic Valve Replacement. BACKGROUND: Public reporting of cardiac surgery ratings has been advocated to inform patient selection of hospitals. Although Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) ratings are based on audited risk-adjusted patient outcomes, other rating systems rely on administrative databases. In this study, we evaluate correlation among 4 widely used hospital rating systems for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and aortic valve replacement (AVR). STUDY DESIGN: We identified an initial cohort of 602 hospitals from US News & World Report's (USN) listing of the 2016-2017 \"Best Hospitals for Cardiology & Heart Surgery.\" From this cohort, current publicly available CABG and AVR ratings were collected from the STS, USN, Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, and Healthgrades. All 4 rating systems rated hospitals as high, average, or below average performers for each procedure. We then determined the match rate between rating systems for individual hospitals and assessed interrater reliability with Cohen's \u03ba. RESULTS: Rating systems had different distributions of high and low performing ratings assigned. USN rated hospitals as high performing for both CABG and AVR more frequently compared with STS, Healthgrades, and Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. For CABG, the match rate between systems varied from 50% to 85%, with the best match between STS and Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. Similarly for AVR, the match rate varied from 50% to 73%, with the best match between STS and Healthgrades. Interrater reliability was poor among the 4 rating systems (\u03ba < 0.2) and consistent with no agreement for CABG and AVR ratings. CONCLUSIONS: Publicly reported cardiac surgery ratings have significant discrepancy and poor correlation. This might confuse instead of clarify public perception of hospital quality for cardiac surgery. ",
        "Dynamics of the HIV outbreak and response in Scott County, IN, USA, 2011-15: a modelling study. BACKGROUND: In November, 2014, a cluster of HIV infections was detected among people who inject drugs in Scott County, IN, USA, with 215 HIV infections eventually attributed to the outbreak. This study examines whether earlier implementation of a public health response could have reduced the scale of the outbreak. METHODS: In this modelling study, we derived weekly case data from the HIV outbreak in Scott County, IN, and on the uptake of HIV testing, treatment, and prevention services from publicly available reports from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and researchers from Indiana. Our primary objective was to determine if an earlier response to the outbreak could have had an effect on the number of people infected. We computed upper and lower bounds for cumulative HIV incidence by digitally extracting data from published images from a CDC study using Bio-Rad avidity incidence testing to estimate the recency of each transmission event. We constructed a generalisation of the susceptible-infectious-removed model to capture the transmission dynamics of the HIV outbreak. We computed non-parametric interval estimates of the number of individuals with an undiagnosed HIV infection, the case-finding rate per undiagnosed HIV infection, and model-based bounds for the HIV transmission rate throughout the epidemic. We used these models to assess the potential effect if the same intervention had begun at two key timepoints earlier than the actual date of the initiation of efforts to control the outbreak. FINDINGS: The upper bound for undiagnosed HIV infections in Scott County peaked at 126 around Jan 10, 2015, over 2 months before the Governor of Indiana declared a public health emergency on March 26, 2015. Applying the observed case-finding rate scale-up to earlier intervention times suggests that an earlier public health response could have substantially reduced the total number of HIV infections (estimated to have been 183-184 infections by Aug 11, 2015). Initiation of a response on Jan 1, 2013, could have suppressed the number of infections to 56 or fewer, averting at least 127 infections; whereas an intervention on April 1, 2011, could have reduced the number of infections to ten or fewer, averting at least 173 infections. INTERPRETATION: Early and robust surveillance efforts and case finding alone could reduce nascent epidemics. Ensuring access to HIV services and harm-reduction interventions could further reduce the likelihood of outbreaks, and substantially mitigate their severity and scope.

        "Investigation into the cleaning methods of smartphones and wearables from infectious contamination in a patient care environment (I-SWIPE). BACKGROUND: Many health care workers are using smartphones and wearable devices without an enforced cleaning standard to prevent the spread of bacteria to patients. To our knowledge, no real-world trials have been performed to date, examining bacterial elimination on these devices in a hospital setting. The primary objective was to determine if ultraviolet wavelength C (UV-C) was more effective at eliminating bacteria on smartphones and wearable devices when compared with usual care. METHODS: This prospective before-and-after study included clinicians who used smartphones or wearable devices during their daily clinical practice. Devices underwent two 30-second UV-C disinfection cycles, at the beginning and end of clinician shifts. Swabs were collected at predetermined intervals both prior to and following a UV-C disinfection cycle to determine the extent of bacterial growth. RESULTS: Following a run-in period of twice-daily UV-C disinfection, 20% of devices grew pathogenic bacteria prior to UV-C use. Comparatively, only 4% of devices grew bacteria post-UV-C; therefore, the decrease in bacterial growth was statistically significant (P\u202f=\u202f.002). CONCLUSIONS: UV-C appears to be more effective at eliminating bacteria on smartphones and wearable devices when compared with usual care and is a useful disinfection device in a hospital setting. Further studies are needed to determine the interval at which UV-C should be used to prevent bacterial growth and spread. ",
        "Extended-spectrum \u03b2-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli in human-derived and foodchain-derived samples from England, Wales, and Scotland: an epidemiological surveillance and typing study. BACKGROUND: Extended-spectrum \u03b2-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli isolates (ESBL-E coli) cause more than 5000 cases of bacteraemias annually in the UK. The contribution of the food chain to these infections is debated. We aimed to identify the most important reservoirs of ESBL-E coli that colonise and infect humans to identify strategic intervention points. METHODS: Sampling for ESBL-E coli was done between Aug 1, 2013, and Dec 15, 2014. We used selective media to seek ESBL-E coli in routinely submitted samples from human faeces, and prospectively collected samples from sewage, farm slurry, and retail foodstuffs in London, East Anglia, northwest England, Scotland, and Wales. We sequenced recovered isolates and compared these isolates with 293 bloodstream and 83 veterinary surveillance ESBL-E coli isolates from the same regions. FINDINGS: 2157 (11%) of 20\u2008243 human faeces samples contained ESBL-E coli, including 678 (17%) of 3995 in London. ESBL-E coli also were frequent in sewage and retail chicken (104 [65%] of 159 meat samples), but were rare in other meats and absent from plant-based foods (0 of 400 fruit and vegetable samples). Sequence type (ST) 131 dominated among ESBL-E coli from human blood (188 [64%] of 293 isolates), faeces (128 [36%] of 360), and sewage (14 [22%] of 65) with STs 38 and 648 also widespread; CTX-M-15 was the predominant ESBL in these lineages (319 [77%] of 416). By contrast, STs 602, 23, and 117-mostly with CTX-M-1 ESBL-dominated among food and veterinary isolates (68 [31%] of 218), with only two ST131 organisms recovered. ST10 occurred in both animals and humans, being frequent in surveillance bovines (11 [22%] of 51 cattle) and representing 15 (4%) of 360 human faecal isolates (but only three [1%] of 293 from bacteraemias); however, both human and animal ST10 isolates were diverse in serotype. INTERPRETATION: Most human bacteraemias with ESBL-E coli in the UK involve internationally prevalent human-associated STs, particularly ST131; non-human reservoirs made little contribution to invasive human disease. Any interventions that seek to target food or livestock can affect the numbers of human infections caused by ESBL-E coli; prevention of the spread of resistant lineages among humans is more vital.

        "Disparities in accessing infertility care in the United States: results from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 2013-16. OBJECTIVE: To investigate infertility rates and access to infertility care among women in the United States. DESIGN: Retrospective cross-sectional. SETTING: Not applicable. PATIENT(S): Women between 20 and 44\u00a0years-old who participated in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey between 2013 and 2016 and answered questions RHQ074 (\"have you ever attempted to become pregnant over a period of at least a year without becoming pregnant?\") and RHQ076 (\"have you ever been to a doctor or other medical provider because you were unable to become pregnant?\"). INTERVENTION(S): None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Rates of infertility and accessing infertility care. RESULT(S): Women reported infertility at a rate of 12.5% (95% confidence interval, 10.8-14.4). Higher infertility rates were noted with increasing age and body mass index. There were no differences in infertility rates by race/ethnicity, education, income, U.S. citizenship, insurance, or primary location of health care. However, women with less than a high school diploma accessed infertility care less than women with a college degree (5.0% vs. 11.6%). Women with incomes less than $25,000 sought infertility care less than those with incomes above $100,000 (5.4% vs. 11.6%). Non-U.S. citizens accessed infertility care less than U.S. citizens (6.9% vs. 9.4%), and uninsured women reported fewer visits for infertility than insured women (5.9% vs. 9.9%). Women who used the emergency department as their primary medical location reported accessing infertility care less than those who relied on a hospital outpatient unit (1.4% vs. 14.9%). CONCLUSION(S): These nationally representative findings highlight the need to address disparities in access to infertility care. ",
        "Benefits of Empiric Nutritional and Medical Therapy for Semen Parameters and Pregnancy and Live Birth Rates in Couples with Idiopathic Infertility: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis. CONTEXT: Empiric use of medical and nutritional supplements to improve semen parameters and pregnancy rates in couples with idiopathic infertility has reached global proportions, although the evidence base for their use in this setting is controversial. OBJECTIVE: We systematically reviewed evidence comparing the benefits of nutritional and medical therapy on pregnancy rates and semen parameters in men with idiopathic infertility. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: A literature search was performed using MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, and the Cochrane Library (searched from January 1, 1990 to September 19, 2017). using the methods detailed in the Cochrane Handbook. Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) was used to assess the certainty of evidence. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: The literature search identified 5663 citations, and after screening of abstracts and full texts, 61 studies (59 randomised controlled trials and two nonrandomised comparative studies) were included. Pooled results demonstrated that pentoxyfylline, coenzyme Q10, L-carnitine, follicle-stimulating hormone, tamoxifen, and kallikrein all resulted in improvements in semen parameters. Individual studies identified several other medical and nutritional therapies that improved semen parameters, but data were limited to individual studies with inherent methodological flaws. There were limited data available on live birth and pregnancy rates for all interventions. The GRADE certainty of evidence for all outcomes was very low mainly owing to methodological flaws and inconsistencies in study design. Some outcomes were also downgraded owing to imprecision of results. CONCLUSIONS: There is some evidence that empiric medical and nutritional supplements may improve semen parameters. There is very limited evidence that empiric therapy leads to better live birth rates, spontaneous pregnancy, or pregnancy following assisted-reproductive techniques. However, the findings should be interpreted with caution as there were some methodological flaws, as a number of studies were judged to be either at high or unclear risk of bias for many domains. PATIENT SUMMARY: This review identified several medical and nutritional treatments, such as pentoxyfylline, coenzyme Q10, L-carnitine, follicle-stimulating hormone, tamoxifen, and kallikrein, that appear to improve semen parameters. However, there are limited data suggesting improvements in pregnancy and live birth rates. The lack of evidence can be attributed to methodological flaws in studies and the low number of pregnancies reported. ",

        "What's Unique About Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender (LGBT) Youth and Young Adult Suicides? Findings From the National Violent Death Reporting System. PURPOSE: The purpose of the study was to explore variability in circumstances around suicide deaths among youth and young adults by sexual/gender identity category (gay male, lesbian/gay female, bisexual male, bisexual female, transgender male, transgender female, non-LGBT [lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender] male, and non-LGBT female). METHODS: Secondary analysis of National Violent Death Reporting System (NVDRS) data for all 12-\u00a0to 29-year-olds who died by suicide in NVDRS participating states. Coverage begins in 2013, the year that NVDRS began coding for sexual orientation and transgender status, and ends in 2015, the latest year of NVDRS data available. The valid sample was limited to cases in which sexual orientation or transgender status could be determined postmortem, n\u00a0= 2,209. RESULTS: Almost one quarter (24%) of 12- to 14-year-olds who died by suicide were LGBT, whereas only 8% of 25- to 29-year-olds who died by suicide were LGBT. Most non-LGBT males and bisexual males died by firearm and had intimate partner problems contribute to their deaths. Non-LGBT females and LGBT persons other than bisexual males were generally less likely to use firearms. They were also more likely to have psychiatric diagnoses, prior suicidality, and family problems contributing to their deaths. Rates of many circumstances varied widely among LGBT subgroups. CONCLUSIONS: The LGBT versus non-LGBT suicide disparity is greatest at younger ages, and each LGBT subgroup has its own specific risk profile for suicide. Suicide prevention and intervention efforts targeted at LGBT youth may increase their effectiveness by attending to these distinct risk profiles. ",
        "Validation of Predictive Metabolic Syndrome Biomarkers of World Trade Center Lung Injury: A 16-Year Longitudinal Study. BACKGROUND: Metabolic syndrome (MetSyn) predicted future development of World Trade Center lung injury (WTC-LI) in a subgroup of firefighters who never smoked and were male. An intracohort validation of MetSyn as a predictor of WTC-LI is examined in the cohort exposed to the World Trade Center (WTC) that has been followed longitudinally for 16 years. METHODS: Results of pulmonary function tests (n\u00a0= 98,221) in workers exposed to the WTC (n\u00a0= 9,566) were evaluated. A baseline cohort of firefighters who had normal FEV1 before 9/11 and who had had serum drawn before site closure on July 24, 2002 (n\u00a0= 7,487) was investigated. Case subjects with WTC-LI (n\u00a0= 1,208) were identified if they had at least two measured instances of FEV1 less than the lower limit of normal (LLN). Cox proportional hazards modeled early MetSyn biomarker ability to predict development of FEV1 less than the LLN. RESULTS: Case subjects were more likely to smoke, be highly exposed, and have MetSyn. There was a significant exposure dose response; the individuals most highly exposed had a 30.1%\u00a0increased risk of developing WTC-LI, having MetSyn increased risk of developing WTC-LI by 55.7%, and smoking increased risk by 15.2%. There was significant interaction between smoking and exposure. CONCLUSIONS: We validated the usefulness of MetSyn to predict future WTC-LI in a larger population of individuals who were exposed. MetSyn defined by dyslipidemia, insulin resistance, and cardiovascular disease suggests that systemic inflammation can contribute to future lung function loss. ",
        "Camp Leadership Perspectives on Food Allergy-Related Anaphylaxis Events and Training for Camp Staff: A National Survey of Summer Camps. BACKGROUND: Training of camp staff to recognize and treat anaphylaxis is recommended because food allergies are prevalent among summer campers. The frequency of food allergy anaphylaxis events and the extent of anaphylaxis training for camp staff are unknown. OBJECTIVE: To estimate the frequency of food-allergic reactions in camps across the United States and to assess the state of food allergy anaphylaxis training for camp staff. METHODS: We partnered with CampDoc.com to send a 20-question survey in February 2016 to camp leadership representing 528 camps. Questions addressed demographic characteristics, food allergy policies, training, medication availability, anaphylaxis events, and confidence in staff to recognize and treat anaphylaxis. RESULTS: A total of 559 responses were received, representing 258 camps. The majority surveyed (n\u00a0= 529 [94.6%]) reported food-allergic children attending their camps. Only 47.6% (n\u00a0= 266) respondents reported requiring individualized emergency action plans as required for camper attendance. Anaphylaxis treated with epinephrine was reported by 24% (n\u00a0= 134) of leadership within the previous 2 years at their camp. These respondents were more likely to have a training session for staff (odds ratio, 2.46; 95% CI, 1.4-4.3). A total of 63.3% (n\u00a0= 354) reported training session presence. However, 15.6% (n\u00a0= 87) of leadership were unsatisfied with training materials and one-third were not confident in staff to manage anaphylaxis. CONCLUSIONS: Appropriate policies to manage food anaphylaxis events and anaphylaxis management training were missing in a substantial proportion of camps. Camp-tailored food allergy training is needed given the number of camps reporting food allergy reactions requiring epinephrine. ",
        "Breast Density Notification Letters and Websites: Are They Too \"Dense\"?. PURPOSE: To evaluate grade-level readability of dense breast notification letters (DBNs) and popular websites. METHODS: HIPAA-compliant, institutional review board-exempt study. As of April 2018, letter characteristics and grade-level readability were evaluated from states with mandated text using five readability metrics, one of which was the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level. For states that had mandated DBNs in 2016, the 2016 data were compared with 2018. Readability was also assessed for common websites about dense breasts. RESULTS: Thirty states had mandated text for DBNs. All were written above a Flesch-Kincaid sixth-grade level. Eight state DBNs were around or below a Flesch-Kincaid eighth-grade level. Connecticut was the highest (19.4) and Alabama and New York lowest (both at 7.2). For all states, the mean readability score using the five metrics exceeded an eighth-grade level. Of states that had updated DBNs since 2016, only one state significantly improved readability (Missouri 13.1 to 8.5). All DBNs discussed that breast density may mask cancer on a mammogram, 20 discussed the association with increased risk of breast cancer, and 23 discussed supplemental screening. For websites, the range of Flesch-Kincaid grade-level readability was 6 to 11.3. The lowest was the American Cancer Society dense breast website (6.0) followed by ACR dense breast patient pamphlet (7.2). CONCLUSION: As of 2018, the mean readability score using five metrics for all state-mandated DBNs exceeded an eighth-grade reading level. Compared with 2016, only one state significantly decreased DBN grade-level readability. Publicly available websites performed relatively better. ",
        "Expired Drugs in the Remote Environment. INTRODUCTION: The British Antarctic Survey Medical Unit works in a very remote area of the world, with several Antarctic bases receiving only a single annual resupply of consumable goods. Pharmaceuticals supplied in this manner will often be approaching or past the end of their nominal shelf life before the following year's resupply. Drugs are transported from the UK via ship; the hold is not temperature controlled, and the ship crosses through the tropics (air temperature 25-30\u00b0C for approximately 3 wk). The drugs then must be transported from the ship to the base, often in temperatures substantially below freezing. This study assessed the stability of 5 expired drugs (atropine, nifedipine, flucloxacillin, naproxen, and bendroflumethiazide) returned from Antarctic bases. METHODS: Drugs were opportunistically obtained and tested using stability-indicating assays. RESULTS: All tested drugs were stable. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that the studied drugs may be stable beyond expiry, even when not maintained in strictly temperature-controlled conditions. ",
        "Resistance training for hot flushes in postmenopausal women: A randomised controlled trial. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the effect of 15 weeks of resistance training on the frequency of moderate to severe hot flushes in postmenopausal women. STUDY DESIGN: Postmenopausal women with at least 4 moderate or severe hot flushes or night sweats per day day were randomized to a 15-week resistance training intervention or unchanged physical activity. Participants did not exercise regularly at baseline and had not used any therapy for hot flushes two months prior to study entry. The resistance training was performed three times per week and the program contained 8 exercises performed with 8-12 repetitions in 2 sets. Loads were set individually from eight-repetition maximum-strength tests and increased progressively. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was change in mean moderate or severe hot flushes per day from baseline to week 15, assessed with symptom diaries. Secondary outcomes included change in hot flush score and time spent on physical activity. RESULTS: Between November 19, 2013, and October 26, 2016, 65 women were enrolled; 58 completed the trial and were included in the analyses. The mean age was 55 and the mean number of moderate or severe hot flushes per day at baseline was 7.1; there were no baseline differences between groups. The frequency of hot flushes decreased more in the intervention group than in the control group (mean difference -2.7, 95% CI -4.2 to -1.3). The mean percentage change was -43.6% (-56.0 to -31.3) in the intervention group and -2.0% (-16.4-12.4) in the control group. CONCLUSION: A 15-week resistance-training program decreased the frequency of moderate and severe hot flushes among postmenopausal women and could be an effective and safe treatment option to alleviate vasomotor symptoms.

        "Peer-supported self-management for people discharged from a mental health crisis team: a randomised controlled trial. BACKGROUND: High resource expenditure on acute care is a challenge for mental health services aiming to focus on supporting recovery, and relapse after an acute crisis episode is common. Some evidence supports self-management interventions to prevent such relapses, but their effect on readmissions to acute care following a crisis is untested. We tested whether a self-management intervention facilitated by peer support workers could reduce rates of readmission to acute care for people discharged from crisis resolution teams, which provide intensive home treatment following a crisis. METHODS: We did a randomised controlled superiority trial recruiting participants from six crisis resolution teams in England. Eligible participants had been on crisis resolution team caseloads for at least a week, and had capacity to give informed consent. Participants were randomly assigned to intervention and control groups by an unmasked data manager. Those collecting and analysing data were masked to allocation, but participants were not. Participants in the intervention group were offered up to ten sessions with a peer support worker who supported them in completing a personal recovery workbook, including formulation of personal recovery goals and crisis plans. The control group received the personal recovery workbook by post. The primary outcome was readmission to acute care within 1 year. This trial is registered with ISRCTN, number 01027104. FINDINGS: 221 participants were assigned to the intervention group versus 220 to the control group; primary outcome data were obtained for 218 versus 216. 64 (29%) of 218 participants in the intervention versus 83 (38%) of 216 in the control group were readmitted to acute care within 1 year (odds ratio 0\u00b766, 95% CI 0\u00b743-0\u00b799; p=0\u00b70438). 71 serious adverse events were identified in the trial (29 in the treatment group; 42 in the control group). INTERPRETATION: Our findings suggest that peer-delivered self-management reduces readmission to acute care, although admission rates were lower than anticipated and confidence intervals were relatively wide. The complexity of the study intervention limits interpretability, but assessment is warranted of whether implementing this intervention in routine settings reduces acute care readmission.

        "Lack of Routine Healthcare among Resident Physicians in New England. BACKGROUND: Although physician health promotes retention to the profession and encourages higher quality patient care, residents may face challenges seeking routine medical care. Erratic working hours, time constraints, easy access to informal health consultation, and a culture of self-reliance may deter help-seeking behavior. Despite national focus on physician burnout and efforts to promote wellness, little is known about the self-care habits of residents. The goal of this study was to evaluate the routine healthcare practices of resident physicians. STUDY DESIGN: A 44-question survey with questions on medical and psychiatric health was electronically distributed to 102 program directors in 20 New England teaching hospitals. Program directors were asked to forward the survey to current trainees. RESULTS: 299 residents completed the survey. A third of respondents reported not having a routine place for medical care (RPFC), and these residents had lower utilization of preventative health services. 38% of residents taking daily prescription medication did not have a RPFC. Compared to residents in Family Medicine, those in Surgery, Internal Medicine, Radiology, Anesthesia, OB/GYN, and Pediatrics were significantly more likely to lack RPFC. Though two-thirds of respondents reported symptoms of depression, these residents were less likely to have been under the care of a mental health professional than those who did not report depression symptoms. CONCLUSION: Despite a high prevalence of self-reported depression and prescription medication use, a significant proportion of surveyed resident physicians in New England do not seek mental health resources and lack consistent, routine health care. Resident health is vital to the mission of physician well-being and mitigating the escalating problem of burnout. Barriers to self-care and help-seeking behavior should be evaluated to promote sustainable behavior that will encourage a long professional career. ",
        "Trends in Mood and Anxiety Symptoms and Suicide-Related Outcomes Among U.S. Undergraduates, 2007-2018: Evidence From Two National Surveys. PURPOSE: Past work has evidenced increased utilization of mental health services on college campuses, as well as rising rates of mood and suicide-related pathology in adolescents and young adults in recent years. We examined whether such findings are reflective of large-scale, nationwide trends in college student mental health in the past decade. METHODS: We examined trends in mood, anxiety, and suicide-related outcomes among U.S. college students from 2007 to 2018 across two large national datasets: (1) the National College Health Assessment (n\u00a0= 610,543; mean age\u00a0= 21.25\u00a0years; 67.7% female; and 72.0% white) and (2) the Healthy Minds Study (n\u00a0= 177,692; 86% students aged 18-22\u00a0years; 57% female; and 74% white). Participants, randomly selected by their educational institution, completed self-report measures of past-year mood, anxiety, nonsuicidal self-injury, and suicidal thoughts and behaviors. RESULTS: In both samples, rates of depression, anxiety, nonsuicidal self-injury, suicidal ideation, and suicide attempts markedly increased over the assessed years, with rates doubling over the period in many cases. Anger, low flourishing, and suicide plans, each assessed in only one dataset, also exhibited upward trends. CONCLUSIONS: Findings demonstrate a broad worsening of mental health among U.S. college students over the past decade, a concerning result meriting further attention and intervention. ",
        "Disparities in cancer screening in people with mental illness across the world versus the general population: prevalence and comparative meta-analysis including 4\u2008717\u2008839 people. BACKGROUND: Since people with mental illness are more likely to die from cancer, we assessed whether people with mental illness undergo less cancer screening compared with the general population. METHODS: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched PubMed and PsycINFO, without a language restriction, and hand-searched the reference lists of included studies and previous reviews for observational studies from database inception until May 5, 2019. We included all published studies focusing on any type of cancer screening in patients with mental illness; and studies that reported prevalence of cancer screening in patients, or comparative measures between patients and the general population. The primary outcome was odds ratio (OR) of cancer screening in people with mental illness versus the general population. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale was used to assess study quality and I2 to assess study heterogeneity. This study is registered with PROSPERO, CRD42018114781. FINDINGS: 47 publications provided data from 46 samples including 4\u2008717\u2008839 individuals (501\u2008559 patients with mental illness, and 4\u2008216\u2008280 controls), of whom 69\u00b785% were women, for screening for breast cancer (k=35; 296\u2008699 individuals with mental illness, 1\u2008023 288 in the general population), cervical cancer (k=29; 295\u2008688 with mental illness, 3\u2008540\u2008408 in general population), colorectal cancer (k=12; 153\u2008283 with mental illness, 2\u2008228\u2008966 in general population), lung and gastric cancer (both k=1; 420 with mental illness, none in general population), ovarian cancer (k=1; 37 with mental illness, none in general population), and prostate cancer (k=6; 52\u2008803 with mental illness, 2\u2008038\u2008916 in general population). Median quality of the included studies was high at 7 (IQR 6-8). Screening was significantly less frequent in people with any mental disease compared with the general population for any cancer (k=37; OR 0\u00b776 [95% CI 0\u00b772-0\u00b779]; I2=98\u00b753% with publication bias of Egger's p value=0\u00b7025), breast cancer (k=27; 0\u00b765 [0\u00b760-0\u00b771]; I2=97\u00b758% and no publication bias), cervical cancer (k=23; 0\u00b789 [0\u00b784-0\u00b795]; I2=98\u00b747% and no publication bias), and prostate cancer (k=4; 0\u00b778 [0\u00b770-0\u00b786]; I2=79\u00b768% and no publication bias), but not for colorectal cancer (k=8; 1\u00b702 [0\u00b790-1\u00b715]; I2=97\u00b784% and no publication bias). INTERPRETATION: Despite the increased mortality from cancer in people with mental illness, this population receives less cancer screening compared with that of the general population. Specific approaches should be developed to assist people with mental illness to undergo appropriate cancer screening, especially women with schizophrenia. FUNDING: None. ",
        "Association of Muscular Strength and Incidence of Type 2 Diabetes. OBJECTIVE: To examine the association between muscular strength and incident type 2 diabetes, independent of cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF). PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 4681 adults aged 20 to 100 years who had no type 2 diabetes at baseline were included in the current prospective cohort study. Participants underwent muscular strength tests and maximal treadmill exercise tests between January 1, 1981, and December 31, 2006. Muscular strength was measured by leg and bench press and categorized as age group- and sex-specific thirds (lower, middle, and upper) of the combined strength score. Type 2 diabetes was defined on the basis of fasting plasma glucose levels, insulin therapy, or physician diagnoses. RESULTS: During a mean follow-up of 8.3 years, 229 of the 4681 patients (4.9%) had development of type 2 diabetes. Participants with the middle level of muscular strength had a 32% lower risk of development of type 2 diabetes (hazard ratio, 0.68; 95% confidence interval, 0.49-0.94; P=.02) compared with those with the lower level of muscular strength after adjusting for potential confounders, including estimated CRF. However, no significant association between the upper level of muscular strength and incident type 2 diabetes was observed. CONCLUSION: A moderate level of muscular strength is associated with a lower risk of type 2 diabetes, independent of estimated CRF. More studies on the dose-response relationship between muscular strength and type 2 diabetes are needed. ",
        "Initiative to Improve Exclusive Breastfeeding by Delaying the Newborn Bath. OBJECTIVE: To examine whether delayed newborn bathing would increase rates of in-hospital exclusive breastfeeding and plans to use human milk at discharge. DESIGN: A retrospective, two-group, pre- and postintervention design. SETTING/LOCAL PROBLEM: At our facility, the initial bath was completed within 2 hours of birth, and the rate of in-hospital exclusive breastfeeding was low. PARTICIPANTS: Couplets of mothers and healthy newborns (N\u00a0= 996). INTERVENTION/MEASUREMENTS: Newborn baths were delayed at least 12 hours after birth. Pre- and postintervention data were retrieved from the hospital's electronic medical record and administrative database. Univariate and multivariate analyses were completed. RESULTS: Of 996 mother-newborn couplets, 448 were preintervention couplets and 548 were postintervention couplets. Of\u00a0all mothers, 63.3%\u00a0were White, 67.8%\u00a0were married, and 67.1%\u00a0gave birth vaginally. Of all newborns, 49.6%\u00a0were female, and the mean (standard deviation) birth weight was 3.3 kg (0.50). We found no differences in maternal or newborn characteristics by group. Median (25th percentile, 75th percentile) times from birth to first bath before and after the intervention were 1.9 (1.6, 2.3) and 17.9 (11.9, 25.0) hours, respectively (p\u00a0< .001). In-hospital exclusive breastfeeding increased from 59.8%\u00a0before the intervention to 68.2%\u00a0after the intervention (p\u00a0= .006). In multivariate modeling, in-hospital exclusive breastfeeding increased for all couplets after the intervention (odds ratio\u00a0= 1.49, 95%\u00a0confidence interval [1.14, 1.96]; p\u00a0= .004) and with vaginal versus cesarean birth (odds ratio\u00a0= 1.60, 95%\u00a0confidence interval [1.14, 2.25]; p\u00a0= .006). In addition, the postintervention discharge feeding plan reflected an increase in use of human milk. CONCLUSION: Delaying the newborn bath was associated with increased in-hospital exclusive breastfeeding rates and use of human milk as a part of the discharge feeding plan. ",
        "The effects of dual-task balance training on gait in older women with osteoporosis: A randomized controlled trial. BACKGROUND: Although there is a growing body of literature showing promising effects of balance training on gait in older adults, little is known about the effects of dual-task training on varying domains of spatial and temporal gait parameters. RESEARCH QUESTION: Does the short-term effects of dual-task balance training differ between single and dual-task gait in older women with osteoporosis with regards to different gait domains (pace, rhythm, variability, asymmetry and postural control)?. METHODS: Elderly women with osteoporosis who experienced fear of falling and/or \u22651 fall the last 12 months were recruited. Ninety-five participants were randomized to 12 weeks of balance training or to a control group. The participants in the training group (n\u2009=\u200965) received 12 weeks (3 times/week) of balance and gait exercises including dual-tasks, and the control group (n\u2009=\u200930) received care as usual. Single- and dual-task gait were assessed before and after the intervention with an electronic walkway system and analyzed using non-parametric statistics and effect sizes. RESULTS: 68 participants completed the study. The training group walked faster for single- and dual-task gait following training (P \u2264 .044) by increasing their cadence (P \u2264 .012) and reducing step and swing time (P \u2264 .045) compared with the control group. Significant between-group differences in favor of the training group were found for gait variability during dual-task gait (P \u2264 .041). The improvement in speed were greater for dual- than single-task gait (0.10 vs. 0.05\u2009m/s) and the effect sizes revealed small to medium effects for dual-task gait, and either non-existent or small for single-task gait. SIGNIFICANCE: Greater training effects found on a variety of domains of dual-task gait compared to single-task gait support the role of cognitively demanding exercises for the maintenance of safe ambulation in older women with osteoporosis.

        "Perception and practice of sublingual immunotherapy among practicing allergists in the United States: A follow-up survey. BACKGROUND: Limited information is available regarding the current perception and practice of sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT) use among US and international allergists. In light of 4 recent US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved SLIT options, perceptions and practices may be changing. OBJECTIVE: To provide updated information about current allergists' practice and perception of SLIT relative to 2007 and\u00a02011. METHODS: On behalf of the American College of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology (ACAAI) Immunotherapy and Diagnostics Committee, an electronic survey was sent to all US and international allergists who were members of the ACAAI. Data were compared with previous surveys conducted and published in 2007 and\u00a02011. RESULTS: Of the 305 respondents, 268 (87.9%) practiced in the United States. A total of 197 of 268 respondents (73.5%) reported experience using SLIT compared with 45 of 766 US allergists (5.9%) in 2007 and 59 of 519 US allergists (11.4%) in 2011 (P < .001). Of the 188 respondents in the United States who used SLIT in their practice, 129 (68.6%) used FDA-approved SLIT tablets only, 44 (23.4%) used both FDA-approved SLIT tablets and SLIT drops using an extract that is FDA approved for subcutaneous immunotherapy, and 15 (8.0%) reported using only SLIT drops. Limitation of only treating one allergen was the primary barrier in using SLIT among 197 of 268 respondents (73.5%). CONCLUSION: There has been a significant increase in SLIT use in the last 5 years, with 73.5% of respondents reporting experience with it. With 4 FDA-approved SLIT therapies, this likely contributes to its more widespread use. The greatest barrier to SLIT use is the limitation of only treating one allergen. ",
        "Side effects from opioids used for acute pain after emergency department discharge. OBJECTIVE: Opioid side effects are common when treating chronic pain. However, the frequency of opioid side effects has rarely been examined in acute pain conditions, particularly in a post emergency department (ED) setting. The objective of this study was to evaluate the short-term incidence of opioid-induced side effects (constipation, nausea/vomiting, dizziness, drowsiness, sweating, and weakness) in patients discharged from the ED with an opioid prescription. METHODS: This is a prospective cohort study of patients aged \u226518\u202fyears who visited the ED for an acute pain condition (\u22642\u202fweeks) and were discharged with an opioid prescription. Patients completed a 14-day diary assessing daily pain medication use and side effects. RESULTS: We recruited 386 patients with a median age of 54\u202fyears (IQR:43-66); 50% were women. During the 2-week follow-up, 80% of patients consumed opioids. Among the patients who used opioids, 79% (95%CI:75-83) reported side effects compared to 38% (95%CI:27-49) for non-users. Adjusting for age, sex, and pain condition, patients who used opioids were more likely to report constipation (OR:7.5; 95%CI:3.1-17.9), nausea/vomiting (OR:4.1; 95%CI:1.8-9.5), dizziness (OR:5.4; 95%CI: 2.2-13.2), drowsiness (OR:4.6; 95%CI:2.5-8.7), and weakness (OR:4.2; 95%CI:1.6-11.0) compared to non-users. A dose-response trend was observed for constipation but not for the other side effects. Nausea/vomiting (OR:2.0; 95%CI:1.1-3.6) and dizziness (OR:1.9; 95%CI:1.1-3.4) were more often associated with oxycodone than with morphine. CONCLUSION: As observed for chronic pain treatment, side effects are highly prevalent during short-term opioid treatment for acute pain. Physicians should inform patients about those side effects and should consider prescribing laxatives. ",
        "\"Feeling confident and equipped\": Evaluating the acceptability and efficacy of an overdose response and naloxone administration intervention to service industry employees in New York City. BACKGROUND: The problem of injection drug use in public bathrooms has been documented from the perspectives of people who inject drugs and service industry employees (SIEs). Previous studies suggest that SIEs are unaware of how to respond to opioid overdoses, yet there are no behavioral interventions designed for SIEs to address their specific needs. In response to this gap in the field, we constructed, implemented, and evaluated a three-module behavioral intervention for SIEs grounded in the Information-Motivation-Behavioral skills model. This paper focuses on the evaluation of one module, namely, the intervention component addressing overdose response and naloxone administration (ORNA). METHODS: Participants were SIEs (N\u2009=\u200918 from two separate business establishments) recruited using convenience sampling. The study utilized a pre-/post-test concurrent nested mixed method design and collected quantitative and qualitative data including an evaluation of the intervention module. The primary outcomes were opioid overdose-related knowledge and attitudes. Acceptability was also assessed. RESULTS: SIEs demonstrated significant improvements (p\u2009<\u2009 0.01, Cohen's d\u2009=\u20091.45) in opioid overdose-related knowledge as well as more positive opioid overdose-related attitudes (p< 0.01, Cohen's d\u2009=\u20092.45) following the intervention. Participants also reported high levels of acceptability of the module and suggestions for improvement (i.e., more role-playing). CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the acceptability and evidence of efficacy of the ORNA module, as well as the utility of training SIEs in ORNA. The expansion of this training to other SIEs and public employees (librarians, etc.) who manage public bathrooms warrants further investigation. ",
        "Confidentiality Discussions and Private Time With a Health-Care Provider for Youth, United States, 2016. PURPOSE: The objective of the study was to define factors associated with adolescent and young adult (AYA) experiences with private time and having discussed confidentiality and the impact of these experiences on improving delivery of clinical preventive services. METHODS: In 2016, a nationally representative sample of 1,918 US AYAs (13- to 26-year-olds) was surveyed. Survey questionnaire domains were based on prior research and Fishers' information-motivation-behavior skills conceptual model. Data were weighted to represent US households with AYA and analyzed to identify factors independently associated with ever experiencing private time and discussions of confidentiality with a regular health-care provider (HCP). We examined the association of these experiences on AYA attitudes about health care. RESULTS: Fifty-five percent of female and 49% of male AYA reported ever having had private time with an HCP and 55% of female and 44% of male AYA had spoken to an HCP about confidentiality. Independent predictors of having experienced private time and confidentiality included older age, race, higher household income, gender of the provider, amount of years with the provider, and involvement in risk behaviors. AYA who had experienced private time and confidentiality discussions had more positive attitudes about their providers, were more willing and comfortable discussing sensitive topics, and thought that these discussions should happen at younger ages. CONCLUSIONS: Although confidentiality and private time are important to AYA, many are not experiencing these components of care. Providing private time and discussions of confidentiality can improve the delivery of health care for young people by enhancing positive youth attitudes about preventive care. ",
        "Successful treatment of prediabetes in clinical practice using physiological assessment (STOP DIABETES). BACKGROUND: Of the 84 million American adults with prediabetes, over 5 to 7 years, about 28 million progress to type 2 diabetes. We aimed to assess whether a real-world, pathophysiology-based, therapeutic approach could prevent development of type 2 diabetes in high-risk individuals. METHODS: We did a retrospective observational study of people at increased risk of type 2 diabetes from a community practice in southern California, USA. Participants had an oral glucose tolerance test and were assigned a risk stratification on the basis of presence and severity of insulin resistance, impaired \u03b2-cell function, and glycaemia (ie, 1-h plasma glucose concentration of more than 8\u00b76 mmol/L during an oral glucose tolerance test). Treatment was recommended on the basis of risk: metformin, pioglitazone, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist, and lifestyle therapy for participants at high risk of diabetes, and metformin, pioglitazone, and lifestyle therapy for those at intermediate risk. Individuals who refused pharmacological therapy were assigned to lifestyle therapy only. Participants were followed up every 6 months and oral glucose tolerance tests were repeated at 6 months and subsequently every 2 years or sooner. The primary outcome of our analysis was incidence of type 2 diabetes according to the American Diabetes Association criteria, within the study period (2009-16). This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT03308773. FINDINGS: Between Jan 1, 2009 and Dec 31, 2016, we assessed 1769 people at increased risk of diabetes, of which 747 (42%) were identified at high or intermediate risk and were recommended pharmacological treatment. Of 422 participants analysed, 28 (7%) progressed to type 2 diabetes (seven [5%] of 141 participants who received metformin, pioglitazone, and lifestyle therapy, none [0%] of 81 who received metformin, pioglitazone, GLP-1 receptor agonist, and lifestyle therapy, and 21 [11%] of 200 who received lifestyle therapy only) after mean follow-up of 32\u00b709 months (SEM 1\u00b724). Compared with participants who received lifestyle therapy only, the adjusted hazard ratio for progression to type 2 diabetes was 0\u00b729 (95% CI 0\u00b711-0\u00b778, p=0\u00b70009) in participants who received metformin and pioglitazone, and 0\u00b712 (95% CI 0\u00b702-0\u00b794, p=0\u00b704) in participants who received metformin, pioglitazone, and GLP-1 receptor agonist. Improved \u03b2-cell function was the strongest predictor of type 2 diabetes prevention. INTERPRETATION: Progression to type 2 diabetes in people at high risk of diabetes can be markedly reduced with interventions designed to correct underlying pathophysiological disturbances (ie, impaired insulin secretion and resistance) in a real-world setting. FUNDING: None. ",
        "Medically assisted reproduction and birth outcomes: a within-family analysis using Finnish population registers. BACKGROUND: Children born after medically assisted reproduction are at higher risk of adverse birth outcomes than are children conceived naturally. We aimed to establish the extent to which this excess risk should be attributed to harmful effects of treatment or to pre-existing parental characteristics that confound the association. METHODS: We used data from Finnish administrative registers covering a 20% random sample of households with at least one child aged 0-14 years at the end of 2000 (n=65\u2008723). We analysed birthweight, gestational age, risk of low birthweight, and risk of preterm birth among children conceived both by medically assisted reproduction and naturally. First, we estimated differences in birth outcomes by mode of conception in the general population, using standard multivariate methods that controlled for observed factors (eg, multiple birth, birth order, and parental sociodemographic characteristics). Second, we used a sibling-comparison approach that has not been used before in medically assisted reproduction research. We compared children conceived by medically assisted reproduction with siblings conceived naturally and, thus, controlled for all observed and unobserved factors shared by siblings. FINDINGS: Between 1995 and 2000, 2776 (4%) children in our sample were conceived by medically assisted reproduction; 1245 children were included in the sibling comparison. Children conceived by medically assisted reproduction had worse outcomes than did those conceived naturally, for all outcomes, even after adjustments for observed child and parental characteristics-eg, difference in birthweight of -60 g (95% CI -86 to -34) and 2\u00b715 percentage point (95% CI 1\u00b707 to 3\u00b724) increased risk of preterm delivery. In the sibling comparison, the gap in birth outcomes was attenuated, such that the relation between medically assisted reproduction and adverse birth outcomes was statistically and substantively weak for all outcomes-eg, difference in birthweight of -31 g (95% CI -85 to 22) and 1\u00b756 percentage point (95% CI -1\u00b726 to 4\u00b738) increased risk of preterm delivery. INTERPRETATION: Children conceived by medically assisted reproduction face an elevated risk of adverse birth outcomes. However, our results indicate that this increased risk is largely attributable to factors other than the medically assisted reproduction treatment itself. FUNDING: European Research Council, the Academy of Finland, and the Signe and Ane Gyllenberg Foundation. ",
        "Poorly Controlled Asthma During Pregnancy Remains Common in the United States. BACKGROUND: Asthma is among the most common preexisting medical conditions in pregnancy. Uncontrolled asthma may increase the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes. OBJECTIVES: To describe the prevalence, severity, and control of asthma during pregnancy in the United States. METHODS: We identified 2 cohorts of pregnancies ending in a live birth within 2 large US health care claims databases: the Truven Health MarketScan Commercial Claims and Encounters Database (MarketScan, private insurance) for the period 2011 to 2015 and the nationwide Medicaid Analytic eXtract (MAX, public insurance) for the period 2000 to 2013. We defined asthma prevalence, severity, and control on the basis of International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision diagnoses and asthma-related treatments. Severe asthma was defined as dispensing of 1 or more medium/high-dose inhaled corticosteroid plus additional therapy within the 12 months preceding delivery. Poor control was defined as having at least 1 of the following: 1 or more exacerbation (asthma-related hospitalization or emergency room visit, or a course of oral corticosteroids) or 5 or more filled prescriptions for short-acting \u03b2-agonists between the last menstrual period and delivery. RESULTS: Among 604,420 pregnant women in MarketScan and 2,071,359 in MAX, 20,104 (3.3%) and 120,745 (5.8%) had asthma, respectively. Among pregnant women with asthma, 19.0% and 18.8% had severe asthma and 16.5% and 28.0% had poorly controlled asthma in MarketScan and MAX, respectively. Many women with poorly controlled asthma during pregnancy were not dispensed a long-term controller (38.4% in MarketScan and 43.3% in MAX). Within both cohorts, women with poor control were more often smokers and obese, had more comorbidities, and used more concomitant nonasthma medications. CONCLUSIONS: Poorly controlled asthma is more frequent among publicly versus privately insured pregnancies in the United States. Dispensing of long-term controller medications during pregnancy remains low, even for symptomatic patients. ",
        "Variation and Trends in Antidepressant Prescribing for Men Undergoing Treatment for Nonmetastatic Prostate Cancer: A Population-based Cohort Study. Psychological distress is prevalent among men with prostate cancer (PCa). However, the variation in antidepressant use among individuals throughout the survivorship period is unknown. We sought to examine the variation and trends in receipt of antidepressants after PCa treatment, among patients with nonmetastatic PCa. Using population-based linked administrative data, we identified men \u226566 yr old who underwent surgery (n=4952), radiotherapy (n=4994), or surveillance (n=2136), and these men were matched to general population controls (n=57127). One year prior to PCa treatment, 7.7% of men received an antidepressant prescription, which increased to 10.5% in the year after treatment. In difference-in-differences analysis, adjusted for demographic and health characteristics, men had increased odds of antidepressant receipt up to 5 yr after surgery (odds ratio [OR] 1.49; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.35-1.64; p\u22640.0001) or radiotherapy (OR 1.33; 95% CI 1.21-1.47; p\u22640.0001). Men did not have an increased risk of antidepressant receipt up to 5 yr after surveillance (OR 1.15; 95% CI 0.94-1.41; p=0.16). Limitations include the potential for selection bias and misclassification due to the retrospective design of the study and the use of administrative databases. Thus, men with nonmetastatic PCa who initially receive surgery or radiotherapy, but not those who initially undergo surveillance, have an increased risk of antidepressant receipt after treatment. PATIENT SUMMARY: In this report, we examined antidepressant prescription for men after treatment of nonmetastatic prostate cancer across the entire population of men \u226566 yr in Ontario, Canada, from 2002 to 2009. For men diagnosed with nonmetastatic prostate cancer, the risk of antidepressant receipt at 5 yr after treatment was significantly increased after surgery or radiotherapy, but not after surveillance. Providers and patients should consider the psychological effects of prostate cancer treatment during the survivorship period. ",
        "Racial disparities in analgesic use amongst patients presenting to the emergency department for kidney stones in the United States. INTRODUCTION: We sought quantify racial disparities in use of analgesia amongst patients seen in Emergency Departments for renal colic. METHODS: We identified all individuals presenting to the Emergency Department with urolithiasis from 2003 to 2015 in the nationally representative Premier Hospital Database. We included patients discharged in \u22641\u00a0day and excluded those with chronic pain or renal insufficiency. We assessed the relationship between race/ethnicity and opioid dosage in morphine milligram equivalents (MME), and ketorolac, through multivariable regression models adjusting for patient and hospital characteristics. RESULTS: The cohort was 266,210 patients, comprised of White (84%), Black (6%) and Hispanic (10%) individuals. Median opioid dosage was 20 MME and 55.5% received ketorolac. Our adjusted model showed Whites had highest median MME (20\u00a0mg) with Blacks (-3.3\u00a0mg [95% CI: -4.6\u00a0mg to -2.1\u00a0mg]) and Hispanics (-6.0\u00a0mg [95% CI: -6.9\u00a0mg to -5.1\u00a0mg]) receiving less. Blacks were less likely to receive ketorolac (OR: 0.72, 95% CI: 0.62-0.84) while there was no difference between Whites and Hispanics. CONCLUSIONS: Black and Hispanic patients in American Emergency Departments with acute renal colic receive less opioid medication than White patients; Black patients are also less likely to receive ketorolac.

        "Burden of 30-Day Readmissions Associated With Discharge Against Medical Advice Among Inpatients in the United States. BACKGROUND: Discharges against medical advice are common among inpatients in the United States. The impact of discharge against medical advice on readmission rates and subsequent hospitalization outcomes is uncertain. We sought to ascertain the effect of discharge against medical advice on 30-day readmission rates and outcomes of readmission. METHODS: We used the 2014 Nationwide Readmissions Database to identify index hospitalizations among patients older than 18 years of age. The primary exposure variable was discharge against medical advice, and the primary outcome measure was all-cause unplanned 30-day readmission. We used multivariate hierarchical logistic regression modeling to ascertain the effect of discharge against medical advice on 30-day readmission rates. RESULTS: There were an estimated 23,110,641 index hospitalizations nationwide with an overall unplanned 30-day readmission rate of 10.2%. 1.3% of index admissions resulted in a discharge against medical advice. Patients who were discharged against medical advice were younger (mean age 47.1 years vs 56.5 years, P\u202f<\u202f0.001) with a higher proportion of males (61.1% vs 39.5%, P\u202f<\u202f0.001) compared with patients with a routine discharge. Discharge against medical advice was associated with significantly higher odds of 30-day readmission (risk-adjusted odds ratio [OR] 2.06, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.03-2.09, P\u202f<\u202f0.001). Discharge against medical advice was associated with higher odds of readmission to a different hospital (OR 2.35, 95% CI 2.22-2.49, P\u202f<\u202f0.001) and repeat discharge against medical advice after readmission (OR 18.41, 95% CI 17.46-19.41, P\u202f<\u202f0.001). The most common cause of readmission after discharge against medical advice was alcohol-related disorders (9%). Hospital-level rates of discharge against medical advice ranged from 0% to 12.5%. CONCLUSIONS: Discharge against medical advice is associated with over twice the odds of all-cause unplanned 30-day readmission compared with routine discharge. There is large hospital-level variation in rates of discharge against medical advice. Interventions to reduce discharges against medical advice, particularly at hospitals with high rates of such discharges, may reduce the overall readmission burden in this challenging and high-risk patient population.

        "A Randomized Controlled Trial of Brief Mindfulness Meditation for Women Undergoing Stereotactic Breast Biopsy. PURPOSE: Stereotactic breast biopsy (SBB) is a common, anxiety-producing procedure. Nonpharmacologic methods to manage acute anxiety are needed. METHODS: In this single-blind trial, women were recruited before SBB and randomized in a 2:2:1 ratio to a single session of guided mindfulness-based meditation (GM; n\u00a0= 30), focused breathing (FB; n\u00a0= 30), or standard care (SC; n\u00a0= 16). Anxiety and pain were assessed at baseline after a 10-min prebiopsy group-specific activity (GM, FB, or SC), every 4 min during SBB, and after biopsy. Electroencephalographic activity in the medial prefrontal cortex, insula, anterior cingulate cortex, and precuneus was collected throughout the study. RESULTS: Women in the GM group reported a steeper reduction in anxiety than women in the FB and SC groups (P < .001 for all, Cohen's d > 0.4 for all). There were no group differences in pain ratings during the biopsy. Women in the GM group experienced increased beta activity during biopsy in the insula (P\u00a0= .006, Cohen's d\u00a0= 1.4) and anterior cingulate cortex (P\u00a0= .019, Cohen's d\u00a0= 1.0) compared with women in the SC group, and there was a trend toward the same effect compared with women in the FB group (P < .10 for both). Women in the GM and FB groups experienced a nonsignificant decrease in delta activity in the precuneus during biopsy compared with those in the SC group (P < .40 for both, Cohen's d > 0.6 for both), which was associated with a steeper reduction in anxiety during the biopsy (r\u00a0= 0.51, P < .01). CONCLUSIONS: Brief, guided meditation may provide effective anxiety relief during an acute medical procedure and affect neuronal activity in regions associated with attention, self-awareness, and emotion regulation.

        "Pain and Dysfunction with Sexual Activity after Inguinal Hernia Repair: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis. BACKGROUND: The reported incidence rates of sexual dysfunction (SD) and pain with sexual activity (PSA) after inguinal hernia repair in males vary considerably. This meta-analysis explores the rates of SD and PSA after different surgical and anesthesia types to understand patient risk after inguinal hernia repair. STUDY DESIGN: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis using Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines to search 3 databases (EMBASE, MEDLINE, and Cochrane Library). We identified retrospective, prospective, and randomized controlled trial studies, published on or before March 1, 2019, reporting on SD and PSA after inguinal hernia repair. We used random-effects models to calculate pooled estimates of incidence rates of SD and PSA after inguinal hernia repair. Subgroup meta-analyses and meta-regression were used to explore sources of variation. RESULTS: A total of 4,884 patients from 12 studies were identified. Study-level median age at the time of repair was 52.3 years old, and study-level median follow-up was 10.5 months. Definitions of SD and PSA focused on completion of intercourse for the former and pain with erection/ejaculation for the latter. The overall incidence of new-onset, postoperative SD was 5.3% (95% CI 3.6% to 7.9%) and of PSA was 9.0% (95% CI 5.8% to 13.6%). Rates of SD associated with minimally invasive surgical (MIS) and open repair were, respectively, 7.8% (95% CI 5.4% to 11.3%) and 3.7% (95% CI 2.0% to 6.8%); rates of PSA were 7.4% (95% CI 4.7% to 11.5%) and 12.5% (95% CI 6.4% to 23.3%), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Sexual dysfunction and PSA are not rare after inguinal hernia repair. They should be included in preoperative discussions and as standard metrics in reporting outcomes of repair in large cohorts or trials. ",
        "Skin barrier damage after exposure to paraphenylenediamine. BACKGROUND: p-Phenylenediamine (PPD) is a strong contact allergen used in hair dye that is known to cause allergic contact dermatitis (ACD). Both private and occupational exposure to PPD is frequent, but the effect of PPD exposure in nonallergic occupationally exposed subjects is unknown. OBJECTIVE: We sought to investigate the effects of PPD exposure on the skin of occupationally exposed subjects with and without clinical symptoms. METHODS: Skin biopsy specimens were collected from 4 patients with mild and 5 patients with severe PPD-related ACD and 7 hairdressers without contact dermatitis on day 4 after patch testing with 1% PPD in petrolatum. RNA sequencing and transcriptomics analyses were performed and confirmed by using quantitative RT-PCR. Protein expression was analyzed in skin from 4 hairdressers and 1 patient with ACD by using immunofluorescence staining. Reconstructed human epidermis was used to test the effects of PPD in\u00a0vitro. RESULTS: RNA sequencing demonstrated downregulation of tight junction and stratum corneum proteins in the skin of patients with severe ACD after PPD exposure. Claudin-1 (CLDN-1), CLDN8, CLDN11, CXADR-like membrane protein (CLMP), occludin (OCLN), membrane-associated guanylate kinase inverted 1 (MAGI1), and MAGI2 mRNA expression was downregulated in patients with severe ACD. CLDN1 and CLMP expression were downregulated in nonresponding hairdressers and patients with mild ACD. Filaggrin 1 (FLG1), FLG2, and loricrin (LOR) expression were downregulated in patients with ACD. Confocal microscopic images showed downregulation of CLDN-1, FLG-1, and FLG-2 expression. In contrast, 3-dimensional skin cultures showed upregulation of FLG-1 in response to PPD but downregulation of FLG-2. CONCLUSION: PPD-exposed skin is associated with extensive transcriptomic changes, including downregulation of tight junction and stratum corneum proteins, even in the absence of clinical symptoms. ",
        "The use of mind-body medicine among US individuals with sleep problems: analysis of the 2017 National Health Interview Survey data. BACKGROUND: Being a major health risk and very prevalent in the population, sleep problems are an important health care issue. METHODS: We used the 2017 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) to study the prevalence of sleep problems and the use of mind body medicine (MBM) among individuals with sleep problems in a representative sample of the US population (N\u00a0=\u00a026,742). Using chi-squared tests and backward stepwise multiple logistic regression analyses, predictors of sleep problems and of MBM use in the past 12 months were identified. RESULTS: The prevalence of sleep problems was 49.3%, with higher prevalence being associated with higher age, being female, being non-Hispanic White, and higher education. Among individuals with sleep problems, 29.8% used MBM vs. only 17.5% without. Being less than 30 years of age, female, non-Hispanic White, living in the Western US, having a higher education, and being diagnosed with heart disease predicted MBM use among individual's with sleep problems. Yoga (16.3%), spiritual meditation (13.6%), and mindfulness meditation (7.5%) were the most used MBM approaches. CONCLUSION: The characteristics of individuals with sleep problems were largely in line with the literature, while notably Whites were more prone to sleep problems than other ethnicities. MBM treatments commonly used were yoga, spiritual meditation and mindfulness meditation; although evidence supports its use for sleep problems, tai chi was used rarely by the wider population. Further studies should explore reasons for ethnical differences in MBM use and why some effective MBM approaches are not commonly used. ",
        "Sleep myths: an expert-led study to identify false beliefs about sleep that impinge upon population sleep health practices. INTRODUCTION: False beliefs about sleep can persist despite contradicting scientific evidence, potentially impairing population health. Identifying commonly held false beliefs lacking an evidence base (\"myths\") can inform efforts to promote population sleep health. METHOD: We compiled a list of potential myths using Internet searches of popular press and scientific literature. We used a Delphi process with sleep experts (n\u202f=\u202f10) from the fields of sleep medicine and research. Selection and refinement of myths by sleep experts proceeded in 3 phases, including focus groups (Phase 1); email-based feedback to edit, add, or remove myths (Phase 2); and closed-ended questionnaires (Phase 3) where experts rated myths on 2 dimensions, falseness and public health significance, using 5-point Likert scale from 1 (\"not at all\") to 5 (\"extremely false\"). RESULTS: The current study identified 20 sleep myths. Mean expert ratings of falseness ranged from 5.00 (SD\u202f=\u202f0.00) for the statement \"during sleep the brain is not active\" to 2.50 (SD\u202f=\u202f1.07) for the statement \"sleeping in during the weekends is a good way to ensure you get adequate sleep.\" Mean responses to public health significance ranged from 4.63 (SD\u202f=\u202f0.74) for debunking the statement that \"many adults need only 5 or less hours of sleep for general health\" to 1.71 (SD\u202f=\u202f0.49) for the statement that \"remembering your dreams is a sign of a good night's sleep.\". CONCLUSION: The current study identified commonly held sleep myths that have a limited or questionable evidence base. Ratings provided by experts suggest areas that may benefit from public health education to correct myths and promote healthy sleep. ",
        "Effect of positive airway pressure therapy in children with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome: does positive airway pressure use reduce pedestrian injury risk?. INTRODUCTION: Treatment with positive airway pressure (PAP) therapy reduces injury risk among adults with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS), but the effect of PAP therapy on children's injury risk is unknown. This study investigated whether treatment of OSAS with PAP reduces children's pedestrian injury risk in a virtual reality pedestrian environment. METHODS: Forty-two children ages 8-16 years with OSAS were enrolled upon diagnosis by polysomnography. Children crossed a simulated street several times upon enrollment, prior to PAP treatment, and again after 3\u202fmonths of PAP therapy. Children underwent sleep studies at all time points. RESULTS: Children adherent with PAP had a significant reduction in hits by a virtual vehicle (P\u202f<\u202f.01) and less time to contact with oncoming vehicles (P\u202f<\u202f.01) following treatment. Those who were nonadherent did not show improved safety. There was no change in attention to oncoming traffic. CONCLUSIONS: OSAS may have significant consequences on children's daytime functioning in a critical domain of personal safety: pedestrian skills. In pedestrian simulation, children with OSAS adherent to PAP therapy showed improvement in pedestrian safety and had fewer collisions with a virtual vehicle following treatment. Results highlight need for heightened awareness of the real-world benefits of treatment for pediatric sleep disorders. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level II Therapeutic Study. ",
        "Temporal and Geographic Patterns of Social Media Posts About an Emerging Suicide Game. PURPOSE: Rates of suicide are increasing rapidly among youth. Social media messages and online games promoting suicide are a concern for parents and clinicians. We examined the timing and location of social media posts about one alleged youth suicide game to better understand the degree to which social media data can provide earlier public health awareness. METHODS: We conducted a search of all public social media posts and news articles on the Blue Whale Challenge (BWC), an alleged suicide game, from January 1, 2013, through June 30, 2017. Data were retrieved through multiple keyword search; sources included social media platforms Twitter, YouTube, Reddit, Tumblr, as well as blogs, forums, and news articles. Posts were classified into three categories: individual \"pro\"-BWC posts (support for game), individual \"anti\"-BWC posts (opposition to game), and media reports. Timing and location of posts were assessed. RESULTS: Overall, 95,555 social media posts and articles about the BWC were collected. In total, over one-quarter (28.3%) were \"pro\"-BWC. The first U.S. news article related to the BWC was published approximately 4\u00a0months after the first English language U.S. social media post about the BWC and 9\u00a0months after the first U.S. social media post in any language. By the close of the study period, \"pro\"-BWC posts had spread to 127 countries. CONCLUSIONS: Novel online risks to mental health, such as prosuicide games or messages, can spread rapidly and globally. Better understanding social media and Web data may allow for detection of such threats earlier than is currently possible. ",
        "Association between interpregnancy interval and adverse birth outcomes in women with a previous stillbirth: an international cohort study. BACKGROUND: WHO recommends that women wait at least 2 years after a livebirth and at least 6 months after a miscarriage or induced abortion before conceiving again, to reduce the risk of adverse birth outcomes in the subsequent pregnancy. No recommendation exists for the optimal interval after a stillbirth. We investigated the association between interpregnancy interval after stillbirth and birth outcomes in the subsequent pregnancy. METHODS: In this international cohort study, we used data from birth records from Finland (1987-2016), Norway (1980-2015), and Western Australia (1980-2015). Consecutive singleton pregnancies in women whose most recent pregnancy had ended in stillbirth of at least 22 weeks' gestation were included in the analysis. Interpregnancy interval was defined as the time between the end of pregnancy (delivery date) and the start of the next pregnancy (delivery date of next pregnancy minus gestational age at birth). We calculated odds ratios (ORs) for stillbirth, preterm birth, and small-for-gestational-age birth by interpregnancy interval by country, adjusted for maternal age, parity, decade of delivery, and gestational length of the previous pregnancy. A fixed-effects meta-analysis was used to estimate pooled ORs. FINDINGS: We identified 14\u2008452 births in women who had a stillbirth in the previous pregnancy; median interpregnancy interval after stillbirth was 9 months (IQR 4-19). 9109 (63%) women conceived within 12 months of the stillbirth. Of the 14\u2008452 births, 228 (2%) were stillbirths, 2532 (18%) were preterm births, and 1284 (9%) were small-for-gestational-age births. Compared with an interpregnancy interval of 24-59 months, intervals shorter than 12 months were not associated with increased odds of subsequent stillbirth (pooled adjusted OR 1\u00b709 [95% CI 0\u00b763-1\u00b791] for <6 months; 0\u00b790 [0\u00b747-1\u00b771] for 6-11 months), preterm birth (0\u00b791 [0\u00b775-1\u00b711] for <6 months; 0\u00b791 [0\u00b774-1\u00b711] for 6-11 months), or small-for-gestational-age birth (0\u00b766 [0\u00b751-0\u00b785] for <6 months; 0\u00b764 [0\u00b748-0\u00b784] for 6-11 months). Further, we noted no difference in the association between interpregnancy interval and birth outcomes by gestational length of the previous stillbirth. INTERPRETATION: Conception within 12 months of a stillbirth was common and was not associated with increased risk of adverse outcomes in the subsequent pregnancy. These findings could be used when counselling women who are planning future pregnancies after a stillbirth and for informing future recommendations for pregnancy spacing in a high-income setting.

        "Association Between State Minimum Wages and Suicide Rates in the U.S. INTRODUCTION: The suicide rate in the U.S. has been increasing in recent years. Previous studies have consistently identified financial stress as a contributing factor in suicides. Nevertheless, there has been little research on the effect of economic policies that can alleviate financial stress on suicide rates. The purpose of this study is to determine whether increases in state minimum wages have been associated with changes in state suicide rates. METHODS: A retrospective panel data study was conducted. In 2018, linear regression models with state fixed effects were used to estimate the relationship between changes in state minimum wages and suicide rates for all 50U.S. states between 2006 and 2016. Models controlled for time-varying state characteristics that could be associated with changes in minimum wages and suicide rates. RESULTS: There were approximately 432,000 deaths by suicide in the study period. A one-dollar increase in the real minimum wage was associated on average with a 1.9% decrease in the annual state suicide rate in adjusted analyses. This negative association was most consistent in years since 2011. An annual decrease of 1.9% in the suicide rate during the study period would have resulted in roughly 8,000 fewer deaths by suicide. Analyses by race and sex did not reveal substantial variation in the association between minimum wages and suicides. CONCLUSIONS: Increases in real minimum wages have been associated with slower growth in state suicide rates in recent years. Increasing the minimum wage could represent a strategy for addressing increases in suicide rates. ",
        "Suicide Risk Assessment and Management Training Practices in Pediatric Residency Programs: A Nationwide Needs Assessment Survey. PURPOSE: Youth suicide is a public health emergency, and its prevention is a national imperative. Pediatric providers are critical to risk assessment, triage, and intervention, yet little is known about the content, quality, and perceived adequacy of suicide prevention pediatric residency training. We thus sought to (1) characterize suicide risk assessment and management training practices in pediatric residency programs nationwide and (2) assess areas of training need to guide curricular development. METHODS: An online nationwide needs assessment was distributed to all 204 pediatric residency program directors (PDs) and 494 pediatric chief residents (CRs) through the Association of Pediatric Program Directors listservs (May to June 2017). Descriptive statistics and comparisons between PDs and CRs are reported. RESULTS: Ninety-five PDs and 210 CRs (47% and 43% response rate, respectively) completed the survey. Although 82% of respondents rated suicide prevention training in residency as \"very\" or \"extremely\" important, a minority (18% PDs and 10% CRs) reported adequate preparation relative to need. Formal training was not universal (66% PDs and 45% CRs) and practices varied across programs (PD median\u00a0= 3\u00a0hours [interquartile range: 1-4.5\u00a0hours], CR median\u00a0= 1.5\u00a0hours [interquartile range: 0-3\u00a0hours]). Top-ranked educational priorities included interviewing adolescents about risk, risk factor identification, and locating community resources. Training barriers included limited time, lack of training resources, and need for additional expert faculty to guide training. CONCLUSIONS: PDs and CRs reported constraints to suicide prevention training for pediatric residents despite high perceived importance and need. Programs may benefit from explicit guidelines and standardized curricula that emphasize educational priorities, building on these findings. ",
        "Emergency abdominal surgery in patients presenting from skilled nursing facilities: Opportunities for palliative care. BACKGROUND: Residents of skilled nursing facilities (SNF) with acute abdomen present with more comorbidities and frailty than community-dwelling (CD) counterparts. Outcomes in this population are poorly described. METHODS: We hypothesized that SNF patients have higher mortality and morbidity than CD patients. This retrospective review of the NSQIP database from 2011 to 2015 compared outcomes of SNF and CD patients presenting with bowel obstruction, ischemia and perforation. Primary outcomes were in-hospital and 30-day mortality and failure-to-rescue (FTR). RESULTS: 18,326 patients met inclusion criteria. 904 (5%) presented from SNF. In-hospital (26% vs 10%) and 30-day mortality (33% vs 26%) was higher in SNF patients (p\u202f<\u202f0.001). The FTR rate was 34% for SNF patients and 20% for CD patients (p\u202f<\u202f0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Presentation from SNF is an independent predictor of mortality and FTR. Presentation from SNF is a potential trigger for early, concurrent palliative care to assist surgeons, patients, and families in decision making and goal-concordant treatment. ",
        "\"I'd Like to Have More of a Say Because It's My Body\": Adolescents' Perceptions Around Barriers and Facilitators to Shared Decision-Making. PURPOSE: Adolescents living with long-term conditions (LTCs) often feel as though they are left out of discussions and decisions with healthcare professionals, which can give them the impression that their views are not important. Research around decision-making during clinical encounters often fails to represent adolescents' perspectives. This study explores adolescents' perceptions and experiences, focusing on identifying the perceived barriers to, and facilitators for, their involvement in shared decision-making (SDM). METHODS: Nineteen adolescents (aged 13-19\u00a0years) with LTCs were recruited from endocrinology, rheumatology, neurology, and nephrology clinics. Participatory qualitative interviews were conducted using life grids and pie charts, and transcripts were analyzed thematically. RESULTS: Four overarching themes and nine sub-themes were identified which describe barriers and facilitators around SDM. Adolescents need to feel, as though their involvement is supported by parents and healthcare professionals, that their contribution to the decision-making process is important and will yield a positive outcome. Adolescents often feel it is their right to be involved in decisions that affect them but also feel as though the adults' contributions to the decisions are considered more valuable. Adolescents need to feel capable of being involved, in terms of being able to understand and process information about the available options and ask appropriate questions. CONCLUSIONS: This work highlights a number of ways SDM can be facilitated between healthcare practitioners and adolescents with LTCs. Identifying the needs of adolescents with LTCs is necessary for optimizing the SDM process and to support them during healthcare consultations. ",
        "An RCT of Dating Matters: Effects on Teen Dating Violence and Relationship Behaviors. INTRODUCTION: Teen dating violence is a serious public health problem with few effective prevention strategies. This study examines whether the Dating Matters comprehensive prevention model, compared with a standard of care intervention, prevented negative relationship behaviors and promoted positive relationship behaviors. STUDY DESIGN: This longitudinal, cluster-RCT compared the effectiveness of Dating Matters with standard of care across middle school. Standard of care was an evidence-based teen dating violence prevention curriculum (Safe Dates) implemented in eighth grade. SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: Forty-six middle schools in high-risk urban neighborhoods in four U.S. cities were randomized. Schools lost to follow-up were replaced with new schools, which were independently randomized (71% school retention). Students were surveyed in fall and spring of sixth, seventh, and eighth grades (2012-2016). The analysis sample includes students from schools implementing Dating Matters or standard of care for >2 years who started sixth grade in the fall of 2012 or 2013 and had dated (N=2,349 students, mean age 12 years, 49% female, and 55% black, non-Hispanic, 28% Hispanic, 17% other). INTERVENTION: Dating Matters is a comprehensive, multicomponent prevention model including classroom-delivered programs for sixth to eighth graders, training for parents of sixth to eighth graders, educator training, a youth communications program, and local health department activities to assess capacity and track teen dating violence-related policy and data. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Self-reported teen dating violence perpetration and victimization, use of negative conflict resolution strategies, and positive relationship skills were examined as outcomes. Imputation and analyses were conducted in 2017. RESULTS: Latent panel models demonstrated significant program effects for three of four outcomes; Dating Matters students reported 8.43% lower teen dating violence perpetration, 9.78% lower teen dating violence victimization, and 5.52% lower use of negative conflict resolution strategies, on average across time points and cohorts, than standard of care students. There were no significant effects on positive relationship behaviors. CONCLUSIONS: Dating Matters demonstrates comparative effectiveness, through middle school, for reducing unhealthy relationship behaviors, such as teen dating violence and use of negative conflict resolution strategies, relative to the standard of care intervention. TRIAL REGISTRATION: This study is registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov NCT01672541. ",
        "Availability of Naloxone in Pharmacies and Knowledge of Pharmacy Staff Regarding Dispensing Naloxone to Younger Adolescents. PURPOSE: This study assessed the immediate availability of naloxone in pharmacies and the knowledge of pharmacy staff regarding naloxone dispensing protocols, especially as it relates to younger adolescents. METHODS: The primary sample included pharmacies in the 10 states with the highest number of opioid-related overdose deaths in 2016; in addition, pharmacies in the 2 states with the highest prevalence of opioid-related overdose deaths in 2016 were also contacted. Researchers simulated a routine conversation between pharmacy staff and a potential customer about the immediate availability of and requirements to purchase naloxone. RESULTS: The primary sample included 120 pharmacies (82.5% chain pharmacies; 50.8% rural). The majority (80.3%) had at least one form of naloxone in stock. Pharmacy staff were knowledgeable about prescription and third-party purchasing requirements. However, almost half incorrectly responded that there was a minimum age requirement to purchase naloxone. CONCLUSION: This study reveals barriers to obtaining naloxone, including a lack of immediate in-store availability and a common misperception that naloxone cannot be dispensed to minors. ",
        "Gender Minority Mental Health in the U.S.: Results of a National Survey on College Campuses. INTRODUCTION: The purpose of this study was to examine mental health status by gender identity among undergraduate and graduate students. METHODS: Data came from the 2015-2017 Healthy Minds Study, a mobile survey of randomly selected students (N=65,213 at 71 U.S. campuses, including 1,237 gender minority [GM] students); data were analyzed in 2018. Outcomes were symptoms of depression, anxiety, eating disorders, self-injury, and suicidality based on widely used, clinically validated screening instruments. Bivariable and multivariable analyses explored differences between GM and cisgender (non-GM) students as well as by assigned sex at birth. RESULTS: Across mental health measures, a significantly higher prevalence of symptoms was observed in GM students than cisgender students. Compared with 45% of cisgender students, 78% of GM students met the criteria for 1 or more of the aforementioned mental health outcomes. GM status was associated with 4.3 times higher odds of having at least 1 mental health problem (95% CI=3.61, 5.12). CONCLUSIONS: Findings from this largest campus-based study of its kind using representative data with both gender identity and mental health measures underscore the importance of recognizing and addressing GM mental health burdens, such as by screening for mental health and providing gender-affirming services. There is broad urgency to identify protective factors and reduce mental health inequities for this vulnerable population. ",
        "Global Collaboration to Modernize Advanced Trauma Life Support Training. BACKGROUND: Each year, thousands of surgeons and other trauma health care providers participate in the American College of Surgeon's Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS) program, which historically has allowed trainees to practice cricothyroidotomy, chest tube insertion, pericardiocentesis, venous cutdown, and diagnostic peritoneal lavage on live dogs, pigs, sheep, and goats. However, more than 99% of ATLS programs in the United States and Canada have now ended animal use, driven primarily by simulation technology advancements. OBJECTIVE: This review details an international survey of animal versus simulation use in ATLS programs and summarizes the surgical training impact of a novel collaboration between the industry manufacturer of the TraumaMan human simulator, Simulab Corporation (Seattle, Washington), and an animal protection nongovernmental organization (NGO) based in Norfolk, Virginia, to replace animal use in ATLS programs with human simulators. METHODS: From 2012 through 2017, the NGO e-mailed formal surveys concerning program statistics and animal use practices to ATLS officials in various countries (N\u202f=\u202f64). The survey response rate was 87.5% and included pre- and post-comparison surveys relative to the industry-NGO simulation collaboration. RESULTS: Eighteen ATLS programs (32.1%) initially replied that they use nonanimal training methods, whereas 38 ATLS programs (67.8%) replied that they use animals for surgical skills training and cited financial constraints as the primary barrier to adopting human simulation methods. Through the industry-NGO collaboration, the NGO donated 119 TraumaMan models valued at nearly $3 million (USD) to ATLS programs in 22 countries, such that 75% of those ATLS programs surveyed by the NGO now use exclusively nonanimal simulation models. CONCLUSIONS: The industry-NGO collaboration successfully transformed the surgical skills laboratories of 22 international ATLS programs to replace animal use with nonanimal simulation models that are more anatomically realistic, cost less, and allow trainees to repeat surgical skills until proficiency.

        "Risk of Stroke With E-Cigarette and Combustible Cigarette Use in Young Adults. INTRODUCTION: Rising trends in stroke incidence and hospitalizations because of combustible cigarette smoking have been noted among younger adults. However, the association between e-cigarette use and stroke in this population remains largely unknown. This study examines the association between e-cigarette use with or without a history of previous or concurrent combustible cigarette use and stroke among young adults. METHODS: Pooled data (2016-2017) were analyzed from the Behavior Risk Factor Surveillance System, a nationally representative, cross-sectional telephone survey, in 2019. The sample size was 161,529 participants aged 18-44 years. The association between e-cigarette use and stroke was examined using logistic regression adjusting for patient demographics, relevant comorbidities without or with history, and concurrent use of combustible cigarette use. RESULTS: Current dual use of e-cigarettes and combustible cigarettes was associated with 2.91 times higher odds of stroke versus nonsmokers (AOR=2.91, 95% CI=1.62, 5.25) and 1.83 times higher odds versus current sole combustible cigarette users (AOR=1.83, 95% CI=1.06, 3.17). Compared with nonsmokers, current sole e-cigarette users did not show significantly different odds of stroke (AOR=0.69, 95% CI=0.34, 1.42). However, odds of stroke were lower for sole e-cigarette users versus current sole combustible cigarette users (AOR=0.43, 95% CI=0.20, 0.93). CONCLUSIONS: Sole e-cigarette use is not associated with greater odds of stroke in young adults. However, if young adults have former or current combustible cigarette use, odds of stroke are significantly increased even compared with current sole combustible cigarette use. Switching from combustible cigarettes to e-cigarettes does not confer stroke benefits. ",
        "Implementation of non-communicable disease policies: a geopolitical analysis of 151 countries. BACKGROUND: Most countries have endorsed WHO non-communicable disease (NCD) best buy policies, but we know very little about global implementation patterns and about the geopolitical factors affecting implementation. We aimed to assess global implementation based on analysis of multiple geopolitical datasets. METHODS: We used the 2015 and 2017 WHO NCD progress monitor reports to calculate aggregate implementation scores for 151 countries, based on their implementation of 18 WHO-recommended NCD policies. We ranked all countries and used descriptive statistics to analyse global trends. We used linear regression to assess the associations between policy implementation and World Bank geographic region, risk of premature NCD mortality, percentage of all deaths caused by NCDs, World Bank income group, human capital index, democracy index, and tax burden. FINDINGS: In 2017, the mean NCD policy implementation score was 49\u00b73% (SD 18\u00b74%). Costa Rica and Iran had the joint-highest implementation scores (86\u00b71% of all WHO-recommended policies). Scores were lowest in Haiti and South Sudan (5\u00b75%). Between 2015 and 2017, aggregate implementation scores rose in 109 countries and regressed in 32 countries. Mean implementation rose for all of the 18 policies except for those targeting alcohol and physical activity. The most commonly implemented policies were clinical guidelines, graphic warnings on tobacco packaging, and NCD risk factor surveys. Our multiple linear regression model explained 61\u00b71% of the variance in 2017 aggregate scores (p<0\u00b70001), but we found evidence of a high degree of collinearity between the explanatory variables. INTERPRETATION: Implementation of WHO-recommended NCD policies is increasing over time. On average, countries implemented just under half of the NCD policies recommended by WHO in 2017. Nutrition-related policies saw gains, while those related to alcohol and physical activity were the most likely to have been dropped. Aggregate implementation scores tended to be highest in high-income countries that invest in health care and education.

        "The Relationship between Marijuana Use Prior to Sex and Sexual Function in Women. INTRODUCTION: Scientific research on the effects of marijuana on sexual functioning in women, including libido, arousal, orgasm, and satisfaction, is limited. AIM: To evaluate women's perceptions of the effect of marijuana use before sexual activity. METHODS: A cross-sectional design, from March 2016-February 2017, within a single, academic, obstetrics and gynecology practice, was performed. Patients were given a questionnaire at their visit and asked to complete it anonymously and place it in a locked box after their visit. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was satisfaction in the sexual domains of drive, orgasm, lubrication, dyspareunia, and overall sexual experience. The secondary outcome was the effect of the frequency of marijuana use on satisfaction. RESULTS: Of the 373 participants, 34.0% (n\u00a0= 127) reported having used marijuana before sexual activity. Most women reported increases in sex drive, improvement in orgasm, decrease in pain, but no change in lubrication. After adjusting for race, women who reported marijuana use before sexual activity had 2.13 higher odds of reporting satisfactory orgasms (adjusted odds ratio\u00a0= 2.13; 95% CI\u00a0= 1.05, 4.35) than women who reported no marijuana use. After adjusting for race and age, women with frequent marijuana use, regardless of use before sex or not, had 2.10 times higher odds of reporting satisfactory orgasms than those with infrequent marijuana use (adjusted odds ratio\u00a0= 2.10; 95% CI\u00a0= 1.01-4.44). CONCLUSION: Marijuana appears to improve satisfaction with orgasm. A better understanding of the role of the endocannabinoid system in women is important, because there is a paucity of literature, and it could help lead to development of treatments for female sexual dysfunction.

        "Reported Knowledge of Typical Daily Calorie Requirements: Relationship to Demographic Characteristics in US Adults. BACKGROUND: US obesity rates are at historically high levels, increasing the risk of negative health and economic outcomes at individual and population levels. Findings from earlier studies indicate that many consumers lack a clear understanding of calorie needs, potentially affecting their ability to manage caloric intake. OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to determine the knowledge of typical daily calorie needs of US adults by demographic and other characteristics, using a nationally representative sample. DESIGN: Data were analyzed from 6,267 respondents to the 2007-2008 and 2009-2010 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey and its supplemental data source, the Flexible Consumer Behavior Survey, to assess reported knowledge of typical daily calorie requirements and associations with demographic and other characteristics of interest. STATISTICAL ANALYSES PERFORMED: Logistic regression for complex sample surveys was used to estimate associations between self-reported daily calorie needs for men and women aged 21 years and older and participant characteristics. RESULTS: Most respondents accurately reported typical daily calorie needs for a person of their sex, age group, and physical activity level, however, distinct differences emerged between demographic groups. Women, non-Hispanic whites, and those with higher income and education levels were more likely to estimate typical daily calorie needs accurately; men were almost four times more likely than women to indicate a lack of knowledge of daily calorie needs. CONCLUSIONS: Knowledge of typical daily calorie requirements is a foundational concept of nutrition literacy. Educational efforts to increase awareness, knowledge, and use of calorie information for certain groups may be helpful to refine interventions and ultimately improve public health in the United States.

        "National Prevalence of Sexual Violence by a Workplace-Related Perpetrator. INTRODUCTION: Workplace sexual violence is not a new phenomenon but has received increased attention recently with the re-emergence of the #metoo movement. Gaps exist in the understanding of the prevalence of this problem in the U.S., its perpetrators, and its impacts. METHODS: Using 2010-2012 data from the National Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Survey (22,590 women and 18,584 men), this study examined the prevalence of several types of sexual violence by a workplace-related perpetrator (authority figure or nonauthority figure) and numerous impacts of the violence, including psychological impacts, safety concerns, and missing days of work or school. Data were analyzed in 2018. RESULTS: In the U.S., 5.6% of women (almost 7 million) and 2.5% of men (nearly 3 million) reported some type of sexual violence by a workplace-related perpetrator. Almost 4% of women (3.9%) reported sexual violence by nonauthority figures and 2.1% reported authority figures; 2.0% of men reported sexual violence by nonauthority figures, and 0.6% reported authority figures. For women, the most commonly reported sexual violence type was unwanted sexual contact (3.5% of women); for men, it was noncontact unwanted sexual experiences (1.3% of men). An estimated 1 million women (0.8%) have been raped by a workplace-related perpetrator. For women and men, fear was the most commonly reported impact of workplace-related sexual violence. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that workplace prevention efforts that do not address different components of workplace harassment may not be adequate to address all forms of sexual violence occurring across the U.S. in the workplace context.

        "Foods and Beverages Obtained at Worksites in the United States. BACKGROUND: Nutrition interventions are a common component of worksite wellness programs and have been recognized as an effective strategy to change employee dietary behaviors. However, little is known about worksite food behaviors or the foods that are obtained at workplaces at the national level. OBJECTIVE: The aims were to examine the frequency of and the amount of money spent obtaining foods at work among employed US adults, to determine the foods most commonly obtained at work, and to assess the dietary quality of these foods. DESIGN: This is a cross-sectional analysis of data from the US Department of Agriculture Food Acquisition and Purchasing Survey, a nationally representative household survey conducted from April 2012 through January 2013 on food purchases and acquisitions during a 7-day study period. PARTICIPANTS: The study included 5,222 employed adult Americans. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The study assessed the prevalence of obtaining any foods at work overall and according to sociodemographic subgroups, number of acquisitions and calories obtained, most commonly obtained foods and leading food sources of calories, and 2010 Healthy Eating Index (HEI) scores that represent dietary quality. STATISTICAL ANALYSES PERFORMED: Prevalence estimates of obtaining \u22651 foods at work were compared according to sociodemographic characteristic using \u03c72 tests. RESULTS: Nearly a quarter (23.4%) of working adults obtained foods at work during the week, and the foods they obtained averaged 1,292 kcal per person per week. The leading food types obtained included foods typically high in solid fat, added sugars, or sodium, such as pizza, regular soft drinks, cookies or brownies, cakes and pies, and candy. HEI scores suggest that work foods are high in empty calories, sodium, and refined grains and low in whole grains and fruit. CONCLUSIONS: Working adults commonly obtain foods at work, and the foods they obtain have limited dietary quality. Future research should examine the role worksites can play to help ensure access to and promote healthier options. ",
        "Yoga as Antihypertensive Lifestyle Therapy: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the efficacy of yoga as antihypertensive lifestyle therapy and identify moderators that account for variability in the blood pressure (BP) response to yoga. METHODS: We systematically searched 6 electronic databases from inception through June 4, 2018, for articles published in English language journals on trials of yoga interventions that involved adult participants, reported preintervention and postintervention BP, and had a nonexercise/nondiet control group. Our search yielded 49 qualifying controlled trials (56 interventions). We (1) evaluated the risk of bias and methodological study quality, (2) performed meta-regression analysis following random-effects assumptions, and (3) generated additive models that represented the largest possible clinically relevant BP reductions. RESULTS: On average, the 3517 trial participants were middle-aged (49.2\u00b119.5 years), overweight (27.9\u00b13.6 kg/m2) adults with high BP (systolic BP, 129.3\u00b113.3 mm Hg; diastolic BP, 80.7\u00b18.4 mm Hg). Yoga was practiced 4.8\u00b13.4 sessions per week for 59.2\u00b125.0 minutes per session for 13.2\u00b17.5 weeks. On average, yoga elicited moderate reductions in systolic BP (weighted mean effect size, -0.47; 95% CI, -0.62-0.32, -5.0 mm Hg) and diastolic BP (weighted mean effect size, -0.47; 95% CI, -0.61 to -0.32; -3.9 mm Hg) compared with controls (P<.001 for both systolic BP and diastolic BP). Controlling for publication bias and methodological study quality, when yoga was practiced 3 sessions per week among samples with hypertension, yoga interventions that included breathing techniques and meditation/mental relaxation elicited BP reductions of 11/6 mm Hg compared with those that did not (ie, 6/3 mm Hg). CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that yoga is a viable antihypertensive lifestyle therapy that produces the greatest BP benefits when breathing techniques and meditation/mental relaxation are included. Soft Tissue and Bony Injuries Attributed to the Practice of Yoga: A Biomechanical Analysis and Implications for Management. OBJECTIVE: To analyze injuries that were directly associated with yoga practice and identify specific poses that should be avoided in patients with osteopenia or osteoporosis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of patients with injuries that were primarily caused by yoga. Patients were seen from January 1, 2006, through December 31, 2018. Injuries were categorized into 3 groups: (1) soft tissue injury, (2) axial nonbony injury, and (3) bony injury. Patients underwent evaluation and were counseled to modify exercise activity. RESULTS: We identified 89 patients for inclusion in the study. Within the soft tissue group, 66 patients (74.2%) had mechanical myofascial pain due to overuse. Rotator cuff injury was seen in 6 (6.7%), and trochanteric bursopathy was observed in 1 (1.1%). In the axial group, exacerbation of pain in degenerative joint disease (46 patients [51.7%]) and facet arthropathy (n=34 [38.2%]) were observed. Radiculopathy was seen in 5 patients (5.6%). Within the bony injury category, kyphoscoliosis was seen on imaging in 15 patients (16.9%). Spondylolisthesis was present in 15 patients (16.9%). Anterior wedging was seen in 16 (18.0%), and compression fractures were present in 13 (14.6%). The poses that were most commonly identified as causing the injuries involved hyperflexion and hyperextension of the spine. We correlated the kinesiologic effect of such exercises on specific musculoskeletal structures. CONCLUSION: Yoga potentially has many benefits, but care must be taken when performing positions with extreme spinal flexion and extension. Patients with osteopenia or osteoporosis may have higher risk of compression fractures or deformities and would benefit from avoiding extreme spinal flexion. Physicians should consider this risk when discussing yoga as exercise. ",
        "Characteristics and Precipitating Circumstances of Suicide Among Incarcerated Youth. OBJECTIVE: Studies show incarcerated youth are at increased risk for suicidal behavior, yet little is known about factors associated with suicide for this population. Using a nationally representative sample, this study examined characteristics and precipitating circumstances of suicide in incarcerated youth decedents compared with youth suicide decedents in the general population. METHOD: Data were analyzed for suicide decedents 10- to 24-years-old (N\u00a0= 10,126) in the United States from 2003 through 2012 from the National Violent Death Reporting System. Logistic regression compared precipitating circumstances of suicide for incarcerated youth decedents and those not in custody. Details on suicide deaths in detained youth were captured from coroner/medical examiner and law enforcement reports associated with each incident. RESULTS: Most youth suicide decedents were older, white, and male regardless of incarceration status. Incarcerated youth suicide decedents were more likely to die by hanging, strangulation, or suffocation and less likely to disclose suicide intent, leave a suicide note, or exhibit depressive symptoms compared with those not in custody. Additional risk factors for suicide were not significantly different between youth decedents in custody and those not in custody, suggesting that unique aspects of the incarceration environment could be associated with an increased risk of suicide. CONCLUSION: Study findings highlight the need for early suicide risk detection and developmentally relevant interventions tailored for youth in correctional settings. Future efforts should include evaluation studies to support suicide prevention programs designed for incarcerated youth and research that examines distinctive factors associated with suicidal behavior in youth in custody.

        "What exercise advice are women receiving from their healthcare practitioners during pregnancy?. BACKGROUND: Exercise during pregnancy is associated with a variety of health benefits for both mother and child. Despite these benefits, few Australian pregnant women are sufficiently active to meet current exercise during pregnancy guidelines. Healthcare practitioners can play an instrumental role in encouraging women to be active during their pregnancy through the provision of clear and accurate exercise advice. However, little is known about the exercise advice that pregnant women receive from Healthcare practitioners. METHODS: Regionally-based Australian women were asked to self-report the exercise advice they received from their Healthcare practitioners during their pregnancy via a survey during one of their clinic visits. RESULTS: Of the 131 participants, 53% (n=70) reported receiving some form of exercise advice from their Healthcare practitioner. Specifically, frequency of exercise was discussed among 34% of the participants (n=23) while exercise intensity 57% was discussed among 57% of the participants (n=38). Exercise duration was discussed among 39% of participants (n=26) and types of exercise was discussed among 84% of the participants (n=56). In most instances, participants report receiving advice not in accordance with current exercise during pregnancy guidelines. CONCLUSIONS: Healthcare practitioners may not be actively providing advice to pregnant women about their exercise behaviours. Of the advice that is provided, it may not in accordance with current evidence-based exercise during pregnancy guidelines. Whilst healthcare practitioners may be uniquely positioned to provide exercise advice to pregnant women, they may not have the necessary knowledge, training or support to provide specific exercise advice.

        "The Contribution of Snacking to Overall Diet Intake among an Ethnically and Racially Diverse Population of Boys and Girls. BACKGROUND: Children in low-income and minority populations are at risk for poor dietary quality. At least one-third of the calories consumed by children are eaten between meals (ie, snacks). The contribution of snacking to diet quality among children is poorly understood. OBJECTIVE: The current study examined associations between snacking and children's diet quality along with differences across ethnicity or race, sex, and weight status. DESIGN: Cross-sectional data came from Phase I of the Family Matters Study, an observational study. PARTICIPANTS/SETTING: This study included 150 families with children aged 5 to 7 years old from six ethnic or racial groups (n=25 from each: African American, Hispanic, Hmong, Native American, Somali, non-Hispanic white); data were collected in Minneapolis-Saint Paul, MN in 2017-2018. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Total daily energy (kilocalories), overall diet quality using the Healthy Eating Index (HEI-2010), and food group intakes (eg, fruit, vegetables, refined grains, sugar-sweetened beverages [SSB]) were assessed using three 24-hour dietary recalls. STATISTICAL ANALYSES PERFORMED: Conditional fixed effects estimators (within-child variation) were used in regression analyses to characterize the relationship between daily snacking and dietary intake relative to dietary intake at all other daily meal occasions. Mean (\u00b1standard deviation) overall dietary intake including all meals and snacks was compared with mean (\u00b1standard deviation) intake of meals only. RESULTS: Among boys, snacking was found to contribute positively to HEI-2010 scores (HEI-2010=57.6, HEI-2010 without snacks=55.0; effect size [ES]=0.28, P=0.03). Snacking was an important source of fruit (ES=0.71) and dairy (ES=0.53), but also contributed to children's consumption of refined grains (ES=0.68) and SSB (ES=0.31). Very few vegetables were consumed as snacks. Furthermore, snacks contributed more to the overall diet quality (HEI-2010) of Native American (ES=0.30) and Somali (ES=0.35) youth as compared with youth from other ethnic or racial backgrounds. CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest that snacks have the potential to improve diet quality in children. Future research should examine influences on children's food choices at snack times and barriers to serving more healthful foods as snacks that are faced by ethnically or racially diverse families.

        "Declined care and discrimination during the childbirth hospitalization. Many studies have documented poorer patient-provider interactions among people of color compared to Whites, including lower-quality patient-provider communication, less involvement in decision making, and higher chances of perceived discrimination in healthcare encounters. In maternity care, where overuse of medical interventions such as cesarean delivery is a concern, women may try to exert agency by declining procedures. However, declining procedures may brand these women as uncooperative or non-compliant patients. The potential consequences of this are likely worse for women of color, who already expend more effort to manage their image during healthcare encounters in order to avoid stereotypes (e.g. the \"angry Black woman\"). Using a national sample of women who gave birth in U.S. hospitals in 2011-2012, we examined the relationship between declining procedures and discrimination during the childbirth hospitalization. We found that women who reported having declined care for themselves or their infant during the childbirth hospitalization were more likely to report \"poor treatment\" based on race and ethnicity, insurance status or having a difference of opinion with a healthcare provider. Moreover, the increase in odds of perceived discrimination due to a difference of opinion with a healthcare provider was significantly larger in magnitude for Black women compared to White women. These results suggest that in the context of childbirth care, women pay a penalty for exhibiting behavior that may be perceived as uncooperative, and this penalty may be greater for Black women. ",
        "Mutation of the co-chaperone Tsc1 in bladder cancer diminishes Hsp90 acetylation and reduces drug sensitivity and selectivity. The molecular chaperone Heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) is essential for the folding, stability, and activity of several drivers of oncogenesis. Hsp90 inhibitors are currently under clinical evaluation for cancer treatment, however their efficacy is limited by lack of biomarkers to optimize patient selection. We have recently identified the tumor suppressor tuberous sclerosis complex 1 (Tsc1) as a new co-chaperone of Hsp90 that affects Hsp90 binding to its inhibitors. Highly variable mutations of TSC1 have been previously identified in bladder cancer and correlate with sensitivity to the Hsp90 inhibitors. Here we showed loss of TSC1 leads to hypoacetylation of Hsp90-K407/K419 and subsequent decreased binding to the Hsp90 inhibitor ganetespib. Pharmacologic inhibition of histone deacetylases (HDACs) restores acetylation of Hsp90 and sensitizes Tsc1-mutant bladder cancer cells to ganetespib, resulting in apoptosis. Our findings suggest that TSC1 status may predict response to Hsp90 inhibitors in patients with bladder cancer, and co-targeting HDACs can sensitize tumors with Tsc1 mutations to Hsp90 inhibitors. ",
        "Conclusions from a behavioral aging study on male and female F2 hybrid mice on age-related behavior, buoyancy in water-based tests, and an ethical method to assess lifespan. Due to strain-specific behavioral idiosyncrasies, inbred mouse strains are suboptimal research models for behavioral aging studies. The aim of this study is to determine age-related behavioral changes of F2 hybrid C57BL/6NxBALB/c male and female mice. Lifespan was followed (nmales=48, nfemales=51) and cohorts of mature adult (7 months), middle-aged (15 months), and old mice (22 months of age; n=7-12 per group) were assessed regarding open-field activity, exploration, passive avoidance learning/memory, and depressive-like behavior. We found that both males and females demonstrated decreased exploratory behavior with age, while memory and depressive-like behavior were maintained. Females exhibited enhanced depressive-like behavior compared to males; however, a correlation between fat mass and swimming activity in the test directly accounted for 30-46% of this behavioral sex difference. In addition, we suggest a method to qualitatively estimate natural lifespan from survival analyses in which animals with signs of pain or severe disease are euthanized. This is, to our knowledge, the first behavioral study to consider both sex and aging in hybrid mice. We here define decreased exploratory behavior as a conserved hallmark of aging independent of sex, highlight the effect of buoyancy in water tests, and provide a method to assay lifespan with reduced animal suffering.

        "Structural insights into E1 recognition and the ubiquitin-conjugating activity of the E2 enzyme Cdc34. Ubiquitin (Ub) signaling requires the sequential interactions and activities of three enzymes, E1, E2, and E3. Cdc34 is an E2 that plays a key role in regulating cell cycle progression and requires unique structural elements to function. The molecular basis by which Cdc34 engages its E1 and the structural mechanisms by which its unique C-terminal extension functions in Cdc34 activity are unknown. Here, we present crystal structures of Cdc34 alone and in complex with E1, and a Cdc34~Ub thioester mimetic that represents the product of Uba1-Cdc34 Ub transthiolation. These structures reveal conformational changes in Uba1 and Cdc34 and a unique binding mode that are required for transthiolation. The Cdc34~Ub structure reveals contacts between the Cdc34 C-terminal extension and Ub that stabilize Cdc34~Ub in a closed conformation and are critical for Ub discharge. Altogether, our structural, biochemical, and cell-based studies provide insights into the molecular mechanisms by which Cdc34 function in cells. ",
        "Impact of Glycemic Control on Risk of Mortality and Complications in Trauma Patients. The impact of diabetes mellitus on outcomes in trauma patients continues to attract interest, but data regarding the impact of longer term glycemic control are still lacking. This study evaluated the effect of long-term glycemic control on outcomes. Trauma patients presenting to the University of Alabama at Birmingham Hospital, between 2011 and 2018, were stratified into 4 groups, based on admission HbA1C level. A Poisson regression with robust error variance was used to estimate risk ratios and associated confidence intervals for the association between HbA1C and specific outcomes. A total of 26,134 patients were included. Patients without diabetes or excellent glycemic control (ND-EGC) had shorter hospital and ICU stay as well as fewer days on ventilator support. Compared with those with ND-EGC, the renal failure risk was higher for those with moderate (risk ratio [RR] 2.53, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.76-3.63) and poor glycemic control (RR 3.20, 95% CI 2.18-4.71). Urinary tract infection risk was also higher for those with poor control (RR 1.83, 95% CI 1.17-2.02). Observed associations were of similar strength for pneumonia and mortality for all less-than-excellent glycemic control groups. In conclusion, trauma patients with worse long-term glycemic control had increased risks of developing pneumonia, renal failure, urinary tract infection, and death. HbA1c can prognosticate the risks and outcomes of diabetic trauma patients. ",
        "Colorectal Cancer Care among Young Adult Patients after the Dependent Coverage Expansion under the Affordable Care Act. The impact of the Dependent Coverage Expansion (DCE) under the Affordable Care Act (ACA) on receipt of colorectal cancer treatment has yet to be determined. We identified newly diagnosed DCE-eligible (aged 19-25 years, n\u2009=\u20091,924) and DCE-ineligible (aged 27-34 years, n\u2009=\u20098,313) colorectal cancer patients from the National Cancer Database during 2007-2013. All statistical tests were two-sided. Post-ACA, there was a statistically significant increase in early stage diagnosis among DCE-eligible (15 percentage points increase, p<.001), but not DCE-ineligible (p\u2009=\u2009.09) patients. DCE-eligible patients resected for IIB-IIIC colorectal cancer were more likely to receive timely adjuvant chemotherapy (HR\u2009=\u20091.34, CI\u2009=\u20091.05, 1.71; 7.0 days decrease in restricted mean time from surgery to chemotherapy, p=.01), with no differences in DCE-ineligible patients (HR\u2009=\u20091.10, CI\u2009=\u20090.98, 1.24; 2.1 days decrease, p=.41) post-ACA. Our findings highlight the role of the ACA in improving access to potentially life-saving cancer care, including a shift to early-stage diagnosis and more timely receipt of adjuvant chemotherapy. ",
        "Acetazolamide does not alter endurance exercise performance at 3,500-m altitude. Acetazolamide (AZ) is a medication commonly used to prevent acute mountain sickness (AMS) during rapid ascent to high altitude. However, it is unclear whether AZ use impairs exercise performance; previous literature regarding this topic is equivocal. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of AZ on time-trial (TT) performance during a 30-h exposure to hypobaric hypoxia equivalent to 3,500-m altitude. Ten men [sea-level peak oxygen consumption (VO2peak): 50.8\u2009\u00b1\u20096.5 mL\u00b7kg-1\u00b7min-1; body fat %: 20.6\u2009\u00b1\u20095.2%] completed 2 30-h exposures at 3,500 m. In a crossover study design, subjects were given 500 mg/day of either AZ or a placebo. Exercise testing was completed 2 h and 24 h after ascent and consisted of 15-min steady-state treadmill walking at 40%-45% sea-level VO2peak, followed by a 2-mile self-paced treadmill TT. AMS was assessed after ~12 h and 22 h at 3,500 m. The incidence of AMS decreased from 40% with placebo to 0% with AZ. Oxygen saturation was higher (P < 0.05) in AZ versus placebo trials at the end of the TT after 2 h (85\u2009\u00b1\u20093% vs. 79\u2009\u00b1\u20093%) and 24 h (86\u2009\u00b1\u20093% vs. 81\u2009\u00b1\u20094%). There was no difference in time to complete 2 miles between AZ and PL after 2 h (20.7\u2009\u00b1\u20093.2 vs. 22.7\u2009\u00b1\u20095.0 min, P > 0.05) or 24 h (21.5\u2009\u00b1\u20093.4 vs. 21.1\u2009\u00b1\u20092.9 min, P > 0.05) of exposure to altitude. Our results suggest that AZ (500 mg/day) does not negatively impact endurance exercise performance at 3,500 m.NEW & NOTEWORTHY To our knowledge, this is the first study to examine the impact of acetazolamide (500 mg/day) versus placebo on self-paced, peak-effort exercise performance using a short-duration exercise test in a hypobaric hypoxic environment with a repeated-measures design. In the present study, acetazolamide did not impact exercise performance after 2-h or 24-h exposure to 3,500-m simulated altitude. ",
        "Antiretroviral Prescribing Practices Among Pregnant Women Living With HIV in the United States, 2008-2017. Importance: Since 1994, the US Department of Health and Human Services has published treatment guidelines for pregnant women living with HIV. Understanding how well prescribing patterns correspond with treatment guidelines could inform health policy and influence future clinical practice. Objectives: To compare antiretroviral prescribing practices over time among pregnant women living with HIV with Department of Health and Human Services treatment guidelines and identify factors associated with receiving recommended regimens. Design, Setting, and Participants: A prospective cohort study of 1582 pregnant women living with HIV were enrolled in the Pediatric HIV/AIDS Cohort Study Surveillance Monitoring of ART (antiretroviral therapy) Toxicities study between January 1, 2008, and June 30, 2017. The study was conducted at 18 academic research hospitals in the United States. Exposures: Antiretroviral medications (ARVs) prescribed during pregnancy. Main Outcomes and Measures: Proportion of regimens prescribed to pregnant women living with HIV qualifying as preferred or alternative according to Department of Health and Human Services guidelines, stratified by timing of initiation. Results: Of 1867 pregnancies (among 1582 pregnant women living with HIV with a mean [SD] age of 28.6 [6.1] years at conception), 1264 (67.7%) occurred among women self-identified as black, 480 (25.7%) self-identified as white, and 123 (6.6%) self-identified as other or unreported race/ethnicity. Antiretroviral medications were initiated prior to conception for 790 women (42.3%), resumed during pregnancy for 625 women (33.5%), and initiated during pregnancy for 452 women (24.2%). Only 925 pregnancies (49.5%) were associated with prescribed ARVs designated as preferred or alternative, while 492 (26.4%) involved ARVs with insufficient evidence for use during pregnancy and 136 (7.3%) involved ARVs that were not recommended during pregnancy. A higher proportion of treatment-naive pregnant women initiating ARVs were prescribed preferred or alternative ARVs compared with those resuming ARVs or those treated with ARVs before conception (316 of 452 [69.9%] vs 325 of 625 [52.0%] vs 284 of 790 [35.9%]; P\u2009<\u2009.001). A total of 91 of 452 women (20.1%) initiating ARVs during pregnancy were prescribed ARVs with insufficient evidence for use during pregnancy or not recommended during pregnancy. Among women resuming ARVs, those with a viral load greater than 1000 copies/mL early in pregnancy had higher odds of being prescribed guideline-recommended ARVs (adjusted odds ratio, 2.03 [95% CI, 1.33-3.10]) compared with those with a viral load of 400 copies/mL or less. Conclusions and Relevance: This study suggests that US ARV prescribing practices for pregnant women living with HIV do not align well with national guidelines. This finding is particularly concerning when treatment is initiated during pregnancy. Further research is needed to understand disparities between prescribing practices and evidence-based guideline recommendations. ",
        "Artificial Inclusion Bodies for Clinical Development. Bacterial inclusion bodies (IBs) are mechanically stable protein particles in the microscale, which behave as robust, slow-protein-releasing amyloids. Upon exposure to cultured cells or upon subcutaneous or intratumor injection, these protein materials secrete functional IB polypeptides, functionally mimicking the endocrine release of peptide hormones from secretory amyloid granules. Being appealing as delivery systems for prolonged protein drug release, the development of IBs toward clinical applications is, however, severely constrained by their bacterial origin and by the undefined and protein-to-protein, batch-to-batch variable composition. In this context, the de novo fabrication of artificial IBs (ArtIBs) by simple, cell-free physicochemical methods, using pure components at defined amounts is proposed here. By this, the resulting functional protein microparticles are intriguing, chemically defined biomimetic materials that replicate relevant functionalities of natural IBs, including mammalian cell penetration and local or remote release of functional ArtIB-forming protein.

        "Neutrophil content predicts lymphocyte depletion and anti-PD1 treatment failure in NSCLC. Immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) treatment has recently become a first-line therapy for many non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. Unfortunately, most NSCLC patients are refractory to ICI monotherapy, and initial attempts to address this issue with secondary therapeutics have proven unsuccessful. To identify entities precluding CD8+ T cell accumulation in this process, we performed unbiased analyses on flow cytometry, gene expression, and multiplexed immunohistochemical data from a NSCLC patient cohort. The results revealed the presence of a myeloid-rich subgroup, which was devoid of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Of all myeloid cell types assessed, neutrophils were the most highly associated with the myeloid phenotype. Additionally, the ratio of CD8+ T cells to neutrophils (CD8/PMN) within the tumor mass optimally distinguished between active and myeloid cases. This ratio was also capable of showing the separation of patients responsive to ICI therapy from those with stable or progressive disease in 2 independent cohorts. Tumor-bearing mice treated with a combination of anti-PD1 and SX-682 (CXCR1/2 inhibitor) displayed relocation of lymphocytes from the tumor periphery into a malignant tumor, which was associated with induction of IFN-\u03b3-responsive genes. These results suggest that neutrophil antagonism may represent a viable secondary therapeutic strategy to enhance ICI treatment outcomes. ",
        "Electronic cigarette vapour increases virulence and inflammatory potential of respiratory pathogens. INTRODUCTION: Bacteria have been extensively implicated in the development of smoking related diseases, such as COPD, by either direct infection or bacteria-mediated inflammation. In response to the health risks associated with tobacco exposure, the use of electronic cigarettes (e-cigs) has increased. This study compared the effect of e-cig vapour (ECV) and cigarette smoke (CSE) on the virulence and inflammatory potential of key lung pathogens (Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa). METHODS: Biofilm formation, virulence in the Galleria mellonella infection model, antibiotic susceptibility and IL-8/TNF-\u03b1 production in A549 cells, were compared between bacteria exposed to ECV, CSE and non-exposed bacteria. RESULTS: Statistically significant increases in biofilm and cytokine secretion were observed following bacterial exposure to either ECV or CSE, compared to non-exposed bacteria; the effect of exposure to ECV on bacterial phenotype and virulence was comparable, and in some cases greater, than that observed following CSE exposure. Treatment of A549 cells with cell signaling pathway inhibitors prior to infection, did not suggest that alternative signaling pathways were being activated following exposure of bacteria to either ECV or CSE. CONCLUSIONS: These findings therefore suggest that ECV and CSE can induce changes in phenotype and virulence of key lung pathogens, which may increase bacterial persistence and inflammatory potential.

        "Edematous severe acute malnutrition is characterized by hypomethylation of DNA. Edematous severe acute childhood malnutrition (edematous SAM or ESAM), which includes kwashiorkor, presents with more overt multi-organ dysfunction than non-edematous SAM (NESAM). Reduced concentrations and methyl-flux of methionine in 1-carbon metabolism have been reported in acute, but not recovered, ESAM, suggesting downstream DNA methylation changes could be relevant to differences in SAM pathogenesis. Here, we assess genome-wide DNA methylation in buccal cells of 309 SAM children using the 450\u2009K microarray. Relative to NESAM, ESAM is characterized by multiple significantly hypomethylated loci, which is not observed among SAM-recovered adults. Gene expression and methylation show both positive and negative correlation, suggesting a complex transcriptional response to SAM. Hypomethylated loci link to disorders of nutrition and metabolism, including fatty liver and diabetes, and appear to be influenced by genetic variation. Our epigenetic findings provide a potential molecular link to reported aberrant 1-carbon metabolism in ESAM and support consideration of methyl-group supplementation in ESAM. ",
        "DNA vaccination before conception protects Zika virus-exposed pregnant macaques against prolonged viremia and improves fetal outcomes. Zika virus (ZIKV) infection of pregnant women is associated with congenital Zika syndrome (CZS) and no vaccine is available, although several are being tested in clinical trials. We tested the efficacy of ZIKV DNA vaccine VRC5283 in a rhesus macaque model of congenital ZIKV infection. Most animal vaccine experiments have a set pathogen exposure several weeks or months after vaccination. In the real world, people encounter pathogens years or decades after vaccination, or may be repeatedly exposed if the virus is endemic. To more accurately mimic how this vaccine would be used, we immunized macaques before conception and then exposed them repeatedly to ZIKV during early and mid-gestation. In comparison to unimmunized animals, vaccinated animals had a significant reduction in peak magnitude and duration of maternal viremia, early fetal loss, fetal infection, and placental and fetal brain pathology. Vaccine-induced neutralizing antibody titers on the day of first ZIKV exposure were negatively associated with the magnitude of maternal viremia, and the absence of prolonged viremia was associated with better fetal outcomes. These data support further clinical development of ZIKV vaccine strategies to protect against negative fetal outcomes. ",
        "NLRP3 inflammasome in fibroblasts links tissue damage with inflammation in breast cancer progression and metastasis. Cancer-Associated Fibroblasts (CAFs) were shown to orchestrate tumour-promoting inflammation in multiple malignancies, including breast cancer. However, the molecular pathways that govern the inflammatory role of CAFs are poorly characterised. In this study we found that fibroblasts sense damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), and in response activate the NLRP3 inflammasome pathway, resulting in instigation of pro-inflammatory signalling and secretion of IL-1\u03b2. This upregulation was evident in CAFs in mouse and in human breast carcinomas. Moreover, CAF-derived inflammasome signalling facilitated tumour growth and metastasis, which was attenuated when NLRP3 or IL-1\u03b2 were specifically ablated. Functionally, CAF-derived inflammasome promoted tumour progression and metastasis by modulating the tumour microenvironment towards an immune suppressive milieu and by upregulating the expression of adhesion molecules on endothelial cells. Our findings elucidate a mechanism by which CAFs promote breast cancer progression and metastasis, by linking the physiological tissue damage response of fibroblasts with tumour-promoting inflammation.

        "A novel self-organizing embryonic stem cell system reveals signaling logic underlying the patterning of human ectoderm. During development, the ectoderm is patterned by a combination of BMP and WNT signaling. Research in model organisms has provided substantial insight into this process; however, there are currently no systems in which to study ectodermal patterning in humans. Further, the complexity of neural plate border specification has made it difficult to transition from discovering the genes involved to deeper mechanistic understanding. Here, we develop an in vitro model of human ectodermal patterning, in which human embryonic stem cells self-organize to form robust and quantitatively reproducible patterns corresponding to the complete medial-lateral axis of the embryonic ectoderm. Using this platform, we show that the duration of endogenous WNT signaling is a crucial control parameter, and that cells sense relative levels of BMP and WNT signaling in making fate decisions. These insights allowed us to develop an improved protocol for placodal differentiation. Thus, our platform is a powerful tool for studying human ectoderm patterning and for improving directed differentiation protocols.This article has an associated 'The people behind the papers' interview.

        "Risk of Operative and Nonoperative Interventions Up to 4 Years After Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass vs Vertical Sleeve Gastrectomy in a Nationwide US Commercial Insurance Claims Database. Importance: There are few nationwide studies comparing the risk of reintervention after contemporary bariatric procedures. Objective: To compare the risk of intervention after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) vs vertical sleeve gastrectomy (VSG). Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study used a nationwide US commercial insurance claims database. Adults aged 18 to 64 years who underwent a first RYGB or VSG procedure between January 1, 2010, and June 30, 2017, were matched on US region, year of surgery, most recent presurgery body mass index (BMI) category (based on diagnosis codes), and baseline type 2 diabetes. The prematch pool included 4496 patients undergoing RYGB and 8627 patients undergoing VSG, and the final weighted matched sample included 4476 patients undergoing RYGB and 8551 patients undergoing VSG. Exposures: Bariatric surgery procedure type (RYGB vs VSG). Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was any abdominal operative intervention after the index procedure. Secondary outcomes included the following subtypes of operative intervention: biliary procedures, abdominal wall hernia repair, bariatric conversion or revision, and other abdominal operations. Nonoperative outcomes included endoscopy and enteral access. Time to first event was compared using multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression modeling. Results: Among 13\u202f027 patients, the mean (SD) age was 44.4 (10.3) years, and 74.1% were female; 13.7% had a preoperative BMI between 30 and 39.9, 45.8% had a preoperative BMI between 40 and 49.9, and 24.2% had a preoperative BMI of at least 50. Patients were followed up for up to 4 years after surgery (median, 1.6 years; interquartile range, 0.7-3.2 years), with 41.9% having at least 2 years of follow-up and 16.3% having at least 4 years of follow-up. Patients undergoing VSG were less likely to have any subsequent operative intervention than matched patients undergoing RYGB (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 0.80; 95% CI, 0.72-0.89) and similarly were less likely to undergo biliary procedures (aHR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.67-0.90), abdominal wall hernia repair (aHR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.47-0.75), other abdominal operations (aHR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.61-0.82), and endoscopy (aHR, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.49-0.59) or have enteral access placed (aHR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.39-0.86). Patients undergoing VSG were more likely to undergo bariatric conversion or revision (aHR, 1.83; 95% CI, 1.19-2.80). Conclusions and Relevance: In this nationwide study, patients undergoing VSG appeared to be less likely than matched patients undergoing RYGB to experience subsequent abdominal operative interventions, except for bariatric conversion or revision procedures. Patients considering bariatric surgery should be aware of the increased risk of subsequent procedures associated with RYGB vs VSG as part of shared decision-making around procedure choice. ",
        "Chronic methamphetamine interacts with BDNF Val66Met to remodel psychosis pathways in the mesocorticolimbic proteome. Methamphetamine (Meth) abuse has reached epidemic proportions in many countries and can induce psychotic episodes mimicking the clinical profile of schizophrenia. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is implicated in both Meth effects and schizophrenia. We therefore studied the long-term effects of chronic Meth exposure in transgenic mice engineered to harbor the human BDNFVal66Met polymorphism expressed via endogenous mouse promoters. These mice were chronically treated with an escalating Meth regime during late adolescence. At least 4 weeks later, all hBDNFVal66Met Meth-treated mice exhibited sensitization confirming persistent behavioral effects of Meth. We used high-resolution quantitative mass spectrometry-based proteomics to biochemically map the long-term effects of Meth within the brain, resulting in the unbiased detection of 4808 proteins across the mesocorticolimbic circuitry. Meth differentially altered dopamine signaling markers (e.g., Dat, Comt, and Th) between hBDNFVal/Val and hBDNFMet/Met mice, implicating involvement of BDNF in Meth-induced reprogramming of the mesolimbic proteome. Targeted analysis of 336 schizophrenia-risk genes, as well as 82 growth factor cascade markers, similarly revealed that hBDNFVal66Met genotype gated the recruitment of these factors by Meth in a region-specific manner. Cumulatively, these data represent the first comprehensive analysis of the long-term effects of chronic Meth exposure within the mesocorticolimbic circuitry. In addition, these data reveal that long-term Meth-induced brain changes are strongly dependent upon BDNF genetic variation, illustrating how drug-induced psychosis may be modulated at the molecular level by a single genetic locus.

        "Glutamine Links Obesity to Inflammation in Human White Adipose Tissue. While obesity and associated metabolic complications are linked to inflammation of white adipose tissue (WAT), the causal factors remain unclear. We hypothesized that the local metabolic environment could be an important determinant. To this end, we compared metabolites released from WAT of 81 obese and non-obese women. This identified glutamine to be downregulated in obesity and inversely associated with a pernicious WAT phenotype. Glutamine administration in\u00a0vitro and in\u00a0vivo attenuated both pro-inflammatory gene and protein levels in adipocytes and WAT and macrophage infiltration in WAT. Metabolomic and bioenergetic analyses in human adipocytes suggested that glutamine attenuated glycolysis and reduced uridine diphosphate N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc) levels. UDP-GlcNAc is the substrate for the post-translational modification O-linked \u03b2-N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) mediated by the enzyme O-GlcNAc transferase. Functional studies in human adipocytes established a mechanistic link between reduced glutamine, O-GlcNAcylation of nuclear proteins, and a pro-inflammatory transcriptional response. Altogether, glutamine metabolism is linked to WAT inflammation in obesity. ",
        "Associations of Circadian Eating Pattern and Diet Quality with Substantial Postpartum Weight Retention. Besides food quantity and quality, food timing and frequency may contribute to weight regulation. It is unclear if these factors during pregnancy can influence maternal weight retention after childbirth. We thus aimed to examine the associations of maternal circadian eating pattern and diet quality in pregnancy with substantial postpartum weight retention (PPWR) at 18 months in an Asian cohort. We assessed circadian eating pattern and diet quality of 687 women using 24-h dietary recalls at 26-28 weeks' gestation. We calculated PPWR by subtracting maternal weight in the first trimester from weight at 18-month postpartum and defined substantial PPWR as \u22655 kg weight retention. Multivariable binary logistic regression was performed. Overall, 16% of women had substantial PPWR. After the confounders adjustment, night eating, defined by greater night-time caloric intake (odds ratio 1.95; 95% confidence interval 1.05, 3.62), and lower diet quality, classified by median score of the Healthy Eating Index (1.91; 1.17, 3.10), were independently associated with higher odds of substantial PPWR. No associations with substantial PPWR were observed for night fasting duration and number of eating episodes. In conclusion, alignment of eating time with day-night cycles and diet quality during pregnancy may play a role in PPWR, with possible implications for long-term obesity risk. ",
        "Targeting the cannabinoid receptor CB2 in a mouse model of l-dopa induced dyskinesia. L-dopa induced dyskinesia (LID) is a debilitating side-effect of the primary treatment used in Parkinson's disease (PD), l-dopa. Here we investigate the effect of HU-308, a cannabinoid CB2 receptor agonist, on LIDs. Utilizing a mouse model of PD and LIDs, induced by 6-OHDA and subsequent l-dopa treatment, we show that HU-308 reduced LIDs as effectively as amantadine, the current frontline treatment. Furthermore, treatment with HU-308 plus amantadine resulted in a greater anti-dyskinetic effect than maximally achieved with HU-308 alone, potentially suggesting a synergistic effect of these two treatments. Lastly, we demonstrated that treatment with HU-308 and amantadine either alone, or in combination, decreased striatal neuroinflammation, a mechanism which has been suggested to contribute to LIDs. Taken together, our results suggest pharmacological treatments with CB2 agonists merit further investigation as therapies for LIDs in PD patients. Furthermore, since CB2 receptors are thought to be primarily expressed on, and signal through, glia, our data provide weight to suggestion that neuroinflammation, or more specifically, altered glial function, plays a role in development of LIDs.

        "Suicide prevention and depression apps' suicide risk assessment and management: a systematic assessment of adherence to clinical guidelines. BACKGROUND: There are an estimated 800,000 suicides\u00a0per year globally, and approximately 16,000,000 suicide attempts. Mobile apps may help address the unmet needs of people at risk. We assessed adherence of suicide prevention advice in depression management and suicide prevention apps to six evidence-based clinical guideline recommendations: mood and suicidal thought tracking, safety plan development, recommendation of activities to deter suicidal thoughts, information and education, access to support networks, and access to emergency counseling. METHODS: A systematic assessment of depression and suicide prevention apps available in Google Play and Apple's App Store was conducted. Apps were identified by searching 42matters in January 2019 for apps launched or updated since January 2017 using the terms \"depression,\" \"depressed,\" \"depress,\" \"mood disorders,\" \"suicide,\" and \"self-harm.\" General characteristics of apps, adherence with six suicide prevention strategies identified in evidence-based clinical guidelines using a 50-question checklist developed by the study team, and trustworthiness of the app based on HONcode principles were appraised and reported as a narrative review, using descriptive statistics. RESULTS: The initial search yielded 2690 potentially relevant apps. Sixty-nine apps met inclusion criteria and were systematically assessed. There were 20 depression management apps (29%), 3 (4%) depression management and suicide prevention apps, and 46 (67%) suicide prevention apps. Eight (12%) depression management apps were chatbots. Only 5/69 apps (7%) incorporated all six suicide prevention strategies. Six apps (6/69, 9%), including two apps available in both app stores and downloaded more than one million times each, provided an erroneous crisis helpline number. Most apps included emergency contact information (65/69 apps, 94%) and direct access to a crisis helpline through the app (46/69 apps, 67%). CONCLUSIONS: Non-existent or inaccurate suicide crisis helpline phone numbers were provided by mental health apps downloaded more than 2 million times. Only five out of 69 depression and suicide prevention apps offered all six evidence-based suicide prevention strategies. This demonstrates a failure of Apple and Google app stores, and the health app industry in self-governance, and quality and safety assurance. Governance levels should be stratified by the risks and benefits to users of the app, such as when suicide prevention advice is provided. ",
        "A Vulnerability Risk Index of Self-Neglect in a Community-Dwelling Older Population. BACKGROUND: The only way to systematically screen for self-neglect among older adults is through in-home observations, which are often difficult and unfeasible for healthcare providers. To fill this gap, we need a robust and efficient prognostication tool to better treat and prevent self-neglect among older adults. OBJECTIVES: To develop a predictive index that can be used to assess risk prognostication of the onset of self-neglect among community-dwelling older populations. DESIGN: Two waves of longitudinal data from the Chicago Health and Aging Project (CHAP), collected during 2008 to 2012 with approximately 3-year follow-up intervals. SETTING: Non-Hispanic black or non-Hispanic white community-dwelling older adults in three adjacent neighborhoods in Chicago, IL. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 2885 individuals who were participants of the CHAP study. MEASUREMENTS: The main outcomes are incident self-neglect cases. A total of 86 potential predictors were considered in the domains of sociodemographic and socioeconomic, general well-being, health behavior, medical health, medicine/healthcare, cognitive function, physical well-being, social well-being, and psychological well-being. RESULTS: The 3-year self-neglect incidence rate is 241 (8.4%). A 10-item predictive model (with a c-statistic of 0.76) was developed using stepwise selection in multivariable logistical regression models. After corrections of overfitting by validating in 100 bootstrapping samples, the predictive accuracy of the model dropped to 0.71, suggesting at least moderate overfitting. A point-based risk index was developed based on parameter estimates of each predictive factor in the final logistic model. The index has an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.76. CONCLUSION: The study developed an efficient index with good predictive ability of self-neglect. Further external validation and impact studies are necessary before practitioners can apply this index to determine risk of self-neglect among other community aging populations.

        "Imaging Phenotypes of Breast Cancer Heterogeneity in Preoperative Breast Dynamic Contrast Enhanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging (DCE-MRI) Scans Predict 10-Year Recurrence. PURPOSE: Identifying imaging phenotypes and understanding their relationship with prognostic markers and patient outcomes can allow for a noninvasive assessment of cancer. The purpose of this study was to identify and validate intrinsic imaging phenotypes of breast cancer heterogeneity in preoperative breast dynamic contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) scans and evaluate their prognostic performance in predicting 10 years recurrence. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Pretreatment DCE-MRI scans of 95 women with primary invasive breast cancer with at least 10 years of follow-up from a clinical trial at our institution (2002-2006) were retrospectively analyzed. For each woman, a signal enhancement ratio (SER) map was generated for the entire segmented primary lesion volume from which 60 radiomic features of texture and morphology were extracted. Intrinsic phenotypes of tumor heterogeneity were identified via unsupervised hierarchical clustering of the extracted features. An independent sample of 163 women diagnosed with primary invasive breast cancer (2002-2006), publicly available via The Cancer Imaging Archive, was used to validate phenotype reproducibility. RESULTS: Three significant phenotypes of low, medium, and high heterogeneity were identified in the discovery cohort and reproduced in the validation cohort (P < 0.01). Kaplan-Meier curves showed statistically significant differences (P < 0.05) in recurrence-free survival (RFS) across phenotypes. Radiomic phenotypes demonstrated added prognostic value (c = 0.73) predicting RFS. CONCLUSIONS: Intrinsic imaging phenotypes of breast cancer tumor heterogeneity at primary diagnosis can predict 10-year recurrence. The independent and additional prognostic value of imaging heterogeneity phenotypes suggests that radiomic phenotypes can provide a noninvasive characterization of tumor heterogeneity to augment personalized prognosis and treatment.

        "Population-based dietary exposure to mercury through fish consumption in the Southern Peruvian Amazon. BACKGROUND: Mercury exposure related to artisanal and small-scale gold mining (ASGM) has raised environmental and public health concerns globally. Exposure to mercury, a potent neurotoxin that bioaccumulates in fish, is especially of concern to women of childbearing age (WCBA) and children in high-fish consuming populations. In Madre de Dios (MDD), Peru, an Amazon region with naturally occurring mercury and high ASGM activity, there is significant exposure concern among the mainly riverine, fish-consuming communities. The objective of this study was to conduct the first assessment of mercury exposure in a population-based sample of MDD, identify factors associated with elevated levels and compare the relationship between fish consumption and hair total mercury (H-THg) among persons living in ASGM affected and non-ASGM affected watersheds. METHODS: Hair samples and household demographic surveys, including a module on fish consumption, were collected from 723 participants across 46 communities within 10\u202fkm of the Interoceanic Highway in MDD, who were previously enrolled in the first population-based study in MDD spanning areas affected and unaffected by ASGM. H-THg concentration (natural log transformed) was evaluated for association with independent demographic variables through multilevel multivariate regression models accounting for clustering among households and communities. Samples from canned fish available at local stores were also tested for total mercury. RESULTS: Fish consumption (diversity and total consumed) varied spatially along the highway. 269 participants (37.2%) had elevated H-THg (>2.2\u202f\u03bcg/g; median 1.60\u202f\u03bcg/g; mean 2.24\u202f\u03bcg/g), including 42.7% of WCBA and 20.0% of children under 5. Overall, H-THg was higher among people living in ASGM-affected areas. H-THg concentrations were strongly associated with fish consumption; however, in the multivariate models, household consumption of high trophic level fish was associated with elevated H-THg only in communities located in the ASGM-impacted watersheds. Similarly, the relationship between living in a household engaged in economic activities of fishing or Brazil nut harvesting was associated with higher H-THg, but only among households in the ASGM-affected area. In the non-ASGM affected areas, we observed a positive relationship between household daily fruit consumption and H-THg that was not observed in ASGM-affected areas. CONCLUSION: Diet, residential location, and occupation are strong predictors of mercury exposure in Madre de Dios, Peru. Canned fish may represent a previously overlooked source of dietary Hg exposure in the region. In accordance with the Minamata Convention on Mercury, the significant environmental health concern of mercury exposure in ASGM areas demands policy and programmatic attention. ",
        "Intake of Watermelon or Its Byproducts Alters Glucose Metabolism, the Microbiome, and Hepatic Proinflammatory Metabolites in High-Fat-Fed Male C57BL/6\u00a0J Mice. BACKGROUND: Watermelon intake has demonstrated effects on blood pressure regulation along with other health benefits. OBJECTIVE: We hypothesized that intake of whole watermelon and products made from watermelon rind (WR) and watermelon skin (WS) would remediate metabolic complications in C57BL/6\u00a0J male mice fed a diet modeling a Western-style diet. METHODS: Ten-week-old male C57BL/6\u00a0J mice were provided either a low-fat (LF) diet [10% fat (by energy), 8% sucrose (by energy) and no added cholesterol], a high-fat (HF) diet [45% fat (by energy), 20%\u00a0kcal sucrose (by energy), and 1% (w/w) cholesterol], or an HF diet plus WS, WR, or watermelon flesh (WF) for 10 wk. Dried WF was provided at 8% of total energy (equivalent to 2 servings/d) and watermelon skin and rind were added at 2.25% (w/w, dry weight of additives) of diet. Animals were provided experimental diets ad libitum. Body weights, food intake, and glucose tolerance were determined. Serum insulin, inflammatory markers, microbiome, and the relative hepatic concentrations of 709 biochemicals were measured postmortem. RESULTS: The final body weight of the LF control group was significantly lower than that of the HF-fed control group (32.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.9\u00a0g compared with 43.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.7\u00a0g, P\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.05). Mice in treatment groups fed HF supplemented with watermelon products had final body weights similar to those of the HF-fed control mice. Serum insulin concentrations were reduced by \u223c40% in mice fed an HF diet with WR supplementation compared with mice fed an HF diet alone (P\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.05). Depending on the individual species or group, microbiome populations changed significantly. Supplementation with WF resulted in a return to the basal hepatic concentrations of monohydroxy fatty acids and eicosanoids observed in LF-fed mice (P\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.05). CONCLUSIONS: In obese male mice, supplementation with each of the watermelon products to an HF diet improved fasting blood glucose, circulating serum insulin concentrations, and changes in hepatic metabolite accumulation. At a modest level of supplementation to an HF diet, fiber-rich additives made from WR and WS further improved glucose metabolism and energy efficiency and shifted the microbiome composition. ",
        "Establishing links between abnormal eating behaviours and semantic deficits in dementia. The hypothesis that semantic deficits in dementia may contribute in producing changes in eating preferences has never been experimentally investigated despite this association has been clinically observed. We administered tasks assessing semantic memory and the Appetite and Eating Habits Questionnaire (APEHQ) to 23 patients with dementia (behavioural frontotemporal dementia, primary progressive aphasia, and Alzheimer's disease) and to 21 healthy controls. We used voxel-based morphometry and diffusion tensor imaging to identify regions and white matter tracts of significant atrophy associated with the performance at the semantic tasks and the pathological scores at the APEHQ. We observed that the lower the patients' scores at semantic tasks, the higher their changes in eating habits and preferences. Both semantic disorders and eating alterations correlated with atrophy in the temporal lobes and white matter tracts connecting the temporal lobe with frontal regions such as the arcuate fasciculus, the cingulum, and the inferior longitudinal fasciculus. These results confirm that semantic deficits underlie specific eating alterations in dementia patients. ",
        "Effect of the intervertebral disc on vertebral bone strength prediction: a finite-element study. BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Osteoporotic vertebral fractures (OVFs) are a prevalent skeletal condition in the elderly but the mechanism behind these fractures remain unclear due to the complex biomechanical interplay between spinal segments such as the vertebra and intervertebral discs (IVDs). PURPOSE: To investigate the biomechanical influence of IVDs by (1) comparing finite element (FE)-predicted failure load with experimentally measured failure load of functional spinal units (FSUs) and (2) comparing this correlation with those of FE-predicted failure load and bone mineral density (BMD) of the single central vertebra with experimentally measured failure load. STUDY DESIGN: A computational biomechanical analysis. PATIENT SAMPLE: Ten thoracic FSUs consisting of a central vertebra, the adjacent IVDs, and the upper and lower halves of the adjacent vertebrae were harvested from formalin-fixed human donors (4 males, 6 females; mean age of 82\u00b19 years). OUTCOME MEASURES: The outcome measures included the prediction of vertebral strength and determination of BMD in FSUs and the single central vertebra and the correlation of both measures with experimentally measured vertebral strength of the FSUs. METHODS: The FSUs underwent clinical multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) (spatial resolution: 250\u00d7250\u00d7600 \u03bcm3). BMD was determined for the FSUs from the MDCT images of the central vertebrae. FE-predicted failure load was calculated in the single central vertebra of the FSUs alone and the entire FSUs. Experimentally measured failure load of the FSUs was determined in a uniaxial biomechanical test. RESULTS: BMD of the central vertebrae correlated significantly with experimentally measured failure load (R2=0.66, p<.02), whereas FE-predicted failure load of the central vertebra showed no significant correlation with experimentally measured failure load (p=.07). However, FE-predicted failure load of FSUs best predicted experimentally measured failure load of FSUs (R2=0.93, p<.0001). CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that routine clinical MDCT images can be an accurate and feasible tool for prediction of OVFs using patient-specific FE analysis of FSU models. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Improved management of OVFs is essential amidst current clinical challenges. Implementation of a vertebral strength assessment tool could result in more accurate prediction of osteoporotic fracture risk and aid clinicians with better targeted early treatment strategies. ",
        "Racial/Ethnic Disparities in Pain Treatment: Evidence From Oregon Emergency Medical Services Agencies. BACKGROUND: Despite the critical role that Emergency Medical Services (EMS) provides in the health care system, racial/ethnic treatment disparities in EMS remain relatively unexamined. OBJECTIVE: To investigate racial/ethnic treatment disparities in pain assessment and pain medication administration in EMS. RESEARCH DESIGN: A retrospective analysis was performed on 25,732 EMS encounters from 2015 to 2017 recorded in the Oregon Emergency Medical Services Information System using multivariate logistic regression models to examine the role of patient race/ethnicity in pain assessment and pain medication administration among patients with a traumatic injury. RESULTS: Hispanic and Asian patients were less likely to receive a pain assessment procedure and all racial/ethnic patients were less likely to receive pain medications compared with white patients. In particular, regarding the adjusted likelihood of receiving a pain assessment procedure, Hispanic patients were 21% less likely [95% confidence interval (CI), 10%-30%; P<0.001], Asian patients were 31% less likely (95% CI, 16%-43%; P<0.001) when compared with white patients. Regarding the adjusted likelihood of receiving any pain medications, black patients were 32% less likely (95% CI, 21%-42%; P<0.001), Hispanic patients were 21% less likely (95% CI, 7%-32%; P<0.01), and Asian patients were 24% less likely (95% CI, 1%-41%; P<0.05) when compared with white patients. CONCLUSIONS: Racial/ethnic minorities were more likely to experience disadvantages in EMS treatment in Oregon. Hispanic and Asian patients who requested EMS services in Oregon for traumatic injuries were less likely to have their pain assessed and all racial/ethnicity patients were less likely to be treated with pain medications when compared with white patients.

BACKGROUND: Although most American patients with ESKD become eligible for Medicare by their fourth month of dialysis, some never do. Information about where patients with limited health insurance receive maintenance dialysis has been lacking. METHODS: We identified patients initiating maintenance dialysis (2008-2015) from the US Renal Data System, defining patients as \"safety-net reliant\" if they were uninsured or had only Medicaid coverage at dialysis onset and had not qualified for Medicare by the fourth dialysis month. We examined four dialysis facility ownership categories according to for-profit/nonprofit status and ownership (chain versus independent). We assessed whether patients who were safety-net reliant were more likely to initiate dialysis at certain facility types. We also examined hospital-based affiliation. RESULTS: The proportion of patients <65 years initiating dialysis who were safety-net reliant increased significantly over time, from 11% to 14%; 73% of such patients started dialysis at for-profit/chain-owned facilities compared to 76% of all patients starting dialysis. Patients who were safety-net reliant had a 30% higher relative risk of initiating dialysis at nonprofit/independently owned versus for-profit/independently owned facilities (odds ratio, 1.30; 95% CI, 1.24 to 1.36); they had slightly lower relative risks of initiating dialysis at for-profit and non-profit chain-owned facilities, and were more likely to receive dialysis at hospital-based facilities. These findings primarily reflect increased likelihood of dialysis among patients without insurance at certain facility types. CONCLUSIONS: Although most patients who were safety-net reliant received care at for-profit/chain-owned facilities, they were disproportionately cared for at nonprofit/independently owned and hospital-based facilities. Ongoing loss of market share of nonprofit/independently owned outpatient dialysis facilities may affect safety net-reliant populations. ",
        "Bacterial microbiota composition of Ixodes ricinus ticks: the role of environmental variation, tick characteristics and microbial interactions. Ecological factors, host characteristics and/or interactions among microbes may all shape the occurrence of microbes and the structure of microbial communities within organisms. In the past, disentangling these factors and determining their relative importance in shaping within-host microbiota communities has been hampered by analytical limitations to account for (dis)similar environmental preferences ('environmental filtering'). Here we used a joint species distribution modelling (JSDM) approach to characterize the bacterial microbiota of one of the most important disease vectors in Europe, the sheep tick Ixodes ricinus, along ecological gradients in the Swiss Alps. Although our study captured extensive environmental variation along elevational clines, the explanatory power of such large-scale ecological factors was comparably weak, suggesting that tick-specific traits and behaviours, microhabitat and -climate experienced by ticks, and interactions among microbes play an important role in shaping tick microbial communities. Indeed, when accounting for shared environmental preferences, evidence for significant patterns of positive or negative co-occurrence among microbes was found, which is indicative of competition or facilitation processes. Signals of facilitation were observed primarily among human pathogens, leading to co-infection within ticks, whereas signals of competition were observed between the tick endosymbiont Spiroplasma and human pathogens. These findings highlight the important role of small-scale ecological variation and microbe-microbe interactions in shaping tick microbial communities and the dynamics of tick-borne disease. ",
        "Recurrent somatic mutations reveal new insights into consequences of mutagenic processes in cancer. The sheer size of the human genome makes it improbable that identical somatic mutations at the exact same position are observed in multiple tumours solely by chance. The scarcity of cancer driver mutations also precludes positive selection as the sole explanation. Therefore, recurrent mutations may be highly informative of characteristics of mutational processes. To explore the potential, we use recurrence as a starting point to cluster >2,500 whole genomes of a pan-cancer cohort. We describe each genome with 13 recurrence-based and 29 general mutational features. Using principal component analysis we reduce the dimensionality and create independent features. We apply hierarchical clustering to the first 18 principal components followed by k-means clustering. We show that the resulting 16 clusters capture clinically relevant cancer phenotypes. High levels of recurrent substitutions separate the clusters that we link to UV-light exposure and deregulated activity of POLE from the one representing defective mismatch repair, which shows high levels of recurrent insertions/deletions. Recurrence of both mutation types characterizes cancer genomes with somatic hypermutation of immunoglobulin genes and the cluster of genomes exposed to gastric acid. Low levels of recurrence are observed for the cluster where tobacco-smoke exposure induces mutagenesis and the one linked to increased activity of cytidine deaminases. Notably, the majority of substitutions are recurrent in a single tumour type, while recurrent insertions/deletions point to shared processes between tumour types. Recurrence also reveals susceptible sequence motifs, including TT[C>A]TTT and AAC[T>G]T for the POLE and 'gastric-acid exposure' clusters, respectively. Moreover, we refine knowledge of mutagenesis, including increased C/G deletion levels in general for lung tumours and specifically in midsize homopolymer sequence contexts for microsatellite instable tumours. Our findings are an important step towards the development of a generic cancer diagnostic test for clinical practice based on whole-genome sequencing that could replace multiple diagnostics currently in use.

        "Human Cytomegalovirus miRNAs Regulate TGF-\u03b2 to Mediate Myelosuppression while Maintaining Viral Latency in CD34+ Hematopoietic Progenitor Cells. Infection with human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) remains a significant cause of morbidity and mortality\u00a0following hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT)\u00a0because of various hematologic problems, including\u00a0myelosuppression. Here, we demonstrate that latently expressed HCMV miR-US5-2 downregulates the transcriptional repressor NGFI-A binding protein\u00a0(NAB1) to induce myelosuppression of uninfected CD34+ hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs) through an increase in TGF-\u03b2 production. Infection of HPCs with an HCMV\u0394miR-US5-2 mutant resulted in decreased TGF-\u03b2 expression and restoration of myelopoiesis. In contrast, we show that infected HPCs are refractory to TGF-\u03b2 signaling as another HCMV miRNA, miR-UL22A, downregulates SMAD3, which is required for maintenance of latency. Our data suggest that latently expressed viral miRNAs manipulate stem cell homeostasis by inducing secretion of TGF-\u03b2 while protecting infected HPCs from TGF-\u03b2-mediated effects on viral latency and reactivation. These observations provide a mechanism through which HCMV induces global myelosuppression following HSCT while maintaining lifelong infection in myeloid lineage cells. ",
        "Frequency and Clinical Presentation of Mucocutaneous Disease Due to Mycoplasma pneumoniae Infection in Children With Community-Acquired Pneumonia. Importance: The diagnosis of Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection as the cause of mucocutaneous disease is challenging because current diagnostic tests are not able to differentiate M pneumoniae infection from carriage. Objective: To examine the frequency and clinical presentation of M pneumoniae-induced mucocutaneous disease in children with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) using improved diagnostics. Design, Setting, and Participants: This prospective, longitudinal cohort study included 152 children aged 3 to 18 years with CAP enrolled in a CAP study from May 1, 2016, to April 30, 2017, at the University Children's Hospital Zurich. Children were inpatients or outpatients with clinically defined CAP according to the British Thoracic Society guidelines. Data analysis was performed from July 10, 2017, to June 29, 2018. Main Outcomes and Measures: Frequency and clinical presentation of M pneumoniae-induced mucocutaneous disease in childhood CAP. Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection was diagnosed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of oropharyngeal samples and confirmed with the measurement of specific peripheral blood IgM antibody-secreting cells by enzyme-linked immunospot assay to differentiate M pneumoniae-infected patients from carriers with CAP caused by other pathogens. Mucocutaneous disease was defined as any eruptive lesion that involved skin and/or mucous membranes occurring during the CAP episode. Results: Among 152 enrolled children with CAP (median [interquartile range] age, 5.7 [4.3-8.9] years; 84 [55.3%] male), 44 (28.9%) tested positive for M pneumoniae by PCR; of these, 10 children (22.7%) developed mucocutaneous lesions. All 10 patients with mucocutaneous eruptions tested positive for specific IgM antibody-secreting cells. Skin manifestations were found in 3 cases (2.8%) of M pneumoniae PCR-negative CAP (P\u2009<\u2009.001). The spectrum of M pneumoniae-induced mucocutaneous disease included M pneumoniae-induced rash and mucositis (3 cases [6.8%]), urticaria (2 cases [4.5%]), and maculopapular skin eruptions (5 cases [11.4%]). Two patients had ocular involvement as the sole mucosal manifestation (bilateral anterior uveitis and nonpurulent conjunctivitis). Patients with M pneumoniae-induced mucocutaneous disease had longer duration of prodromal fever (median [interquartile range], 10.5 [8.3-11.8] vs 7.0 [5.5-9.5] days; P\u2009=\u2009.02) and higher C-reactive protein levels (median [interquartile range], 31 [22-59] vs 16 [7-23] mg/L; P\u2009=\u2009.04) than patients with CAP due to M pneumoniae without mucocutaneous manifestations. They were also more likely to require oxygen (5 [50%] vs 1 [5%]; P\u2009=\u2009.007), to require hospitalization (7 [70%] vs 4 [19%]; P\u2009=\u2009.01), and to develop long-term sequelae (3 [30%] vs 0; P\u2009=\u2009.03). Conclusions and Relevance: Mucocutaneous disease occurred significantly more frequently in children with CAP due to M pneumoniae than in children with CAP of other origins. Mycoplasma pneumoniae-induced mucocutaneous disease was associated with increased systemic inflammation, morbidity, and a higher risk of long-term sequelae. ",
        "Racial and Ethnic Variations in Mortality Rates for Patients Undergoing Maintenance Dialysis Treated in US Territories Compared with the US 50 States. BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: In the United States mortality rates for patients treated with dialysis differ by racial and/or ethnic (racial/ethnic) group. Mortality outcomes for patients undergoing maintenance dialysis in the United States territories may differ from patients in the United States 50 states. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: This retrospective cohort study of using US Renal Data System data included 1,547,438 adults with no prior transplantation and first dialysis treatment between April 1, 1995 and September 28, 2012. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) of death for the territories versus 50 states for each racial/ethnic group using the whole cohort and covariate-matched samples. Covariates included demographics, year of dialysis initiation, cause of kidney failure, comorbid conditions, dialysis modality, and many others. RESULTS: Of 22,828 patients treated in the territories (American Samoa, Guam, Puerto Rico, Virgin Islands), 321 were white, 666 were black, 20,299 were Hispanic, and 1542 were Asian. Of 1,524,610 patients in the 50 states, 838,736 were white, 444,066 were black, 182,994 were Hispanic, and 58,814 were Asian. The crude mortality rate (deaths per 100 patient-years) was lower for whites in the territories than the 50 states (14 and 29, respectively), similar for blacks (18 and 17, respectively), higher for Hispanics (27 and 16, respectively), and higher for Asians (22 and 15). In matched analyses, greater risks of death remained for Hispanics (HR, 1.65; 95% confidence interval, 1.60 to 1.70; P<0.001) and Asians (HR, 2.01; 95% confidence interval, 1.78 to 2.27; P<0.001) living in the territories versus their matched 50 states counterparts. There were no significant differences in mortality among white or black patients in the territories versus the 50 states. CONCLUSIONS: Mortality rates for patients undergoing dialysis in the United States territories differ substantially by race/ethnicity compared with the 50 states. After matched analyses for comparable age and risk factors, mortality risk no longer differed for whites or blacks, but remained much greater for territory-dwelling Hispanics and Asians. ",
        "Self-determination in young adults with autism spectrum disorder. This study examined rates of and contributing factors to self-determination among young adults with autism spectrum disorder. Caregivers of young adults with autism spectrum disorder, 16-25\u2009years, from five Autism Treatment Network sites completed surveys about their young adults' transition experiences including the American Institutes for Research Self-Determination measure. Data were analyzed using univariate and multivariate analysis. Caregivers (n\u2009=\u2009479) reported their young adults with autism spectrum disorder as having moderate overall self-determination (x\u2009=\u200938; standard deviation\u2009=\u20099.04) with low capacity (x\u2009=\u200915.3; standard deviation\u2009=\u20095.67) and high opportunities at home (x\u2009=\u200923.1; standard deviation\u2009=\u20094.59). Young adults with autism spectrum disorder with intellectual disability or severe autism spectrum disorder symptomology experience significant disparities in overall self-determination compared to those without intellectual disability and less frequent symptom expression and severity. Barring severity indicators, there were few significant predictors of self-determination. Findings show a breakdown in self-determination skill-building. Young adults with autism spectrum disorder with intellectual disability or severe symptomology experienced significant disparities in self-determination. These findings show that current promotion of self-determination is not meeting the needs of young adults with autism spectrum disorder. Future interventions must identify what supports young adults with autism spectrum disorder need to capitalize on these opportunities to be independent and exert autonomy in their daily lives. ",
        "Evidence for an attentional priority map in inferotemporal cortex. From incoming sensory information, our brains make selections according to current behavioral goals. This process, selective attention, is controlled by parietal and frontal areas. Here, we show that another brain area, posterior inferotemporal cortex (PITd), also exhibits the defining properties of attentional control. We discovered this area with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during an attentive motion discrimination task. Single-cell recordings from PITd revealed strong attentional modulation across 3 attention tasks yet no tuning to task-relevant stimulus features, like motion direction or color. Instead, PITd neurons closely tracked the subject's attention state and predicted upcoming errors of attentional selection. Furthermore, artificial electrical PITd stimulation controlled the location of attentional selection without altering feature discrimination. These are the defining properties of a feature-blind priority map encoding the locus of attention. Together, these results suggest area PITd, located strategically to gather information about object properties, as an attentional priority map. ",
        "Semaphorin 3E/PlexinD1 signaling is required for cardiac ventricular compaction. Left ventricular noncompaction (LVNC) is one of the most common forms of genetic cardiomyopathy characterized by excessive trabeculation and impaired myocardial compaction during fetal development. Patients with LVNC are at higher risk of developing left/right ventricular failure or both. Although the key regulators for cardiac chamber development are well studied, the role of semaphorin (Sema)/plexin signaling in this process remains poorly understood. In this article, we demonstrate that genetic deletion of Plxnd1, a class-3 Sema receptor in endothelial cells, leads to severe cardiac chamber defects. They were characterized by excessive trabeculation and noncompaction similar to patients with LVNC. Loss of Plxnd1 results in decreased expression of extracellular matrix proteolytic genes, leading to excessive deposition of cardiac jelly. We demonstrate that Plxnd1 deficiency is associated with an increase in Notch1 expression and its downstream target genes. In addition, inhibition of the Notch signaling pathway partially rescues the excessive trabeculation and noncompaction phenotype present in Plxnd1 mutants. Furthermore, we demonstrate that Semaphorin 3E (Sema3E), one of PlexinD1's known ligands, is expressed in the developing heart and is required for myocardial compaction. Collectively, our study uncovers what we believe to be a previously undescribed role of the Sema3E/PlexinD1 signaling pathway in myocardial trabeculation and the compaction process. ",
        "Mice Reach Higher Visual Sensitivity at Night by Using a More Efficient Behavioral Strategy. Circadian clocks predictively adjust the physiology of organisms to the day/night cycle. The retina has its own clock, and many diurnal changes in its physiology have been reported. However, their implications for retinal functions and visually guided behavior are largely unresolved. Here, we study the impact of diurnal rhythm on the sensitivity limit of mouse vision. A simple photon detection task allowed us to link well-defined retinal output signals directly to visually guided behavior. We show that visually guided behavior at its sensitivity limit is strongly under diurnal control, reaching the highest sensitivity and stability at night. The diurnal differences in visual sensitivity did not arise in the retina, as assessed by spike recordings from the most sensitive retinal ganglion cell types: ON sustained, OFF sustained, and OFF transient alpha ganglion cells. Instead, we found that mice, as nocturnal animals, use a more efficient search strategy for visual cues at night. Intriguingly, they can switch to the more efficient night strategy even at their subjective day after first having performed the task at night. Our results exemplify that the shape of visual psychometric functions depends robustly on the diurnal state of the animal, its search strategy, and even its diurnal history of performing the task. The results highlight the impact of the day/night cycle on high-level sensory processing, demonstrating a direct diurnal impact on the behavioral strategy of the animal. ",
        "Inducible knockout of \u2206Np63 alters cell polarity and metabolism during pubertal mammary gland development. The \u2206Np63 isoform of the p53-family transcription factor Trp63 is a key regulator of mammary epithelial stem cells that is involved in breast cancer development. To investigate the role of \u2206Np63 at different stages of normal mammary gland development, we generated a \u2206Np63-inducible conditional knockout (cKO) mouse model. We demonstrate that the deletion of \u2206Np63 at puberty results in depletion of mammary stem cell-enriched basal cells, reduces expression of E-cadherin and\u00a0\u03b2-catenin, and leads to a closed ductal lumen. RNA-sequencing analysis reveals reduced expression of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS)-associated proteins and desmosomal polarity proteins. Functional assays show reduced numbers of mitochondria in the mammary epithelial cells of \u0394Np63 cKO compared to wild-type, supporting the reduced OXPHOS phenotype. These findings identify a novel role for \u2206Np63 in cellular metabolism and mammary epithelial cell polarity. ",
        "New Insights on Lipedema: The Enigmatic Disease of the Peripheral Fat. BACKGROUND: Although a large number of adult women worldwide are affected by lipedema, the physiologic conditions triggering onset and progression of this chronic disease remain enigmatic. In the present study, a descriptive epidemiologic situation of postoperative lipedema patients is presented. METHODS: The authors developed an online survey questionnaire for lipedema patients in Germany. The survey was conducted on 209 female patients who had been diagnosed with lipedema and had undergone tumescent liposuction. RESULTS: Most of the participants (average age, 38.5 years) had noticed a first manifestation of the disease at the age of 16. It took a mean of 15 years to accomplish diagnosis. Liposuction led to a significant reduction of pain, swelling, tenderness, and easy bruising as confirmed by the majority of patients. Hypothyroidism [n = 75 (35.9 percent) and depression [n = 48 (23.0 percent)] occurred at a frequency far beyond the average prevalence in the German population. The prevalence of diabetes type 1 [n = 3 (1.4 percent)], and diabetes type 2 [n = 2 (1 percent)] was particularly low among the respondents. Forty-seven of the lipedema patients (approximately 22.5 percent) suffered from a diagnosed migraine. Following liposuction, the frequency and/or intensity of migraine attacks became markedly reduced, as stated by 32 patients (68.1 percent). CONCLUSIONS: Quality of life increases significantly after surgery with a reduction of pain and swelling and decreased tendency to easy bruising. The high prevalence of hypothyroidism in lipedema patients could be related to the frequently observed lipedema-associated obesity. The low prevalence of diabetes, dyslipidemia, and hypertension appears to be a specific characteristic distinguishing lipedema from lifestyle-induced obesity. ",
        "Host monitoring of quorum sensing during Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection. Pseudomonas aeruginosa rapidly adapts to altered conditions by quorum sensing (QS), a communication system that it uses to collectively modify its behavior through the production, release, and detection of signaling molecules. QS molecules can also be sensed by hosts, although the respective receptors and signaling pathways are poorly understood. We describe a pattern of regulation in the host by the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) that is critically dependent on qualitative and quantitative sensing of P. aeruginosa quorum. QS molecules bind to AhR and distinctly modulate its activity. This is mirrored upon infection with P. aeruginosa collected from diverse growth stages and with QS mutants. We propose that by spying on bacterial quorum, AhR acts as a major sensor of infection dynamics, capable of orchestrating host defense according to the status quo of infection. ",
        "Scalable Prediction of Acute Myeloid Leukemia Using High-Dimensional Machine Learning and Blood Transcriptomics. Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a severe, mostly fatal hematopoietic malignancy. We were interested in whether transcriptomic-based machine learning could predict AML status without requiring expert input. Using 12,029 samples from 105 different studies, we present a large-scale study of machine learning-based prediction of AML in which we address key questions relating to the combination of machine learning and transcriptomics and their practical use. We find data-driven, high-dimensional approaches-in which multivariate signatures are learned directly from genome-wide data with no prior knowledge-to be accurate and robust. Importantly, these approaches are highly scalable with low marginal cost, essentially matching human expert annotation in a near-automated workflow. Our results support the notion that transcriptomics combined with machine learning could be used as part of an integrated -omics approach wherein risk prediction, differential diagnosis, and subclassification of AML are achieved by genomics while diagnosis could be assisted by transcriptomic-based machine learning.

        "Structure of the Cardiac Sodium Channel. Voltage-gated sodium channel Nav1.5 generates cardiac action potentials and initiates the heartbeat. Here, we report structures of NaV1.5 at 3.2-3.5\u00a0\u00c5 resolution. NaV1.5 is distinguished from other sodium channels by a unique glycosyl moiety and loss of disulfide-bonding capability at the NaV\u03b2 subunit-interaction sites. The antiarrhythmic drug flecainide specifically targets the central cavity of the pore. The voltage sensors are partially activated, and the fast-inactivation gate is partially closed. Activation of the voltage sensor of Domain III allows binding of the isoleucine-phenylalanine-methionine (IFM) motif to the inactivation-gate receptor. Asp and Ala, in the selectivity motif DEKA, line the walls of the ion-selectivity filter, whereas Glu and Lys are in positions to accept and release Na+ ions via a charge-delocalization network. Arrhythmia mutation sites undergo large translocations during gating, providing a potential mechanism for pathogenic effects. Our results provide detailed insights into Nav1.5 structure, pharmacology, activation, inactivation, ion selectivity, and arrhythmias. ",
        "Nivolumab Is Effective in Mismatch Repair-Deficient Noncolorectal Cancers: Results From Arm Z1D-A Subprotocol of the NCI-MATCH (EAY131) Study. PURPOSE: The National Cancer Institute Molecular Analysis for Therapy Choice (NCI-MATCH) trial, the largest national precision oncology study to date (> 1,100 sites) of patients with relapsed or refractory malignancies, assigned patients to targeted therapy in parallel phase II studies based on tumor molecular alterations. The anti-programmed death receptor 1 inhibitor nivolumab previously showed activity in mismatch repair (MMR)-deficient colon cancer. We hypothesized that nivolumab would have activity in patients with MMR-deficient, noncolorectal tumors. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eligible patients with relapsed or refractory tumors, good end-organ function, and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of \u2264 1 underwent tumor biopsy for centralized screening of molecular alterations. MMR deficiency was defined by complete loss of nuclear expression of MLH1 or MSH2 MMR gene products by immunohistochemistry (IHC). Patients with MMR-deficient colorectal cancer were excluded. Nivolumab, 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks (28-day cycles) and 480 mg every 4 weeks after cycle 4, was administered intravenously. Disease reassessment was performed every 2 cycles. The primary end point was RECIST 1.1 objective response rate (ORR). RESULTS: Two percent of 4,902 screened patients had an MMR-deficient cancer by IHC. Forty-two evaluable patients were enrolled, with a median age of 60 years and a median of 3 prior therapies. The most common histologies were endometrioid endometrial adenocarcinoma (n = 13), prostate adenocarcinoma (n = 5), and uterine carcinosarcoma (n = 4). ORR was 36% (15 of 42 patients). An additional 21% of patients had stable disease. The estimated 6-, 12-, and 18-month progression-free survival rates were 51.3% (90% CI, 38.2% to 64.5%), 46.2% (90% CI, 33.1% to 59.3%), and 31.4% (90% CI, 18.7% to 44.2%), respectively. Median overall survival was 17.3 months. Toxicity was predominantly low grade. CONCLUSION: A variety of refractory cancers (2.0% of those screened) had MMR deficiency as defined in NCI-MATCH. Nivolumab has promising activity in MMR-deficient noncolorectal cancers of a wide variety of histopathologic types. ",
        "PBRM1 acts as a p53 lysine-acetylation reader to suppress renal tumor growth. p53 acetylation is indispensable for its transcriptional activity and tumor suppressive function. However, the identity of reader protein(s) for p53 acetylation remains elusive. PBRM1, the second most highly mutated tumor suppressor gene in kidney cancer, encodes PBRM1. Here, we identify PBRM1 as a reader for p53 acetylation on lysine 382 (K382Ac) through its bromodomain 4 (BD4). Notably, mutations on key residues of BD4 disrupt recognition of p53 K382Ac. The mutation in BD4 also reduces p53 binding to promoters of target genes such as CDKN1A (p21). Consequently, the PBRM1 BD4 mutant fails to fully support p53 transcriptional activity and is defective as a tumor suppressor. We also find that expressions of PBRM1 and p21 correlate with each other in human kidney cancer samples. Our findings uncover a tumor suppressive mechanism of PBRM1 in kidney cancer and provide a mechanistic insight into the crosstalk between p53 and SWI/SNF complexes. ",
        "Establishment of the experimental procedure for prediction of conjugation capacity in mutant UGT1A1. UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 1A1 (UGT1A1) is an enzyme that is found in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane and can reportedly have a large number of amino acid substitutions that result in the reduction of glucuronidation capacity. For example, adverse drug reactions when patients receive CPT-11 (irinotecan) such as in cancer chemotherapy are caused by amino acid substitutions in UGT1A1. We previously found that the extent of the docking when the hydroxyl residue of bilirubin was oriented toward UDP-glucuronic acid correlated with in vitro conjugation capacity. In this study, we analyzed the conformation of mutant UGT1A1s by means of structural optimization with water and lipid bilayers instead of the optimization in vacuo that we used in our previous study. We then derived a mathematical model that can predict the conjugation capacities of mutant UGT1A1s by using results of substrate docking in silico and results of in vitro analysis of glucuronidation of acetaminophen and 17\u03b2-estradiol by UGT1A1s. This experimental procedure showed that the in silico conjugation capacities of other mutant UGT1A1s with bilirubin or SN-38 were similar to reported in vitro conjugation capacities. Our results suggest that this experimental procedure described herein can correctly predict the conjugation capacities of mutant UGT1A1s and any substrate. ",
        "Genomic risk score offers predictive performance comparable to clinical risk factors for ischaemic stroke. Recent genome-wide association studies in stroke have enabled the generation of genomic risk scores (GRS) but their predictive power has been modest compared to established stroke risk factors. Here, using a meta-scoring approach, we develop a metaGRS for ischaemic stroke (IS) and analyse this score in the UK Biobank (n\u2009=\u2009395,393; 3075 IS events by age 75). The metaGRS hazard ratio for IS (1.26, 95% CI 1.22-1.31 per metaGRS standard deviation) doubles that of a previous GRS, identifying a subset of individuals at monogenic levels of risk: the top 0.25% of metaGRS have three-fold risk of IS. The metaGRS is similarly or more predictive compared to several risk factors, such as family history, blood pressure, body mass index, and smoking. We estimate the reductions needed in modifiable risk factors for individuals with different levels of genomic risk and suggest that, for individuals with high metaGRS, achieving risk factor levels recommended by current guidelines may be insufficient to mitigate risk.

        "Frequent drinking is a more important risk factor for new-onset atrial fibrillation than binge drinking: a nationwide population-based study. AIMS: Heavy consumption of alcohol is a known risk factor for new-onset atrial fibrillation (AF). We aimed to evaluate the relative importance of frequent drinking vs. binge drinking. METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 9\u00a0776\u00a0956 patients without AF who participated in a national health check-up programme were included in the analysis. The influence of drinking frequency (day per week), alcohol consumption per drinking session (grams per session), and alcohol consumption per week were studied. Compared with patients who drink twice per week (reference group), patients who drink once per week showed the lowest risk [hazard ratio (HR) 0.933, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.916-0.950] and those who drink everyday had the highest risk for new-onset AF (HR 1.412, 95% CI 1.373-1.453), respectively. However, the amount of alcohol intake per drinking session did not present any clear association with new-onset AF. Regardless of whether weekly alcohol intake exceeded 210\u2009g, the frequency of drinking was significantly associated with the risk of new-onset AF. In contrast, when patients were stratified by weekly alcohol intake (210\u2009g per week), those who drink large amounts of alcohol per drinking session showed a lower risk of new-onset AF. CONCLUSION: Frequent drinking and amount of alcohol consumption per week were significant risk factors for new-onset AF, whereas the amount of alcohol consumed per each drinking session was not an independent risk factor. Avoiding the habit of consuming a low but frequent amount of alcohol might therefore be important to prevent AF. ",
        "Vascularized cancer on a chip: The effect of perfusion on growth and drug delivery of tumor spheroid. Tumor vasculature creates a hostile tumor microenvironment (TME) in vivo and nourishes cancers, resulting in cancer progression and drug resistance. To mimic the biochemical and biomechanical environments of tumors in vitro, several models integrated with a vascular network have been reported. However, the tumor responses to biochemical and biomechanical stimuli were evaluated under static conditions and failed to incorporate the effects of blood flow to tumors. In this study, we present a tumor-on-a-chip platform that enables the evaluation of tumor activities with intraluminal flow in an engineered tumor vascular network. The fibroblasts in the tumor spheroid induced angiogenic sprouts, which constructed a perfusable vascular network in a tumor spheroid. The perfusability of the engineered vascular network was preserved during the culture. Moreover, perfusion for over 24\u202fh significantly increased the proliferation activities of tumor cells and decreased cell death in the spheroid. Drug administration under perfusion condition did not show the dose-dependent effects of anticancer drugs on tumor activities in contrast to the results under static conditions. Our results demonstrate the importance of flow in a vascular network for the evaluation of tumor activities in a drug screening platform. ",
        "Medication versus trauma-focused psychotherapy for adults with posttraumatic stress disorder: A systematic review and meta-analysis. The goal of this study was to summarize evidence from head-to-head randomized trials for treatment of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in adults comparing trauma-focused psychotherapies and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or serotonin/norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) in a systematic review and meta-analysis. We conducted a search of multiple databases to identify trials comparing a trauma-focused psychotherapy (cognitive behavioral therapy, prolonged exposure, cognitive therapy, cognitive processing therapy or eye movement desensitization and reprocessing) to an SSRI or SNRI. Cochrane Risk of Bias 2.0 was used to assess risk of bias; high risk of bias trials were included only in sensitivity analyses. PTSD symptom reduction was the primary outcome. Four trials met inclusion criteria. Random effects meta-analysis of the two trials that were not high risk of bias showed no difference in PTSD symptom reduction, but a wide confidence interval, including effects favoring psychotherapy and effects favoring medication. Heterogeneity was high. Inclusion of the two high risk of bias trials did not change substantive conclusions. There is insufficient evidence to determine whether SSRIs or trauma-focused psychotherapies are more effective for PTSD symptom reduction among adults with PTSD. ",
        "Accurate, scalable and integrative haplotype estimation. The number of human genomes being genotyped or sequenced increases exponentially and efficient haplotype estimation methods able to handle this amount of data are now required. Here we present a method, SHAPEIT4, which substantially improves upon other methods to process large genotype and high coverage sequencing datasets. It notably exhibits sub-linear running times with sample size, provides highly accurate haplotypes and allows integrating external phasing information such as large reference panels of haplotypes, collections of pre-phased variants and long sequencing reads. We provide SHAPEIT4 in an open source format and demonstrate its performance in terms of accuracy and running times on two gold standard datasets: the UK Biobank data and the Genome In A Bottle. ",
        "Hypersynchronization in mild cognitive impairment: the 'X' model. Hypersynchronization has been proposed as a synaptic dysfunction biomarker in the Alzheimer's disease continuum, reflecting the alteration of the excitation/inhibition balance. While animal models have verified this idea extensively, there is still no clear evidence in humans. Here we test this hypothesis, evaluating the risk of conversion from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to Alzheimer's disease in a longitudinal study. We compared the functional resting state eyes-closed magnetoencephalographic networks of 54 patients with MCI who were followed-up every 6 months. According to their clinical outcome, they were split into: (i) the 'progressive' MCI (n = 27) group; and (ii) the 'stable' MCI group (n = 27). They did not differ in gender or educational level. For all participants, two magnetoencephalographic recordings were acquired. Functional connectivity was evaluated using the phase locking value. To extract the functional connectivity network with significant changes between both magnetoencephalographic recordings, we evaluated the functional connectivity ratio, defined as functional connectivity post-/pre-condition, in a network-based statistical model with an ANCOVA test with age as covariate. Two significant networks were found in the theta and beta bands, involving fronto-temporal and fronto-occipital connections, and showing a diminished functional connectivity ratio in the progressive MCI group. These topologies were then evaluated at each condition showing that at baseline, patients with progressive MCI showed higher synchronization than patients with stable MCI, while in the post-condition this pattern was reversed. These results may be influenced by two main factors in the post-condition: the increased synchrony in the stable MCI patients and the network failure in the progressive MCI patients. These findings may be explained as an 'X' form model where the hypersynchrony predicts conversion, leading subsequently to a network breakdown in progressive MCI. Patients with stable MCI showed an opposite phenomenon, which could indicate that they were a step beyond in the Alzheimer's disease continuum. This model would be able to predict the risk for the conversion to dementia in MCI patients. ",
        "A Review of the In Vivo Evidence Investigating the Role of Nitrite Exposure from Processed Meat Consumption in the Development of Colorectal Cancer. The World Cancer Research Fund (WCRF) 2007 stated that the consumption of processed meat is a convincing cause of colorectal cancer (CRC), and therefore, the public should avoid it entirely. Sodium nitrite has emerged as a putative candidate responsible for the CRC-inducing effects of processed meats. Sodium nitrite is purported to prevent the growth of Clostridium botulinum and other food-spoiling bacteria, but recent, contradictory peer-reviewed evidence has emerged, leading to media reports questioning the necessity of nitrite addition. To date, eleven preclinical studies have investigated the effect of consuming nitrite/nitrite-containing meat on the development of CRC, but the results do not provide an overall consensus. A sizable number of human clinical studies have investigated the relationship between processed meat consumption and CRC risk with widely varying results. The unique approach of the present literature review was to include analysis that limited the human studies to those involving only nitrite-containing meat. The majority of these studies reported that nitrite-containing processed meat was associated with increased CRC risk. Nitrite consumption can lead to the formation of N-nitroso compounds (NOC), some of which are carcinogenic. Therefore, this focused perspective based on the current body of evidence links the consumption of meat containing nitrites and CRC risk. ",
        "Mitochondrial oxidative capacity and NAD+ biosynthesis are reduced in human sarcopenia across ethnicities. The causes of impaired skeletal muscle mass and strength during aging are well-studied in healthy populations. Less is known on pathological age-related muscle wasting and weakness termed sarcopenia, which directly impacts physical autonomy and survival. Here, we compare genome-wide transcriptional changes of sarcopenia versus age-matched controls in muscle biopsies from 119 older men from Singapore, Hertfordshire UK and Jamaica. Individuals with sarcopenia reproducibly demonstrate a prominent transcriptional signature of mitochondrial bioenergetic dysfunction in skeletal muscle, with low PGC-1\u03b1/ERR\u03b1 signalling, and downregulation of oxidative phosphorylation and mitochondrial proteostasis genes. These changes translate functionally into fewer mitochondria, reduced mitochondrial respiratory complex expression and activity, and low NAD+ levels through perturbed NAD+ biosynthesis and salvage in sarcopenic muscle. We provide an integrated molecular profile of human sarcopenia across ethnicities, demonstrating a fundamental role of altered mitochondrial metabolism in the pathological loss of skeletal muscle mass and function in older people.

        "An Abl-FBP17 mechanosensing system couples local plasma membrane curvature and stress fiber remodeling during mechanoadaptation. Cells remodel their structure in response to mechanical strain. However, how mechanical forces are translated into biochemical signals that coordinate the structural changes observed at the plasma membrane (PM) and the underlying cytoskeleton during mechanoadaptation is unclear. Here, we show that PM mechanoadaptation is controlled by a tension-sensing pathway composed of c-Abl tyrosine kinase and membrane curvature regulator FBP17. FBP17 is recruited to caveolae to induce the formation of caveolar rosettes. FBP17 deficient cells have reduced rosette density, lack PM tension buffering capacity under osmotic shock, and cannot adapt to mechanical strain. Mechanistically, tension is transduced to the FBP17 F-BAR domain by direct phosphorylation mediated by c-Abl, a mechanosensitive molecule. This modification inhibits FBP17 membrane bending activity and releases FBP17-controlled inhibition of mDia1-dependent stress fibers, favoring membrane adaptation to increased tension. This mechanoprotective mechanism adapts the cell to changes in mechanical tension by coupling PM and actin cytoskeleton remodeling. ",
        "Functional and Morphological Characterization of Small and Large Steroidogenic Luteal Cells From Domestic Cats Before and During Culture. The current study aimed to isolate, culture and characterize small (SLC) and large (LLC) steroidogenic cells from the corpora lutea (CL) of non-pregnant domestic cats. Isolation of feline SLC was based on an enzymatic digestion of luteal tissue, whereas LLC were obtained by mechanical disruption of CL. To assess function of both cell types, progesterone secretion and mRNA expression of selected genes involved in steroid and prostaglandin synthesis were measured, as well as relative transcript abundance of hormone receptors and anti-oxidative enzymes, before and during culture. The cells were cultured for 3 or 5 days without gonadotropins. Isolated feline SLC and LLC had different sizes (12 \u00b1 3 \u03bcm vs. 34 \u00b1 5 \u03bcm, respectively), morphologies (amount of lipid droplets) and behaved differently in culture. SLC attached and proliferated or spread quickly, but lost their steroidogenic function during culture (significant decrease in progesterone secretion and expression of steroidogenic genes). The expression of receptors for gonadotropins and prolactin also decreased. Prostaglandin synthase (PTGS2) decreased steadily over time, whereas mRNA expression of PGE2 synthase (PGES) increased. The gene expression of anti-oxidative enzyme glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4), also increased during culture, but not of superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1). In comparison to SLC, LLC did not attach to culture plates, secreted more progesterone per inoculated cells and maintained steroidogenic function during culture. Expression of prostaglandin synthases (PTGS2 and PGES) was almost non-detectable. The gene expression of hormone receptors for prostaglandin F2 alpha (PTGFR), gonadotropins (LHCHR and FSHR), and prolactin (PRLR), as well as of anti-oxidative enzymes (GPX4, SOD1), increased over time. To conclude, we successfully isolated and cultured different types of feline steroidogenic luteal cells and comprehensively characterized both isolated cell types. This knowledge can be used to better understand the CL lifecycle in felines more broadly, and the established cell cultures will provide a foundation for future studies on luteolytic and luteotrophic factors in the domestic cat, and for comparison with other feline species, particularly lynx.

        "Trends in E-Cigarette, Cigarette, Cigar, and Smokeless Tobacco Use Among US Adolescent Cohorts, 2014-2018. Objectives. To examine changes in age of initiation of e-cigarette, cigarette, cigar, and smokeless tobacco use among adolescents in the United States.Methods. We used data from 5 cohorts of the National Youth Tobacco Survey (2014-2018; n\u2009=\u200926\u2009662).Results. In 2014, 8.8% of lifetime e-cigarette users initiated use at 14 years or younger, as compared with 28.6% of lifetime e-cigarette users in 2018. There was no such change in initiation ages for cigarettes, cigars, and smokeless tobacco among lifetime users of each of these products.Conclusions. US adolescents are initiating e-cigarette use at younger ages in recent years. This is concerning given the association of e-cigarette use with subsequent cigarette use. Continued surveillance of these trends and additional prospective research are needed. Tobacco prevention programs, policies, and regulations that make it more difficult for youths to obtain e-cigarettes are warranted. ",
        "Oral Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitors block activation of the platelet Fc receptor CD32a (Fc\u03b3RIIA): a new option in HIT?. Activation of the platelet Fc-receptor CD32a (Fc\u03b3RIIA) is an early and crucial step in the pathogenesis of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia type II (HIT) that has not been therapeutically targeted. Downstream Fc\u03b3RIIA Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) is activated; however, its role in Fc receptor-induced platelet activation is unknown. We explored the potential to prevent Fc\u03b3RIIA-induced platelet activation by BTK inhibitors (BTKi's) approved\u00a0(ibrutinib, acalabrutinib) or in clinical trials (zanubrutinib [BGB-3111] and tirabrutinib [ONO/GS-4059]) for B-cell malignancies, or in trials for autoimmune diseases (evobrutinib, fenebrutinib [GDC-0853]). We found that all BTKi's blocked platelet activation in blood after Fc\u03b3RIIA stimulation by antibody-mediated cross-linking (inducing platelet aggregation and secretion) or anti-CD9 antibody (inducing platelet aggregation only). The concentrations that inhibit 50% (IC50) of Fc\u03b3RIIA cross-linking-induced platelet aggregation were for the irreversible BTKi's ibrutinib 0.08 \u00b5M, zanubrutinib 0.11 \u00b5M, acalabrutinib 0.38 \u00b5M, tirabrutinib 0.42 \u00b5M, evobrutinib 1.13 \u00b5M, and for the reversible BTKi fenebrutinib 0.011 \u00b5M. IC50 values for ibrutinib and acalabrutinib were four- to fivefold lower than the drug plasma concentrations in patients treated for B-cell malignancies. The BTKi's also suppressed adenosine triphosphate secretion, P-selectin expression, and platelet-neutrophil complex formation after Fc\u03b3RIIA cross-linking. Moreover, platelet aggregation in donor blood stimulated by sera from HIT patients was blocked by BTKi's. A single oral intake of ibrutinib (280 mg) was sufficient for a rapid and sustained suppression of platelet Fc\u03b3RIIA activation. Platelet aggregation by adenosine 5'-diphosphate, arachidonic acid, or thrombin receptor-activating peptide was not inhibited. Thus, irreversible and reversible BTKi's potently inhibit platelet activation by Fc\u03b3RIIA in blood. This new rationale deserves testing in patients with HIT. ",
        "Randomized Trial of Medical versus Surgical Treatment for Refractory Heartburn. BACKGROUND: Heartburn that persists despite proton-pump inhibitor (PPI) treatment is a frequent clinical problem with multiple potential causes. Treatments for PPI-refractory heartburn are of unproven efficacy and focus on controlling gastroesophageal reflux with reflux-reducing medication (e.g., baclofen) or antireflux surgery or on dampening visceral hypersensitivity with neuromodulators (e.g., desipramine). METHODS: Patients who were referred to Veterans Affairs (VA) gastroenterology clinics for PPI-refractory heartburn received 20 mg of omeprazole twice daily for 2 weeks, and those with persistent heartburn underwent endoscopy, esophageal biopsy, esophageal manometry, and multichannel intraluminal impedance-pH monitoring. If patients were found to have reflux-related heartburn, we randomly assigned them to receive surgical treatment (laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication), active medical treatment (omeprazole plus baclofen, with desipramine added depending on symptoms), or control medical treatment (omeprazole plus placebo). The primary outcome was treatment success, defined as a decrease of 50% or more in the Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD)-Health Related Quality of Life score (range, 0 to 50, with higher scores indicating worse symptoms) at 1 year. RESULTS: A total of 366 patients (mean age, 48.5 years; 280 men) were enrolled. Prerandomization procedures excluded 288 patients: 42 had relief of their heartburn during the 2-week omeprazole trial, 70 did not complete trial procedures, 54 were excluded for other reasons, 23 had non-GERD esophageal disorders, and 99 had functional heartburn (not due to GERD or other histopathologic, motility, or structural abnormality). The remaining 78 patients underwent randomization. The incidence of treatment success with surgery (18 of 27 patients, 67%) was significantly superior to that with active medical treatment (7 of 25 patients, 28%; P\u2009=\u20090.007) or control medical treatment (3 of 26 patients, 12%; P<0.001). The difference in the incidence of treatment success between the active medical group and the control medical group was 16 percentage points (95% confidence interval, -5 to 38; P\u2009=\u20090.17). CONCLUSIONS: Among patients referred to VA gastroenterology clinics for PPI-refractory heartburn, systematic workup revealed truly PPI-refractory and reflux-related heartburn in a minority of patients. For that highly selected subgroup, surgery was superior to medical treatment. (Funded by the Department of Veterans Affairs Cooperative Studies Program; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01265550.). ",
        "Full noncontact laser ultrasound: first human data. Full noncontact laser ultrasound (LUS) imaging has several distinct advantages over current medical ultrasound (US) technologies: elimination of the coupling mediums (gel/water), operator-independent image quality, improved repeatability, and volumetric imaging. Current light-based ultrasound utilizing tissue-penetrating photoacoustics (PA) generally uses traditional piezoelectric transducers in contact with the imaged tissue or carries an optical fiber detector close to the imaging site. Unlike PA, the LUS design presented here minimizes the optical penetration and specifically restricts optical-to-acoustic energy transduction at the tissue surface, maximizing the generated acoustic source amplitude. With an appropriate optical design and interferometry, any exposed tissue surfaces can become viable acoustic sources and detectors. LUS operates analogously to conventional ultrasound but uses light instead of piezoelectric elements. Here, we present full noncontact LUS results, imaging targets at ~5\u2009cm depths and at a meter-scale standoff from the target surface. Experimental results demonstrating volumetric imaging and the first LUS images on humans are presented, all at eye- and skin-safe optical exposure levels. The progression of LUS imaging from tissue-mimicking phantoms, to excised animal tissue, to humans in vivo is shown, with validation from conventional ultrasound images. The LUS system design insights and results presented here inspire further LUS development and are a significant step toward the clinical implementation of LUS. ",
        "Association of Apolipoprotein E \u03b54 With Medial Temporal Tau Independent of Amyloid-\u03b2. Importance: Apolipoprotein E \u03b54 (APOE\u03b54) is the single most important genetic risk factor for Alzheimer disease. While APOE\u03b54 is associated with increased amyloid-\u03b2 burden, its association with cerebral tau pathology has been controversial. Objective: To determine whether APOE\u03b54 is associated with medial temporal tau pathology independently of amyloid-\u03b2, sex, clinical status, and age. Design, Setting, and Participants: This is a study of 2 cross-sectional cohorts of volunteers who were cognitively normal, had mild cognitive impairment (MCI), or had Alzheimer disease dementia: the Translational Biomarkers in Aging and Dementia (TRIAD) study (data collected between October 2017 and July 2019) and the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) (collected between November 2015 and June 2019). The first cohort (TRIAD) comprised cognitively normal elderly participants (n\u2009=\u2009124), participants with MCI (n\u2009=\u200950), and participants with Alzheimer disease (n\u2009=\u200950) who underwent tau positron emission tomography (PET) with fluorine 18-labeled MK6240 and amyloid-\u03b2 PET with [18F]AZD4694. The second sample (ADNI) was composed of cognitively normal elderly participants (n\u2009=\u2009157), participants with MCI (n\u2009=\u200983), and participants with Alzheimer disease (n\u2009=\u200925) who underwent tau PET with [18F]flortaucipir and amyloid-\u03b2 PET with [18F]florbetapir. Exclusion criteria were a history of other neurological disorders, stroke, or head trauma. There were 489 eligible participants, selected based on availability of amyloid-PET, tau-PET, magnetic resonance imaging, and genotyping for APOE\u03b54. Forty-five young adults (<30 years) from the TRIAD cohort were not selected for this study. Main Outcomes and Measures: A main association between APOE\u03b54 and tau-PET standardized uptake value ratio, correcting for age, sex, clinical status, and neocortical amyloid-PET standardized uptake value ratio. Results: The mean (SD) age of the 489 participants was 70.5 (7.1) years; 171 were APOE\u03b54 carriers (34.9%), and 230 of 489 were men. In both cohorts, APOE\u03b54 was associated in increased tau-PET uptake in the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus independently of amyloid-\u03b2, sex, age, and clinical status after multiple comparisons correction (TRIAD: \u03b2\u2009=\u20090.33; 95% CI, 0.19-0.49; ADNI: \u03b2\u2009=\u20090.13; 95% CI, 0.08-0.19; P\u2009<\u2009.001). Conclusions and Relevance: Our results indicate that the elevated risk of developing dementia conferred by APOE\u03b54 genotype involves mechanisms associated with both amyloid-\u03b2 and tau aggregation. These results contribute to an evolving framework in which APOE\u03b54 has deleterious consequences in Alzheimer disease beyond its link with amyloid-\u03b2 and suggest APOE\u03b54 as a potential target for future disease-modifying therapeutic trials targeting tau pathology.

        "Neurons in the Nucleus papilio contribute to the control of eye movements during REM sleep. Rapid eye movements (REM) are characteristic of the eponymous phase of sleep, yet the underlying motor commands remain an enigma. Here, we identified a cluster of Calbindin-D28K-expressing neurons in the Nucleus papilio (NPCalb), located in the dorsal paragigantocellular nucleus, which are active during REM sleep and project to the three contralateral eye-muscle nuclei. The firing of opto-tagged NPCalb neurons is augmented prior to the onset of eye movements during REM sleep. Optogenetic activation of NPCalb neurons triggers eye movements selectively during REM sleep, while their genetic ablation or optogenetic silencing suppresses them. None of these perturbations led to a change in the duration of REM sleep episodes. Our study provides the first evidence for a brainstem premotor command contributing to the control of eye movements selectively during REM sleep in the mammalian brain. ",
        "Proenkephalin a 119-159 (penKid) - a novel biomarker for acute kidney injury in sepsis: an observational study. BACKGROUND: Sepsis is a leading cause of death worldwide and a major challenge for physicians to predict and manage. Proenkephalin A 119-159 (penKid) is a reliable surrogate marker for the more unstable endogenous opioid peptide enkephalin, which has previously been shown to predict both acute and chronic kidney disease. The aim of this prospective observational study was to assess penKid as a predictor of acute kidney injury (AKI), multi-organ failure and mortality in sepsis among unselected sepsis patients presenting to the emergency department (ED). METHOD: We enrolled 644 patients consecutively during office-hours (6\u2009AM-6\u2009PM) between December 1, 2013 and February 1, 2015. Fifty-six patients were excluded due to incomplete data. We measured penKid in 588 adult patients (patients under 18\u2009years of age were excluded) with sepsis (\u22652SIRS criteria + suspected infection) upon admission to the ED at Sk\u00e5ne University Hospital, Malm\u00f6, Sweden. Logistic regression analysis was used to relate levels of penKid at presentation to AKI, multi-organ failure, 28-day mortality and progression of renal SOFA subscore. Odds ratios are presented as the number of standard deviations from the mean of log-transformed penKid. RESULTS: In age and sex adjusted models, penKid predicted AKI within 48\u2009h and 7\u2009days, but these associations were attenuated after additional adjustment for estimated creatinine-based glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). In models adjusted for age, sex and eGFR, penKid significantly predicted progression from rSOFA\u2009=\u20090 and\u2009\u2264\u20091 to higher rSOFA scores as well as multi-organ failure and mortality. In contrast, eGFR did not predict 28-day mortality. CONCLUSION: PenKid is an effective predictor of renal injury, severe multi-organ failure and mortality in unselected sepsis patients presenting to the emergency department. ",
        "Differences in attentional control and white matter microstructure in adolescents with attentional, affective, and behavioral disorders. Adolescence is a critical time of physiological, cognitive, and social development. It is also a time of increased risk-taking and vulnerability for psychopathology. White matter (WM) changes during adolescence have been better elucidated in the last decade, but how WM is impacted by psychopathology during this time remains unclear. Here, we examined the link between WM microstructure and psychopathology during adolescence. Twenty youth diagnosed with affective, attentional, and behavioral disorders (clinical sample), and 20 age-matched controls were recruited to examine group differences in WM microstructure, attentional control, and the link between them. The main results showed that clinical sample had relatively lower attentional control and fractional anisotropy (FA) in WM throughout the brain: two association tracts were identified, and many differences were found in areas rich in callosal and projection fibers. Moreover, increased FA was positively associated with attention performance in the clinical sample in structures supporting ventral WM pathways, whereas a similar link was identified in controls in dorsal WM association fibers. Overall, these results support a model of general impairment in WM microstructure combined with reliance on altered, perhaps less efficient, pathways for attentional control in youth with affective, attentional, and behavioral disorders.

        "Early-life programming of mesenteric lymph node stromal cell identity by the lymphotoxin pathway regulates adult mucosal immunity. Redundant mechanisms support immunoglobulin A (IgA) responses to intestinal antigens. These include multiple priming sites [mesenteric lymph nodes (MLNs), Peyer's patches, and isolated lymphoid follicles] and various cytokines that promote class switch to IgA, even in the absence of T cells. Despite these backup mechanisms, vaccination against enteric pathogens such as rotavirus has limited success in some populations. Genetic and environmental signals experienced during early life are known to influence mucosal immunity, yet the mechanisms for how these exposures operate remain unclear. Here, we used rotavirus infection to follow antigen-specific IgA responses through time and in different gut compartments. Using genetic and pharmacological approaches, we tested the role of the lymphotoxin (LT) pathway-known to support IgA responses-at different developmental stages. We found that LT-\u03b2 receptor (LT\u03b2R) signaling in early life programs intestinal IgA responses in adulthood by affecting antibody class switch recombination to IgA and subsequent generation of IgA antibody-secreting cells within an intact MLN. In addition, early-life LT\u03b2R signaling dictates the phenotype and function of MLN stromal cells to support IgA responses in the adult. Collectively, our studies uncover new mechanistic insights into how early-life LT\u03b2R signaling affects mucosal immune responses during adulthood. ",
        "Hepatic Lipoprotein Export and Remission of Human Type 2 Diabetes after Weight Loss. The role of hepatic lipoprotein metabolism in diet-induced remission of type 2 diabetes is currently unclear. Here, we determined the contributions of hepatic VLDL1-triglyceride production rate and VLDL1-palmitic acid content to changes in intra-pancreatic fat and return of first phase insulin response in a subgroup of the Diabetes Remission Clinical Trial. Liver fat, VLDL1-triglyceride production, and intra-pancreatic fat decreased after weight loss\u00a0and remained normalized after 24\u00a0months of remission. First-phase insulin response remained increased only in those maintaining diabetes remission. Compared with those in remission at 24\u00a0months, individuals who relapsed after initial remission had a\u00a0greater rise in the content of VLDL1-triglyceride and VLDL1-palmitic acid, re-accumulated intra-pancreatic fat, and lost first-phase response by 24\u00a0months. Thus, we observed temporal relationships between VLDL1-triglyceride production, hepatic palmitic acid flux, intra-pancreatic fat, and \u03b2-cell function. Weight-related disordered fat metabolism appears to drive development and reversal of type 2 diabetes. ",
        "Freestanding Emergency Department Entry and Market-level Spending on Emergency Care. BACKGROUND: Freestanding emergency departments (FrEDs) could reduce wait times in overcrowded emergency departments (EDs), but they might also increase usage and overall spending for emergency care. We investigate the relationship between the number of FrEDs entering a local market and overall spending on emergency care. METHODS: We accessed data from Arizona, Florida, North Carolina, and Texas in Blue Cross Blue Shield Axis; a limited data set of deidentified insurance data claims that we linked to Public Use Microdata Area (PUMA) data from the American Community Survey; and lists of licensed FrEDs from state agencies. Regression analysis was used to estimate the association between changes in the number of FrEDs in 495 PUMAs and total spending on emergency care, out-of-pocket spending, utilization, and price per visit from January 2013 to December 2017. Final estimates came from a PUMA-level fixed-effects model, with controls for state, quarter, and PUMA-level demographics. RESULTS: Entry of an additional FrED in a PUMA was associated with a 3.6 percentage point (pp; CI\u00a0= 2.4 to 4.9) increase in emergency provider reimbursement per insured beneficiary in Texas, Florida, and North Carolina. There was no change in spending (2.5 pp; CI\u00a0= -8.2 to 3.1) associated with a FrED's entry in Arizona. Entry of an additional FrED was associated with a 0.18 (CI\u00a0= 0.12 to 0.23) increase in the number of emergency care visits per 100 enrollees in Texas, Florida, and Arizona. In contrast, entry of another FrED was not associated with a change in utilization (-0.03; CI = \u00a0-0.09 to 0.02) in North Carolina. Estimated out-of-pocket payments for emergency care increased 3.6 pp (CI\u00a0=\u00a02.5 to 4.8) with the entry of a FrED in Texas, Florida, and Arizona, but declined by 15.3 pp (CI\u00a0= -26.8 to -3.7) in North Carolina. CONCLUSIONS: Rather than functioning as substitutes for hospital-based EDs, FrEDs have increased local market spending on emergency care in three of four states' markets where they have entered. State policy makers and researchers should carefully track spending and utilization of emergency care as FrEDs disseminate to better understand their potential health benefits and cost implications for patients.

        "Descending motor circuitry required for NT-3 mediated locomotor recovery after spinal cord injury in mice. Locomotor function, mediated by lumbar neural circuitry, is modulated by descending spinal pathways. Spinal cord injury (SCI) interrupts descending projections and denervates lumbar motor neurons (MNs). We previously reported that retrogradely transported neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) to lumbar MNs attenuated SCI-induced lumbar MN dendritic atrophy and enabled functional recovery after a rostral thoracic contusion. Here we functionally dissected the role of descending neural pathways in response to NT-3-mediated recovery after a T9 contusive SCI in mice. We find that residual projections to lumbar MNs are required to produce leg movements after SCI. Next, we show that the spared descending propriospinal pathway, rather than other pathways (including the corticospinal, rubrospinal, serotonergic, and dopaminergic pathways), accounts for NT-3-enhanced recovery. Lastly, we show that NT-3 induced propriospino-MN circuit reorganization after the T9 contusion via promotion of dendritic regrowth rather than prevention of dendritic atrophy. ",

Third-generation Arab Americans had increased odds of being overweight or obese when compared with first- (AOR\u2009=\u20092.59; 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.02, 6.58) and second-generation Arab Americans (AOR\u2009=\u20093.22; 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.25, 8.29), respectively.Conclusions. Alcohol use increased across immigrant generations, and we observed no differences in health outcomes, other than obesity. The immigrant health paradox does not appear to apply to Arab Americans in California; mechanisms that generate health in this population should be studied further. ",
        "SIRT6 Promotes Hepatic Beta-Oxidation via Activation of PPAR\u03b1. The pro-longevity enzyme SIRT6 regulates various metabolic pathways. Gene expression analyses in\u00a0SIRT6 heterozygotic mice identify significant decreases in PPAR\u03b1 signaling, known to regulate multiple metabolic pathways. SIRT6 binds PPAR\u03b1 and its response element within promoter regions and activates gene transcription. Sirt6+/- results in significantly reduced PPAR\u03b1-induced \u03b2-oxidation and its metabolites and reduced alanine and lactate levels, while inducing pyruvate oxidation. Reciprocally, starved SIRT6 transgenic mice show increased pyruvate, acetylcarnitine, and glycerol levels and significantly induce \u03b2-oxidation genes in a PPAR\u03b1-dependent\u00a0manner. Furthermore, SIRT6 mediates PPAR\u03b1 inhibition of SREBP-dependent cholesterol and triglyceride synthesis. Mechanistically, SIRT6 binds PPAR\u03b1 coactivator NCOA2 and decreases liver NCOA2 K780 acetylation, which stimulates its activation of PPAR\u03b1 in a SIRT6-dependent manner. These coordinated SIRT6 activities lead to regulation of whole-body respiratory exchange ratio and liver fat content, revealing the interactions whereby SIRT6 synchronizes various metabolic pathways, and suggest a mechanism by which SIRT6 maintains healthy liver.

        "Prepregnancy obesity is associated with cognitive outcomes in boys in a low-income, multiethnic birth cohort. BACKGROUND: Maternal obesity and high gestational weight gain (GWG) disproportionally affect low-income populations and may be associated with child neurodevelopment in a sex-specific manner. We examined sex-specific associations between prepregnancy BMI, GWG, and child neurodevelopment at age 7. METHODS: Data are from a prospective low-income cohort of African American and Dominican women (n\u2009=\u2009368; 44.8% male offspring) enrolled during the second half of pregnancy from 1998 to 2006. Neurodevelopment was measured using the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC-IV) at approximately child age 7. Linear regression estimated associations between prepregnancy BMI, GWG, and child outcomes, adjusting for race/ethnicity, marital status, gestational age at delivery, maternal education, maternal IQ and child age. RESULTS: Overweight affected 23.9% of mothers and obesity affected 22.6%. At age 7, full-scale IQ was higher among girls (99.7\u2009\u00b1\u200911.6) compared to boys (96.9\u2009\u00b1\u200913.3). Among boys, but not girls, prepregnancy overweight and obesity were associated with lower full-scale IQ scores [overweight \u03b2: -\u20097.1, 95% CI: (-\u200912.1, -\u20092.0); obesity \u03b2: -\u20095.7, 95% CI: (-\u200910.7, -\u20090.7)]. GWG was not associated with full-scale IQ in either sex. CONCLUSIONS: Prepregnancy overweight and obesity were associated with lower IQ among boys, but not girls, at 7\u2009years. These findings are important considering overweight and obesity prevalence and the long-term implications of early cognitive development. ",
        "Effects of PACK guide training on the management of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease by primary care clinicians: a pragmatic cluster randomised controlled trial in Florian\u00f3polis, Brazil. Introduction: The Practical Approach to Care Kit (PACK) guide was localised for Brazil, where primary care doctors and nurses were trained to use it. Methods: Twenty-four municipal clinics in Florian\u00f3polis were randomly allocated to receive outreach training and the guide, and 24 were allocated to receive only the guide. 6666 adult patients with asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) were enrolled, and trial outcomes were measured over 12 months, using electronic medical records. The primary outcomes were composite scores of treatment changes and spirometry, and new asthma and COPD diagnosis rates. Results: Asthma scores in 2437 intervention group participants were higher (74.8%, 20.4% and 4.8% with scores of 0, 1 and 2, respectively) than in 2633 control group participants (80.0%, 16.8% and 3.2%) (OR for higher score 1.32, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.61, p=0.006). Adjusted for asthma scores recorded in each clinic before training started, the OR was 1.24 (95% CI 1.03 to 1.50, p=0.022). COPD scores in 1371 intervention group participants (77.7%, 17.9% and 4.3% with scores of 0, 1 and 2) did not differ from those in 1181 control group participants (80.5%, 15.8% and 3.7%) (OR 1.21, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.55, p=0.142). Rates of new asthma and COPD diagnoses, and hospital admission, and indicators of investigation, diagnosis and treatment of comorbid cardiovascular disease, diabetes and depression, and tobacco cessation did not differ between trial arms. Conclusion: PACK training increased guideline-based treatment and spirometry for asthma but did not affect COPD or comorbid conditions, or diagnosis rates.

        "Variant Signal Peptides of Vaccine Antigen, FHbp, Impair Processing Affecting Surface Localization and Antibody-Mediated Killing in Most Meningococcal Isolates. Meningococcal lipoprotein, Factor H binding protein (FHbp), is the sole antigen of the Trumenba vaccine (Pfizer) and one of four antigens of the Bexsero vaccine (GSK) targeting Neisseria meningitidis serogroup B isolates. Lipidation of FHbp is assumed to occur for all isolates. We show in the majority of a collection of United Kingdom isolates (1742/1895) non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the signal peptide (SP) of FHbp. A single SNP, common to all, alters a polar amino acid that abolishes processing: lipidation and SP cleavage. Whilst some of the FHbp precursor is retained in the cytoplasm due to reduced binding to SecA, remarkably some is translocated and further surface-localized by Slam. Thus we show Slam is not lipoprotein-specific. In a panel of isolates tested, the overall reduced surface localization of the precursor FHbp, compared to isolates with an intact SP, corresponded with decreased susceptibility to antibody-mediated killing. Our findings shed new light on the canonical pathway for lipoprotein processing and translocation of important relevance for lipoprotein-based vaccines in development and in particular for Trumenba.

        "Time-Based Prospective Memory Is Associated with Functional Performance in Persons with MS. OBJECTIVE: Persons with multiple sclerosis (MS) often report prospective memory (PM) failures that directly impact their everyday life. However, it is not known whether PM deficits confer an increased risk of poorer everyday functioning. The aims of this study were to: (1) compare time- (Time-PM) and event-based PM (Event-PM) performance between persons with MS and healthy controls (HCs), (2) examine the neuropsychological correlates of PM in MS, and (3) examine the relationship between PM and everyday functioning in MS. METHOD: A between-subjects design was used to examine 30 adults with MS and 30 community-dwelling HC. Participants were administered the Memory for Intentions Screening Test (MIST) to assess PM skills, the Actual Reality\u2122 (AR) to assess everyday functioning, and a battery of cognitive tests. RESULTS: The MS group performed significantly worse on Time-PM compared to HC but not on Event-PM tasks. While both Time-PM and Event-PM subscales were correlated with retrospective learning and memory, the MIST Time-PM subscale was correlated with executive functions. Significant correlations were observed between AR and the MIST Time-PM, but not Event-PM, subscales. CONCLUSIONS: The results highlight the role of executive functions on Time-PM. Furthermore, significant relationships with AR extend the ecological validity of the MIST to MS populations. ",
        "The Impact of Medicaid Managed Care on Obstetrical Care and Birth Outcomes: A Case Study. .                         Background:.                      As Medicaid has increasingly financed managed care plans since the 1990s, it is important to understand the corresponding impacts on the well-being of disadvantaged mothers and infants. This study examines how a Medicaid managed care (MMC) program in Pennsylvania (PA) impacts disadvantaged women's obstetrical care utilization and access as well as their birth outcomes. .                         Materials and Methods:.                      This study uses a dataset of PA disadvantaged women who had multiple singleton births in 1994-2004. As to the empirical approach, we apply a linear multiple regression model to implement a pre-post design with control groups. The model also controls for unmeasured maternal birth-invariant characteristics, which affect take-up of Medicaid coverage and managed care plans. .                         Results:.                      The sample for the main analysis consists of 78,346 sibling births. We find the program roll-out reduces usage of some high-tech obstetrical services and limits access to high-quality hospital services, thereby contributing to cost savings. However, implementation of the program is also associated with deterioration in birth outcomes, worse prenatal care, and an elevated risk of inappropriate gestational weight gain. .                         Conclusions:.                      Cost containment through transition to MMC can be fulfilled at the price of maternal health care utilization and infant welfare. Therefore, caution is needed in design and delivery of managed care to low-income women. ",
        "Analysis of 207,543 children with acute opioid poisonings from the United States National Poison Data System. Introduction: Previous studies using administrative data have demonstrated that the United States opioid epidemic is harming both adults and children, and is straining health care systems. Our objective is to describe the outcomes and trends in resource use among children with acute opioid ingestions using patient-level case report data.Materials and Methods: This study was a retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data from the 55 poison control centers in the United States which comprise the National Poison Data System (NPDS). Children under 19\u2009years of age with a primary opioid ingestion between 1 January 2005 and 31 December 2018 were included in the analysis. Trends over three eras (2005-2009, 2010-2014, 2015-2018) were assessed using a Cochran-Armitage Trend Test. Yearly trends in the proportion of cases were calculated using generalized linear models. Multi-variable logistic regression analysis was used to calculate the adjusted odds of variables associated with having at least one Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) level intervention.Results: Children were involved in 207,543 (27.54%) of a total of 1,002,947 primary exposure-related opioid poisoning cases reported to US poison centers. The percentage of patients admitted to a critical care unit from these exposures increased in each era (6.6%, 8.5%, 9.6%). Suicidal intent increased in each era (14.0%, 15.3%, 21.2%), and was associated with increased adjusted odds of receiving a PICU procedure (OR 9.68, CI 7.97-11.76). Fentanyl (OR 12, CI 9.2-15.7), heroin (OR 11.1, CI 9.4-13.1), and methadone (OR 15, CI 13-17.3) were the opioids most associated with having a PICU procedure.Discussion and Conclusions: The severity of admissions for acute opioid ingestions, especially following attempted suicide, has increased over the studied time frame. Efforts focused on reducing access, especially to synthetic and illicit opioids, and addressing adolescent suicidality are needed to reduce these serious consequences of the opioid epidemic on children in the United States.

        "Polygenic risk-tailored screening for prostate cancer: A benefit-harm and cost-effectiveness modelling study. BACKGROUND: The United States Preventive Services Task Force supports individualised decision-making for prostate-specific antigen (PSA)-based screening in men aged 55-69. Knowing how the potential benefits and harms of screening vary by an individual's risk of developing prostate cancer could inform decision-making about screening at both an individual and population level. This modelling study examined the benefit-harm tradeoffs and the cost-effectiveness of a risk-tailored screening programme compared to age-based and no screening. METHODS AND FINDINGS: A life-table model, projecting age-specific prostate cancer incidence and mortality, was developed of a hypothetical cohort of 4.48 million men in England aged 55 to 69 years with follow-up to age 90. Risk thresholds were based on age and polygenic profile. We compared no screening, age-based screening (quadrennial PSA testing from 55 to 69), and risk-tailored screening (men aged 55 to 69 years with a 10-year absolute risk greater than a threshold receive quadrennial PSA testing from the age they reach the risk threshold). The analysis was undertaken from the health service perspective, including direct costs borne by the health system for risk assessment, screening, diagnosis, and treatment. We used probabilistic sensitivity analyses to account for parameter uncertainty and discounted future costs and benefits at 3.5% per year. Our analysis should be considered cautiously in light of limitations related to our model's cohort-based structure and the uncertainty of input parameters in mathematical models. Compared to no screening over 35 years follow-up, age-based screening prevented the most deaths from prostate cancer (39,272, 95% uncertainty interval [UI]: 16,792-59,685) at the expense of 94,831 (95% UI: 84,827-105,630) overdiagnosed cancers. Age-based screening was the least cost-effective strategy studied. The greatest number of quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) was generated by risk-based screening at a 10-year absolute risk threshold of 4%. At this threshold, risk-based screening led to one-third fewer overdiagnosed cancers (64,384, 95% UI: 57,382-72,050) but averted 6.3% fewer (9,695, 95% UI: 2,853-15,851) deaths from prostate cancer by comparison with age-based screening. Relative to no screening, risk-based screening at a 4% 10-year absolute risk threshold was cost-effective in 48.4% and 57.4% of the simulations at willingness-to-pay thresholds of GBP\u00a320,000 (US$26,000) and \u00a330,000 ($39,386) per QALY, respectively. The cost-effectiveness of risk-tailored screening improved as the threshold rose. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the results of this modelling study, offering screening to men at higher risk could potentially reduce overdiagnosis and improve the benefit-harm tradeoff and the cost-effectiveness of a prostate cancer screening program. The optimal threshold will depend on societal judgements of the appropriate balance of benefits-harms and cost-effectiveness. ",
        "Expanding Heart Transplant in the Era of Direct-Acting Antiviral Therapy for Hepatitis C. Importance: For patients awaiting heart transplant, hepatitis C-positive donors offer an opportunity to expand the donor pool, shorten wait times, and decrease wait-list mortality. While early reported outcomes among few heart transplant recipients have been promising, knowledge of 1-year outcomes in larger cohorts of patients is critical to shared decision-making with patients about this option. Objective: To better define the association of hepatitis C-positive donors with heart transplant volumes, wait-list duration, the transmission and cure of donor-derived hepatitis C, and morbidity and mortality at 1 year. Design, Setting, and Participants: This was a prospective, single-center observational study of 80 adult (age 18 years or older) patients who underwent heart transplant using hearts from hepatitis C-positive donors between September 2016 and April 2019 at a large academic medical center. Among donors, who were considered hepatitis C-positive if results from hepatitis C antibody and/or nucleic acid testing were positive, 70 had viremia and 10 were seropositive but did not have viremia. Follow-up was available through May 15, 2019. Comparisons were drawn with patients who underwent transplant with hearts from hepatitis C-negative donors during the same period. Exposures: In addition to standard posttransplant management, transplant recipients who developed donor-derived hepatitis C infection were treated with direct-acting antivirals. Main Outcomes and Measures: The main outcomes included wait-list duration and 1-year survival in all patients, and for those who developed donor-derived hepatitis C, the response to direct-acting antiviral treatment. Results: Of 80 patients, 57 (71.3%) were men, 55 (68.7%) were white, and 17 (26.3%) were black; the median age at transplant was 54.5 years (interquartile range, 46-62 years). Following consent to accept hearts from hepatitis C-exposed donors, the median days to heart transplant was 4 (interquartile range, 1-18). No recipients of donors with negative nucleic acid testing results (10 [12.5%]) developed donor-derived hepatitis C. Of 70 patients who were recipients of donors with positive nucleic acid testing results, 67 (95.7%) developed donor-derived hepatitis C over a median follow-up of 301 days (interquartile range, 142-617). Treatment with direct-acting antivirals was well tolerated and yielded sustained virologic responses in all treated patients. Within the cohort with infection, 1-year patient survival was 90.4%, which was not significantly different compared with the cohort without infection or with patients who received transplants from hepatitis C-negative donors during the same period. Conclusions and Relevance: In the era of direct-acting antivirals, hepatitis C-positive donors are a viable option to expand the donor pool, potentially reducing wait-list duration and mortality. In heart transplant recipients with donor-derived hepatitis C, infection is well-tolerated and curable, and 1-year survival is equivalent to that in recipients of hepatitis C-negative donors. ",
        "Ancestral-sequence reconstruction unveils the structural basis of function in mammalian FMOs. Flavin-containing monooxygenases (FMOs) are ubiquitous in all domains of life and metabolize a myriad of xenobiotics, including toxins, pesticides and drugs. However, despite their pharmacological importance, structural information remains bereft. To further our understanding behind their biochemistry and diversity, we used ancestral-sequence reconstruction, kinetic and crystallographic techniques to scrutinize three ancient mammalian FMOs: AncFMO2, AncFMO3-6 and AncFMO5. Remarkably, all AncFMOs could be crystallized and were structurally resolved between 2.7- and 3.2-\u00c5 resolution. These crystal structures depict the unprecedented topology of mammalian FMOs. Each employs extensive membrane-binding features and intricate substrate-profiling tunnel networks through a conspicuous membrane-adhering insertion. Furthermore, a glutamate-histidine switch is speculated to induce the distinctive Baeyer-Villiger oxidation activity of FMO5. The AncFMOs exhibited catalysis akin to human FMOs and, with sequence identities between 82% and 92%, represent excellent models. Our study demonstrates the power of ancestral-sequence reconstruction as a strategy for the crystallization of proteins. ",
        "Comparing Rates of Adverse Events and Medical Errors on Inpatient Psychiatric Units at Veterans Health Administration and Community-based General Hospitals. OBJECTIVE: There is limited knowledge about how general hospitals and Veterans Health Administration (VHA) hospitals fare relative to each other on a broad range of inpatient psychiatry-specific patient safety outcomes.This research compares data from 2 large-scale epidemiological studies of adverse events (AEs) and medical errors (MEs) in inpatient psychiatric units, one in VHA hospitals and the other in community-based general hospitals. METHOD: Retrospective medical record reviews assessed the prevalence of AEs and MEs in a sample of 4371 discharges from 14 community-based general hospitals (derived from 69,081 discharges at 85 hospitals) and a sample of 8005 discharges from 40 VHA hospitals (derived from 92,103 discharges at 105 medical centers). Rates of AEs and MEs across hospital systems were calculated, controlling for relevant patient and hospital characteristics. RESULTS: The overall rate of AEs and MEs in inpatient psychiatric units of VHA hospitals was 7.11 and 1.49 per 100 patient discharges; at community-based acute care hospitals, these rates were 13.48 and 3.01 per 100 patient discharges. The adjusted odds ratio of a patient experiencing an AE and a ME at community-based hospitals as compared with VHA hospitals was 2.11 and 2.08, respectively. CONCLUSION: Although chart reviews may not document the complete nature and outcomes of care, even after controlling for differences in patient and hospital characteristics, psychiatric inpatients at community-based hospitals were twice as likely to experience AEs or MEs as inpatients at VHA hospitals. While community-based hospitals may lag behind VHA hospitals, both hospital systems should continue to pursue evidence-based improvements in patient safety. Future research aimed at changing hospital practices should draw on established strategies for bridging the gap from research to practice in order to improve the quality of care for this vulnerable patient population.

        "Behavioral Intervention and Disposal of Leftover Opioids: A Randomized Trial. OBJECTIVES: Leftover prescription opioids pose risks to children and adolescents, yet many parents keep these medications in the home. Our objective in this study was to determine if providing a behavioral disposal method (ie, Nudge) with or without a Scenario-Tailored Opioid Messaging Program (STOMP) (risk-enhancement education) improves parents' opioid-disposal behavior after their children's use. METHODS: Parents whose children were prescribed a short course of opioids were recruited and randomly assigned to the Nudge or control groups with or without STOMP. Parents completed surveys at baseline and 7 and 14 days. Main outcomes were (1) prompt disposal (ie, immediate disposal of leftovers after use) and (2) planned retention (intention to keep leftovers). RESULTS: There were 517 parents who took part, and 93% had leftovers after use. Prompt disposal behavior was higher for parents who received both the STOMP and Nudge interventions (38.5%), Nudge alone (33.3%), or STOMP alone (31%) compared with controls (19.2%; P \u2264 .02). Furthermore, the STOMP intervention independently decreased planned retention rates (5.6% vs 12.5% no STOMP; adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 0.40 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.19-0.85]). Higher risk perception lowered the odds of planned retention (aOR 0.87 [95% CI 0.79-0.96]), whereas parental past opioid misuse increased those odds (aOR 4.44 [95% CI 1.67-11.79]). CONCLUSIONS: Providing a disposal method nudged parents to dispose of their children's leftover opioids promptly after use, whereas STOMP boosted prompt disposal and reduced planned retention. Such strategies can reduce the presence of risky leftover medications in the home and decrease the risks posed to children and adolescents. ",
        "The 2016 California policy to eliminate nonmedical vaccine exemptions and changes in vaccine coverage: An empirical policy analysis. BACKGROUND: Vaccine hesitancy, the reluctance or refusal to receive vaccination, is a growing public health problem in the United States and globally. State policies that eliminate nonmedical (\"personal belief\") exemptions to childhood vaccination requirements are controversial, and their effectiveness to improve vaccination coverage remains unclear given limited rigorous policy analysis. In 2016, a California policy (Senate Bill 277) eliminated nonmedical exemptions from school entry requirements. The objective of this study was to estimate the association between California's 2016 policy and changes in vaccine coverage. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We used a quasi-experimental state-level synthetic control analysis and a county-level difference-in-differences analysis to estimate the impact of the 2016 California policy on vaccination coverage and prevalence of exemptions to vaccine requirements (nonmedical and medical). We used publicly available state-level data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on coverage of measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccination, nonmedical exemption, and medical exemption in children entering kindergarten. We used county-level data individually requested from state departments of public health on overall vaccine coverage and exemptions. Based on data availability, we included state-level data for 45 states, including California, from 2011 to 2017 and county-level data for 17 states from 2010 to 2017. The prespecified primary study outcome was MMR vaccination in the state analysis and overall vaccine coverage in the county analysis. In the state-level synthetic control analysis, MMR coverage in California increased by 3.3% relative to its synthetic control in the postpolicy period (top 2 of 43 states evaluated in the placebo tests, top 5%), nonmedical exemptions decreased by 2.4% (top 2 of 43 states evaluated in the placebo tests, top 5%), and medical exemptions increased by 0.4% (top 1 of 44 states evaluated in the placebo tests, top 2%). In the county-level analysis, overall vaccination coverage increased by 4.3% (95% confidence interval [CI] 2.9%-5.8%, p < 0.001), nonmedical exemptions decreased by 3.9% (95% CI 2.4%-5.4%, p < 0.001), and medical exemptions increased by 2.4% (95% CI 2.0%-2.9%, p < 0.001). Changes in vaccination coverage across counties after the policy implementation from 2015 to 2017 ranged from -6% to 26%, with larger increases in coverage in counties with lower prepolicy vaccine coverage. Results were robust to alternative model specifications. The limitations of the study were the exclusion of a subset of US states from the analysis and the use of only 2 years of postpolicy data based on data availability. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, implementation of the California policy that eliminated nonmedical childhood vaccine exemptions was associated with an estimated increase in vaccination coverage and a reduction in nonmedical exemptions at state and county levels. The observed increase in medical exemptions was offset by the larger reduction in nonmedical exemptions. The largest increases in vaccine coverage were observed in the most \"high-risk\" counties, meaning those with the lowest prepolicy vaccine coverage. Our findings suggest that government policies removing nonmedical exemptions can be effective at increasing vaccination coverage. ",
        "Level of Consciousness Is Dissociable from Electroencephalographic Measures of Cortical Connectivity, Slow Oscillations, and Complexity. Leading neuroscientific theories posit a central role for the functional integration of cortical areas in conscious states. Considerable evidence supporting this hypothesis is based on network changes during anesthesia, but it is unclear whether these changes represent state-related (conscious vs unconscious) or drug-related (anesthetic vs no anesthetic) effects. We recently demonstrated that carbachol delivery to prefrontal cortex (PFC) restored wakefulness despite continuous administration of the general anesthetic sevoflurane. By contrast, carbachol delivery to parietal cortex, or noradrenaline delivery to either prefrontal or parietal cortices, failed to restore wakefulness. Thus, carbachol-induced reversal of sevoflurane anesthesia represents a unique state that combines wakefulness with clinically relevant anesthetic concentrations in the brain. To differentiate the state-related and drug-related associations of cortical connectivity and dynamics, we analyzed the electroencephalographic data gathered from adult male Sprague Dawley rats during the aforementioned experiments for changes in functional cortical gamma connectivity (25-155 Hz), slow oscillations (0.5-1 Hz), and complexity (<175 Hz). We show that higher gamma (85-155 Hz) connectivity is decreased (p \u2264 0.02) during sevoflurane anesthesia, an expected finding, but was not restored during wakefulness induced by carbachol delivery to PFC. Conversely, for rats in which wakefulness was not restored, the functional gamma connectivity remained reduced, but there was a significant decrease (p < 0.001) in the power of slow oscillations and increase (p < 0.001) in cortical complexity, which was similar to that observed during wakefulness induced after carbachol delivery to PFC. We conclude that the level of consciousness can be dissociated from cortical connectivity, oscillations, and dynamics.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Numerous theories of consciousness suggest that functional connectivity across the cortex is characteristic of the conscious state and is reduced during anesthesia. However, it is unknown whether the observed changes are state-related (conscious vs unconscious) or drug-related (drug vs no drug). We used a novel rat model in which cholinergic stimulation of PFC produced wakefulness despite continuous exposure to a general anesthetic. We demonstrate that, as expected, general anesthesia reduces connectivity. Surprisingly, the connectivity remains suppressed despite pharmacologically induced wakefulness in the presence of anesthetic, with restoration occurring only after the anesthetic is discontinued. Thus, whether an animal exhibits wakefulness or not can be dissociated from cortical connectivity, prompting a reevaluation of the role of connectivity in level of consciousness. ",
        "The Effect of Macronutrients on Reproductive Hormones in Overweight and Obese Men: A Pilot Study. Hypogonadal obese men find it difficult to lose weight. We investigated whether the modification of macronutrient intake can alter testosterone levels independently of the body mass index. Fasted overweight or obese fertile men were asked to consume meals of polyunsaturated fats (PUFA), monounsaturated fats (MUFA), refined carbohydrates (CHO, orange juice, OJ), whey and egg albumin and mixed meals of PUFA and CHO, PUFA and egg albumin, and CHO and egg albumin. Blood was collected at fasting, then hourly for 5 h and analysed to determine the levels of testosterone and other hormones. We found PUFA and MUFA or a mixed meal of PUFA and CHO significantly reduced serum testosterone production to a similar degree over a 5 h period. PUFA decreased serum testosterone levels by 3.2 nmol/L after 1 h compared to baseline (p = 0.023), with this suppression remaining significant up to 5 h postprandially (2.1 nmol/L; p = 0.012). The net overall testosterone levels were reduced by approximately 10 nmol/L \u00d7 h by PUFA, MUFA and PUFA combined with CHO. CHO alone had little effect on testosterone levels, whereas egg albumin was able to increase them (7.4 cf 2.0 nmol/L \u00d7 h). Therefore, for men wishing to optimize their testosterone levels, it may be wise to avoid a high fat intake, drink liquids such as water or OJ or even consider fasting.

        "Spinal subpial delivery of AAV9 enables widespread gene silencing and blocks motoneuron degeneration in ALS. Gene silencing with virally delivered shRNA represents a promising approach for treatment of inherited neurodegenerative disorders. In the present study we develop a subpial technique, which we show in adult animals successfully delivers adeno-associated virus (AAV) throughout the cervical, thoracic and lumbar spinal cord, as well as brain motor centers. One-time injection at cervical and lumbar levels just before disease onset in mice expressing a familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)-causing mutant SOD1 produces long-term suppression of motoneuron disease, including near-complete preservation of spinal \u03b1-motoneurons and muscle innervation. Treatment after disease onset potently blocks progression of disease and further \u03b1-motoneuron degeneration. A single subpial AAV9 injection in adult pigs or non-human primates using a newly designed device produces homogeneous delivery throughout the cervical spinal cord white and gray matter and brain motor centers. Thus, spinal subpial delivery in adult animals is highly effective for AAV-mediated gene delivery throughout the spinal cord and supraspinal motor centers. ",
        "An efficient gene knock-in strategy using 5'-modified double-stranded DNA donors with short homology arms. Here, we report a rapid CRISPR-Cas9-mediated gene knock-in strategy that uses Cas9 ribonucleoprotein and 5'-modified double-stranded DNA donors with 50-base-pair homology arms and achieved unprecedented 65/40% knock-in rates for 0.7/2.5\u2009kilobase inserts, respectively, in human embryonic kidney 293T cells. The identified 5'-end modification led to up to a fivefold increase in gene knock-in rates at various genomic loci in human cancer and stem cells. ",
        "Single-cell analysis of structural variations and complex rearrangements with tri-channel processing. Structural variation (SV), involving deletions, duplications, inversions and translocations of DNA segments, is a major source of genetic variability in somatic cells and can dysregulate cancer-related pathways. However, discovering somatic SVs in single cells has been challenging, with copy-number-neutral and complex variants typically escaping detection. Here we describe single-cell tri-channel processing (scTRIP), a computational framework that integrates read depth, template strand and haplotype phase to comprehensively discover SVs in individual cells. We surveyed SV landscapes of 565 single cells, including transformed epithelial cells and patient-derived leukemic samples, to discover abundant SV classes, including inversions, translocations and complex DNA rearrangements. Analysis of the leukemic samples revealed four times more somatic SVs than cytogenetic karyotyping, submicroscopic copy-number alterations, oncogenic copy-neutral rearrangements and a subclonal chromothripsis event. Advancing current methods, single-cell tri-channel processing can directly measure SV mutational processes in individual cells, such as breakage-fusion-bridge cycles, facilitating studies of clonal evolution, genetic mosaicism and SV formation mechanisms, which could improve disease classification for precision medicine.

        "Association of body mass index and cardiotoxicity related to anthracyclines and trastuzumab in early breast cancer: French CANTO cohort study. BACKGROUND: In patients treated with cardiotoxic chemotherapies, the presence of cardiovascular risk factors and previous cardiac disease have been strongly correlated to the onset of cardiotoxicity. The influence of overweight and obesity as risk factors in the development of treatment-related cardiotoxicity in breast cancer (BC) was recently suggested. However, due to meta-analysis design, it was not possible to take into account associated cardiac risk factors or other classic risk factors for anthracycline (antineoplastic antibiotic) and trastuzumab (monoclonal antibody) cardiotoxicity. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Using prospective data collected from 2012-2014 in the French national multicenter prospective CANTO (CANcer TOxicities) study of 26 French cancer centers, we aimed to examine the association of body mass index (BMI) and cardiotoxicity (defined as a reduction in left ventricular ejection fraction [LVEF] > 10 percentage points from baseline to LVEF < 50%). In total, 929 patients with stage I-III BC (mean age 52 \u00b1 11 years, mean BMI 25.6 \u00b1 5.1 kg/m2, 42% with 1 or more cardiovascular risk factors) treated with anthracycline (86% epirubicin, 7% doxorubicin) and/or trastuzumab (36%), with LVEF measurement at baseline and at least 1 assessment post-chemotherapy were eligible in this interim analysis. We analyzed associations between BMI and cardiotoxicity using multivariate logistic regression. At baseline, nearly 50% of the study population was overweight or obese. During a mean follow-up of 22 \u00b1 2 months following treatment completion, cardiotoxicity occurred in 29 patients (3.2%). The obese group was more prone to cardiotoxicity than the normal-weight group (9/171 versus 8/466; p = 0.01). In multivariate analysis, obesity (odds ratio [OR] 3.02; 95% CI 1.10-8.25; p = 0.03) and administration of trastuzumab (OR 12.12; 95% CI 3.6-40.4; p < 0.001) were independently associated with cardiotoxicity. Selection bias and relatively short follow-up are potential limitations of this national multicenter observational cohort. CONCLUSIONS: In BC patients, obesity appears to be associated with an important increase in risk-related cardiotoxicity (CANTO, ClinicalTrials.gov registry ID: NCT01993498). TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01993498. ",
        "Antiretroviral Prescribing Practices Among Pregnant Women Living With HIV in the United States, 2008-2017. Importance: Since 1994, the US Department of Health and Human Services has published treatment guidelines for pregnant women living with HIV. Understanding how well prescribing patterns correspond with treatment guidelines could inform health policy and influence future clinical practice. Objectives: To compare antiretroviral prescribing practices over time among pregnant women living with HIV with Department of Health and Human Services treatment guidelines and identify factors associated with receiving recommended regimens. Design, Setting, and Participants: A prospective cohort study of 1582 pregnant women living with HIV were enrolled in the Pediatric HIV/AIDS Cohort Study Surveillance Monitoring of ART (antiretroviral therapy) Toxicities study between January 1, 2008, and June 30, 2017. The study was conducted at 18 academic research hospitals in the United States. Exposures: Antiretroviral medications (ARVs) prescribed during pregnancy. Main Outcomes and Measures: Proportion of regimens prescribed to pregnant women living with HIV qualifying as preferred or alternative according to Department of Health and Human Services guidelines, stratified by timing of initiation. Results: Of 1867 pregnancies (among 1582 pregnant women living with HIV with a mean [SD] age of 28.6 [6.1] years at conception), 1264 (67.7%) occurred among women self-identified as black, 480 (25.7%) self-identified as white, and 123 (6.6%) self-identified as other or unreported race/ethnicity. Antiretroviral medications were initiated prior to conception for 790 women (42.3%), resumed during pregnancy for 625 women (33.5%), and initiated during pregnancy for 452 women (24.2%). Only 925 pregnancies (49.5%) were associated with prescribed ARVs designated as preferred or alternative, while 492 (26.4%) involved ARVs with insufficient evidence for use during pregnancy and 136 (7.3%) involved ARVs that were not recommended during pregnancy. A higher proportion of treatment-naive pregnant women initiating ARVs were prescribed preferred or alternative ARVs compared with those resuming ARVs or those treated with ARVs before conception (316 of 452 [69.9%] vs 325 of 625 [52.0%] vs 284 of 790 [35.9%]; P\u2009<\u2009.001). A total of 91 of 452 women (20.1%) initiating ARVs during pregnancy were prescribed ARVs with insufficient evidence for use during pregnancy or not recommended during pregnancy. Among women resuming ARVs, those with a viral load greater than 1000 copies/mL early in pregnancy had higher odds of being prescribed guideline-recommended ARVs (adjusted odds ratio, 2.03 [95% CI, 1.33-3.10]) compared with those with a viral load of 400 copies/mL or less. Conclusions and Relevance: This study suggests that US ARV prescribing practices for pregnant women living with HIV do not align well with national guidelines. This finding is particularly concerning when treatment is initiated during pregnancy. Further research is needed to understand disparities between prescribing practices and evidence-based guideline recommendations. ",
        "Knowledge and Perception of Breast Density, Screening Mammography, and Supplemental Screening: in Search of \"Informed\". BACKGROUND: As of 2019, 37 US states have breast density notification laws. No qualitative study to date has examined women's perspectives about breast density in general or by states with and without notification laws. OBJECTIVE: Explore women's knowledge and perceptions of breast density and experiences of breast cancer screening across three states with and without notification laws. DESIGN: Qualitative research design using four focus groups conducted in 2017. PARTICIPANTS: Forty-seven women who had a recent normal mammogram and dense breasts in registry data obtained through the Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium. APPROACH: Focus groups were 90\u00a0min, audio recorded, and transcribed for analysis. Data were analyzed using mixed deductive and inductive coding. KEY RESULTS: Women reported variable knowledge levels of personal breast density and breast density in general, even among women living in states with a notification law. A number of women were aware of the difficulty of detecting cancer with dense breasts, but only one knew that density increased breast cancer risk. Across all states, very few women reported receiving information about breast density during healthcare visits beyond being encouraged to get supplemental imaging or to pay for new mammography technology (i.e., breast tomosynthesis). Women offered more imaging or different technology held strong convictions that these were \"better,\" even though knowledge of differences, effectiveness, or harms across technologies seemed limited. Women from all states expressed a strong desire for more information about breast density. CONCLUSIONS: More research needs to be done to understand how the medical community can best assist women in making informed decisions related to breast density, mammography, and supplemental screening. Options to explore include improved breast density notifications and education materials about breast density, continued development of personalized risk information tools, strategies for providers to discuss evidence and options based on risk stratification, and shared decision-making.

        "Creatine uptake regulates CD8 T cell antitumor immunity. T cells demand massive energy to combat cancer; however, the metabolic regulators controlling antitumor T cell immunity have just begun to be unveiled. When studying nutrient usage of tumor-infiltrating immune cells in mice, we detected a sharp increase of the expression of a CrT (Slc6a8) gene, which encodes a surface transporter controlling the uptake of creatine into a cell. Using CrT knockout mice, we showed that creatine uptake deficiency severely impaired antitumor T cell immunity. Supplementing creatine to WT mice significantly suppressed tumor growth in multiple mouse tumor models, and the combination of creatine supplementation with a PD-1/PD-L1 blockade treatment showed synergistic tumor suppression efficacy. We further demonstrated that creatine acts as a \"molecular battery\" conserving bioenergy to power T cell activities. Therefore, our results have identified creatine as an important metabolic regulator controlling antitumor T cell immunity, underscoring the potential of creatine supplementation to improve T cell-based cancer immunotherapies.

        "Bioactive Adrenomedullin, Organ Support Therapies, and Survival in the Critically Ill: Results from the French and European Outcome Registry in ICU Study. OBJECTIVES: Adrenomedullin has vascular properties and elevated plasma adrenomedullin levels were detected in sepsis. We assessed, in septic and nonseptic ICU patients, the relation between circulating adrenomedullin, the need for organ support and mortality, using an assay of bioactive adrenomedullin. DESIGN: Prospective multicenter observational cohort study. SETTING: Data from the French and euRopean Outcome reGistry in ICUs study. PATIENTS: Consecutive patients admitted to intensive care with a requirement for invasive mechanical ventilation and/or vasoactive drug support for more than 24 hours following ICU admission and discharged from ICU were included. INTERVENTIONS: Clinical and biological parameters were collected at baseline, including bioactive-adrenomedullin. Status of ICU survivors was assess until 1 year after discharge. The main outcome was the need for organ support, including renal replacement therapy and/or for inotrope(s) and/or vasopressor(s). Secondary endpoints were the ICU length of stay and the 28-day all-cause mortality. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Median plasma bioactive adrenomedullin (n = 2,003) was 66.6 pg/mL (34.6-136.4 pg/mL) and the median Simplified Acute Physiology Score II score 49 (36-63). Renal replacement therapy was needed in 23% and inotropes(s) and/or vasopressor(s) in 77% of studied patients. ICU length of stay was 13 days (7-21 d) and mortality at 28 days was 22 %. Elevated bioactive adrenomedullin independently predicted 1) the need for organ support (odds ratio, 4.02; 95% CI, 3.08-5.25) in ICU patients whether admitted for septic or nonseptic causes and 2) the need for renal replacement therapy (odds ratio, 4.89; 3.83-6.28), and for inotrope(s) and/or vasopressor(s) (odds ratio, 3.64; 2.84-4.69), even in patients who were not on those supports at baseline. Elevated bioactive adrenomedullin was also associated with a prolonged length of stay (odds ratio, 1.85; 1.49-2.29) and, after adjustment for Simplified Acute Physiology Score II, with mortality (odds ratio, 2.31; 1.83-2.92). CONCLUSIONS: Early measurement of bioactive adrenomedullin is a strong predictor of the need of organ support and of short-term mortality in critically ill patients. ",
        "Engraftment of skeletal progenitor cells by bone-directed transplantation improves osteogenesis imperfecta murine bone phenotype. Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is a genetic disorder most commonly caused by mutations associated with type I collagen, resulting in a defective collagen bone matrix. Current treatments for OI focus on pharmaceutical strategies to increase the amount of defective bone matrix, but do not address the underlying collagen defect. Introducing healthy donor stem cells that differentiate into osteoblasts producing normal collagen in OI patients has the potential to increase bone mass and correct the mutant collagen matrix. In this study, donor bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs, also known as bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells) expressing both \u03b1SMACreERT2/Ai9 progenitor reporter and osteoblast reporter Col2.3GFP were locally transplanted into the femur of OI murine (OIM) mice. One month post-transplantation, 18% of the endosteal surface was lined by donor Col2.3GFP expressing osteoblasts indicating robust engraftment. Long-term engraftment in the marrow was observed 3 and 6 months post-transplantation. The presence of Col1a2-expressing donor cell-derived cortical bone matrix was detected in transplanted OIM femurs. Local transplantation of BMSCs increased cortical thickness (+12%), the polar moment of inertia (+14%), bone strength (+30%), and stiffness (+30%) 3 months post-transplantation. Engrafted cells expressed progenitor markers CD51 and Sca-1 up to 3 months post-transplantation. Most importantly, 3 months post-transplantation donor cells maintained the ability to differentiate into Col2.3GFP+ osteoblasts in vitro, and in vivo following secondary transplantation into OIM animals. Locally transplanted BMSCs can improve cortical structure and strength, and persist as continued source of osteoblast progenitors in the OIM mouse for at least 6 months. ",
        "A rapid and label-free platform for virus capture and identification from clinical samples. Emerging and reemerging viruses are responsible for a number of recent epidemic outbreaks. A crucial step in predicting and controlling outbreaks is the timely and accurate characterization of emerging virus strains. We present a portable microfluidic platform containing carbon nanotube arrays with differential filtration porosity for the rapid enrichment and optical identification of viruses. Different emerging strains (or unknown viruses) can be enriched and identified in real time through a multivirus capture component in conjunction with surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy. More importantly, after viral capture and detection on a chip, viruses remain viable and get purified in a microdevice that permits subsequent in-depth characterizations by various conventional methods. We validated this platform using different subtypes of avian influenza A viruses and human samples with respiratory infections. This technology successfully enriched rhinovirus, influenza virus, and parainfluenza viruses, and maintained the stoichiometric viral proportions when the samples contained more than one type of virus, thus emulating coinfection. Viral capture and detection took only a few minutes with a 70-fold enrichment enhancement; detection could be achieved with as little as 102 EID50/mL (50% egg infective dose per microliter), with a virus specificity of 90%. After enrichment using the device, we demonstrated by sequencing that the abundance of viral-specific reads significantly increased from 4.1 to 31.8% for parainfluenza and from 0.08 to 0.44% for influenza virus. This enrichment method coupled to Raman virus identification constitutes an innovative system that could be used to quickly track and monitor viral outbreaks in real time. ",
        "Synthetic mRNA nanoparticle-mediated restoration of p53 tumor suppressor sensitizes p53-deficient cancers to mTOR inhibition. Loss of function in tumor suppressor genes is commonly associated with the onset/progression of cancer and treatment resistance. The p53 tumor suppressor gene, a master regulator of diverse cellular pathways, is frequently altered in various cancers, for example, in ~36% of hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) and ~68% of non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLCs). Current methods for restoration of p53 expression, including small molecules and DNA therapies, have yielded progressive success, but each has formidable drawbacks. Here, a redox-responsive nanoparticle (NP) platform is engineered for effective delivery of p53-encoding synthetic messenger RNA (mRNA). We demonstrate that the synthetic p53-mRNA NPs markedly delay the growth of p53-null HCC and NSCLC cells by inducing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. We also reveal that p53 restoration markedly improves the sensitivity of these tumor cells to everolimus, a mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor that failed to show clinical benefits in advanced HCC and NSCLC. Moreover, cotargeting of tumor-suppressing p53 and tumorigenic mTOR signaling pathways results in marked antitumor effects in vitro and in multiple animal models of HCC and NSCLC. Our findings indicate that restoration of tumor suppressors by the synthetic mRNA NP delivery strategy could be combined together with other therapies for potent combinatorial cancer treatment. ",
        "Endothelial Cell-Selective Adhesion Molecule Contributes to the Development of Definitive Hematopoiesis in the Fetal Liver. Endothelial cell-selective adhesion molecule (ESAM) is a lifelong marker of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Although we previously elucidated the functional importance of ESAM in HSCs in stress-induced hematopoiesis in adults, it is unclear how ESAM affects hematopoietic development during fetal life. To address this issue, we analyzed fetuses from conventional or conditional ESAM-knockout mice. Approximately half of ESAM-null fetuses died after mid-gestation due to anemia. RNA sequencing analyses revealed downregulation of adult-type globins and Alas2, a heme biosynthesis enzyme, in ESAM-null fetal livers. These abnormalities were attributed to malfunction of ESAM-null HSCs, which was demonstrated in culture and transplantation experiments. Although crosslinking ESAM directly influenced gene transcription in HSCs, observations in conditional ESAM-knockout fetuses revealed the critical involvement of ESAM expressed in endothelial cells in fetal lethality. Thus, we showed that ESAM had important roles in developing definitive hematopoiesis. Furthermore, we unveiled the importance of endothelial ESAM in this process. ",
        "Molecular Signatures of Dengue Virus-Specific IL-10/IFN-\u03b3 Co-producing CD4\u00a0T Cells and Their Association with Dengue Disease. Dengue virus (DENV) can cause diseases ranging from dengue fever (DF) to more severe dengue hemorrhagic fever/dengue shock syndrome (DHF/DSS). Whether antiviral T\u00a0cells contribute to the protection against or pathogenesis of severe disease is not well defined. Here, we identified antigen-specific IL-10+IFN-\u03b3+ double-positive (DP) CD4 T\u00a0cells during acute DENV infection. While the transcriptomic signatures of DP cells partially overlapped with those of cytotoxic and type 1 regulatory CD4 T\u00a0cells, the majority of them were non-cytotoxic/Tr1 and included IL21, IL22, CD109, and CCR1. Although we observed a higher frequency of DP cells in DHF, the transcriptomic profile of DP cells was similar in DF and DHF, suggesting that DHF is not associated with the altered phenotypic or functional attributes of DP cells. Overall, this study revealed a DENV-specific\u00a0DP cell subset in patients with acute dengue disease and argues against altered DP cells as a determinant of DHF. ",
        "Functional Oocytes Derived from Granulosa Cells. The generation of genomically stable and functional oocytes has great potential for preserving fertility and restoring ovarian function. It remains elusive whether functional oocytes can be generated from adult female somatic cells through reprogramming to germline-competent pluripotent stem cells (gPSCs) by chemical treatment alone. Here, we show that somatic granulosa cells isolated from adult mouse ovaries can be robustly induced to generate gPSCs by a purely chemical approach, with additional Rock inhibition and critical reprogramming facilitated by crotonic sodium or acid. These gPSCs acquired high germline competency and could consistently be directed to differentiate into primordial-germ-cell-like cells and form functional oocytes that produce fertile mice. Moreover, gPSCs promoted by crotonylation and the derived germ cells exhibited longer telomeres and high genomic stability like PGCs in\u00a0vivo,\u00a0providing additional evidence supporting the safety and effectiveness of chemical induction, which is particularly important for germ cells in genetic inheritance.

        "Association Between Body Mass Index and Overall Survival With Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor Therapy for Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer. Importance: High body mass index (BMI) is independently associated with overall survival benefit from immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy in patients with melanoma, yet whether BMI is associated with outcomes in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer treated with atezolizumab remains unknown. Objective: To examine whether BMI is associated with survival outcomes and adverse events in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated with atezolizumab. Design, Setting, and Participants: A pooled analysis of individual patient-level data from 4 international, multicenter clinical trials was performed. Two were single-arm phase 2 trials (BIRCH [data cutoff of May 28, 2015] and FIR [data cutoff of January 7, 2015]), and 2 were 2-arm randomized clinical trials (POPLAR [phase 2; data cutoff of May 8, 2015] and OAK [phase 3; data cutoff of July 7, 2016]). Patients with advanced NSCLC previously untreated or treated with at least 1 line of systemic therapy, with measurable disease and good organ function and without contraindications for chemotherapy or immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy, were included in these trials. Data analyses were performed from February 28, 2019, to September 30, 2019. Interventions: The control group was treated with docetaxel once every 3 weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxic effects occurred in POPLAR and OAK. The experimental group was treated with atezolizumab once every 3 weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxic effects occurred in all available trials. Main Outcomes and Measures: Association between BMI and overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), and treatment-related adverse events. Intention-to-treat analysis was conducted. Results: Adequate data were available for 2110 patients from a total pool of 2261 across 4 trials. Of those 2110, 1434 patients (median age, 64 years [range, 57-70 years]; 890 men [62%]) received atezolizumab and 676 patients (median age, 63 years[range, 57-69 years]; 419 men [62%]) received docetaxel. There was a linear association between increasing BMI and OS in patients treated with atezolizumab. Obesity (BMI \u226530 [calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared]) was associated with significantly improved OS in patients treated with atezolizumab, but not in those who received docetaxel after adjusting for confounding variables. The association between BMI and OS/PFS was the strongest in the high PD-L1 expression subgroup. Overall survival for patients with the highest category of PD-L1 expression (\u226550% of tumor cells or \u226510% of tumor-infiltrating immune cells; n\u2009=\u2009436) had hazard ratios of 0.36 (95% CI, 0.21-0.62) for the group with obesity and 0.69 (95% CI, 0.48-0.98) for the group with overweight. Patients with the highest category of PD-L1 expression had PFS hazard ratios of 0.68 (95% CI, 0.49-0.94) for the group with obesity and 0.72 (95% CI, 0.56-0.92) for the group with overweight. Treatment-related adverse events were not associated with BMI. Conclusions and Relevance: High BMI appears to be independently associated with improved survival with atezolizumab in patients with NSCLC, raising the possibility that baseline BMI should be considered as a stratification factor in future immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy trials.

        "Cortical pattern generation during dexterous movement is input-driven. The motor cortex controls skilled arm movement by sending temporal patterns of activity to lower motor centres1. Local cortical dynamics are thought to shape these patterns throughout movement execution2-4. External inputs have been implicated in setting the initial state of the motor cortex5,6, but they may also have a pattern-generating role. Here we dissect the contribution of local dynamics and inputs to cortical pattern generation during a prehension task in mice. Perturbing cortex to an aberrant state prevented movement initiation, but after the perturbation was released, cortex either bypassed the normal initial state and immediately generated the pattern that controls reaching or failed to generate this pattern. The difference in these two outcomes was probably a result of external inputs. We directly investigated the role of inputs by inactivating the thalamus; this perturbed cortical activity and disrupted limb kinematics at any stage of the movement. Activation of thalamocortical axon terminals at different frequencies disrupted cortical activity and arm movement in a graded manner. Simultaneous recordings revealed that both thalamic activity and the current state of cortex predicted changes in cortical activity. Thus, the pattern generator for dexterous arm movement is distributed across multiple, strongly interacting brain regions. ",
        "Cortical Interactions between Prosthetic and Natural Vision. Outer retinal degenerative diseases, such as retinitis pigmentosa (RP) and age-related macular degeneration (AMD), are among the leading causes of incurable blindness in the Western world [1]. Retinal prostheses have been shown to restore some useful vision by electrically stimulating the remaining retinal neurons [2]. In contrast to inherited retinal degenerative diseases (e.g., RP), typically leading to a complete loss of the visual field, in AMD patients the disease is localized to the macula, leaving the peripheral vision intact. Implanting a retinal prosthesis in the central macula in AMD patients [3, 4] leads to an intriguing situation where the patient's central retina is stimulated electrically, whereas the peripheral healthy retina responds to natural light stimulation. An important question is whether the visual cortex responds to these two concurrent stimuli similarly to the interaction between two adjacent natural light stimuli projected onto healthy retina. Here, we investigated the cortical interactions between prosthetic and natural vision based on visually evoked potentials (VEPs) recorded in rats implanted with photovoltaic subretinal implants. Using this model, where prosthetic and natural vision information are combined in the visual cortex, we observed striking similarities in the interactions of natural and prosthetic vision, including similar effect of background illumination, linear summation of non-patterned stimuli, and lateral inhibition with spatial patterns [5], which increased with target contrast. These results support the idea of combined prosthetic and natural vision in restoration of sight for AMD patients. ",
        "Single low-dose VSV-EBOV vaccination protects cynomolgus macaques from lethal Ebola challenge. BACKGROUND: Ebola virus (EBOV), variant Makona, was the causative agent of the 2013-2016 West African epidemic responsible for almost 30,000 human infections and over 11,000 fatalities. During the epidemic, the development of several experimental vaccines was accelerated through human clinical trials. One of them, the vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)-based vaccine VSV-EBOV, showed promising efficacy in a phase 3 clinical trial in Guinea and is currently used in the ongoing EBOV outbreak in the northeastern part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). This vaccine expresses the EBOV-Kikwit glycoprotein from the 1995 outbreak as the immunogen. METHODS: Here we generated a VSV-based vaccine expressing the contemporary EBOV-Makona glycoprotein. We characterized the vaccine in tissue culture and analyzed vaccine efficacy in the cynomolgus macaque model. Subsequently, we determined the dose-dependent protective efficacy in nonhuman primates against lethal EBOV challenge. FINDINGS: We observed complete protection from disease with VSV-EBOV doses ranging from 1\u202f\u00d7\u202f107 to 1\u202f\u00d7\u202f101 plaque-forming units. Some protected animals receiving lower vaccine doses developed temporary low-level EBOV viremia. Control animals developed classical EBOV disease and reached euthanasia criteria within a week after challenge. This study demonstrates that very low doses of VSV-EBOV uniformly protect macaques against lethal EBOV challenge. INTERPRETATION: Our study provides missing pre-clinical data supporting the use of reduced VSV-EBOV vaccine doses without decreasing protective efficacy and at the same time increase vaccine safety and availability - two critical concerns in public health response.

        "A Spatiomolecular Map of the Striatum. The striatum is organized into two major outputs formed by striatal projection neuron (SPN) subtypes with distinct molecular identities. In addition, histochemical division into patch and matrix compartments represents an additional spatial organization, proposed to mirror a motor-motivation regionalization. To map the molecular diversity of patch versus matrix SPNs, we genetically labeled mu opioid receptor (Oprm1) expressing neurons and performed single-nucleus RNA sequencing. This allowed us to\u00a0establish molecular definitions of patch, matrix, and exopatch SPNs, as well as identification of Col11a1+ striatonigral SPNs. At the tissue level, mapping the expression of candidate markers reveals organization of spatial domains, which are conserved in the non-human primate brain. The spatial markers are cell-type independent and instead represent a spatial code found across all SPNs within a spatial domain. The spatiomolecular map establishes a formal system for targeting and studying striatal subregions and SPNs subtypes, beyond the classical striatonigral and striatopallidal division. ",
        "A Nipple-Areola Stencil for Three-Dimensional Tattooing: Nipple by Number. Medical tattooing is a critical reconstructive component in women following mastectomy. Recently, novel three-dimensional tattooing techniques mimicking depth by using light and shadow principles have allowed for aesthetically superior results. However, results are variable between providers, and professionals skilled in tattooing are often inaccessible to patients. To assess the need and obtain more background information regarding current practices, the authors recorded survey results from 753 plastic and reconstructive surgery offices. Results showed that 23 percent of facilities that offer reconstruction do not perform or refer for nipple-areola complex tattooing, leaving the patients to seek the service on their own. In this article, the authors present the nipple-by-number device, a three-dimensionally-printed stencil to ensure an accurate, consistent, and personalized aesthetic result during three-dimensional nipple-areola complex tattooing. The nipple-by-number device permits the plastic surgeon or supervised treating specialist to inexpensively, efficiently, and expeditiously perform the three-dimensional nipple-areola complex tattooing in their office. Furthermore, the device gives the patients the option of having their premorbid nipple-areola complex anatomy restored through preoperative photographs or choosing a different nipple-areola complex from a catalogue of designs. The device can be applied on any reconstructed breast mound whether or not a nipple projection procedure has been performed. ",
        "In\u00a0Vivo Imaging of the Coupling between Neuronal and CREB Activity in the Mouse Brain. Sensory experiences cause long-term modifications of neuronal circuits by modulating activity-dependent transcription programs that are vital for regulation of long-term synaptic plasticity and memory. However, it has not been possible to precisely determine the interaction between neuronal activity patterns and transcription factor activity. Here we present a technique using two-photon fluorescence lifetime imaging (2pFLIM) with new FRET biosensors to chronically image in\u00a0vivo signaling of CREB, an activity-dependent transcription factor important for synaptic plasticity, at single-cell resolution. Simultaneous imaging of the red-shifted CREB sensor and GCaMP permitted exploration of how experience shapes the interplay between CREB and neuronal activity in the neocortex of awake mice. Dark rearing increased the sensitivity of CREB activity to Ca2+ elevations and prolonged the duration of CREB activation to more than 24\u00a0h in the visual cortex. This technique will allow researchers to unravel the transcriptional dynamics underlying experience-dependent plasticity in the brain. ",
        "Emergent dynamics of neuromorphic nanowire networks. Neuromorphic networks are formed by random self-assembly of silver nanowires. Silver nanowires are coated with a polymer layer after synthesis in which junctions between two nanowires act as resistive switches, often compared with neurosynapses. We analyze the role of single junction switching in the dynamical properties of the neuromorphic network. Network transitions to a high-conductance state under the application of a voltage bias higher than a threshold value. The stability and permanence of this state is studied by shifting the voltage bias in order to activate or deactivate the network. A model of the electrical network with atomic switches reproduces the relation between individual nanowire junctions switching events with current pathway formation or destruction. This relation is further manifested in changes in 1/f power-law scaling of the spectral distribution of current. The current fluctuations involved in this scaling shift are considered to arise from an essential equilibrium between formation, stochastic-mediated breakdown of individual nanowire-nanowire junctions and the onset of different current pathways that optimize power dissipation. This emergent dynamics shown by polymer-coated Ag nanowire networks places this system in the class of optimal transport networks, from which new fundamental parallels with neural dynamics and natural computing problem-solving can be drawn.

        "A sensory appendage protein protects malaria vectors from pyrethroids. Pyrethroid-impregnated bed nets have driven considerable reductions in malaria-associated morbidity and mortality in Africa since the beginning of the century1. The intense selection pressure exerted by bed nets has precipitated widespread and escalating resistance to pyrethroids in African Anopheles populations, threatening to reverse the gains that been made by malaria control2. Here we show that expression of a sensory appendage protein (SAP2), which is enriched in the legs, confers pyrethroid resistance to Anopheles gambiae. Expression of SAP2 is increased in insecticide-resistant populations and is further induced after the mosquito comes into contact with pyrethroids. SAP2 silencing fully restores mortality of the mosquitoes, whereas SAP2 overexpression results in increased resistance, probably owing to high-affinity binding of SAP2 to pyrethroid insecticides. Mining of genome sequence data reveals a selective sweep near the SAP2 locus in the mosquito populations of three West African countries (Cameroon, Guinea and Burkina Faso) with the observed increase in haplotype-associated single-nucleotide polymorphisms mirroring the increasing resistance of mosquitoes to pyrethroids reported in Burkina Faso. Our study identifies a previously undescribed mechanism of insecticide resistance that is likely to be highly relevant to malaria control efforts. ",
        "Stress Reduction in the Prevention of Left Ventricular Hypertrophy: A Randomized Controlled Trial of Transcendental Meditation and Health Education in Hypertensive African Americans. Background: African Americans have disproportionately high rates of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is an independent risk factor for CVD and may contribute to this disparity. Psychological stress contributes to LVH in African Americans and other populations. Objective: This study evaluated the effects of stress reduction with the Transcendental Meditation (TM) technique on preventing LVH in African American adults with hypertension. Setting: Martin Luther King Hospital - Charles R. Drew University of Medicine and Science, Los Angeles, CA. Method: In this trial, 85 African American adults (average 52.8 years) were randomly assigned to either TM program or health education (HE) control group and completed posttesting. Participants were tested at baseline and after six months for left ventricular mass index (LVMI) by M-mode echocardiography, blood pressure, psychosocial stress and behavioral factors. Change in outcomes was analyzed between groups by ANCOVA and within groups by paired t-test. Results: The TM group had significantly lower LVMI compared with the HE group (-7.55gm/m2, 95% CI -14.78 to -.34 gm/m2, P=.040). Both interventions showed significant within group reductions in BP, (SBP/DBP changes for TM: -5/ -3 mm Hg, and for HE: -7/-6 mm Hg, P=.028 to <.001) although between group changes were not significant. In addition, both groups showed significant reductions in anger (P=.002 to .001). There were no other changes in lifestyle factors. Conclusions: These findings indicate that stress reduction with TM was effective in preventing LVMI progression and thus may prevent LVH and associated CVD in high-risk African American patients. ",
        "Amount and Intensity of Leisure-Time Physical Activity and Lower Cancer Risk. PURPOSE: To determine whether recommended amounts of leisure-time physical activity (ie, 7.5-15 metabolic equivalent task [MET] hours/week) are associated with lower cancer risk, describe the shape of the dose-response relationship, and explore associations with moderate- and vigorous-intensity physical activity. METHODS: Data from 9 prospective cohorts with self-reported leisure-time physical activity and follow-up for cancer incidence were pooled. Multivariable Cox regression was used to estimate adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs of the relationships between physical activity with incidence of 15 types of cancer. Dose-response relationships were modeled with restricted cubic spline functions that compared 7.5, 15.0, 22.5, and 30.0 MET hours/week to no leisure-time physical activity, and statistically significant associations were determined using tests for trend (P < .05) and 95% CIs (< 1.0). RESULTS: A total of 755,459 participants (median age, 62 years [range, 32-91 years]; 53% female) were followed for 10.1 years, and 50,620 incident cancers accrued. Engagement in recommended amounts of activity (7.5-15 MET hours/week) was associated with a statistically significant lower risk of 7 of the 15 cancer types studied, including colon (8%-14% lower risk in men), breast (6%-10% lower risk), endometrial (10%-18% lower risk), kidney (11%-17% lower risk), myeloma (14%-19% lower risk), liver (18%-27% lower risk), and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (11%-18% lower risk in women). The dose response was linear in shape for half of the associations and nonlinear for the others. Results for moderate- and vigorous-intensity leisure-time physical activity were mixed. Adjustment for body mass index eliminated the association with endometrial cancer but had limited effect on other cancer types. CONCLUSION: Health care providers, fitness professionals, and public health practitioners should encourage adults to adopt and maintain physical activity at recommended levels to lower risks of multiple cancers.

        "Face Lifting in Bald Male Patients: New Trends and Specific Needs. BACKGROUND: Aesthetic surgery has recently become popular also among men. The ever-increasing number of bald men wishing to undergo facial surgery represents a challenge for the surgeon, as the scars cannot be hidden in the hair and must therefore be as short as possible. The authors present their experience in face lifting in bald male patients and propose an innovative technique to handle the skin excess to achieve practically invisible scars. METHODS: A 10-year observational study was carried out on 68 bald male face-lift patients. All patients underwent deep plane lifting with a specific method for handling skin excess. This technique is the innovation presented in this article. Subjective and objective methods were used to evaluate the results. The well-known FACE-Q questionnaire was sent to all the patients together with an explanatory letter. Three ad hoc questions were added to the questionnaire to assess the degree of satisfaction with the scars. The objective method involved the evaluation of preoperative and postoperative photographs by a three-member jury. The average follow-up period was 12 months. RESULTS: All patients showed a high degree of satisfaction with the final appearance of the surgical scars and appreciation of the overall quality of the result, 1 year after face-lift surgery. No patient expressed regret about choosing to undergo this type of surgery. Very high scores were registered for the overall facial appearance and for the various critical areas examined, including scars, from patients and experts alike. CONCLUSION: The face-lifting technique for bald men proposed by the authors, involving a peculiar and innovative way of handling the skin excess, has proven to be reliably effective in obtaining virtually invisible scars.

        "Human sperm displays rapid responses to diet. The global rise in obesity and steady decline in sperm quality are two alarming trends that have emerged during recent decades. In parallel, evidence from model organisms shows that paternal diet can affect offspring metabolic health in a process involving sperm tRNA-derived small RNA (tsRNA). Here, we report that human sperm are acutely sensitive to nutrient flux, both in terms of sperm motility and changes in sperm tsRNA. Over the course of a 2-week diet intervention, in which we first introduced a healthy diet followed by a diet rich in sugar, sperm motility increased and stabilized at high levels. Small RNA-seq on repeatedly sampled sperm from the same individuals revealed that tsRNAs were up-regulated by eating a high-sugar diet for just 1 week. Unsupervised clustering identified two independent pathways for the biogenesis of these tsRNAs: one involving a novel class of fragments with specific cleavage in the T-loop of mature nuclear tRNAs and the other exclusively involving mitochondrial tsRNAs. Mitochondrial involvement was further supported by a similar up-regulation of mitochondrial rRNA-derived small RNA (rsRNA). Notably, the changes in sugar-sensitive tsRNA were positively associated with simultaneous changes in sperm motility and negatively associated with obesity in an independent clinical cohort. This rapid response to a dietary intervention on tsRNA in human sperm is attuned with the paternal intergenerational metabolic responses found in model organisms. More importantly, our findings suggest shared diet-sensitive mechanisms between sperm motility and the biogenesis of tsRNA, which provide novel insights about the interplay between nutrition and male reproductive health.

        "Abnormal cardiovascular response to nitroglycerin in migraine. INTRODUCTION: Migraine and vasovagal syncope are comorbid conditions that may share part of their pathophysiology through autonomic control of the systemic circulation. Nitroglycerin can trigger both syncope and migraine attacks, suggesting enhanced systemic sensitivity in migraine. We aimed to determine the cardiovascular responses to nitroglycerin in migraine. METHODS: In 16 women with migraine without aura and 10 age- and gender-matched controls without headache, intravenous nitroglycerin (0.5\u2009\u00b5g\u00b7kg-1\u00b7min-1) was administered. Finger photoplethysmography continuously assessed cardiovascular parameters (mean arterial pressure, heart rate, cardiac output, stroke volume and total peripheral resistance) before, during and after nitroglycerin infusion. RESULTS: Nitroglycerin provoked a migraine-like attack in 13/16 (81.2%) migraineurs but not in controls (p\u2009=\u2009.0001). No syncope was provoked. Migraineurs who later developed a migraine-like attack showed different responses in all parameters vs. controls (all p\u2009<\u2009.001): The decreases in cardiac output and stroke volume were more rapid and longer lasting, heart rate increased, mean arterial pressure and total peripheral resistance were higher and decreased steeply after an initial increase. DISCUSSION: Migraineurs who developed a migraine-like attack in response to nitroglycerin showed stronger systemic cardiovascular responses compared to non-headache controls. The stronger systemic cardiovascular responses in migraine suggest increased systemic sensitivity to vasodilators, possibly due to insufficient autonomic compensatory mechanisms. ",
        "Posttraumatic stress disorder increases the odds of REM sleep behavior disorder and other parasomnias in Veterans with and without comorbid traumatic brain injury. STUDY OBJECTIVES: To describe the crude prevalence of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (RBD) following traumatic brain injury (TBI) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in Veterans, given potential relationships between TBI, PTSD, RBD, and neurodegeneration. METHODS: Veterans (n = 394; 94% male; 54.4 \u00b1 15.5 years of age) were prospectively/cross-sectionally recruited from the VA Portland Health Care System and completed in-lab video-polysomnography and questionnaires. TBI and PTSD were assessed via diagnostic screening and medical record review. Subjects were categorized into four groups after assessment of REM sleep without atonia (RSWA) and self-reported dream enactment: (1) \"Normal,\" neither RSWA nor dream enactment, (2) \"Other Parasomnia,\" dream enactment without RSWA, (3) \"RSWA,\" isolated-RSWA without dream enactment, and (4) \"RBD,\" RSWA with dream enactment. Crude prevalence, prevalence odds ratio, and prevalence rate for parasomnias across subjects with TBI and/or PTSD were assessed. RESULTS: Overall prevalence rates were 31%, 7%, and 9% for Other Parasomnia, RSWA, and RBD, respectively. The prevalence rate of RBD increased to 15% in PTSD subjects [age adjusted POR: 2.81 (1.17-4.66)] and to 21% in TBI + PTSD subjects [age adjusted POR: 3.43 (1.20-9.35)]. No subjects met all diagnostic criteria for trauma-associated sleep disorder (TASD), and no overt dream enactment was captured on video. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of RBD and related parasomnias is significantly higher in Veterans compared with the general population and is associated with PTSD and TBI + PTSD. Considering the association between idiopathic-RBD and synucleinopathy, it remains unclear whether RBD (and potentially TASD) associated with PTSD or TBI + PTSD similarly increases risk for long-term neurologic sequelae.

        "Outcomes of art therapy and coloring for professional and informal caregivers of patients in a radiation oncology unit: A mixed methods pilot study. PURPOSE: Caring for cancer patients can be highly stressful for both family caregivers and oncology professionals. These high levels of stress can lead to poorer patient outcomes and increased risk of health problems for the caregivers themselves. Art therapy may help these caregivers as art-making can be a relaxing and enjoyable form of self-expression and art therapists can support individuals in expressing and processing challenging emotions. Research on art-making or art therapy with caregivers of cancer patients has shown some positive results, but its interpretation is limited by the use of multifaceted interventions. METHOD: In this mixed-methods study we compared two brief arts-based approaches for both professional and informal caregivers: single sessions of coloring or open-studio art therapy, with a 45-minute session each. Assessments imcluded self-reports of affect, stress, self-efficacy, anxiety, burnout arnd creative agency alongside salivary biomarkers before and after the session. Open-ended questions, field notes and observations formed the qualitative part of the study. RESULTS: Thirty-four professional (n=25) and informal (n=9) caregivers participated. Participants in both conditions showed increases in positive affect, creative agency, and self-efficacy and decreases in negative affect, anxiety, perceived stress, and burnout. Participants in both conditions expressed enjoyment, relaxation, appreciation of time away from stressors, creative problem solving, a sense of flow, and personal and existential insight. The two approaches also elicited distinct experiences with participants reporting that they found improved focus in coloring and appreciated the support and freedom of expression in open studio art therapy. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that even brief art-making interventions can be beneficial for stressed caregivers of cancer patients. As experience with art-making increased the impact, repeated sessions may be even more useful. We recommend that oncology units have dedicated studio spaces with therapeutic support and different forms of art-making available to meet individual caregiver needs. ",
        "IPO11 mediates \u03b2catenin nuclear import in a subset of colorectal cancers. Activation of Wnt signaling entails \u03b2catenin protein stabilization and translocation to the nucleus to regulate context-specific transcriptional programs. The majority of colorectal cancers (CRCs) initiate following APC mutations, resulting in Wnt ligand-independent stabilization and nuclear accumulation of \u03b2catenin. The mechanisms underlying \u03b2catenin nucleocytoplasmic shuttling remain incompletely defined. Using a novel, positive selection, functional genomic strategy, DEADPOOL, we performed a genome-wide CRISPR screen and identified IPO11 as a required factor for \u03b2catenin-mediated transcription in APC mutant CRC cells. IPO11 (Importin-11) is a nuclear import protein that shuttles cargo from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. IPO11-/- cells exhibit reduced nuclear \u03b2catenin protein levels and decreased \u03b2catenin target gene activation, suggesting IPO11 facilitates \u03b2catenin nuclear import. IPO11 knockout decreased colony formation of CRC cell lines and decreased proliferation of patient-derived CRC organoids. Our findings uncover a novel nuclear import mechanism for \u03b2catenin in cells with high Wnt activity. ",
        "Whole milk compared with reduced-fat milk and childhood overweight: a systematic review and meta-analysis. BACKGROUND: The majority of children in North America consume cow-milk daily. Children aged >2 y are recommended to consume reduced-fat (0.1-2%) cow-milk to lower the risk of obesity. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the relation between cow-milk fat consumption and adiposity in children aged 1-18 y. METHODS: Embase (Excerpta Medica Database), CINAHL (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature), MEDLINE, Scopus, and Cochrane Library databases from inception to August 2019 were used. The search included observational and interventional studies of healthy children aged 1-18 y that described the association between cow-milk fat consumption and adiposity. Two reviewers extracted data, using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale to assess risk of bias. Meta-analysis was conducted using random effects to evaluate the relation between cow-milk fat and risk of overweight or obesity. Adiposity was assessed using BMI z-score (zBMI). RESULTS: Of 5862 reports identified by the search, 28 met the inclusion criteria: 20 were cross-sectional and 8 were prospective cohort. No clinical trials were identified. In 18 studies, higher cow-milk fat consumption was associated with lower child adiposity, and 10 studies did not identify an association. Meta-analysis included 14 of the 28 studies (n\u00a0=\u00a020,897) that measured the proportion of children who consumed whole milk compared with reduced-fat milk and direct measures of overweight or obesity. Among children who consumed whole (3.25% fat) compared with reduced-fat (0.1-2%) milk, the OR of overweight or obesity was 0.61 (95% CI: 0.52, 0.72; P\u00a0<\u00a00.0001), but heterogeneity between studies was high (I2\u00a0=\u00a073.8%). CONCLUSIONS: Observational research suggests that higher cow-milk fat intake is associated with lower childhood adiposity. International guidelines that recommend reduced-fat milk for children might not lower the risk of childhood obesity. Randomized trials are needed to determine which cow-milk fat minimizes risk of excess adiposity. This systematic review and meta-analysis was registered with PROSPERO (registration number: CRD42018085075). ",
        "Reversal of increased mammary tumorigenesis by valproic acid and hydralazine in offspring of dams fed high fat diet during pregnancy. Maternal or paternal high fat (HF) diet can modify the epigenome in germ cells and fetal somatic cells leading to an increased susceptibility among female offspring of multiple generations to develop breast cancer. We determined if combined treatment with broad spectrum DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) inhibitor hydralazine and histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor valproic acid (VPA) will reverse this increased risk. C57BL/6 mouse dams were fed either a corn oil-based HF or control diet during pregnancy. Starting at age 7 weeks, female offspring were administered 3 doses of 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA) to initiate mammary cancer. After last dose, offspring started receiving VPA/hydralazine administered via drinking water: no adverse health effects were detected. VPA/hydralazine reduced mammary tumor multiplicity and lengthened tumor latency in HF offspring when compared with non-treated HF offspring. The drug combination inhibited DNMT3a protein levels and increased expression of the tumor suppressor gene Cdkn2a/p16 in mammary tumors of HF offspring. In control mice not exposed to HF diet in utero, VPA/hydralazine increased mammary tumor incidence and burden, and elevated expression of the unfolded protein response and autophagy genes, including HIF-1\u03b1, NFkB, PERK, and SQSTM1/p62. Expression of these genes was already upregulated in HF offspring prior to VPA/hydralazine treatment. These findings suggest that breast cancer prevention strategies with HDAC/DNMT inhibitors need to be individually tailored. ",
        "Association of Maternal Exposure to Persistent Organic Pollutants in Early Pregnancy With Fetal Growth. Importance: Prenatal exposure to persistent organic pollutants (POPs) has been associated with birth size, but data on fetal growth and among racially/ethnically diverse pregnant women remain scarce. Objectives: To assess the association between maternal plasma POPs in early pregnancy and fetal growth and by infant sex and maternal race/ethnicity. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study used the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Fetal Growth Studies-Singleton cohort, which recruited nonobese, low-risk pregnant women before 14 weeks' gestation between July 1, 2009, and January 31, 2013, in 12 community-based clinics throughout the United States. Participants self-identified their race/ethnicity, self-reported their behavioral risk factors, and were followed up throughout their pregnancy. Data were analyzed from July 31, 2018, to June 3, 2019. Exposures: Levels of 76 POPs in early gestation plasma were measured: 11 perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, 1 polybrominated biphenyl, 9 polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), 44 polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and 11 organochlorine pesticides (OCPs). The bayesian kernel machine regression method was used to examine chemical class mixtures, and generalized additive mixed model was used to analyze individual chemicals. Main Outcomes and Measures: Fourteen fetal biometrics were measured, including head circumference, abdominal circumference, and femur length, within 5 ultrasonography appointments. Results: A total of 2284 low-risk pregnant women were included: 606 women (26.5%) self-identified as white with a mean (SD) age of 30.3 (4.4) years, 589 (25.8%) as black with a mean (SD) age of 25.5 (5.5) years, 635 (27.8%) as Hispanic with a mean (SD) age of 27.1 (5.5) years, and 454 (19.9%) as Asian with a mean (SD) age of 30.5 (4.5) years. A comparison between the 75th and 25th percentile of exposure revealed that the OCP mixture was negatively associated with most fetal growth measures, with a reduction of 4.7 mm (95% CI, -6.7 to -2.8 mm) in head circumference, 3.5 mm (95% CI, -4.7 to -2.2 mm) in abdominal circumference, and 0.6 mm (95% CI, -1.1 to -0.2 mm) in femur length. Higher exposure to the PBDE mixture was associated with reduced abdominal circumference (-2.4 mm; 95% CI, -4.0 to -0.5 mm) and femur length (-0.5 mm; 95% CI, -1.0 to -0.1 mm), and the dioxin-like PCB mixture was associated with reduced head circumference (-6.4 mm; 95% CI, -8.4 to -4.3 mm) and abdominal circumference (-2.4 mm; 95% CI, -3.9 to -0.8 mm). Associations with individual chemicals were less consistent. There were some interactions by fetal sex, although most of the results did not vary by maternal race/ethnicity. For example, oxychlordane (-0.98 mm; 95% CI, -1.60 to -0.36 mm; P for interaction <.001), trans-nonachlor (-0.31 mm; 95% CI, -0.54 to -0.08 mm; P for interaction\u2009=\u2009.005), and p,p'-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (-0.19 mm; 95% CI, -0.22 to -0.09 mm; P for interaction\u2009=\u2009.006) were associated with shorter femur length among boys only. Conclusions and Relevance: This study found that, among pregnant women with low POP levels, a mixture of OCPs was negatively associated with most fetal growth measures and that mixtures of PBDEs and dioxin-like PCBs were associated with reduced abdominal circumference. These findings suggested that, although exposures may be low, associations with fetal growth are apparent. ",
        "Proteomic and Transcriptomic Changes in Hibernating Grizzly Bears Reveal Metabolic and Signaling Pathways that Protect against Muscle Atrophy. Muscle atrophy is a physiological response to disuse and malnutrition, but hibernating bears are largely resistant to this phenomenon. Unlike other mammals, they efficiently reabsorb amino acids from urine, periodically activate muscle contraction, and their adipocytes differentially responds to insulin. The contribution of myocytes to the reduced atrophy remains largely unknown. Here we show how metabolism and atrophy signaling are regulated in skeletal muscle of hibernating grizzly bear. Metabolic modeling of proteomic changes suggests an autonomous increase of non-essential amino acids (NEAA) in muscle and treatment of differentiated myoblasts with NEAA is sufficient to induce hypertrophy. Our comparison of gene expression in hibernation versus muscle atrophy identified several genes differentially regulated during hibernation, including Pdk4 and Serpinf1. Their trophic effects extend to myoblasts from non-hibernating species (including C. elegans), as documented by a knockdown approach. Together, these changes reflect evolutionary favored adaptations that, once translated to the clinics, could help improve atrophy treatment. ",
        "Individualized pelvic physical therapy for the treatment of post-prostatectomy stress urinary incontinence and pelvic pain. BACKGROUND: The rehabilitation of post-prostatectomy urinary incontinence has traditionally focused on pelvic floor strengthening exercise. The goal of this study was to determine whether an individualized pelvic physical therapy (PT) program aimed at normalizing both underactive and overactive pelvic floor dysfunction (PFD) can result in improvement in post-prostatectomy stress urinary incontinence (SUI) and pelvic pain. METHODS: A retrospective chart review of 136 patients with post-prostatectomy SUI and treated with pelvic PT. Patients were identified as having either underactive, overactive, or mixed-type PFD and treated accordingly with a tailored program to normalize pelvic floor function. Outcomes including decrease in SUI as measured in pad usage per day and pain rated on the numeric pain rating scale. RESULTS: Twenty five patients were found to have underactive PFD and were treated with strengthening. Thirteen patients had overactive PFD and were treated with relaxation training. Ninety eight patients had mixed-type PFD and were treated with a combination of relaxation training followed by strengthening. Patients demonstrated statistically significant decrease in pad usage per day (p\u2009<\u20090.001), decreased pelvic pain (p\u2009<\u20090.001), and increased pelvic floor strength (p\u2009=\u20090.049), even in patients who received predominantly pelvic floor relaxation training to normalize pelvic floor overactivity. CONCLUSIONS: A majority of post-prostatectomy men with SUI have pelvic floor overactivity in addition to pelvic floor underactivity. An individualized pelvic PT program aimed at normalizing pelvic floor function (as opposed to a pure Kegel strengthening program) can be helpful in reducing SUI and pelvic pain. ",
        "Optimized antiangiogenic reprogramming of the tumor microenvironment potentiates CD40 immunotherapy. Cancer immunotherapies are increasingly combined with targeted therapies to improve therapeutic outcomes. We show that combination of agonistic anti-CD40 with antiangiogenic antibodies targeting 2 proangiogenic factors, vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) and angiopoietin 2 (Ang2/ANGPT2), induces pleiotropic immune mechanisms that facilitate tumor rejection in several tumor models. On the one hand, VEGFA/Ang2 blockade induced regression of the tumor microvasculature while decreasing the proportion of nonperfused vessels and reducing leakiness of the remaining vessels. On the other hand, both anti-VEGFA/Ang2 and anti-CD40 independently promoted proinflammatory macrophage skewing and increased dendritic cell activation in the tumor microenvironment, which were further amplified upon combination of the 2 treatments. Finally, combined therapy provoked brisk infiltration and intratumoral redistribution of cytotoxic CD8+ T cells in the tumors, which was mainly driven by Ang2 blockade. Overall, these nonredundant synergistic mechanisms endowed T cells with improved effector functions that were conducive to more efficient tumor control, underscoring the therapeutic potential of antiangiogenic immunotherapy in cancer.

        "The circadian clock protein REVERB\u03b1 inhibits pulmonary fibrosis development. Pulmonary inflammatory responses lie under circadian control; however, the importance of circadian mechanisms in the underlying fibrotic phenotype is not understood. Here, we identify a striking change to these mechanisms resulting in a gain of amplitude and lack of synchrony within pulmonary fibrotic tissue. These changes result from an infiltration of mesenchymal cells, an important cell type in the pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis. Mutation of the core clock protein REVERB\u03b1 in these cells exacerbated the development of bleomycin-induced fibrosis, whereas mutation of REVERB\u03b1 in club or myeloid cells had no effect on the bleomycin phenotype. Knockdown of REVERB\u03b1 revealed regulation of the little-understood transcription factor TBPL1. Both REVERB\u03b1 and TBPL1 altered integrin\u03b21 focal-adhesion formation, resulting in increased myofibroblast activation. The translational importance of our findings was established through analysis of 2 human cohorts. In the UK Biobank, circadian strain markers (sleep length, chronotype, and shift work) are associated with pulmonary fibrosis, making them risk factors. In a separate cohort, REVERB\u03b1 expression was increased in human idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) lung tissue. Pharmacological targeting of REVERB\u03b1 inhibited myofibroblast activation in IPF fibroblasts and collagen secretion in organotypic cultures from IPF patients, thus suggesting that targeting of REVERB\u03b1 could be a viable therapeutic approach.

        "Massive centriole production can occur in the absence of deuterosomes in multiciliated cells. Multiciliated cells (MCCs) amplify large numbers of centrioles that convert into basal bodies, which are required for producing multiple motile cilia. Most centrioles amplified by MCCs grow on the surface of organelles called deuterosomes, whereas a smaller number grow through the centriolar pathway in association with the two parent centrioles. Here, we show that MCCs lacking deuterosomes amplify the correct number of centrioles with normal step-wise kinetics. This is achieved through a massive production of centrioles on the surface and in the vicinity of parent centrioles. Therefore, deuterosomes may have evolved to relieve, rather than supplement, the centriolar pathway during multiciliogenesis. Remarkably, MCCs lacking parent centrioles and deuterosomes also amplify the appropriate number of centrioles inside a cloud of pericentriolar and fibrogranular material. These data show that the centriole number is set independently of their nucleation platforms and suggest that massive centriole production in MCCs is a robust process that can self-organize. ",
        "Molecular profiling of single neurons of known identity in two ganglia from the crab Cancer borealis. Understanding circuit organization depends on identification of cell types. Recent advances in transcriptional profiling methods have enabled classification of cell types by their gene expression. While exceptionally powerful and high throughput, the ground-truth validation of these methods is difficult: If cell type is unknown, how does one assess whether a given analysis accurately captures neuronal identity? To shed light on the capabilities and limitations of solely using transcriptional profiling for cell-type classification, we performed 2 forms of transcriptional profiling-RNA-seq and quantitative RT-PCR, in single, unambiguously identified neurons from 2 small crustacean neuronal networks: The stomatogastric and cardiac ganglia. We then combined our knowledge of cell type with unbiased clustering analyses and supervised machine learning to determine how accurately functionally defined neuron types can be classified by expression profile alone. The results demonstrate that expression profile is able to capture neuronal identity most accurately when combined with multimodal information that allows for post hoc grouping, so analysis can proceed from a supervised perspective. Solely unsupervised clustering can lead to misidentification and an inability to distinguish between 2 or more cell types. Therefore, this study supports the general utility of cell identification by transcriptional profiling, but adds a caution: It is difficult or impossible to know under what conditions transcriptional profiling alone is capable of assigning cell identity. Only by combining multiple modalities of information such as physiology, morphology, or innervation target can neuronal identity be unambiguously determined. ",
        "Structure of the thermo-sensitive TRP channel TRP1 from the alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. Algae produce the largest amount of oxygen on earth and are invaluable for human nutrition and biomedicine, as well as for the chemical industry, energy production and agriculture. The mechanisms by which algae can detect and respond to changes in their environments can rely on membrane receptors, including TRP ion channels. Here we present a 3.5-\u00c5 resolution cryo-EM structure of the transient receptor potential (TRP) channel crTRP1 from the alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii that opens in response to increased temperature and is positively regulated by the membrane lipid PIP2. The structure of crTRP1 significantly deviates from the structures of other TRP channels and has a unique 2-fold symmetrical rose-shape architecture with elbow domains and ankyrin repeat domains submerged and dipping into the membrane, respectively.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer disease (AD) is characterized by the accumulation of beta-amyloid (A\u03b2) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles composed of hyperphosphorylated tau, which together lead to neurodegeneration and cognitive decline. Current therapeutic approaches have primarily aimed to reduce pathological aggregates of either A\u03b2 or tau, yet phase 3 clinical trials of these approaches have thus far failed to delay disease progression in humans. Strong preclinical evidence indicates that these two abnormally aggregated proteins interact synergistically to drive downstream neurodegeneration. Therefore, combinatorial therapies that concurrently target both A\u03b2 and tau might be needed for effective disease modification. METHODS: A combinatorial vaccination approach was designed to concurrently target both A\u03b2 and tau pathologies. Tau22/5xFAD (T5x) bigenic mice that develop both pathological A\u03b2 and tau aggregates were injected intramuscularly with a mixture of two MultiTEP epitope vaccines: AV-1959R and AV-1980R, targeting A\u03b2 and tau, respectively, and formulated in AdvaxCpG, a potent polysaccharide adjuvant. Antibody responses of vaccinated animals were measured by ELISA, and neuropathological changes were determined in brain homogenates of vaccinated and control mice using ELISA and Meso Scale Discovery (MSD) multiplex assays. RESULTS: T5x mice immunized with a mixture of A\u03b2- and tau-targeting vaccines generated high A\u03b2- and tau-specific antibody titers that recognized senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles/neuropil threads in human AD brain sections. Production of these antibodies in turn led to significant reductions in the levels of soluble and insoluble total tau, and hyperphosphorylated tau as well as insoluble A\u03b242, within the brains of bigenic T5x mice. CONCLUSIONS: AV-1959R and AV-1980R formulated with AdvaxCpG adjuvant are immunogenic and therapeutically potent vaccines that in combination can effectively reduce both of the hallmark pathologies of AD in bigenic mice. Taken together, these findings warrant further development of this vaccine technology for ultimate testing in human AD. ",
        "Effect of Treating Parents Colonized With Staphylococcus aureus on Transmission to Neonates in the Intensive Care Unit: A Randomized Clinical Trial. Importance: Staphylococcus aureus is a leading cause of health care-associated infections in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Parents may expose neonates to S aureus colonization, a well-established predisposing factor to invasive S aureus disease. Objective: To test whether treating parents with intranasal mupirocin and topical chlorhexidine compared with placebo would reduce transmission of S aureus from parents to neonates. Design, Setting, and Participants: Double-blinded randomized clinical trial in 2 tertiary NICUs in Baltimore, Maryland. Neonates (n\u2009=\u2009236) with S aureus-colonized parent(s) were enrolled. The study period was November 7, 2014, through December 13, 2018. Interventions: Parents were assigned to intranasal mupirocin and 2% chlorhexidine-impregnated cloths (active treatment, n\u2009=\u2009117) or petrolatum intranasal ointment and nonmedicated soap cloths (placebo, n\u2009=\u2009119) for 5 days. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary end point was concordant S aureus colonization by 90 days, defined as neonatal acquisition of an S aureus strain that was the same strain as a parental strain at time of screening. Secondary outcomes included neonatal acquisition of any S aureus strain and neonatal S aureus infections. Results: Among 236 randomized neonates, 208 were included in the analytic sample (55% male; 76% singleton births; mean birth weight, 1985 g [SD, 958 g]; 76% vaginal birth; mean parent age, 31 [SD, 7] years), of whom 18 were lost to follow-up. Among 190 neonates included in the analysis, 74 (38.9%) acquired S aureus colonization by 90 days, of which 42 (56.8%) had a strain concordant with a parental baseline strain. In the intervention and placebo groups, 13 of 89 neonates (14.6%) and 29 of 101 neonates (28.7%), respectively, acquired concordant S aureus colonization (risk difference, -14.1% [95% CI, -30.8% to -3.9%]; hazard ratio [HR], 0.43 [95.2% CI, 0.16 to 0.79]). A total of 28 of 89 neonates (31.4%) in the intervention group and 46 of 101 (45.5%) in the control group acquired any S aureus strain (HR, 0.57 [95% CI, 0.31 to 0.88]), and 1 neonate (1.1%) in the intervention group and 1 neonate (1.0%) in the control group developed an S aureus infection before colonization. Skin reactions in parents were common (4.8% intervention, 6.2% placebo). Conclusions and Relevance: In this preliminary trial of parents colonized with S aureus, treatment with intranasal mupirocin and chlorhexidine-impregnated cloths compared with placebo significantly reduced neonatal colonization with an S aureus strain concordant with a parental baseline strain. However, further research is needed to replicate these findings and to assess their generalizability. Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02223520. ",
        "Curcumin and Cancer. Curcumin, a polyphenol extracted from Curcuma longa in 1815, has gained attention from scientists worldwide for its biological activities (e.g., antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, antiviral), among which its anticancer potential has been the most described and still remains under investigation. The present review focuses on the cell signaling pathways involved in cancer development and proliferation, and which are targeted by curcumin. Curcumin has been reported to modulate growth factors, enzymes, transcription factors, kinase, inflammatory cytokines, and proapoptotic (by upregulation) and antiapoptotic (by downregulation) proteins. This polyphenol compound, alone or combined with other agents, could represent an effective drug for cancer therapy. ",
        "DNA Methylation Bisubstrate Inhibitors Are Fast-Acting Drugs Active against Artemisinin-Resistant Plasmodium falciparum Parasites. Malaria is the deadliest parasitic disease affecting over 200 million people worldwide. The increasing number of treatment failures due to multi-drug-resistant parasites in South-East Asia hinders the efforts for elimination. It is thus urgent to develop new antimalarials to contain these resistant parasites. Based on a previous report showing the presence of DNA methylation in Plasmodium, we generated new types of DNA methylation inhibitors against malaria parasites. The quinoline-quinazoline-based inhibitors kill parasites, including artemisinin-resistant field isolates adapted to culture, in the low nanomolar range. The compounds target all stages of the asexual cycle, including early rings, during a 6 h treatment period; they reduce DNA methylation in the parasite and show in vivo activity at 10 mg/kg. These potent inhibitors are a new starting point to develop fast-acting antimalarials that could be used in combination with artemisinins. ",
        "Association of Bariatric Surgery With Skin Cancer Incidence in Adults With Obesity: A Nonrandomized Controlled Trial. Importance: Obesity is a cancer risk factor, and bariatric surgery in patients with obesity is associated with reduced cancer risk. However, evidence of an association among obesity, bariatric surgery, and skin cancer, including melanoma, is limited. Objective: To investigate the association of bariatric surgery with skin cancer (squamous cell carcinoma and melanoma) and melanoma incidence. Design, Setting, and Participants: This nonrandomized controlled trial, the Swedish Obese Subjects (SOS) study, is ongoing at 25 surgical departments and 480 primary health care centers in Sweden and was designed to examine outcomes after bariatric surgery. The study included 2007 patients with obesity who underwent bariatric surgery and 2040 contemporaneously matched controls who received conventional obesity treatment. Patients were enrolled between September 1, 1987, and January 31, 2001. Data analysis was performed from June 29, 2018, to November 22, 2018. Interventions: Patients in the surgery group underwent gastric bypass (n\u2009=\u2009266), banding (n\u2009=\u2009376), or vertical banded gastroplasty (n\u2009=\u20091365). The control group (n\u2009=\u20092040) received the customary treatment for obesity at their primary health care centers. Main Outcomes and Measures: The SOS study was cross-linked to the Swedish National Cancer Registry, the Cause of Death Registry, and the Registry of the Total Population for data on cancer incidence, death, and emigration. Results: The study included 4047 participants (mean [SD] age, 47.9 [6.1] years; 2867 [70.8%] female). Information on cancer events was available for 4042 patients. The study found that bariatric surgery was associated with a markedly reduced risk of melanoma (adjusted subhazard ratio, 0.43; 95% CI, 0.21-0.87; P\u2009=\u2009.02; median follow-up, 18.1 years) and risk of skin cancer in general (adjusted subhazard ratio, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.35-0.99; P\u2009=\u2009.047). The skin cancer risk reduction was not associated with baseline body mass index or weight; insulin, glucose, lipid, and creatinine levels; diabetes; blood pressure; alcohol intake; or smoking. Conclusions and Relevance: The results of this study suggest that bariatric surgery in individuals with obesity is associated with a reduced risk of skin cancer, including melanoma.

        "Lip-Reading Enables the Brain to Synthesize Auditory Features of Unknown Silent Speech. Lip-reading is crucial for understanding speech in challenging conditions. But how the brain extracts meaning from, silent, visual speech is still under debate. Lip-reading in silence activates the auditory cortices, but it is not known whether such activation reflects immediate synthesis of the corresponding auditory stimulus or imagery of unrelated sounds. To disentangle these possibilities, we used magnetoencephalography to evaluate how cortical activity in 28 healthy adult humans (17 females) entrained to the auditory speech envelope and lip movements (mouth opening) when listening to a spoken story without visual input (audio-only), and when seeing a silent video of a speaker articulating another story (video-only). In video-only, auditory cortical activity entrained to the absent auditory signal at frequencies <1 Hz more than to the seen lip movements. This entrainment process was characterized by an auditory-speech-to-brain delay of \u223c70 ms in the left hemisphere, compared with \u223c20 ms in audio-only. Entrainment to mouth opening was found in the right angular gyrus at <1 Hz, and in early visual cortices at 1-8 Hz. These findings demonstrate that the brain can use a silent lip-read signal to synthesize a coarse-grained auditory speech representation in early auditory cortices. Our data indicate the following underlying oscillatory mechanism: seeing lip movements first modulates neuronal activity in early visual cortices at frequencies that match articulatory lip movements; the right angular gyrus then extracts slower features of lip movements, mapping them onto the corresponding speech sound features; this information is fed to auditory cortices, most likely facilitating speech parsing.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Lip-reading consists in decoding speech based on visual information derived from observation of a speaker's articulatory facial gestures. Lip-reading is known to improve auditory speech understanding, especially when speech is degraded. Interestingly, lip-reading in silence still activates the auditory cortices, even when participants do not know what the absent auditory signal should be. However, it was uncertain what such activation reflected. Here, using magnetoencephalographic recordings, we demonstrate that it reflects fast synthesis of the auditory stimulus rather than mental imagery of unrelated, speech or non-speech, sounds. Our results also shed light on the oscillatory dynamics underlying lip-reading. ",
        "Diabetes Mellitus Is an Independent Predictor for the Development of Heart Failure: A\u00a0Population Study. OBJECTIVES: To delineate the impact of diabetes mellitus (DM) on the development of cardiovascular diseases in a community population. PATIENTS & METHODS: Cross-sectional survey of residents randomly selected through the Rochester Epidemiology Project, 45 years or older, of Olmsted County as of June 1, 1997, through September 30, 2000. Responders (2042) underwent assessment of systolic and diastolic function using echocardiography. The current analyses included all participants with DM and were compared with a group of participants without DM matched 1:2 for age, sex, hypertension, and coronary artery disease. Baseline characteristics and laboratory and echocardiography findings between groups were compared along with rates of mortality due to various cardiovascular conditions. RESULTS: We identified 116 participants with DM and 232 matched participants without DM. Those with DM had a higher body mass index and plasma insulin and serum glucose levels. Although left ventricular ejection fractions were similar, E/e' ratio (9.7 vs 8.5; P=.001) was higher in DM vs non-DM. During a follow-up of 10.8 (interquartile range, 7.8-11.7) years, participants with DM had a higher incidence of heart failure (HF); hazard ratio, 2.1; 95% confidence limits, 1.2-3.6; P=.01) and 10-year Kaplan-Meier rate of 21% (22 of 116) vs 12% (24 of 232) compared with those without DM. We also examined the subgroup of participants without diastolic dysfunction. In this subgroup, those with DM had an increased risk for HF; hazard ratio, 2.5; 95% confidence limits, 1.0-6.3; P=.04). CONCLUSION: In this cohort, participants with DM have an increased incidence of HF over a 10-year follow-up period even in the absence of underlying diastolic dysfunction. These findings suggest that DM is an independent risk factor for the development of HF and supports the concept of DM cardiomyopathy. ",
        "Memory engrams: Recalling the past and imagining the future. In 1904, Richard Semon introduced the term \"engram\" to describe the neural substrate for storing memories. An experience, Semon proposed, activates a subset of cells that undergo off-line, persistent chemical and/or physical changes to become an engram. Subsequent reactivation of this engram induces memory retrieval. Although Semon's contributions were largely ignored in his lifetime, new technologies that allow researchers to image and manipulate the brain at the level of individual neurons has reinvigorated engram research. We review recent progress in studying engrams, including an evaluation of evidence for the existence of engrams, the importance of intrinsic excitability and synaptic plasticity in engrams, and the lifetime of an engram. Together, these findings are beginning to define an engram as the basic unit of memory. ",
        "NIST Interlaboratory Study on Glycosylation Analysis of Monoclonal Antibodies: Comparison of Results from Diverse Analytical Methods. Glycosylation is a topic of intense current interest in the development of biopharmaceuticals because it is related to drug safety and efficacy. This work describes results of an interlaboratory study on the glycosylation of the Primary Sample (PS) of NISTmAb, a monoclonal antibody reference material. Seventy-six laboratories from industry, university, research, government, and hospital sectors in Europe, North America, Asia, and Australia submitted a total of 103 reports on glycan distributions. The principal objective of this study was to report and compare results for the full range of analytical methods presently used in the glycosylation analysis of mAbs. Therefore, participation was unrestricted, with laboratories choosing their own measurement techniques. Protein glycosylation was determined in various ways, including at the level of intact mAb, protein fragments, glycopeptides, or released glycans, using a wide variety of methods for derivatization, separation, identification, and quantification. Consequently, the diversity of results was enormous, with the number of glycan compositions identified by each laboratory ranging from 4 to 48. In total, one hundred sixteen glycan compositions were reported, of which 57 compositions could be assigned consensus abundance values. These consensus medians provide community-derived values for NISTmAb PS. Agreement with the consensus medians did not depend on the specific method or laboratory type. The study provides a view of the current state-of-the-art for biologic glycosylation measurement and suggests a clear need for harmonization of glycosylation analysis methods. ",
        "Molecular Imaging of Fibroblast Activity After Myocardial Infarction Using a 68Ga-Labeled Fibroblast Activation Protein Inhibitor, FAPI-04. Heart failure remains a major source of late morbidity and mortality after myocardial infarction (MI). The temporospatial presence of activated fibroblasts in the injured myocardium predicts the quality of cardiac remodeling after MI. Therefore, monitoring of activated fibroblasts is of great interest for studying cardiac remodeling after MI. Fibroblast activation protein (FAP) expression is upregulated in activated fibroblasts. This study investigated the feasibility of imaging activated fibroblasts with a new 68Ga-labeled FAP inhibitor (68Ga-FAPI-04) for PET imaging of fibroblast activation in a preclinical model of MI. Methods: MI and sham-operated rats were scanned with 68Ga-FAPI-04 PET/CT (1, 3, 6, 14, 23, and 30 d after MI) and with 18F-FDG (3 d after MI). Dynamic 68Ga-FAPI-04 PET and blocking studies were performed on MI rats 7 d after coronary ligation. After in vivo scans, the animals were euthanized and their hearts harvested for ex vivo analyses. Cryosections were prepared for autoradiography, hematoxylin and eosin (H&E), and immunofluorescence staining. Results:68Ga-FAPI-04 uptake in the injured myocardium peaked on day 6 after coronary ligation. The tracer accumulated intensely in the MI territory, as identified by decreased 18F-FDG uptake and confirmed by PET/MR and H&E staining. Autoradiography and H&E staining of cross-sections revealed that 68Ga-FAPI-04 accumulated mainly at the border zone of the infarcted myocardium. In contrast, there was only minimal uptake in the infarct of the blocked rats, comparable to the uptake in the remote noninfarcted myocardium (PET image-derived ratio of infarct uptake to remote uptake: 6 \u00b1 2). Immunofluorescence staining confirmed the presence of FAP-positive myofibroblasts in the injured myocardium. Morphometric analysis of the whole-heart sections demonstrated 3- and 8-fold higher FAP-positive fibroblast density in the border zone than in the infarct center and remote area, respectively. Conclusion:68Ga-FAPI-04 represents a promising radiotracer for in vivo imaging of post-MI fibroblast activation. Noninvasive imaging of activated fibroblasts may have significant diagnostic and prognostic value, which could aid clinical management of patients after MI. ",
        "PilT and PilU are homohexameric ATPases that coordinate to retract type IVa pili. Bacterial type IV pili are critical for diverse biological processes including horizontal gene transfer, surface sensing, biofilm formation, adherence, motility, and virulence. These dynamic appendages extend and retract from the cell surface. In many type IVa pilus systems, extension occurs through the action of an extension ATPase, often called PilB, while optimal retraction requires the action of a retraction ATPase, PilT. Many type IVa systems also encode a homolog of PilT called PilU. However, the function of this protein has remained unclear because pilU mutants exhibit inconsistent phenotypes among type IV pilus systems and because it is relatively understudied compared to PilT. Here, we study the type IVa competence pilus of Vibrio cholerae as a model system to define the role of PilU. We show that the ATPase activity of PilU is critical for pilus retraction in PilT Walker A and/or Walker B mutants. PilU does not, however, contribute to pilus retraction in \u0394pilT strains. Thus, these data suggest that PilU is a bona fide retraction ATPase that supports pilus retraction in a PilT-dependent manner. We also found that a \u0394pilU mutant exhibited a reduction in the force of retraction suggesting that PilU is important for generating maximal retraction forces. Additional in vitro and in vivo data show that PilT and PilU act as independent homo-hexamers that may form a complex to facilitate pilus retraction. Finally, we demonstrate that the role of PilU as a PilT-dependent retraction ATPase is conserved in Acinetobacter baylyi, suggesting that the role of PilU described here may be broadly applicable to other type IVa pilus systems.

        "c-Cbl targets PD-1 in immune cells for proteasomal degradation and modulates colorectal tumor growth. Casitas B lymphoma (c-Cbl) is an E3 ubiquitin ligase and a negative regulator of colorectal cancer (CRC). Despite its high expression in immune cells, the effect of c-Cbl on the tumor microenvironment remains poorly understood. Here we demonstrate that c-Cbl alters the tumor microenvironment and suppresses Programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) protein, an immune checkpoint receptor. Using syngeneic CRC xenografts, we observed significantly higher growth of xenografts and infiltrating immune cells in c-Cbl+/- compared to c-Cbl+/+ mice. Tumor-associated CD8+ T-lymphocytes and macrophages of c-Cbl+/- mice showed 2-3-fold higher levels of PD-1. Functionally, macrophages from c-Cbl+/- mice showed a 4-5-fold reduction in tumor phagocytosis, which was restored with an anti-PD-1 neutralizing antibody suggesting regulation of PD-1 by c-Cbl. Further mechanistic probing revealed that C-terminus of c-Cbl interacted with the cytoplasmic tail of PD-1. c-Cbl destabilized PD-1 through ubiquitination- proteasomal degradation depending on c-Cbl's RING finger function. This data demonstrates c-Cbl as an E3 ligase of PD-1 and a regulator of tumor microenvironment, both of which were unrecognized components of its tumor suppressive activity. Advancing immune checkpoint and c-Cbl biology, our study prompts for probing of PD-1 regulation by c-Cbl in conditions driven by immune checkpoint abnormalities such as cancers and autoimmune diseases.

        "Flow cytometric significance of cellular alkaline phosphatase activity in acute myeloid leukemia. In this prospective hospital-based cohort study that included 43 newly diagnosed patients with acute myeloid leukemia, flow cytometric cellular alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity within primitive leukemic cells allowed us to identify two groups of patients at diagnosis according to the numbers of leukemic blasts expressing \u2265 12% of ALP+ cells (27 patients, Group A) and less than 12% of ALP+ cells (16 patients, Group B). Differences in outcome for complete response, relapse or treatment resistance, and exitus were statistically analyzed and were significant, when comparing the two groups. The overall survival (OS) and event-free survival (EFS) differences between Group A and B were statistically significant. The survival of Group A patients was significantly shorter than those for Group B. No significant relationship was detected in outcome when comparing ELN prognostic-risk group based on cytogenetic and molecular profile (patients in the favorable, intermediate, and adverse risk groups). Flow cytometric cellular ALP activity at diagnosis may be used to estimate relapses and disease persistence more accurately. The limitations of our study include the small number of patients enrolled and a short follow-up, due to its prospective nature. ",
        "Short-Chain Fatty Acids Improve Poststroke Recovery via Immunological Mechanisms. Recovery after stroke is a multicellular process encompassing neurons, resident immune cells, and brain-invading cells. Stroke alters the gut microbiome, which in turn has considerable impact on stroke outcome. However, the mechanisms underlying gut-brain interaction and implications for long-term recovery are largely elusive. Here, we tested the hypothesis that short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), key bioactive microbial metabolites, are the missing link along the gut-brain axis and might be able to modulate recovery after experimental stroke. SCFA supplementation in the drinking water of male mice significantly improved recovery of affected limb motor function. Using in vivo wide-field calcium imaging, we observed that SCFAs induced altered contralesional cortex connectivity. This was associated with SCFA-dependent changes in spine and synapse densities. RNA sequencing of the forebrain cortex indicated a potential involvement of microglial cells in contributing to the structural and functional remodeling. Further analyses confirmed a substantial impact of SCFAs on microglial activation, which depended on the recruitment of T cells to the infarcted brain. Our findings identified that microbiota-derived SCFAs modulate poststroke recovery via effects on systemic and brain resident immune cells.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Previous studies have shown a bidirectional communication along the gut-brain axis after stroke. Stroke alters the gut microbiota composition, and in turn, microbiota dysbiosis has a substantial impact on stroke outcome by modulating the immune response. However, until now, the mediators derived from the gut microbiome affecting the gut-immune-brain axis and the molecular mechanisms involved in this process were unknown. Here, we demonstrate that short-chain fatty acids, fermentation products of the gut microbiome, are potent and proregenerative modulators of poststroke neuronal plasticity at various structural levels. We identified that this effect was mediated via circulating lymphocytes on microglial activation. These results identify short-chain fatty acids as a missing link along the gut-brain axis and as a potential therapeutic to improve recovery after stroke. ",
        "Structure of the cell-binding component of the Clostridium difficile binary toxin reveals a di-heptamer macromolecular assembly. Targeting Clostridium difficile infection is challenging because treatment options are limited, and high recurrence rates are common. One reason for this is that hypervirulent C. difficile strains often have a binary toxin termed the C. difficile toxin, in addition to the enterotoxins TsdA and TsdB. The C. difficile toxin has an enzymatic component, termed CDTa, and a pore-forming or delivery subunit termed CDTb. CDTb was characterized here using a combination of single-particle cryoelectron microscopy, X-ray crystallography, NMR, and other biophysical methods. In the absence of CDTa, 2 di-heptamer structures for activated CDTb (1.0 MDa) were solved at atomic resolution, including a symmetric (SymCDTb; 3.14 \u00c5) and an asymmetric form (AsymCDTb; 2.84 \u00c5). Roles played by 2 receptor-binding domains of activated CDTb were of particular interest since the receptor-binding domain 1 lacks sequence homology to any other known toxin, and the receptor-binding domain 2 is completely absent in other well-studied heptameric toxins (i.e., anthrax). For AsymCDTb, a Ca2+ binding site was discovered in the first receptor-binding domain that is important for its stability, and the second receptor-binding domain was found to be critical for host cell toxicity and the di-heptamer fold for both forms of activated CDTb. Together, these studies represent a starting point for developing structure-based drug-design strategies to target the most severe strains of C. difficile. ",
        "U.S. Military Veterans' Health and Well-Being in the First Year After Service. INTRODUCTION: This study examined the health and well-being of U.S. veterans during the first year after military service and tested several hypotheses regarding differences in veterans' well-being over time, across life domains, and based on sex, military rank, and deployment history. METHODS: A national sample of 9,566 veterans was recruited from a roster of all separating U.S. service members in the fall of 2016. Veterans' status, functioning, and satisfaction with regard to their health, work, and social relationships were assessed within 3 months of separation and then 6 months later. Analyses were completed in 2019. RESULTS: Health concerns were most salient for newly separated veterans, with many veterans reporting that they had chronic physical (53%) or mental (33%) health conditions and were less satisfied with their health than either their work or social relationships. By contrast, most veterans reported relatively high vocational and social well-being and only work functioning demonstrated a notable decline in the first year following separation. Enlisted personnel reported consistently poorer health, vocational, and social outcomes compared with their officer counterparts, whereas war zone-deployed veterans reported more health concerns and women endorsed more mental health concerns compared with their nondeployed and male peers. CONCLUSIONS: Although most newly separated veterans experience high vocational and social well-being as they reintegrate into civilian life, findings point to the need for additional attention to the health of separating service members and bolstered support for enlisted personnel to prevent the development of chronic readjustment challenges within this population.

        "Temporal changes of circadian rhythmicity in cluster headache. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the temporal changes of circadian rhythmicity in relation to the disease course in patients with cluster headache. METHODS: In this multicenter study, patients with cluster headache were recruited between September 2016 and July 2018. We evaluated the patients for circadian rhythmicity and time of cluster headache attacks in the current bout and any experience of bout-to-bout change in circadian rhythmicity. We analyzed the patterns of circadian rhythmicity in relation to the disease progression (the number of total lifetime bouts, grouped into deciles). RESULTS: Of the 175 patients in their active, within-bout period, 86 (49.1%) had circadian rhythmicity in the current bout. The prevalence of circadian rhythmicity in the active period was overall similar regardless of disease progression. Sixty-three (46.3%) out of 136 patients with \u22652 bouts reported bout-to-bout changes in circadian rhythmicity. The most frequent time of cluster headache attacks was distributed evenly throughout the day earlier in the disease course and dichotomized into hypnic and midday as the number of lifetime bouts increased (p\u2009=\u20090.037 for the homogeneity of variance). When grouped into nighttime and daytime, nighttime attacks were predominant early in the disease course, while daytime attacks increased with disease progression (up to 7th deciles of total lifetime bouts, p\u2009=\u20090.001) and decreased in patients with the most advanced disease course (p\u2009=\u20090.013 for the non-linear association). CONCLUSIONS: Circadian rhythmicity is not a fixed factor, and changes according to the disease course. Our findings will be valuable in providing a new insight into the stability of functional involvement of the suprachiasmatic nucleus in the pathophysiology of cluster headache. ",
        "Mechanotransduction-Dependent Control of Stereocilia Dimensions and Row Identity in Inner Hair Cells. Actin-rich structures, like stereocilia and microvilli, are assembled with precise control of length, diameter, and relative spacing. By quantifying actin-core dimensions of stereocilia from phalloidin-labeled mouse cochleas, we demonstrated that inner hair cell stereocilia developed in specific stages, where a widening phase is sandwiched between two\u00a0lengthening phases. Moreover, widening of the\u00a0second-tallest stereocilia rank (row 2) occurred simultaneously with the appearance of mechanotransduction. Correspondingly, Tmc1KO/KO;Tmc2KO/KO or TmieKO/KO hair cells, which lack transduction, have significantly altered stereocilia lengths and diameters, including a narrowed row 2. EPS8 and the short splice isoform of MYO15A, identity markers for mature row 1 (the tallest row), lost their row exclusivity in transduction mutants. GNAI3, another member of the mature row 1 complex, accumulated at mutant row 1 tips at considerably lower levels than in wild-type bundles. Alterations in stereocilia dimensions and in EPS8 distribution seen in transduction mutants were mimicked by block of transduction channels of cochlear explants in culture. In addition, proteins normally concentrated at mature row 2 tips were also distributed differently in transduction mutants; the heterodimeric capping protein subunit CAPZB and its partner TWF2 never concentrated at row 2 tips like they do in wild-type bundles. The altered distribution of marker proteins in transduction mutants was accompanied by increased variability in stereocilia length. Transduction channels thus specify and maintain row identity, control addition of new actin filaments to increase stereocilia diameter, and coordinate stereocilia height within rows. ",
        "Dopamine Signaling in the Suprachiasmatic Nucleus Enables Weight Gain Associated with Hedonic Feeding. The widespread availability of energy-dense, rewarding foods is correlated with the increased incidence of obesity across the globe. Overeating during mealtimes and unscheduled snacking disrupts timed metabolic processes, which further contribute to weight gain. The neuronal mechanism by which the consumption of energy-dense food restructures the timing of feeding is poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that dopaminergic signaling within the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), the central circadian pacemaker, disrupts the timing of feeding, resulting in overconsumption of food. D1 dopamine receptor (Drd1)-null mice are resistant to diet-induced obesity, metabolic disease, and circadian disruption associated with energy-dense diets. Conversely, genetic rescue of Drd1 expression within the SCN restores diet-induced overconsumption, weight gain, and obesogenic symptoms. Access to rewarding food increases SCN dopamine turnover, and elevated Drd1-signaling decreases SCN neuronal activity, which we posit disinhibits downstream orexigenic responses.

INTRODUCTION: This study examined the health and well-being of U.S. veterans during the first year after military service and tested several hypotheses regarding differences in veterans' well-being over time, across life domains, and based on sex, military rank, and deployment history. METHODS: A national sample of 9,566 veterans was recruited from a roster of all separating U.S. service members in the fall of 2016. Veterans' status, functioning, and satisfaction with regard to their health, work, and social relationships were assessed within 3 months of separation and then 6 months later. Analyses were completed in 2019. RESULTS: Health concerns were most salient for newly separated veterans, with many veterans reporting that they had chronic physical (53%) or mental (33%) health conditions and were less satisfied with their health than either their work or social relationships. By contrast, most veterans reported relatively high vocational and social well-being and only work functioning demonstrated a notable decline in the first year following separation. Enlisted personnel reported consistently poorer health, vocational, and social outcomes compared with their officer counterparts, whereas war zone-deployed veterans reported more health concerns and women endorsed more mental health concerns compared with their nondeployed and male peers. CONCLUSIONS: Although most newly separated veterans experience high vocational and social well-being as they reintegrate into civilian life, findings point to the need for additional attention to the health of separating service members and bolstered support for enlisted personnel to prevent the development of chronic readjustment challenges within this population.

        "Between-Group Competition Impacts Reproductive Success in Wild Chimpanzees. Between-group competition in social animals appears to be a prominent selective pressure shaping the evolution of territoriality and cooperation [1-4]. Evidence for an effect of between-group competition on fitness in territorial species, however, is mostly lacking because of difficulty in measuring between-group competition and its long-term impact [5]. Between-group competition corresponds to a complex set of interactions between neighboring groups, and its intensity seems to depend on the competitive abilities of each interacting group [6, 7]. We tested whether the competitive ability of groups and the pressure exerted by neighboring groups affected the reproductive success of wild female chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes verus). Using long-term data on four neighboring groups in the Ta\u00ef National Park, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, collected over the course of 54 observation years, we measured the competitive ability of habituated groups using the number of mature males and the pressure exerted by non-habituated neighbors with an index of neighbor pressure that combined the frequency of neighboring encounters and related spatial information. Importantly, we found that experiencing low neighbor pressure provides fitness benefits through increased offspring survival and shorter inter-birth intervals. Also, many males in a group are associated with shorter inter-birth intervals. We conclude that high between-group competition hampers fast reproduction and offspring survival when exposure is during the prenatal period. Our findings suggest that having many males in a group results in fitness benefits and that between-group competition should be considered as a potential selective pressure that shaped key social adaptations in the hominoid lineage.

        "Effect of the Tailored, Family-Involved Hospital Elder Life Program on Postoperative Delirium and Function in Older Adults: A Randomized Clinical Trial. Importance: Postoperative delirium (POD) is a common condition for older adults, contributing to their functional decline. Objective: To investigate the effectiveness of the Tailored, Family-Involved Hospital Elder Life Program (t-HELP) for preventing POD and functional decline in older patients after a noncardiac surgical procedure. Design, Setting, and Participants: A 2-arm, parallel-group, single-blind, cluster randomized clinical trial was conducted from August 24, 2015, to February 28, 2016, on 6 surgical floors (gastric, colorectal, pancreatic, biliary, thoracic, and thyroid) of West China Hospital in Chengdu, China. Eligible participants (n\u2009=\u2009281) admitted to each of the 6 surgical floors were randomized into a nursing unit providing t-HELP (intervention group) or a nursing unit providing usual care (control group). All randomized patients were included in the intention-to-treat analyses for the primary outcome of POD incidence. Statistical analysis was performed from April 3, 2016, to December 30, 2017. Interventions: In addition to receiving usual care, all participants in the intervention group received the t-HELP protocols, which addressed each patient's risk factor profile. Besides nursing professionals, family members and paid caregivers were involved in the delivery of many of the program interventions. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was the incidence of POD, evaluated with the Confusion Assessment Method. Secondary outcomes included the pattern of functional and cognitive changes (activities of daily living [ADLs], instrumental activities of daily living [IADLs], Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire [SPMSQ]) from hospital admission to 30 days after discharge, and the length of hospital stay (LOS). Results: Of the 475 patients screened for eligibility, 281 (171 [60.9%] male, mean [SD] age 74.7 [5.2] years) were enrolled and randomized to receive t-HELP (n\u2009=\u2009152) or usual care (n\u2009=\u2009129). Postoperative delirium occurred in 4 participants (2.6%) in the intervention group and in 25 (19.4%) in the control group, with a relative risk of 0.14 (95% CI, 0.05-0.38). The number needed to treat to prevent 1 case of POD was 5.9 (95% CI, 4.2-11.1). Participants in the intervention group compared with the control group showed less decline in physical function (median [interquartile range] for ADLs: -5 [-10 to 0] vs -20 [-30 to -10]; P\u2009<\u2009.001; for IADLs: -2 [-2 to 0] vs -4 [-4 to -2]; P\u2009<\u2009.001) and cognitive function (for the SPMSQ level: 1 [0.8%] vs 8 [7.0%]; P\u2009=\u2009.009) at discharge, as well as shorter mean (SD) LOS (12.15 [3.78] days vs 16.41 [4.69] days; P\u2009<\u2009.001). Conclusions and Relevance: The findings suggest that t-HELP, with family involvement at its core, is effective in reducing POD for older patients, maintaining or improving their physical and cognitive functions, and shortening the LOS. The results of this t-HELP trial may improve generalizability and increase the implementation of this program. Trial Registration: Chinese Clinical Trial Registry Identifier: ChiCTR-POR-15006944. ",
        "Nutritional psychiatry: Towards improving mental health by what you eat. Does it matter what we eat for our mental health? Accumulating data suggests that this may indeed be the case and that diet and nutrition are not only critical for human physiology and body composition, but also have significant effects on mood and mental wellbeing. While the determining factors of mental health are complex, increasing evidence indicates a strong association between a poor diet and the exacerbation of mood disorders, including anxiety and depression, as well as other neuropsychiatric conditions. There are common beliefs about the health effects of certain foods that are not supported by solid evidence and the scientific evidence demonstrating the unequivocal link between nutrition and mental health is only beginning to emerge. Current epidemiological data on nutrition and mental health do not provide information about causality or underlying mechanisms. Future studies should focus on elucidating mechanism. Randomized controlled trials should be of high quality, adequately powered and geared towards the advancement of knowledge from population-based observations towards personalized nutrition. Here, we provide an overview of the emerging field of nutritional psychiatry, exploring the scientific evidence exemplifying the importance of a well-balanced diet for mental health. We conclude that an experimental medicine approach and a mechanistic understanding is required to provide solid evidence on which future policies on diet and nutrition for mental health can be based.

        "Association of Ambient and Household Air Pollution With Bone Mineral Content Among Adults in Peri-urban South India. Importance: Air pollution is a major threat to global health. Osteoporosis is responsible for a substantial burden of disease globally and is expected to increase in prevalence because of population aging. Few studies have investigated the association between air pollution and bone health, and their findings were inconclusive. Objective: To quantify the association between ambient and household air pollution and bone mass in a sample of the general population in peri-urban India. Design, Setting, and Participants: This was a population-based cross-sectional analysis of the Andhra Pradesh Children and Parents Study cohort, which recruited participants from 28 villages near Hyderabad, South India, during 2009 to 2012. Separate linear mixed models were fitted with nested random intercepts (household within villages) for each exposure-outcome pair and were sequentially adjusted for potential confounders. Data analysis was conducted between April 2019 and July 2019. Exposures: Annual mean ambient particulate matter air pollution less than 2.5 \u00b5m in aerodynamic diameter (PM2.5) and black carbon (BC) levels at the residence estimated by land-use regression and self-reported use of biomass cooking fuel. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was bone mineral content (BMC) measured in grams, corrected by bone area at the lumbar spine and left hip, as measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. The secondary outcome was bone mineral density measured in grams per centimeters squared. Results: A total of 3717 participants were analyzed (mean [SD] age, 35.7 [14.0] years; 1711 [46.0%] women). The annual mean (SD) PM2.5 exposure was 32.8 (2.5) \u03bcg/m3, and the annual mean (SD) BC exposure was 2.5 (0.2) \u03bcg/m3; 57.8% of participants used biomass cooking fuels. In fully adjusted models, PM2.5 was associated with lower BMC in the spine (mean difference, -0.57 g per 3 \u03bcg/m3 increase in PM2.5; 95% CI, -1.06 to -0.07 g per 3 \u03bcg/m3 increase in PM2.5) and hip (mean difference, -0.13 g per 3 \u03bcg/m3 increase in PM2.5; 95% CI, -0.3 to 0.03 g per 3 \u03bcg/m3 increase in PM2.5). After confounder adjustment, exposure to PM2.5 was also associated with lower bone mineral density in the spine (mean difference, -0.011 g/cm2 per 3 \u03bcg/m3 increase in PM2.5; 95% CI, -0.021 to 0 g/cm2 per 3 \u03bcg/m3 increase in PM2.5) and hip (mean difference, -0.004 g/cm2 per 3 \u03bcg/m3 increase in PM2.5; 95% CI, -0.008 to 0.001 g/cm2 per 3 \u03bcg/m3 increase in PM2.5). Exposure to BC was associated with lower BMC in the spine (mean difference, -1.13 g per 1 \u03bcg/m3 increase in BC; 95% CI, -2.81 to 0.54 g per 1 \u03bcg/m3 increase in BC) and hip (mean difference, -0.35 g per 1 \u03bcg/m3 increase in BC; 95% CI, -0.96 to 0.25 g per 1 \u03bcg/m3 increase in BC), although the confidence intervals were wider. There was no association between biomass fuel use and spine BMC (mean difference, 0.12 g; 95% CI, -0.45 to 0.68 g). Conclusions and Relevance: In a cross-sectional analysis of a population-based cohort, ambient air pollution was associated with lower BMC in a young adult population in a peri-urban area of South India.

        "CE: Original Research: The Recruitment Experience of Foreign-Educated Health Professionals to the United States. BACKGROUND: In 2007 AcademyHealth published a landmark report on the U.S.-based international nurse recruitment industry. This article provides an update to that report, describing the current state of recruitment of foreign-educated health professionals (FEHPs), in particular foreign-educated nurses (FENs), to the United States. Areas covered include the regulatory landscape, economic issues, recruitment industry changes, and current demographic and migration trends. PURPOSE: To learn more, CGFNS International, Inc., formerly known as the Commission on Graduates of Foreign Nursing Schools, and its Alliance for Ethical International Recruitment Practices division conducted a study designed to elicit qualitative and quantitative data that would further illuminate the recruitment experience. METHODS: Researchers conducted a survey of FEHPs, recruited from those who used VisaScreen services between 2015 and 2017, designed to assess their recruitment experiences. They also conducted interviews with a smaller sample of FENs and recruiters to elicit greater detail. RESULTS: While there was evidence of progress relative to the ethical recruitment of FEHPs, issues such as high breach fees, inadequate orientation, and misalignment of expectations regarding work environment and location were also revealed. CONCLUSION: Given that FEHP migration to the United States is likely to continue its upward trajectory, better strategies to implement market-wide practices that ensure the safe, orderly, and ethical recruitment of FEHPs are needed.

        "Mechanisms of noncanonical binding dynamics in multivalent protein-protein interactions. Protein multivalency can provide increased affinity and specificity relative to monovalent counterparts, but these emergent biochemical properties and their mechanistic underpinnings are difficult to predict as a function of the biophysical properties of the multivalent binding partners. Here, we present a mathematical model that accurately simulates binding kinetics and equilibria of multivalent protein-protein interactions as a function of the kinetics of monomer-monomer binding, the structure and topology of the multidomain interacting partners, and the valency of each partner. These properties are all experimentally or computationally estimated a priori, including approximating topology with a worm-like chain model applicable to a variety of structurally disparate systems, thus making the model predictive without parameter fitting. We conceptualize multivalent binding as a protein-protein interaction network: ligand and receptor valencies determine the number of interacting species in the network, with monomer kinetics and structural properties dictating the dynamics of each species. As predicted by the model and validated by surface plasmon resonance experiments, multivalent interactions can generate several noncanonical macroscopic binding dynamics, including a transient burst of high-energy configurations during association, biphasic equilibria resulting from interligand competition at high concentrations, and multiexponential dissociation arising from differential lifetimes of distinct network species. The transient burst was only uncovered when extending our analysis to trivalent interactions due to the significantly larger network, and we were able to predictably tune burst magnitude by altering linker rigidity. This study elucidates mechanisms of multivalent binding and establishes a framework for model-guided analysis and engineering of such interactions. ",
        "Dissociations\u00a0of oral foci of infections with infectious complications and survival after haematopoietic stem cell transplantation. INTRODUCTION: Haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) recipients are at increased risk for severe infections. This study examined the associations of common oral infections with survival and infectious complications in HSCT recipients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: All autologous and allogeneic HSCT recipients transplanted in the University Hospital of Basel, Switzerland, between 2008 and 2016 and referred to oral infection control pre-HSCT were included in this retrospective case-control study. All patients had a clinical and a panoramic radiological dental examination taken immediately prior to HSCT. Presence of acute or chronic oral foci of infections, decayed, missing or filled tooth index (DMFT) and radiological attachment loss (RAL) were examined. Survival and infections of the subjects were followed up for 6 months post-HSCT. RESULTS: Altogether 341 allogeneic and 125 autologous HSCT recipients were included in the study. Within 6 months post-HSCT, 47 (14%) of the allogeneic and 4 (3%) of the autologous recipients died. Oral foci of infections (acute or chronic), DMFT or periodontitis pre-HSCT were not associated with survival 6 months post-HSCT. Oral foci of infections were also not associated with hospital treated infectious diseases or blood culture positive bacteremia during the 6 month follow-up period. Untreated oral foci of infections were not associated with survival or severe infectious complications within 6 months post-HSCT. CONCLUSION: The results of this study suggest that radical dental interventions to chronic oral infections could be postponed until post-HSCT. ",
        "Development of structure-function coupling in human brain networks during youth. The protracted development of structural and functional brain connectivity within distributed association networks coincides with improvements in higher-order cognitive processes such as executive function. However, it remains unclear how white-matter architecture develops during youth to directly support coordinated neural activity. Here, we characterize the development of structure-function coupling using diffusion-weighted imaging and n-back functional MRI data in a sample of 727 individuals (ages 8 to 23 y). We found that spatial variability in structure-function coupling aligned with cortical hierarchies of functional specialization and evolutionary expansion. Furthermore, hierarchy-dependent age effects on structure-function coupling localized to transmodal cortex in both cross-sectional data and a subset of participants with longitudinal data (n = 294). Moreover, structure-function coupling in rostrolateral prefrontal cortex was associated with executive performance and partially mediated age-related improvements in executive function. Together, these findings delineate a critical dimension of adolescent brain development, whereby the coupling between structural and functional connectivity remodels to support functional specialization and cognition.

        "Immunogenic cell death induced by a new photodynamic therapy based on photosens and photodithazine. BACKGROUND: Anti-cancer therapy is more successful when it can also induce an immunogenic form of cancer cell death (ICD). Therefore, when developing new treatment strategies, it is extremely important to choose methods that induce ICD and thereby activate anti-tumor immune response leading to the most effective destruction of tumor cells. The aim of this work was to analyze whether the clinically widely used photosensitizers, photosens (PS) and photodithazine (PD), can induce ICD when used in photodynamic therapy (PDT). METHODS: Cell death in murine glioma GL261 or fibrosarcoma MCA205 cells was induced by PS- or PD-PDT and cell death was analyzed by MTT or flow cytometry. Intracellular distribution of PS and PD was studied by using the laser scanning microscope. Calreticulin exposure and HMGB1 and ATP release were detected by flow cytometry, ELISA and luminescence assay, respectively. Immunogenicity in vitro was analyzed by co-culturing of dying cancer cells with bone-marrow derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) and rate of phagocytosis and maturation (CD11c+CD86+, CD11c+CD40+) of BMDCs and production of IL-6 in the supernatant were measured. In vivo immunogenicity was analyzed in mouse tumor prophylactic vaccination model. RESULTS: We determined the optimal concentrations of the photosensitizers and found that at a light dose of 20\u2009J/cm2 (\u03bbex 615-635\u2009nm) both PS and PD efficiently induced cell death in glioma GL261 and fibrosarcoma MCA205 cells. We demonstrate that PS localized predominantly in the lysosomes and that the cell death induced by PS-PDT was inhibited by zVAD-fmk (apoptosis inhibitor) and by ferrostatin-1 and DFO (ferroptosis inhibitors), but not by the necroptosis inhibitor necrostatin-1\u2009s. By contrast, PD accumulated in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus, and the cell death induced by PD-PDT was inhibited only by z-VAD-fmk. Dying cancer cells induced by PS-PDT or PD-PDT emit calreticulin, HMGB1 and ATP and they were efficiently engulfed by BMDCs, which then matured, became activated and produced IL-6. Using dying cancer cells induced by PS-PDT or PD-PDT, we demonstrate the efficient vaccination potential of ICD in vivo. CONCLUSIONS: Altogether, these results identify PS and PD as novel ICD inducers that could be effectively combined with PDT in cancer therapy. ",
        "Coronary Sinus Neuropeptide Y Levels and Adverse Outcomes in Patients With Stable Chronic Heart Failure. Importance: Chronic heart failure (CHF) is associated with increased sympathetic drive and may increase expression of the cotransmitter neuropeptide Y (NPY) within sympathetic neurons. Objective: To determine whether myocardial NPY levels are associated with outcomes in patients with stable CHF. Design, Setting, and Participants: Prospective observational cohort study conducted at a single-center, tertiary care hospital. Stable patients with heart failure undergoing elective cardiac resynchronization therapy device implantation between 2013 and 2015. Main Outcomes and Measures: Chronic heart failure hospitalization, death, orthotopic heart transplantation, and ventricular assist device placement. Results: Coronary sinus (CS) blood samples were obtained during cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) device implantation in 105 patients (mean [SD] age 68 [12] years; 82 men [78%]; mean [SD] left ventricular ejection fraction [LVEF] 26% [7%]). Clinical, laboratory, and outcome data were collected prospectively. Stellate ganglia (SG) were collected from patients with CHF and control organ donors for molecular analysis. Mean (SD) CS NPY levels were 85.1 (31) pg/mL. On bivariate analyses, CS NPY levels were associated with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR; rs\u2009=\u2009-0.36, P\u2009<\u2009.001); N-terminal-pro hormone brain natriuretic peptide (rs\u2009=\u20090.33; P\u2009=\u2009.004), and LV diastolic dimension (rs\u2009=\u2009-0.35; P\u2009<\u2009.001), but not age, LVEF, functional status, or CRT response. Adjusting for GFR, age, and LVEF, the hazard ratio for event-free (death, cardiac transplant, or left ventricular assist device) survival for CS NPY \u2265 130 pg/mL was 9.5 (95% CI, 2.92-30.5; P\u2009<\u2009.001). Immunohistochemistry demonstrated significantly reduced NPY protein (mean [SD], 13.7 [7.6] in the cardiomyopathy group vs 31.4 [3.7] in the control group; P\u2009<\u2009.001) in SG neurons from patients with CHF while quantitative polymerase chain reaction demonstrated similar mRNA levels compared with control individuals, suggesting increased release from SG neurons in patients with CHF. Conclusions and Relevance: The CS levels of NPY may be associated with outcomes in patients with stable CHF undergoing CRT irrespective of CRT response. Increased neuronal traffic and release may be the mechanism for elevated CS NPY levels in patients with CHF. Further studies are warranted to confirm these findings.

        "Anti-Phospho-Tau Gene Therapy for Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy. Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder caused by repetitive trauma to the central nervous system (CNS) suffered by soldiers, contact sport athletes, and civilians following accident-related trauma. CTE is a CNS tauopathy, with trauma-induced inflammation leading to accumulation of hyperphosphorylated forms of the microtubule-binding protein Tau (pTau), resulting in neurofibrillary tangles and progressive loss of neurons. At present, there are no therapies to treat CTE. We hypothesized that direct CNS administration of an adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector coding for an anti-pTau antibody would generate sufficient levels of anti-pTau in the CNS to suppress pTau accumulation thus interrupting the pathogenic process. Using a serotype AAVrh.10 gene transfer vector coding for a monoclonal antibody directed against pTau, we demonstrate the feasibility of this strategy in a murine CTE model in which pTau accumulation was elicited by repeated traumatic brain injury (TBI) using a closed cortical impact procedure over 5 days. Direct delivery of AAVrh.10 expression vectors coding for either of the two different anti-pTau antibodies to the hippocampus of these TBI mice significantly reduced pTau levels across the CNS. Using doses that can be safely scaled to humans, the data demonstrate that CNS administration of AAVrh.10anti-pTau is effective, providing a new strategy to interrupt the CTE consequences of TBI. ",
        "Burnout, Perceived Stress, Sleep Quality, and Smartphone Use: A Survey of Osteopathic Medical Students. Context: Burnout is a psychological syndrome that results from prolonged exposure to stressful work activities and includes 3 dimensions: emotional exhaustion (EE), depersonalization (DP), and low sense of personal accomplishment (PA). Burnout is a widespread problem in numerous professions but is particularly high among medical students, residents, and early-career physicians compared with college graduates of similar age. However, minimal research has addressed burnout in osteopathic medical students. Objective: To assess levels of burnout in osteopathic medical students and to examine the relationship among burnout, perceived stress, sleep quality, and smartphone use. Methods: This study used a cross-sectional study design and an anonymous, electronic questionnaire service to administer the Maslach Burnout Inventory, the Perceived Stress Scale-4, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality index, and the Smartphone Addiction Scale Short Version. Results: A total of 385 participants (mean [SD] age, 25 [2.4] years; 208 [54.0%] women; 286 [74.3%] white; 138 [35.8%] second-year osteopathic medical students [OMSs]) completed the survey. Of the 385 participants, 9 (2.3%) reported high EE, 67 (17.4) reported high DP, and 310 (80.5) reported a high level of low PA. When comparing dimensions of burnout by gender, only levels of PA differed by gender, with men reporting higher levels of burnout compared with women (\u03c712=5.2, P=.022). Further, levels of DP differed by year in medical school (\u03c7 2=17.3, P=.008), with post-hoc comparisons showing differences between OMS I and OMS III (F=4.530, df=3, P=.004). Linear regression models showed that higher perceived stress (standardized \u03b2=0.5, P<.001), poorer sleep quality (standardized \u03b2=0.2, P=.001), and higher smartphone addiction scores (standardized \u03b2=0.1, P<.001) were associated with higher EE. Similarly, higher perceived stress (standardized \u03b2=0.2, P<.001), poorer sleep quality (standardized \u03b2=0.2, P=.001), and higher smartphone addiction scores (standardized \u03b2=0.2, P=.001) were associated with higher DP. Only higher perceived stress was associated with higher levels of low PA (standardized \u03b2=-0.4, P<.001). Conclusions: These findings suggest independent associations with EE, DP, perceived stress, sleep quality, and smartphone use. Additional research with a larger, more diverse sample is needed to confirm these findings. If confirmed, wellness interventions can be designed to target 2 modifiable factors: sleep quality and smartphone use. ",
        "Association Between Cardiovascular Health and Cognitive Performance: A Twins Study. BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE: The 2020 Strategic Impact Goal introduced by the American Heart Association (AHA) aims at improving cardiovascular health (CVH) of all Americans by 20%. AHA defined ideal CVH across seven established modifiable risk factors for cardiovascular diseases. Prior studies have indicated that ideal CVH also benefits brain health and cognitive aging, but it is possible that this association is explained by familial factors. METHODS: We examined 272 male monozygotic and dizygotic twin pairs (total 544 subjects) free of overt cardiovascular disease and dementia from the Vietnam Era Twin Registry. Memory and learning were measured by Trail Making tests and Wechsler Memory Scale (Immediate and Delayed Memory tests and Visual Reproductive Test). Each of the seven CVH components (smoking, body mass index, physical activity, diet, total cholesterol, blood pressure, and blood glucose) was scored per established criterion. RESULTS: The mean age of the twins was 55 years, 96% were whites, and 61% monozygotic. When considering twins as individuals, for every unit increase in CVH score (indicating better cardiovascular health), twins demonstrated faster cognitive processing speed (Trail B: - 5.6\u200as, 95% CI - 10.3, - 0.9; p\u200a=\u200a0.03) and better story recall, both immediate (0.35, 95% CI 0.06, 0.62; p\u200a=\u200a0.02) and delayed (0.39, 95% CI 0.08, 0.70; p\u200a=\u200a0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Better CVH is associated with better cognitive health in several domains. As suggested by within-pair analysis, this association is largely explained by familial factors, implying that early life exposures are shared determinants of both brain health and cardiovascular health.

        "Loss of Pre-Existing Immunological Memory among HIV Infected Women Despite Immune Reconstitution with Antiretroviral Therapy. BACKGROUND: It is unclear if HIV infection results in permanent loss of T cell memory or if it impacts pre-existing antibodies to childhood vaccinations/infections. METHODS: We conducted a matched cohort study involving 50 pairs of HIV+ and HIV- women. Total memory T cell responses were measured after anti-CD3 stimulation or after vaccinia virus stimulation to measure T cells elicited after childhood smallpox vaccination. Vaccinia-specific antibodies were measured by ELISA. RESULTS: There was no difference between HIV+ and HIV- subjects in terms of CD4+ T cell responses after anti-CD3 stimulation (P=0.19) although HIV+ subjects had significantly higher CD8+ T cell responses (P=0.033). In contrast, there was a significant loss in vaccinia-specific CD4+ T cell memory among HIV+ subjects (P=0.039) whereas antiviral CD8+ T cell memory remained intact (P=1.0). Vaccinia-specific antibodies were maintained indefinitely among HIV- subjects (half-life; infinity, 95%CI, 309 years-infinity) but declined rapidly among HIV+ subjects (half-life; 39 years, 95%CI, 24-108 years, P=0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Despite ART-associated improvement in CD4+ T cell counts (nadir CD4 <200 cells/mm3 with >350 cells/mm3 after ART), antigen-specific CD4+ T cell memory to vaccinations/infections that occurred before HIV infection did not recover after immune reconstitution and a previously unrealized decline in pre-existing antibody responses was observed.

        "The clock gene Bmal1 inhibits macrophage motility, phagocytosis, and impairs defense against pneumonia. The circadian clock regulates many aspects of immunity. Bacterial infections are affected by time of day, but the mechanisms involved remain undefined. Here we show that loss of the core clock protein BMAL1 in macrophages confers protection against pneumococcal pneumonia. Infected mice show both reduced weight loss and lower bacterial burden in circulating blood. In vivo studies of macrophage phagocytosis reveal increased bacterial ingestion following Bmal1 deletion, which was also seen in vitro. BMAL1-/- macrophages exhibited marked differences in actin cytoskeletal organization, a phosphoproteome enriched for cytoskeletal changes, with reduced phosphocofilin and increased active RhoA. Further analysis of the BMAL1-/- macrophages identified altered cell morphology and increased motility. Mechanistically, BMAL1 regulated a network of cell movement genes, 148 of which were within 100 kb of high-confidence BMAL1 binding sites. Links to RhoA function were identified, with 29 genes impacting RhoA expression or activation. RhoA inhibition restored the phagocytic phenotype to that seen in control macrophages. In summary, we identify a surprising gain of antibacterial function due to loss of BMAL1 in macrophages, associated with a RhoA-dependent cytoskeletal change, an increase in cell motility, and gain of phagocytic function.

        "The effect of mindfulness training on extinction retention. Anxiety and trauma related disorders are highly prevalent, causing suffering and high costs for society. Current treatment strategies, although effective, only show moderate effect-sizes when compared to adequate control groups demonstrating a need to develop new forms of treatment or optimize existing ones. In order to achieve this, an increased understanding of what mechanisms are involved is needed. An emerging literature indicates that mindfulness training (MFT) can be used to treat fear and anxiety related disorders, but the treatment mechanisms are unclear. One hypothesis, largely based on findings from neuroimaging studies, states that MFT may improve extinction retention, but this has not been demonstrated empirically. To investigate this question healthy subjects either completed a 4-week MFT- intervention delivered through a smart-phone app (n\u2009=\u200914) or were assigned to a waitlist (n\u2009=\u200915). Subsequently, subjects participated in a two-day experimental protocol using pavlovian aversive conditioning, evaluating acquisition and extinction of threat-related responses on day 1, and extinction retention on day 2. Results showed that the MFT group displayed reduced spontaneous recovery of threat related arousal responses, as compared to the waitlist control group, on day 2. MFT did not however, have an effect on either the acquisition or extinction of conditioned responses day 1. This clarifies the positive effect of MFT on emotional functioning and could have implications for the treatment of anxiety and trauma related disorders. ",
        "Inhibition of ErbB kinase signalling promotes resolution of neutrophilic inflammation. Neutrophilic inflammation with prolonged neutrophil survival is common to many inflammatory conditions, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). There are few specific therapies that reverse neutrophilic inflammation, but uncovering mechanisms regulating neutrophil survival is likely to identify novel therapeutic targets. Screening of 367 kinase inhibitors in human neutrophils and a zebrafish tail fin injury model identified ErbBs as common targets of compounds that accelerated inflammation resolution. The ErbB inhibitors gefitinib, CP-724714, erbstatin and tyrphostin AG825 significantly accelerated apoptosis of human neutrophils, including neutrophils from people with COPD. Neutrophil apoptosis was also increased in Tyrphostin AG825 treated-zebrafish in vivo. Tyrphostin AG825 decreased peritoneal inflammation in zymosan-treated mice, and increased lung neutrophil apoptosis and macrophage efferocytosis in a murine acute lung injury model. Tyrphostin AG825 and knockdown of egfra and erbb2 by CRISPR/Cas9 reduced inflammation in zebrafish. Our work shows that inhibitors of ErbB kinases have therapeutic potential in neutrophilic inflammatory disease. ",
        "Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation Reduces Movement-Evoked Pain and Fatigue: A Randomized, Controlled Trial. OBJECTIVE: Fibromyalgia (FM) is characterized by pain and fatigue, particularly during physical activity. Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) activates endogenous pain inhibitory mechanisms. This study was undertaken to investigate if using TENS during activity would improve movement-evoked pain and other patient-reported outcomes in women with FM. METHODS: Participants were randomly assigned to receive active TENS (n = 103), placebo TENS (n = 99), or no TENS (n = 99) and instructed to use it at home during activity 2 hours each day for 4 weeks. TENS was applied to the lumbar and cervicothoracic regions using a modulated frequency (2-125 Hz) at the highest tolerable intensity. Participants rated movement-evoked pain (primary outcome measure) and fatigue on an 11-point scale before and during application of TENS. The primary outcome measure and secondary patient-reported outcomes were assessed at baseline (time of randomization) and at 4 weeks. RESULTS: After 4 weeks, a greater reduction in movement-evoked pain was reported in the active TENS group versus the placebo TENS group (group mean difference -1.0 [95% confidence interval -1.8, -0.2]; P = 0.008) and versus the no TENS group (group mean difference -1.8 [95% confidence interval -2.6, -1.0]; P < 0.0001). A reduction in movement-evoked fatigue was also reported in the active TENS group versus the placebo TENS group (group mean difference -1.4 [95% confidence interval -2.4, -0.4]; P = 0.001) and versus the no TENS group (group mean difference -1.9 [95% confidence interval -2.9, -0.9]; P = <0.0001). A greater percentage of the patients in the active TENS group reported improvement on the global impression of change compared to the placebo TENS group (70% versus 31%; P < 0.0001) and the no TENS group (9%; P < 0.0001). There were no TENS-related serious adverse events, and <5% of participants experienced minor adverse events from TENS. CONCLUSION: Among women who had FM and were on a stable medication regimen, 4 weeks of active TENS use compared to placebo TENS or no TENS resulted in a significant improvement in movement-evoked pain and other clinical outcomes. Further research is needed to examine effectiveness in a real-world setting to establish the clinical importance of these findings. ",
        "Prevalence of Potentially Unnecessary Bimanual Pelvic Examinations and Papanicolaou Tests Among Adolescent Girls and Young Women Aged 15-20 Years in the United States. Importance: Pelvic examination is no longer recommended for asymptomatic, nonpregnant women and may cause harms such as false-positive test results, overdiagnosis, anxiety, and unnecessary costs. The bimanual pelvic examination (BPE) is an invasive and controversial examination component. Cervical cancer screening is not recommended for women younger than 21 years. Objectives: To estimate prevalence of potentially unnecessary BPE and Papanicolaou (Pap) tests performed among adolescent girls and women younger than 21 years (hereinafter referred to as young women) in the United States and to identify factors associated with receiving these examinations. Design, Setting, and Participants: A cross-sectional analysis of the National Survey of Family Growth from September 2011 through September 2017 focused on a population-based sample of young women aged 15 to 20 years (n\u2009=\u20093410). The analysis used survey weights to estimate prevalence and the number of people represented in the US population. Data were analyzed from December 21, 2018, through September 3, 2019. Main Outcomes and Measures: Receipt of a BPE or a Pap test in the last 12 months and the proportion of potentially unnecessary examinations and tests. Results: Responses from 3410 young women aged 15 to 20 years were included in the analysis with 6-year sampling weights applied. Among US young women aged 15 to 20 years represented during the 2011-2017 study period, 4.8% (95% CI, 3.9%-5.9%) were pregnant, 22.3% (95% CI, 20.1%-24.6%) had undergone STI testing, and 4.5% (95% CI, 3.6%-5.5%) received treatment or medication for an STI in the past 12 months (Table 1). Only 2.0% (95% CI, 1.4%-2.9%) reported using an IUD, and 33.5% (95% CI, 30.8%-36.4%) used at least 1 other type of hormonal contraception in the past 12 months. Among US young women aged 15 to 20 years who were surveyed in the years 2011 through 2017, approximately 2.6 million (22.9%; 95% CI, 20.7%-25.3%) reported having received a BPE in the last 12 months. Approximately half of these examinations (54.4%; 95% CI, 48.8%-59.9%) were potentially unnecessary, representing an estimated 1.4 million individuals. Receipt of a BPE was associated with having a Pap test (adjusted prevalence ratio [aPR], 7.12; 95% CI, 5.56-9.12), testing for sexually transmitted infections (aPR, 1.60; 95% CI, 1.34-1.90), and using hormonal contraception other than an intrauterine device (aPR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.11-1.54). In addition, an estimated 2.2 million young women (19.2%; 95% CI, 17.2%-21.4%) reported having received a Pap test in the past 12 months, and 71.9% (95% CI, 66.0%-77.1%) of these tests were potentially unnecessary. Conclusions and Relevance: This analysis found that more than half of BPEs and almost three-quarters of Pap tests performed among young women aged 15 to 20 years during the years 2011 through 2017 were potentially unnecessary, exposing women to preventable harms. The results suggest that compliance with the current professional guidelines regarding the appropriate use of these examinations and tests may be lacking. ",
        "Step toward Roadside Sensing: Noninvasive Detection of a THC Metabolite from the Sweat Content of Fingerprints. The sudden increase in states legalizing marijuana has forced law enforcement into a situation where the use and consumption are legal, but there are no limitations for what is acceptable for driving or operating machinery. Using ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) spectroscopy, fingerprints from volunteers who had used marijuana were analyzed via a competitive immunoassay for the detection of \u03949-tetrahydrocannabinol (\u03949-THC), the main psychoactive component of marijuana, and 11-nor-9-carboxy-THC (THC-COOH), one of the main metabolites produced in the body following the use/consumption of THC-related products. In this research, the THC-COOH metabolite and the enzyme-labeled conjugate compete against each other as the antigens for the system. The antibody used in this assay has a greater affinity for the metabolite; so, as its concentration increases, the absorbance of the system decreases due to less binding of the enzyme-labeled conjugate.

        "JUUL and Combusted Cigarettes Comparably Impair Endothelial Function. Objectives: JUUL and earlier generation electronic cigarettes (e-cigs) are promoted as being less hazardous than cigarettes. While JUUL Labs, in particular, claims that switching from smoking to vaping has beneficial impacts, the health effects of such products are not well understood. We investigated whether exposure to JUUL and previous generation e-cig aerosol impairs endothelial function comparably to cigarette smoke. Methods: We exposed rats to aerosol from Virginia Tobacco flavor JUUL, an e-cig tank system using unflavored freebase nicotine e-liquid, Marlboro Red combustible tobacco cigarettes, or clean air for 10 cycles of 2 second inhalation over 5 minutes. Endothelial function (FMD) was measured pre- and post-exposure. Blood was collected 20 mins post-exposure for serum nicotine analysis. Results: Aerosol/smoke from JUUL, previous generation e-cigs, and cigarettes all impaired FMD. The extent of impairment ranged from 34%-58%, although the differences between groups were insignificant. Nicotine was highest in serum from the JUUL group; for the other e-cig and cigarette groups, nicotine levels were lower and comparable to each other. Conclusions: Aerosol from JUUL and previous generation e-cigs impairs endothelial function in rats, comparable to impairment by cigarette smoke. ",
        "Near real-time intraoperative brain tumor diagnosis using stimulated Raman histology and deep neural networks. Intraoperative diagnosis is essential for providing safe and effective care during cancer surgery1. The existing workflow for intraoperative diagnosis based on hematoxylin and eosin staining of processed tissue is time, resource and labor intensive2,3. Moreover, interpretation of intraoperative histologic images is dependent on a contracting, unevenly distributed, pathology workforce4. In the present study, we report a parallel workflow that combines stimulated Raman histology (SRH)5-7, a label-free optical imaging method and deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to predict diagnosis at the bedside in near real-time in an automated fashion. Specifically, our CNNs, trained on over 2.5 million SRH images, predict brain tumor diagnosis in the operating room in under 150\u2009s, an order of magnitude faster than conventional techniques (for example, 20-30\u2009min)2. In a multicenter, prospective clinical trial (n\u2009=\u2009278), we demonstrated that CNN-based diagnosis of SRH images was noninferior to pathologist-based interpretation of conventional histologic images (overall accuracy, 94.6% versus 93.9%). Our CNNs learned a hierarchy of recognizable histologic feature representations to classify the major histopathologic classes of brain tumors. In addition, we implemented a semantic segmentation method to identify tumor-infiltrated diagnostic regions within SRH images. These results demonstrate how intraoperative cancer diagnosis can be streamlined, creating a complementary pathway for tissue diagnosis that is independent of a traditional pathology laboratory. ",
        "Perinatal phthalates exposure decreases fine-motor functions in 11-year-old girls: Results from weighted Quantile sum regression. INTRODUCTION: Phthalates are a group of high production chemicals, generally used as plasticizers and odor enhancers. Phthalates cross the blood-placenta barrier and are associated with deficits in cognitive functions and behavior problems in offspring. We previously reported sex-specific associations with motor function when phthalates are considered singly. Because exposure to phthalates usually occurs as mixtures, here we assess these associations between a mixture of phthalates and motor function at age 11\u00a0years. METHODS: Data come from the prospective cohort study of mothers and offspring who participated in the Columbia Center for Children's Environmental Health birth cohort (CCCEH). Seven phthalate metabolites were measured in maternal spot urine obtained during the third trimester and motor function was evaluated using the short form of the Bruininks-Oseretsky Test of Motor Proficiency, 2nd edition (BOT-2) at the age of 11\u00a0years. We used Weighted Quartile Sum (WQS) regression models to examine the effect of phthalate metabolites in males and females separately. The models were adjusted for child age in months, child BMI, maternal race (African-American vs. Dominican), prenatal alcohol consumption, maternal demoralization score, HOME score, and urine specific gravity. In a secondary analysis we used linear regression models to examine the association between the sum of molar concentrations of both DEHP and non-DEHP metabolites, and outcomes of gross and fine motor functions. RESULTS: 209 mother-child pairs were eligible for this analysis. A significant decrease in fine-motor functions was observed among females, but not among males, following exposure to high levels of weighted quartile sum of seven phthalate metabolites (Covariates-adjusted coefficient estimate B\u00a0=\u00a0-2.7, 95% Confidence Interval [CI] -4.64 to -0.75, p\u00a0=\u00a00.01 for females [n\u00a0=\u00a0116] and B\u00a0=\u00a0-1.63, 95%CI -3.94 to 0.69, p\u00a0=\u00a00.16 for males [n\u00a0=\u00a093]). The most highly weighted phthalate metabolites, associated with fine-motor functions among females, were MBP, MBZP, and MIBP, all non-DEHP phthalates. No significant associations were found between the weighted quartile sum of seven phthalate metabolites and gross-motor functions at the age of 11\u00a0years for males (B\u00a0=\u00a0-0.81, 95%CI -1.17 to 1.96, p\u00a0=\u00a00.23). With the molar sum of four non-DEHP phthalates as main predictor of linear regression models, we found significant decrease in gross and fine motor functions among females prenatally exposed to non-DEHP phthalates B\u00a0=\u00a0-0.98, 95%CI -1.98 to 0.03, p\u00a0=\u00a00.05 and B\u00a0=\u00a0-0.85, 95%CI -1.49 to -0.20, p\u00a0=\u00a00.01, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Phthalate exposure during pregnancy was associated with decreased motor functions among 11-year-old girls. ",
        "Haptoglobin administration into the subarachnoid space prevents hemoglobin-induced cerebral vasospasm. Delayed ischemic neurological deficit (DIND) is a major driver of adverse outcomes in patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH), defining an unmet need for therapeutic development. Cell-free hemoglobin that is released from erythrocytes into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is suggested to cause vasoconstriction and neuronal toxicity, and correlates with the occurrence of DIND. Cell-free hemoglobin in the CSF of patients with aSAH disrupted dilatory NO signaling ex vivo in cerebral arteries, which shifted vascular tone balance from dilation to constriction. We found that selective removal of hemoglobin from patient CSF with a haptoglobin-affinity column or its sequestration in a soluble hemoglobin-haptoglobin complex was sufficient to restore physiological vascular responses. In a sheep model, administration of haptoglobin into the CSF inhibited hemoglobin-induced cerebral vasospasm and preserved vascular NO signaling. We identified 2 pathways of hemoglobin delocalization from CSF into the brain parenchyma and into the NO-sensitive compartment of small cerebral arteries. Both pathways were critical for hemoglobin toxicity and were interrupted by the large hemoglobin-haptoglobin complex that inhibited spatial requirements for hemoglobin reactions with NO in tissues. Collectively, our data show that compartmentalization of hemoglobin by haptoglobin provides a novel framework for innovation aimed at reducing hemoglobin-driven neurological damage after subarachnoid bleeding.

        "Outer Radial Glia-like Cancer Stem Cells Contribute to Heterogeneity of Glioblastoma. Glioblastoma is a devastating form of brain cancer. To identify aspects of tumor heterogeneity that may illuminate drivers of tumor invasion, we created a glioblastoma tumor cell atlas with single-cell transcriptomics of cancer cells mapped onto a reference framework of the developing and adult human brain. We find that multiple GSC subtypes exist within a single tumor. Within these GSCs, we identify an invasive cell population similar to outer radial glia (oRG), a fetal cell type\u00a0that expands the stem cell niche in normal human cortex. Using live time-lapse imaging of primary resected tumors, we discover that tumor-derived oRG-like cells undergo characteristic mitotic somal translocation behavior previously only observed in\u00a0human development, suggesting a\u00a0reactivation of\u00a0developmental programs. In addition, we show\u00a0that PTPRZ1 mediates both mitotic somal translocation and glioblastoma tumor invasion. These data suggest that the presence of heterogeneous GSCs may underlie glioblastoma's rapid progression and invasion. ",
        "On-Membrane Dynamic Interplay between Anti-GM1 IgG Antibodies and Complement Component C1q. Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, an autoimmune neuropathy characterized by acute limb weakness, is often preceded by Campylobacter jejuni infection. Molecular mimicry exists between the bacterial lipo-oligosaccharide and human ganglioside. Such C. jejuni infection induces production of immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) autoantibodies against GM1 and causes complement-mediated motor nerve injury. For elucidating the molecular mechanisms linking autoantigen recognition and complement activation, we characterized the dynamic interactions of anti-GM1 IgG autoantibodies on ganglioside-incorporated membranes. Using high-speed atomic force microscopy, we found that the IgG molecules assemble into a hexameric ring structure on the membranes depending on their specific interactions with GM1. Complement component C1q was specifically recruited onto these IgG rings. The ring formation was inhibited by an IgG-binding domain of staphylococcal protein A bound at the cleft between the CH2 and CH3 domains. These data indicate that the IgG assembly is mediated through Fc-Fc interactions, which are promoted under on-membrane conditions due to restricted translational diffusion of IgG molecules. Reduction and alkylation of the hinge disulfide impaired IgG ring formation, presumably because of an increase in conformational entropic penalty. Our findings provide mechanistic insights into the molecular processes involved in Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome and, more generally, into antigen-dependent interplay between antibodies and complement components on membranes.

        "Sex differences in cardiometabolic disorders. The prevalence of cardiometabolic disorders in both women and men has increased worldwide and is linked to a rise in obesity and obesity-associated associated clustering of other cardiometabolic risk factors such as hypertension, impaired glucose regulation and dyslipidemia. However, the predominance of common types of cardiometabolic disorders such as heart failure, atrial fibrillation and ischemic heart disease is sex specific, and our identification of these and the underlying mechanisms is only just emerging. New evidence suggests that sex hormones, sex-specific molecular mechanisms and gender influence glucose and lipid metabolisms, as well as cardiac energy metabolism, and function. Here we review sex differences in cardiometabolic risk factors, associated preclinical and clinical cardiac disorders and potential therapeutic avenues. ",
        "Proteomic analyses of decellularized porcine ovaries identified new matrisome proteins and spatial differences across and within ovarian compartments. Premature ovarian insufficiency (POI) affects approximately 1% of women. We aim to understand the ovarian microenvironment, including the extracellular matrix (ECM) and associated proteins (matrisome), and its role in controlling folliculogenesis. We mapped the composition of the matrisome of porcine ovaries through the cortical compartment, where quiescent follicles reside and the medullary compartment, where the larger follicles grow and mature. To do this we sliced the ovaries, uniformly in two anatomical planes, enriched for matrisome proteins and performed bottom-up shotgun proteomic analyses. We identified 42 matrisome proteins that were significantly differentially expressed across depths, and 11 matrisome proteins that have not been identified in previous ovarian protein analyses. We validated these data for nine proteins and confirmed compartmental differences with a second processing method. Here we describe a processing and proteomic analysis pipeline that revealed spatial differences and matrisome protein candidates that may influence folliculogenesis. ",
        "Unraveling Complexity about Childhood Obesity and Nutritional Interventions: Modeling Interactions Among Psychological Factors. As the global prevalence of childhood obesity continues to rise, researchers and clinicians have sought to develop more effective and personalized intervention techniques. In doing so, obesity interventions have expanded beyond the traditional context of nutrition to address several facets of a child's life, including their psychological state. While the consideration of psychological features has significantly advanced the view of obesity as a holistic condition, attempts to associate such features with outcomes of treatment have been inconclusive. We posit that such uncertainty may arise from the univariate manner in which features are evaluated, focusing on a particular aspect such as loneliness or insecurity, but failing to account for the impact of co-occurring psychological characteristics. Moreover, co-occurrence of psychological characteristics (both child and parent/guardian) have not been studied from the perspective of their relationship with nutritional intervention outcomes. To that end, this work looks to broaden the prevailing view: laying the foundation for the existence of complex interactions among psychological features. In collaboration with a non-profit nutritional clinic in Brazil, this paper demonstrates and models these interactions and their associations with the outcomes of a nutritional intervention. ",
        "Metabolism of cholesterol and progesterone is differentially regulated in primary trophoblastic subtypes and might be disturbed in recurrent miscarriages. During pregnancy, extravillous trophoblasts (EVTs) invade the maternal decidua and remodel the local vasculature to establish blood supply for the growing fetus. Compromised EVT function has been linked to aberrant pregnancy associated with maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality. However, metabolic features of this invasive trophoblast subtype are largely unknown. Using primary human trophoblasts isolated from first trimester placental tissues, we show that cellular cholesterol homeostasis is differentially regulated in EVTs compared with villous cytotrophoblasts. Utilizing RNA-sequencing, gene set-enrichment analysis, and functional validation, we provide evidence that EVTs display increased levels of free and esterified cholesterol. Accordingly, EVTs are characterized by increased expression of the HDL-receptor, scavenger receptor class B type I, and reduced expression of the LXR and its target genes. We further reveal that EVTs express elevated levels of hydroxy-delta-5-steroid dehydrogenase 3 beta- and steroid delta-isomerase 1 (HSD3B1) (a rate-limiting enzyme in progesterone synthesis) and are capable of secreting progesterone. Increasing cholesterol export by LXR activation reduced progesterone secretion in an ABCA1-dependent manner. Importantly, HSD3B1 expression was decreased in EVTs of idiopathic recurrent spontaneous abortions, pointing toward compromised progesterone metabolism in EVTs of early miscarriages. Here, we provide insights into the regulation of cholesterol and progesterone metabolism in trophoblastic subtypes and its putative relevance in human miscarriage. ",
        "Multiyear Follow-up of AAV5-hFVIII-SQ Gene Therapy for Hemophilia A. BACKGROUND: Adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated gene therapy is under investigation as a therapeutic option for persons with hemophilia A. Efficacy and safety data include 3 years of follow-up after a single administration of AAV5-hFVIII-SQ. METHODS: We report durable efficacy, long-term safety, and clinical and biologic results in 15 adults with severe hemophilia A (factor VIII level, \u22641 IU per deciliter) who had received a single infusion of AAV5-hFVIII-SQ at various dose levels. We evaluated the factor VIII level, annualized rate of bleeding events, use of factor VIII, safety, expression kinetics, and biologic markers of AAV transduction for up to 3 years. RESULTS: Three years after infusion, two participants (one who had received 6\u00d71012 vector genomes [vg] per kilogram of body weight and one who had received 2\u00d71013 vg per kilogram) had factor VIII expression of less than 1 IU per deciliter, as assessed on chromogenic assay. Seven participants (who had received 6\u00d71013 vg per kilogram) had a median factor VIII expression of 20 IU per deciliter; the median number of annualized treated bleeding events was 0, and the median use of exogenous factor VIII was reduced from 138.5 infusions to 0 infusions per year. Bleeding in all target joints (major joints with \u22653 bleeding events within 6 months) in this cohort resolved (\u22642 bleeding events within 12 months). Two years after infusion, six participants (who had received 4\u00d71013 vg per kilogram) had a median factor VIII expression of 13 IU per deciliter; the median annualized rate of bleeding events was 0, and the median use of factor VIII was reduced from 155.5 infusions to 0.5 infusions per year. Bleeding in target joints resolved in five of six participants. The factor VIII pharmacodynamic profiles reflected cellular turnover in the blood and molecular events leading to episomal DNA stabilization for persistent expression, findings that are consistent with previous observations in two model systems. Transgene-derived human factor VIII (hFVIII) protein activity mirrored native hFVIII in hemostatic ability. No inhibitor development, thromboses, deaths, or persistent changes in liver-function tests were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Gene therapy with AAV5-hFVIII-SQ vector in participants with hemophilia A resulted in sustained, clinically relevant benefit, as measured by a substantial reduction in annualized rates of bleeding events and complete cessation of prophylactic factor VIII use in all participants who had received 4\u00d71013 vg per kilogram or 6\u00d71013 vg per kilogram of the gene therapy.

        "Whole-genome resequencing identifies quantitative trait loci associated with mycorrhizal colonization of soybean. KEY MESSAGE: A whole-genome resequencing-derived SNP dataset identified six quantitative trait loci (QTL) significantly associated with colonization of soybean by an arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus (Rhizophagus intraradices). Candidate genes identified in these QTL regions include homologs to known nodulin protein families and other symbiosis-specific genes. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) form associations with over 80% of all terrestrial plant species and assist their host plants by increasing their nutrient uptake, drought tolerance, and resilience against pathogens and pests. Genotypic variation of crop plants to AMF colonization has been identified in crops, including soybean; however, the genetics controlling levels of AMF colonization in soybean are unknown. The overall goal of our study was to identify genomic regions associated with mycorrhizal colonization in soybean using genome-wide association analysis. A diverse panel of 350 exotic soybean genotypes inoculated with Rhizophagus intraradices were microscopically evaluated for root colonization using a modified gridline intersect method. Root colonization differed significantly (P\u2009<\u20090.001) among genotypes and ranged from 11 to 70%. A whole-genome resequencing-derived SNP dataset identified six quantitative trait loci (QTL) significantly associated with R. intraradices colonization that explained 24% of the phenotypic variance. Candidate genes identified in these QTL regions include homologs to known nodulin protein families and other symbiosis-specific genes. The results showed there was a significant genetic component to the level of colonization by R. intraradices in soybean. This information may be useful in the development of AMF-sensitive soybean cultivars to enhance nutrient uptake, drought tolerance, and disease resistance in the crop. ",
        "Neurodevelopmental Abnormalities in Children With In Utero Zika Virus Exposure Without Congenital Zika Syndrome. Importance: The number of children who were born to mothers with Zika virus (ZIKV) infection during pregnancy but who did not have apparent disability at birth is large, warranting the study of the risk for neurodevelopmental impairment in this population without congenital Zika syndrome (CZS). Objective: To investigate whether infants without CZS but who were exposed to ZIKV in utero have normal neurodevelopmental outcomes until 18 months of age. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study prospectively enrolled a group of pregnant women with ZIKV in Atl\u00e1ntico Department, Colombia, and in Washington, DC. With this cohort, we performed a longitudinal study of infant neurodevelopment. Infants born between August 1, 2016, and November 30, 2017, were included if they were live born, had normal fetal brain findings on magnetic resonance imaging and ultrasonography, were normocephalic at birth, and had normal examination results without clinical evidence of CZS. Seventy-seven infants born in Colombia, but 0 infants born in the United States, met the inclusion criteria. Exposures: Prenatal ZIKV exposure. Main Outcomes and Measures: Infant development was assessed by the Warner Initial Developmental Evaluation of Adaptive and Functional Skills (WIDEA) and the Alberta Infant Motor Scale (AIMS) at 1 or 2 time points between 4 and 18 months of age. The WIDEA and AIMS scores were converted to z scores compared with normative samples. Longitudinal mixed-effects regression models based on bootstrap resampling methods estimated scores over time, accounting for gestational age at maternal ZIKV infection and infant age at assessment. Results were presented as slope coefficients with 2-tailed P values based on z statistics that tested whether the coefficient differed from 0 (no change). Results: Of the 77 Colombian infants included in this cohort study, 70 (91%) had no CZS and underwent neurodevelopmental assessments. Forty infants (57%) were evaluated between 4 and 8 months of age at a median (interquartile range [IQR]) age of 5.9 (5.3-6.5) months, and 60 (86%) underwent assessment between 9 and 18 months of age at a median (IQR) age of 13.0 (11.2-16.4) months. The WIDEA total score (coefficients: age\u2009=\u2009-0.227 vs age2\u2009=\u20090.006; P\u2009<\u2009.003) and self-care domain score (coefficients: age\u2009=\u2009-0.238 vs age2\u2009=\u20090.01; P\u2009<\u2009.008) showed curvilinear associations with age. Other domain scores showed linear declines with increasing age based on coefficients for communication (-0.036; P\u2009=\u2009.001), social cognition (-0.10; P\u2009<\u2009.001), and mobility (-0.14; P\u2009<\u2009.001). The AIMS scores were similar to the normative sample over time (95% CI, -0.107 to 0.037; P\u2009=\u2009.34). Nineteen of 57 infants (33%) who underwent postnatal cranial ultrasonography had a nonspecific, mild finding. No difference was found in the decline of WIDEA z scores between infants with and those without cranial ultrasonography findings except for a complex interactive relationship involving the social cognition domain (P\u2009<\u2009.049). The AIMS z scores were lower in infants with nonspecific cranial ultrasonography findings (-0.49; P\u2009=\u2009.07). Conclusions and Relevance: This study found that infants with in utero ZIKV exposure without CZS appeared at risk for abnormal neurodevelopmental outcomes in the first 18 months of life. Long-term neurodevelopmental surveillance of all newborns with ZIKV exposure is recommended. ",
        "Multiscale porous elastomer substrates for multifunctional on-skin electronics with passive-cooling capabilities. In addition to mechanical compliance, achieving the full potential of on-skin electronics needs the introduction of other features. For example, substantial progress has been achieved in creating biodegradable, self-healing, or breathable, on-skin electronics. However, the research of making on-skin electronics with passive-cooling capabilities, which can reduce energy consumption and improve user comfort, is still rare. Herein, we report the development of multifunctional on-skin electronics, which can passively cool human bodies without needing any energy consumption. This property is inherited from multiscale porous polystyrene-block-poly(ethylene-ran-butylene)-block-polystyrene (SEBS) supporting substrates. The multiscale pores of SEBS substrates, with characteristic sizes ranging from around 0.2 to 7 \u00b5m, can effectively backscatter sunlight to minimize heat absorption but are too small to reflect human-body midinfrared radiation to retain heat dissipation, thereby delivering around 6 \u00b0C cooling effects under a solar intensity of 840 W\u22c5m-2 Other desired properties, rooted in multiscale porous SEBS substrates, include high breathability and outstanding waterproofing. The proof-of-concept bioelectronic devices include electrophysiological sensors, temperature sensors, hydration sensors, pressure sensors, and electrical stimulators, which are made via spray printing of silver nanowires on multiscale porous SEBS substrates. The devices show comparable electrical performances with conventional, rigid, nonporous ones. Also, their applications in cuffless blood pressure measurement, interactive virtual reality, and human-machine interface are demonstrated. Notably, the enabled on-skin devices are dissolvable in several organic solvents and can be recycled to reduce electronic waste and manufacturing cost. Such on-skin electronics can serve as the basis for future multifunctional smart textiles with passive-cooling functionalities. ",
        "Genetic architecture of subcortical brain structures in 38,851 individuals. Subcortical brain structures are integral to motion, consciousness, emotions and learning. We identified common genetic variation related to the volumes of the nucleus accumbens, amygdala, brainstem, caudate nucleus, globus pallidus, putamen and thalamus, using genome-wide association analyses in almost 40,000 individuals from CHARGE, ENIGMA and UK Biobank. We show that variability in subcortical volumes is heritable, and identify 48 significantly associated loci (40 novel at the time of analysis). Annotation of these loci by utilizing gene expression, methylation and neuropathological data identified 199 genes putatively implicated in neurodevelopment, synaptic signaling, axonal transport, apoptosis, inflammation/infection and susceptibility to neurological disorders. This set of genes is significantly enriched for Drosophila orthologs associated with neurodevelopmental phenotypes, suggesting evolutionarily conserved mechanisms. Our findings uncover novel biology and potential drug targets underlying brain development and disease. ",
        "Uterine balloon tamponade for the treatment of postpartum hemorrhage: a systematic review and meta-analysis. OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy, effectiveness, and safety of uterine balloon tamponade for treating postpartum hemorrhage. STUDY DESIGN: We searched electronic databases (from their inception to August 2019) and bibliographies. We included randomized controlled trials, nonrandomized studies, and case series that reported on the efficacy, effectiveness, and/or safety of uterine balloon tamponade in women with postpartum hemorrhage. The primary outcome was the success rate of uterine balloon tamponade for treating postpartum hemorrhage (number of uterine balloon tamponade success cases/total number of women treated with uterine balloon tamponade). For meta-analyses, we calculated pooled success rate for all studies, and relative risk with 95% confidence intervals for studies that included a comparative arm. RESULTS: Ninety-one studies, including 4729 women, met inclusion criteria (6 randomized trials, 1 cluster randomized trial, 15 nonrandomized studies, and 69 case series). The overall pooled uterine balloon tamponade success rate was 85.9% (95% confidence interval, 83.9-87.9%). The highest success rates corresponded to uterine atony (87.1%) and placenta previa (86.8%), and the lowest to placenta accreta spectrum (66.7%) and retained products of conception (76.8%). The uterine balloon tamponade success rate was lower in cesarean deliveries (81.7%) than in vaginal deliveries (87.0%). A meta-analysis of 2 randomized trials that compared uterine balloon tamponade vs no uterine balloon tamponade in postpartum hemorrhage due to uterine atony after vaginal delivery showed no significant differences between the study groups in the risk of surgical interventions or maternal death (relative risk, 0.59; 95% confidence interval, 0.02-16.69). A meta-analysis of 2 nonrandomized before-and-after studies showed that introduction of uterine balloon tamponade in protocols for managing severe postpartum hemorrhage significantly decreased the use of arterial embolization (relative risk, 0.29; 95% confidence interval, 0.14-0.63). A nonrandomized cluster study reported that use of invasive procedures was significantly lower in the perinatal network that routinely used uterine balloon tamponade than that which did not use uterine balloon tamponade (3.0/1000 vs 5.1/1000; P < .01). A cluster randomized trial reported that the frequency of postpartum hemorrhage-related invasive procedures and/or maternal death was significantly higher after uterine balloon tamponade introduction than before uterine balloon tamponade introduction (11.6/10,000 vs 6.7/10,000; P\u00a0= .04). Overall, the frequency of complications attributed to uterine balloon tamponade use was low (\u22646.5%). CONCLUSION: Uterine balloon tamponade has a high success rate for treating severe postpartum hemorrhage and appears to be safe. The evidence on uterine balloon tamponade efficacy and effectiveness from randomized and nonrandomized studies is conflicting, with experimental studies suggesting no beneficial effect, in contrast with observational studies. Further research is needed to determine the most effective programmatic and healthcare delivery strategies on uterine balloon tamponade introduction and use. ",
        "Association of Childhood Exposure to Nitrogen Dioxide and Polygenic Risk Score for Schizophrenia With the Risk of Developing Schizophrenia. Importance: Schizophrenia is a highly heritable psychiatric disorder, and recent studies have suggested that exposure to nitrogen dioxide (NO2) during childhood is associated with an elevated risk of subsequently developing schizophrenia. However, it is not known whether the increased risk associated with NO2 exposure is owing to a greater genetic liability among those exposed to highest NO2 levels. Objective: To examine the associations between childhood NO2 exposure and genetic liability for schizophrenia (as measured by a polygenic risk score), and risk of developing schizophrenia. Design, Setting, and Participants: Population-based cohort study including individuals with schizophrenia (International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision code F20) and a randomly selected subcohort. Using national registry data, all individuals born in Denmark between May 1, 1981, and December 31, 2002, were followed up from their 10th birthday until the first occurrence of schizophrenia, emigration, death, or December 31, 2012, whichever came first. Statistical analyses were conducted between October 24, 2018, and June 17, 2019. Exposures: Individual exposure to NO2 during childhood estimated as mean daily exposure to NO2 at residential addresses from birth to the 10th birthday. Polygenic risk scores were calculated as the weighted sum of risk alleles at selected single-nucleotide polymorphisms based on genetic material obtained from dried blood spot samples from the Danish Newborn Screening Biobank and on the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium genome-wide association study summary statistics file. Main Outcomes and Measures: The main outcome was schizophrenia. Weighted Cox proportional hazards regression models were fitted to estimate adjusted hazard ratios (AHRs) for schizophrenia with 95% CIs according to the exposures. Results: Of a total of 23\u202f355 individuals, 11\u202f976 (51.3%) were male and all had Danish-born parents. During the period of the study, 3531 were diagnosed with schizophrenia. Higher polygenic risk scores were correlated with higher childhood NO2 exposure (\u03c1\u2009=\u20090.0782; 95% CI, 0.065-0.091; P\u2009<\u2009.001). A 10-\u03bcg/m3 increase in childhood daily NO2 exposure (AHR, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.15-1.32) and a 1-SD increase in polygenic risk score (AHR, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.23-1.35) were independently associated with increased schizophrenia risk. Conclusions and Relevance: These findings suggest that the apparent association between NO2 exposure and schizophrenia is only slightly confounded by a higher polygenic risk score for schizophrenia among individuals living in areas with greater NO2. The findings demonstrate the utility of including polygenic risk scores in epidemiologic studies. ",
        "Effects of a Computerized Training on Attentional Capacity of Young Soccer Players. The purpose of this work was to analyze the effects of a computerized training on attentional capacity in a group of young soccer players. Seventy-five male adolescents from two soccer clubs in the city of Malaga (Spain) and aged between 14 and 18 (15.45 \u00b1 1.43 years) participated in the investigation. A quasi-experimental design was used, and the adolescents were divided into control (n = 38) and experimental (n = 37) groups. The experimental group underwent a computerized training (Rejilla 1.0) of their attention during 9 weeks and 27 sessions. In addition, the D2 attention test was used to analyze the evolution of participants after the intervention program. The results showed positive effects of the computerized intervention program on selective attention, observing changes both in the executions of the software used (p < 0.001, Cohen's d = 1.58, 95% CI [1.06, 2.11]) and in the main measures of the D2 test, total effectiveness (p < 0.001, Cohen's d = 0.62, 95% CI [0.15, 1.08]) and concentration (p < 0.01, Cohen's d = 0.48, 95% CI [0.02, 0.94]).

        "Gastric squamous-columnar junction contains a large pool of cancer-prone immature osteopontin responsive Lgr5-CD44+ cells. Areas of a junction between two types of epithelia are known to be cancer-prone in many organ systems. However, mechanisms for preferential malignant transformation at the junction areas remain insufficiently elucidated. Here we report that inactivation of tumor suppressor genes Trp53 and Rb1 in the gastric squamous-columnar junction (SCJ) epithelium results in preferential formation of metastatic poorly differentiated neoplasms, which are similar to human gastroesophageal carcinoma. Unlike transformation-resistant antral cells, SCJ cells contain a highly proliferative pool of immature Lgr5-CD44+ cells, which are prone to transformation in organoid assays, comprise early dysplastic lesions, and constitute up to 30% of all neoplastic cells. CD44 ligand osteopontin (OPN) is preferentially expressed in and promotes organoid formation ability and transformation of the SCJ glandular epithelium. OPN and CD44 overexpression correlate with the worst prognosis of human gastroesophageal carcinoma. Thus, detection and selective targeting of the\u00a0active OPN-CD44 pathway may have direct clinical relevance. ",
        "Intracranial Pressure Monitoring via External Ventricular Drain: Are We Waiting Long Enough Before Recording the Real Value?. BACKGROUND: External ventricular drain (EVD) is a standard approach for both monitoring intracranial pressure (ICP) and draining cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) for patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage. Documenting an accurate ICP value is important to assess the status of the brain, which would require the EVD system to be leveled properly and closed to CSF drainage for an adequate period. It is suggested that a minimum period of 5-minute EVD closure is needed before documenting a true ICP; however, there is no commonly agreed upon standard for documenting ICP. To obtain an insight into how well the intermittent EVD clamping procedure is performed for ICP documentation, we conducted a retrospective analysis of ICP recordings obtained through EVD from 107 patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage. METHODS: The EVD was kept open for continuous CSF drainage and then intermittently closed for ICP documentation. For each EVD closure, mean ICP, standard deviation of ICP, duration of EVD closure, and time interval between 2 adjacent EVD closures were studied. The total number of EVD closures was calculated for each patient. We developed an algorithm to evaluate whether ICP reached a new equilibrium before the EVD was reopened to drainage. The percentage of EVD closures that reach the equilibrium was calculated. RESULTS: The 107 patients had 32 755 EVD closures in total, among which 65.9% instances lasted less than 1 minute and only 16.3% of all the EVD closure episodes lasted longer than 5 minutes. The median duration of each EVD closure was 25 seconds (interquartile range, 10.2 seconds to 2.33 minutes). Only 22.9% of the EVD closures reached ICP equilibrium before EVD reopening. CONCLUSION: A standard guideline and proper training are needed for bedside nurses, and a potential tool that can render ICP trend at a proper scale at bedside would help clinicians correctly document ICP.

        "A Selective Ligand for Estrogen Receptor Proteins Discriminates Rapid and Genomic Signaling. Estrogen exerts extensive and diverse effects throughout the body of women. In addition to the classical nuclear estrogen receptors (ER\u03b1 and ER\u03b2), the G protein-coupled estrogen receptor GPER is an important mediator of estrogen action. Existing ER-targeted therapeutic agents act as GPER agonists. Here, we report the identification of a small molecule, named AB-1, with the previously unidentified activity of high selectivity for binding classical ERs over GPER. AB-1 also possesses a unique functional activity profile as an agonist of transcriptional activity but an antagonist of rapid signaling through ER\u03b1. Our results define a class of small molecules that discriminate between the classical ERs and GPER, as well as between modes of signaling within the classical ERs. Such an activity profile, if developed into an ER antagonist, could represent an opportunity for the development of first-in-class nuclear hormone receptor-targeted therapeutics for breast cancer exhibiting reduced acquired and de novo resistance.

        "Single cell sequencing of radial glia progeny reveals the diversity of newborn neurons in the adult zebrafish brain. Zebrafish display widespread and pronounced adult neurogenesis, which is fundamental for their regeneration capability after central nervous system injury. However, the cellular identity and the biological properties of adult newborn neurons are elusive for most brain areas. Here, we have used short-term lineage tracing of radial glia progeny to prospectively isolate newborn neurons from the her4.1+ radial glia lineage in the homeostatic adult forebrain. Transcriptome analysis of radial glia, newborn neurons and mature neurons using single cell sequencing identified distinct transcriptional profiles, including novel markers for each population. Specifically, we detected two separate newborn neuron types, which showed diversity of cell fate commitment and location. Further analyses showed that these cell types are homologous to neurogenic cells in the mammalian brain, identified neurogenic commitment in proliferating radial glia and indicated that glutamatergic projection neurons are generated in the adult zebrafish telencephalon. Thus, we prospectively isolated adult newborn neurons from the adult zebrafish forebrain, identified markers for newborn and mature neurons in the adult brain, and revealed intrinsic heterogeneity among adult newborn neurons and their homology with mammalian adult neurogenic cell types.

        "Evaluation of the Extended-Release/Long-Acting Opioid Prescribing Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy Program by the US Food and Drug Administration: A Review. Importance: Extended-release/long-acting (ER/LA) opioids have caused substantial morbidity and mortality in the United States, yet little is known about the efforts of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and drug manufacturers to reduce adverse outcomes associated with inappropriate prescribing or use. This review of 9739 pages of FDA documents obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request aimed to investigate whether the FDA and ER/LA manufacturers were able to assess the effectiveness of the ER/LA Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) program by evaluating manufacturer REMS assessments and FDA oversight of these assessments. Observations: The REMS program was implemented largely as planned. The FDA's goal was for 60% of ER/LA prescribers to take REMS-adherent continuing education (CE) between 2012 and 2016; 27.6% (88\u202f316 of 320\u202f000) of prescribers had done so by 2016. Audits of REMS programs indicated close adherence to FDA content guidelines except for financial disclosures. Nonrepresentative cross-sectional surveys of self-selected prescribers suggested modestly greater ER/LA knowledge among CE completers than noncompleters, and claims-based surveillance indicated slowly declining ER/LA prescribing, although the contribution of the REMS to these trends could not be assessed. The effectiveness of the REMS program for reducing adverse outcomes also could not be assessed because the analyses used nonrepresentative samples, lacked adequate controls for confounding, and did not link prescribing or clinical outcomes to prescribers' receipt of CE training. Although the FDA had requested studies tracking adverse outcomes as a function of CE training, the FDA concluded that these studies had not been performed as of the 60-month report in 2017. Conclusions and Relevance: Five years after initiation, the FDA and ER/LA manufacturers could not conclude whether the ER/LA REMS had reduced inappropriate prescribing or improved patient outcomes. Alternative observational study designs would have allowed for more rigorous estimates of the program's effectiveness. ",
        "Genetic Discrimination Between LADA and Childhood-Onset Type 1 Diabetes Within the MHC. OBJECTIVE: The MHC region harbors the strongest loci for latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA); however, the strength of association is likely attenuated compared with that for childhood-onset type 1 diabetes. In this study, we recapitulate independent effects in the MHC class I region in a population with type 1 diabetes and then determine whether such conditioning in LADA yields potential genetic discriminators between the two subtypes within this region. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Chromosome 6 was imputed using SNP2HLA, with conditional analysis performed in type 1 diabetes case subjects (n = 1,985) and control subjects (n = 2,219). The same approach was applied to a LADA cohort (n = 1,428) using population-based control subjects (n = 2,850) and in a separate replication cohort (656 type 1 diabetes case, 823 LADA case, and 3,218 control subjects). RESULTS: The strongest associations in the MHC class II region (rs3957146, \u03b2 [SE] = 1.44 [0.05]), as well as the independent effect of MHC class I genes, on type 1 diabetes risk, particularly HLA-B*39 (\u03b2 [SE] = 1.36 [0.17]), were confirmed. The conditional analysis in LADA versus control subjects showed significant association in the MHC class II region (rs3957146, \u03b2 [SE] = 1.14 [0.06]); however, we did not observe significant independent effects of MHC class I alleles in LADA. CONCLUSIONS: In LADA, the independent effects of MHC class I observed in type 1 diabetes were not observed after conditioning on the leading MHC class II associations, suggesting that the MHC class I association may be a genetic discriminator between LADA and childhood-onset type 1 diabetes.

        "Attacks on genetic privacy via uploads to genealogical databases. Direct-to-consumer (DTC) genetics services are increasingly popular, with tens of millions of customers. Several DTC genealogy services allow users to upload genetic data to search for relatives, identified as people with genomes that share identical by state (IBS) regions. Here, we describe methods by which an adversary can learn database genotypes by uploading multiple datasets. For example, an adversary who uploads approximately 900 genomes could recover at least one allele at SNP sites across up to 82% of the genome of a median person of European ancestries. In databases that detect IBS segments using unphased genotypes, approximately 100 falsified uploads can reveal enough genetic information to allow genome-wide genetic imputation. We provide a proof-of-concept demonstration in the GEDmatch database, and we suggest countermeasures that will prevent the exploits we describe. ",
        "Neutrophil extracellular traps drive inflammatory pathogenesis in malaria. Neutrophils are essential innate immune cells that extrude chromatin in the form of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) when they die. This form of cell death has potent immunostimulatory activity. We show that heme-induced NETs are essential for malaria pathogenesis. Using patient samples and a mouse model, we define two mechanisms of NET-mediated inflammation of the vasculature: activation of emergency granulopoiesis via granulocyte colony-stimulating factor production and induction of the endothelial cytoadhesion receptor intercellular adhesion molecule-1. Soluble NET components facilitate parasite sequestration and mediate tissue destruction. We demonstrate that neutrophils have a key role in malaria immunopathology and propose inhibition of NETs as a treatment strategy in vascular infections. ",
        "Regulatory T Cells Restrain Interleukin-2- and Blimp-1-Dependent Acquisition of Cytotoxic Function by CD4+ T Cells. In addition to helper and regulatory potential, CD4+ T\u00a0cells also acquire cytotoxic activity marked by granzyme B (GzmB) expression and the ability to promote rejection of established tumors. Here, we examined the molecular and cellular mechanisms underpinning the differentiation of cytotoxic CD4+ T\u00a0cells following immunotherapy. CD4+ transfer into lymphodepleted animals or regulatory T (Treg) cell depletion promoted GzmB expression by tumor-infiltrating CD4+, and this was prevented by interleukin-2 (IL-2) neutralization. Transcriptional analysis revealed a polyfunctional helper and cytotoxic phenotype characterized by the expression of the transcription factors T-bet and Blimp-1. While T-bet ablation restricted interferon-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3) production, loss of Blimp-1 prevented GzmB expression in response to IL-2, suggesting two independent programs required for polyfunctionality of tumor-reactive CD4+ T\u00a0cells. Our findings underscore the role of Treg cells, IL-2, and Blimp-1 in controlling the differentiation of cytotoxic CD4+ T\u00a0cells and offer a pathway to enhancement of anti-tumor activity through their manipulation.

        "Relaxin reverses maladaptive remodeling of the aged heart through Wnt-signaling. Healthy aging results in cardiac structural and electrical remodeling that increases susceptibility to cardiovascular diseases. Relaxin, an insulin-like hormone, suppresses atrial fibrillation, inflammation and fibrosis in aged rats but the mechanisms-of-action are unknown. Here we show that relaxin treatment of aged rats reverses pathological electrical remodeling (increasing Nav1.5 expression and localization of Connexin43 to intercalated disks) by activating canonical Wnt signaling. In isolated adult ventricular myocytes, relaxin upregulated Nav1.5 (EC50\u2009=\u20091.3\u2009nM) by a mechanism inhibited by the addition of Dickkopf-1. Furthermore, relaxin increased the levels of connexin43, Wnt1, and cytosolic and nuclear \u03b2-catenin. Treatment with Wnt1 or CHIR-99021 (a GSK3\u03b2 inhibitor) mimicked the relaxin effects. In isolated fibroblasts, relaxin blocked TGF\u03b2-induced collagen elevation in a Wnt dependent manner. These findings demonstrate a close interplay between relaxin and Wnt-signaling resulting in myocardial remodeling and reveals a fundamental mechanism of great therapeutic potential. ",
        "Single-muscle fiber contractile properties in lifelong aerobic exercising women. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of lifelong aerobic exercise on single-muscle fiber performance in trained women (LLE; n = 7, 72\u2009\u00b1\u20092 yr) by comparing them to old healthy nonexercisers (OH; n = 10, 75\u2009\u00b1\u20091 yr) and young exercisers (YE; n = 10, 25\u2009\u00b1\u20091 yr). On average, LLE had exercised ~5 days/wk for ~7 h/wk over the past 48\u2009\u00b1\u20092 yr. Each subject had a vastus lateralis muscle biopsy to examine myosin heavy chain (MHC) I and IIa single-muscle fiber size and function (strength, speed, power). MHC I fiber size was similar across all three cohorts (YE\u2009=\u20095,178\u2009\u00b1\u2009157, LLE\u2009=\u20094,983\u2009\u00b1\u2009184, OH\u2009=\u20094,902\u2009\u00b1\u2009159 \u00b5m2). MHC IIa fiber size decreased (P < 0.05) 36% with aging (YE\u2009=\u20094,719\u2009\u00b1\u2009164 vs. OH\u2009=\u20093,031\u2009\u00b1\u2009153 \u00b5m2), with LLE showing a similar 31% reduction (3,253\u2009\u00b1\u2009189 \u00b5m2). LLE had 17% more powerful (P < 0.05) MHC I fibers and offset the 18% decline in MHC IIa fiber power observed with aging (P < 0.05). The LLE contractile power was driven by greater strength (+11%, P = 0.056) in MHC I fibers and elevated contractile speed (+12%, P < 0.05) in MHC IIa fibers. These data indicate that lifelong exercise did not benefit MHC I or IIa muscle fiber size. However, LLE had contractile function adaptations that enhanced MHC I fiber power and preserved MHC IIa fiber power through different contractile mechanisms (strength vs. speed). The single-muscle fiber contractile properties observed with lifelong aerobic exercise are unique and provide new insights into aging skeletal muscle plasticity in women at the myocellular level.NEW & NOTEWORTHY This is the first investigation to examine the effects of lifelong exercise on single-muscle fiber physiology in women. Nearly 50 yr of moderate to vigorous aerobic exercise training resulted in enhanced slow-twitch fiber power primarily by increasing force production, whereas fast-twitch fiber power was preserved primarily by increasing contractile speed. These unique muscle fiber power profiles helped offset the effects of fast-twitch fiber atrophy and highlight the benefits of lifelong aerobic exercise for myocellular health. ",
        "Fine-mapping of 150 breast cancer risk regions identifies 191 likely target genes. Genome-wide association studies have identified breast cancer risk variants in over 150 genomic regions, but the mechanisms underlying risk remain largely unknown. These regions were explored by combining association analysis with in silico genomic feature annotations. We defined 205 independent risk-associated signals with the set of credible causal variants in each one. In parallel, we used a Bayesian approach (PAINTOR) that combines genetic association, linkage disequilibrium and enriched genomic features to determine variants with high posterior probabilities of being causal. Potentially causal variants were significantly over-represented in active gene regulatory regions and transcription factor binding sites. We applied our INQUSIT pipeline for prioritizing genes as targets of those potentially causal variants, using gene expression (expression quantitative trait loci), chromatin interaction and functional annotations. Known cancer drivers, transcription factors and genes in the developmental, apoptosis, immune system and DNA integrity checkpoint gene ontology pathways were over-represented among the highest-confidence target genes.

        "Systemic Safety of a Recombinant AAV8 Vector for Human Cocaine Hydrolase Gene Therapy: A Good Laboratory Practice Preclinical Study in Mice. Cocaine addiction continues to impose major burdens on affected individuals and broader society but is highly resistant to medical treatment or psychotherapy. This study was undertaken with the goal of Food and Drug Administration (FDA) permission for a first-in-human clinical trial of a gene therapy for treatment-seeking cocaine users to become and remain abstinent. The approach was based on intravenous administration of AAV8-hCocH, an adeno-associated viral vector encoding a modified plasma enzyme that metabolizes cocaine into harmless by-products. To assess systemic safety, we conducted \"Good Laboratory Practice\" (GLP) studies in cocaine-experienced and cocaine-naive mice at doses of 5E12 and 5E13 vector genomes/kg. Results showed total lack of viral vector-related adverse effects in all tests performed. Instead, mice given one injection of AAV8-hCocH and regular daily injections of cocaine had far less tissue pathology than cocaine-injected mice with no vector treatment. Biodistribution analysis showed the vector located almost exclusively in the liver. These results indicate that a liver-directed AAV8-hCocH gene transfer at reasonable dosage is safe, well tolerated, and effective. Thus, gene transfer therapy emerges as a radically new approach to treat compulsive cocaine abuse. In fact, based on these positive findings, the FDA recently accepted our latest request for investigational new drug application (IND 18579). ",
        "Effects Of Medicaid Expansion On Postpartum Coverage And Outpatient Utilization. Timely postpartum care is associated with lower maternal morbidity and mortality, yet fewer than half of Medicaid beneficiaries attend a postpartum visit. Medicaid enrollees are at higher risk of postpartum disruptions in insurance because pregnancy-related Medicaid eligibility ends sixty days after delivery. We used Medicaid claims data for 2013-15 from Colorado, which expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, and Utah, which did not. We found that after expansion, new mothers in Utah experienced higher rates of Medicaid coverage loss and accessed fewer Medicaid-financed outpatient visits during the six months postpartum, relative to their counterparts in Colorado. The effects of Medicaid expansion on postpartum Medicaid enrollment and outpatient utilization were largest among women who experienced significant maternal morbidity at delivery. These findings provide evidence that expansion may promote the stability of postpartum coverage and increase the use of postpartum outpatient care in the Medicaid program. ",
        "Predictors of episodic migraine transformation to chronic migraine: A systematic review and meta-analysis of observational cohort studies. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: An estimated 2.5-3.1% of people with episodic migraine develop chronic migraine in a year. Several risk factors are associated with an increased risk for this transformation. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to provide quantitative and qualitative data on predictors of this transformation. METHODS: An electronic search was conducted for published, prospective, cohort studies that reported risk factors for chronic migraine among people with episodic migraine. Risk of bias was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale. Quality of evidence was determined according to the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) guidelines. Effect estimates were retrieved and summarized using risk ratios. RESULTS: Of 5695 identified publications, 11 were eligible for inclusion. The pooled analysis (GRADE system) found \"high\" evidence for monthly headache day frequency\u2009\u2265\u200910 (risk ratio\u2009=\u20095.95), \"moderate\" evidence for depression (risk ratio\u2009=\u20091.58), monthly headache day frequency\u2009\u2265\u20095 (risk ratio\u2009=\u20093.18), and annual household income\u2009\u2265\u2009$50,000 (risk ratio\u2009=\u20090.65) and \"very low\" evidence for allodynia (risk ratio\u2009=\u20091.40) and medication overuse (risk ratio\u2009=\u20098.82) in predicting progression to chronic migraine. CONCLUSIONS: High frequency episodic migraine and depression have high quality evidence as predictors of the transformation from episodic migraine to chronic migraine, while annual household income over $50,000 may be protective.

        "Naloxone Administration by Untrained Community Members. STUDY OBJECTIVE: Access to naloxone is a priority for reducing opioid deaths. Although community members who complete naloxone training are able to administer nasal naloxone successfully and rapidly, little is known about the ability of community members to administer naloxone without training. The objective of this study was to assess the ability of untrained individuals to administer naloxone successfully in a simulated opioid overdose setting. DESIGN: Prospective single-site open-label randomized usability assessment. SETTING: Scenario station at a large state fair during August and September 2017. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 207 healthy adults who were randomly assigned to administer naloxone using a nasal spray (NS) device (69 participants), an intramuscular (IM) kit (68 participants), or an improvised nasal atomizer (AT) kit (70 participants). INTERVENTION: Participants were instructed to administer the device to a high-fidelity mannequin in a public environment with distractions to mimic those that might be present in an actual overdose. No device instructions or administration materials were provided. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Participants were assessed by trained study team members who directly observed all naloxone administrations using the predetermined end-point criteria. Individual participant perceptions were evaluated immediately following the naloxone administration using a standardized questionnaire form. The primary outcome was successful administration, defined as administration within 7\u00a0minutes and without critical errors. Secondary outcomes were time to successful naloxone administration and ease of use of the device. The NS (66.7%, p<0.001) and IM (51.5%, p<0.001) devices had higher rates of successful administration than the improvised nasal AT device (2.9%). The NS device was administered more rapidly (median 16\u00a0sec) than the IM device (median 58\u00a0sec, p<0.001) or improvised nasal AT device (median 113\u00a0sec, p=0.012) devices, and it was the easiest to use. CONCLUSION: In this study of naloxone administration, participants administered the NS and IM devices more successfully than the AT device. The NS device was administered most rapidly and was easiest to use. ",
        "Ado-trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) in patients with HER2-amplified tumors excluding breast and gastric/gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinomas: results from the NCI-MATCH trial (EAY131) subprotocol Q. BACKGROUND: The National Cancer Institute-Molecular Analysis for Therapy Choice (NCI-MATCH) is a national precision medicine study incorporating centralized genomic testing to direct refractory cancer patients to molecularly targeted treatment subprotocols. This treatment subprotocol was designed to screen for potential signals of efficacy of ado-trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) in HER2-amplified histologies other than breast and gastroesophageal tumors. METHODS: Eligible patients had HER2 amplification at a copy number (CN) >7 based on targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) with a custom Oncomine AmpliSeq\u2122 (ThermoFisher Scientific) panel. Patients with prior trastuzumab, pertuzumab or T-DM1 treatment were excluded. Patients received T-DM1 at 3.6\u2009mg/kg i.v. every 3\u2009weeks until toxicity or disease progression. Tumor assessments occurred every three cycles. The primary end point was centrally assessed objective response rate (ORR). Exploratory end points included correlating response with HER2 CN by NGS. The impact of co-occurring genomic alterations and PTEN loss by immunohistochemistry were also assessed. RESULTS: Thirty-eight patients were enrolled and 36 included in efficacy analysis. Median prior therapies in the metastatic setting was 3 (range 0-9; unknown in one patient). Median HER2 CN was 17 (range 7-139). Partial responses were observed in two (5.6%) patients: one mucoepidermoid carcinoma of parotid gland and one parotid gland squamous cell cancer. Seventeen patients (47%) had stable disease including 8/10 (80%) with ovarian and uterine carcinomas, with median duration of 4.6\u2009months. The 6-month progression-free survival rate was 23.6% [90% confidence interval 14.2% to 39.2%]. Common toxicities included fatigue, anemia, fever and thrombocytopenia with no new safety signals. There was a trend for tumor shrinkage with higher levels of gene CN as determined by the NGS assay. CONCLUSION: T-DM1 was well tolerated. While this subprotocol did not meet the primary end point for ORR in this heavily pre-treated diverse patient population, clinical activity was seen in salivary gland tumors warranting further study in this tumor type in dedicated trials.

        "Clinically Actionable Insights into Initial and Matched Recurrent Glioblastomas to Inform Novel Treatment Approaches. Glioblastoma is the most common primary adult brain tumour, and despite optimal treatment, the median survival is 12-15 months. Patients with matched recurrent glioblastomas were investigated to try to find actionable mutations. Tumours were profiled using a validated DNA-based gene panel. Copy number variations (CNVs) and single nucleotide variants (SNVs) were examined, and potentially pathogenic variants and clinically actionable mutations were identified. The results revealed that glioblastomas were IDH-wildtype (IDHWT; n\u2009=\u200938) and IDH-mutant (IDHMUT; n\u2009=\u20093). SNVs in TSC2, MSH6, TP53, CREBBP, and IDH1 were variants of unknown significance (VUS) that were predicted to be pathogenic in both subtypes. IDHWT tumours had SNVs that impacted RTK/Ras/PI(3)K, p53, WNT, SHH, NOTCH, Rb, and G-protein pathways. Many tumours had BRCA1/2 (18%) variants, including confirmed somatic mutations in haemangioblastoma. IDHWT recurrent tumours had fewer pathways impacted (RTK/Ras/PI(3)K, p53, WNT, and G-protein) and CNV gains (BRCA2, GNAS, and EGFR) and losses (TERT and SMARCA4). IDHMUT tumours had SNVs that impacted RTK/Ras/PI(3)K, p53, and WNT pathways. VUS in KLK1 was possibly pathogenic in IDHMUT. Recurrent tumours also had fewer pathways (p53, WNT, and G-protein) impacted by genetic alterations. Public datasets (TCGA and GDC) confirmed the clinical significance of findings in both subtypes. Overall in this cohort, potentially actionable variation was most often identified in EGFR, PTEN, BRCA1/2, and ATM. This study underlines the need for detailed molecular profiling to identify individual GBM patients who may be eligible for novel treatment approaches. This information is also crucial for patient recruitment to clinical trials. ",
        "Reducing the metabolic rate of walking and running with a versatile, portable exosuit. Walking and running have fundamentally different biomechanics, which makes developing devices that assist both gaits challenging. We show that a portable exosuit that assists hip extension can reduce the metabolic rate of treadmill walking at 1.5 meters per second by 9.3% and that of running at 2.5 meters per second by 4.0% compared with locomotion without the exosuit. These reduction magnitudes are comparable to the effects of taking off 7.4 and 5.7 kilograms during walking and running, respectively, and are in a range that has shown meaningful athletic performance changes. The exosuit automatically switches between actuation profiles for both gaits, on the basis of estimated potential energy fluctuations of the wearer's center of mass. Single-participant experiments show that it is possible to reduce metabolic rates of different running speeds and uphill walking, further demonstrating the exosuit's versatility. ",
        "Suppression of FOXM1 activities and breast cancer growth in vitro and in vivo by a new class of compounds. The transcription factor FOXM1 is upregulated and overexpressed in aggressive, therapy-resistant forms of hormone receptor-positive and triple negative breast cancers, and is associated with less good patient survival. FOXM1 signaling is also a key driver in many other cancers. Here, we identify a new class of compounds effective in suppressing FOXM1 activity in breast cancers, and displaying good potency for antitumor efficacy. The compounds bind directly to FOXM1 and alter its proteolytic sensitivity, reduce the cellular level of FOXM1 protein by a proteasome- dependent process, and suppress breast cancer cell proliferation and cell cycle progression and increase apoptosis. RNA-seq and gene set enrichment analyses indicate that the compounds decrease expression of FOXM1-regulated genes and suppress gene ontologies under FOXM1 regulation. Several compounds have favorable pharmacokinetic properties and show good tumor suppression in preclinical breast tumor models. These compounds may be suitable for further clinical evaluation in targeting aggressive breast cancers driven by FOXM1. ",
        "Red orange and lemon extract prevents the renal toxicity induced by ochratoxin A in rats. In this work, we investigated the effects of red orange and lemon extract (RLE) on ochratoxin A (OTA)-induced nephrotoxicity. In particular, we analyzed the change in renal function and oxidative stress in Sprague-Dawley rats treated with OTA (0.5\u2009mg/kg body weight, b.w.) and with RLE (90\u2009mg/kg b.w.) by oral administration. After OTA treatment, we found alterations of biochemical and oxidative stress parameters in the kidney, related to a severe decrease of glomerular filtration rate. The RLE treatment normalized the activity of antioxidant enzymes and prevented the glomerular hyperfiltration. Histopathological examinations revealed glomerular damages and kidney cortex fibrosis in OTA-rats, while we observed less severe fibrosis in OTA plus RLE group. Then, we demonstrated that oxidative stress could be the cause of OTA renal injury and that RLE reduces this effect. ",
        "El Ni\u00f1o-Southern oscillation and under-5 diarrhea in Botswana. Childhood diarrheal disease causes significant morbidity and mortality in low and middle-income countries, yet our ability to accurately predict diarrhea incidence remains limited. El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) has been shown to affect diarrhea dynamics in South America and Asia. However, understanding of its effects in sub-Saharan Africa, where the burden of under-5 diarrhea is high, remains inadequate. Here we investigate the connections between ENSO, local environmental conditions, and childhood diarrheal disease in Chobe District, Botswana. Our results demonstrate that La Ni\u00f1a conditions are associated with cooler temperatures, increased rainfall, and higher flooding in the Chobe region during the rainy season. In turn, La Ni\u00f1a conditions lagged 0-5 months are associated with higher than average incidence of under-5 diarrhea in the early rainy season. These findings demonstrate the potential use of ENSO as a long-lead prediction tool for childhood diarrhea in southern Africa. ",
        "Integrative discovery of treatments for high-risk neuroblastoma. Despite advances in the molecular exploration of paediatric cancers, approximately 50% of children with high-risk neuroblastoma lack effective treatment. To identify therapeutic options for this group of high-risk patients, we combine predictive data mining with experimental evaluation in patient-derived xenograft cells. Our proposed algorithm, TargetTranslator, integrates data from tumour biobanks, pharmacological databases, and cellular networks to predict how targeted interventions affect mRNA signatures associated with high patient risk or disease processes. We find more than 80 targets to be associated with neuroblastoma risk and differentiation signatures. Selected targets are evaluated in cell lines derived from high-risk patients to demonstrate reversal of risk signatures and malignant phenotypes. Using neuroblastoma xenograft models, we establish CNR2 and MAPK8 as promising candidates for the treatment of high-risk neuroblastoma. We expect that our method, available as a public tool (targettranslator.org), will enhance and expedite the discovery of risk-associated targets for paediatric and adult cancers. ",
        "Double-Layered M2e-NA Protein Nanoparticle Immunization Induces Broad Cross-Protection against Different Influenza Viruses in Mice. The development of a universal influenza vaccine is an ideal strategy to eliminate public health threats from influenza epidemics and pandemics. This ultimate goal is restricted by the low immunogenicity of conserved influenza epitopes. Layered protein nanoparticles composed of well-designed conserved influenza structures have shown improved immunogenicity with new physical and biochemical features. Herein, structure-stabilized influenza matrix protein 2 ectodomain (M2e) and M2e-neuraminidase fusion (M2e-NA) recombinant proteins are generated and M2e protein nanoparticles and double-layered M2e-NA protein nanoparticles are produced by ethanol desolvation and chemical crosslinking. Immunizations with these protein nanoparticles induce immune protection against different viruses of homologous and heterosubtypic NA in mice. Double-layered M2e-NA protein nanoparticles induce higher levels of humoral and cellular responses compared with their comprising protein mixture or M2e nanoparticles. Strong cytotoxic T cell responses are induced in the layered M2e-NA protein nanoparticle groups. Antibody responses contribute to the heterosubtypic NA immune protection. The protective immunity is long lasting. These results demonstrate that double-layered protein nanoparticles containing structure-stabilized M2e and NA can be developed into a universal influenza vaccine or a synergistic component of such vaccines. Layered protein nanoparticles can be a general vaccine platform for different pathogens. ",
        "TGFB-INHB/activin signaling regulates age-dependent autophagy and cardiac health through inhibition of MTORC2. Age-related impairment of macroautophagy/autophagy and loss of cardiac tissue homeostasis contribute significantly to cardiovascular diseases later in life. MTOR (mechanistic target of rapamycin kinase) signaling is the most well-known regulator of autophagy, cellular homeostasis, and longevity. The MTOR signaling consists of two structurally and functionally distinct multiprotein complexes, MTORC1 and MTORC2. While MTORC1 is well characterized but the role of MTORC2 in aging and autophagy remains poorly understood. Here we identified TGFB-INHB/activin signaling as a novel upstream regulator of MTORC2 to control autophagy and cardiac health during aging. Using Drosophila heart as a model system, we show that cardiac-specific knockdown of TGFB-INHB/activin-like protein daw induces autophagy and alleviates age-related heart dysfunction, including cardiac arrhythmias and bradycardia. Interestingly, the downregulation of daw activates TORC2 signaling to regulate cardiac autophagy. Activation of TORC2 alone through overexpressing its subunit protein rictor promotes autophagic flux and preserves cardiac function with aging. In contrast, activation of TORC1 does not block autophagy induction in daw knockdown flies. Lastly, either daw knockdown or rictor overexpression in fly hearts prolongs lifespan, suggesting that manipulation of these pathways in the heart has systemic effects on longevity control. Thus, our studies discover the TGFB-INHB/activin-mediated inhibition of TORC2 as a novel mechanism for age-dependent decreases in autophagic activity and cardiac health.Abbreviations: AI: arrhythmia index; BafA1: bafilomycin A1; BMP: bone morphogenetic protein; CQ: chloroquine; CVD: cardiovascular diseases; DI: diastolic interval; ER: endoplasmic reticulum; HP: heart period; HR: heart rate; MTOR: mechanistic target of rapamycin kinase; NGS: normal goat serum; PBST: PBS with 0.1% Triton X-100; PDPK1: 3-phosphoinositide dependent protein kinase 1; RICTOR: RPTOR independent companion of MTOR complex 2; ROI: region of interest; ROUT: robust regression and outlier removal; ROS: reactive oxygen species; R-SMAD: receptor-activated SMAD; SI: systolic interval; SOHA: semi-automatic optical heartbeat analysis; TGFB: transformation growth factor beta; TSC1: TSC complex subunit 1.

        "Bypassing stroke-damaged neural pathways via a neural interface induces targeted cortical adaptation. Regaining the function of an impaired limb is highly desirable in paralyzed individuals. One possible avenue to achieve this goal is to bridge the interrupted pathway between preserved neural structures and muscles using a brain-computer interface. Here, we demonstrate that monkeys with subcortical stroke were able to learn to use an artificial cortico-muscular connection (ACMC), which transforms cortical activity into electrical stimulation to the hand muscles, to regain volitional control of a paralysed hand. The ACMC induced an adaptive change of cortical activities throughout an extensive cortical area. In a targeted manner, modulating high-gamma activity became localized around an arbitrarily-selected cortical site controlling stimulation to the muscles. This adaptive change could be reset and localized rapidly to a new cortical site. Thus, the\u00a0ACMC imparts new function for muscle control to connected cortical sites and triggers cortical adaptation to regain impaired motor function after stroke. ",
        "Single-dose bNAb cocktail or abbreviated ART post-exposure regimens achieve tight SHIV control without adaptive immunity. Vertical transmission accounts for most human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in children, and treatments for newborns are needed to abrogate infection or limit disease progression. We showed previously that short-term broadly neutralizing antibody (bNAb) therapy given 24\u2009h after oral exposure cleared simian-human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV) in a macaque model of perinatal infection. Here, we report that all infants given either a single dose of bNAbs at 30\u2009h, or a 21-day triple-drug ART regimen at 48\u2009h, are aviremic with almost no virus in tissues. In contrast, bNAb treatment beginning at 48\u2009h leads to tight control without adaptive immune responses in half of animals. We conclude that both bNAbs and ART mediate effective post-exposure prophylaxis in infant macaques within 30-48\u2009h of oral SHIV exposure. Our findings suggest that optimizing the treatment regimen may extend the window of opportunity for preventing perinatal HIV infection when treatment is delayed. ",
        "Maternal effects on offspring growth indicate post-weaning juvenile dependence in chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes verus). Background: In animals with altricial offspring, most growth occurs after birth and may be optimized by post-natal maternal care. Maternal effects on growth may be influenced by individual characteristics of the mothers, such as social status, individual investment strategies and the length of association with offspring. The prolonged juvenile dependence seen in humans is a distinctive life history adaptation, which may have evolved to facilitate sustained somatic and brain growth.In chimpanzees, offspring are typically weaned at approximately 4\u2009years old, yet immature individuals continue to associate with their mothers for up to 10\u2009years beyond weaning. Whether this lengthy association or the individual characteristics of mothers influences growth patterns in this species is not clear.The relationship between urinary creatinine and specific gravity is an established non-invasive measure of muscle mass in humans and chimpanzees. We analysed the urinary creatinine and specific gravity of 1318 urine samples from 70 wild chimpanzees from the Ta\u00ef Forest, Ivory Coast aged 4 to 15\u2009years. Results: We showed a clear increase in urinary creatinine levels with age in both males and females, replicating established growth curves in this species and reaffirming this measure as a reliable proxy for lean body mass. Comparing those who experience maternal loss (orphans) with non-orphan chimpanzees, maternal presence beyond weaning age and into late juvenility positively influenced offspring muscle mass throughout ontogeny such that orphans had significantly less muscle mass than age-matched non-orphans. In age-matched offspring with mothers, those with high-ranking mothers had greater muscle mass. Accounting for variation in muscle mass attributable to maternal presence, we found no effect of maternal investment (length of inter birth interval, from own birth to birth of following sibling) on offspring muscle mass. Conclusion: Chimpanzee mothers have an extended and multi-faceted influence on offspring phenotypes. Our results suggest that maternal investment extends beyond lactation and into early adulthood and has clear benefits to offspring physical development. Therefore, prolonged juvenile dependence, although unique in its form in human societies, may be a trait with deeper evolutionary origins. ",
        "Resilience of HPV vaccine uptake in Denmark: Decline and recovery. BACKGROUND: Immunization programs' resilience to shocks is central to their success, but little empirical evidence documents resilience in action. We sought to characterize the decline of HPV vaccination in Denmark after negative media coverage and recovery during a national information campaign. METHODS: We conducted a population-based retrospective cohort study of all girls born in Denmark from 1997 to 2006 (N\u00a0=\u00a0328,779), aged 12-15. The outcome measure was HPV vaccine uptake (first dose), as reported to the Danish national health registry from 2009 to 2019, when HPV vaccine was freely available to girls in primary care clinics in Denmark. Events that created 4 natural time periods for study were HPV vaccine reaching the uptake of other vaccines in the national program (2009), some negative media coverage of HPV vaccination (2013), extensive negative media coverage (2015), and a national information campaign about the vaccine's safety and effectiveness (2017-2019). RESULTS: In the period with some negative media coverage, HPV vaccine uptake fell to 83.6% (95% CI:78.0%-89.7%) of baseline uptake. In the period with extensive negative media coverage, uptake fell even further to 49.6% (95% CI:44.5%-55.2%) of baseline uptake. After the information campaign, HPV vaccine uptake recovered to its baseline level (109.2%, 95% CI:90.1%-132.4%) due in part to catch-up doses. Despite the recovery, an estimated 26,000 fewer girls initiated the vaccine than if uptake had not declined. CONCLUSIONS: The experience in Denmark offers one of the first opportunities to document how a nation grappled with negative media coverage of HPV vaccination and the steadying impact of action by national authorities.

        "Precision delivery of RAS-inhibiting siRNA to KRAS driven cancer via peptide-based nanoparticles. Over 95% of pancreatic adenocarcinomas (PDACs), as well as a large fraction of other tumor types, such as colorectal adenocarcinoma, are driven by KRAS activation. However, no direct RAS inhibitors exist for cancer therapy. Furthermore, the delivery of therapeutic agents of any kind to PDAC in particular has been hindered by the extensive desmoplasia and resultant drug delivery challenges that accompanies these tumors. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) is a promising modality for anti-neoplastic therapy due to its precision and wide range of potential therapeutic targets. Unfortunately, siRNA therapy is limited by low serum half-life, vulnerability to intracellular digestion, and transient therapeutic effect. We assessed the ability of a peptide based, oligonucleotide condensing, endosomolytic nanoparticle (NP) system to deliver siRNA to KRAS-driven cancers. We show that this peptide-based NP is avidly taken up by cancer cells in vitro, can deliver KRAS-specific siRNA, inhibit KRAS expression, and reduce cell viability. We further demonstrate that this system can deliver siRNA to the tumor microenvironment, reduce KRAS expression, and inhibit pancreatic cancer growth in vivo. In a spontaneous KPPC model of PDAC, this system effectively delivers siRNA to stroma-rich tumors. This model has the potential for translational relevance for patients with KRAS driven solid tumors.

        "Effect of Folic Acid and Zinc Supplementation in Men on Semen Quality and Live Birth Among Couples Undergoing Infertility Treatment: A Randomized Clinical Trial. Importance: Dietary supplements marketed for male fertility commonly contain folic acid and zinc based on limited prior evidence for improving semen quality. However, no large-scale trial has examined the efficacy of this therapy for improving semen quality or live birth. Objective: To determine the effect of daily folic acid and zinc supplementation on semen quality and live birth. Design, Setting, and Participants: The Folic Acid and Zinc Supplementation Trial was a multicenter randomized clinical trial. Couples (n\u2009=\u20092370; men aged \u226518 years and women aged 18-45 years) planning infertility treatment were enrolled at 4 US reproductive endocrinology and infertility care study centers between June 2013 and December 2017. The last 6-month study visit for semen collection occurred during August 2018, with chart abstraction of live birth and pregnancy information completed during April 2019. Interventions: Men were block randomized by study center and planned infertility treatment (in vitro fertilization, other treatment at a study site, and other treatment at an outside clinic) to receive either 5 mg of folic acid and 30 mg of elemental zinc (n\u2009=\u20091185) or placebo (n\u2009=\u20091185) daily for 6 months. Main Outcomes and Measures: The co-primary outcomes were live birth (resulting from pregnancies occurring within 9 months of randomization) and semen quality parameters (sperm concentration, motility, morphology, volume, DNA fragmentation, and total motile sperm count) at 6 months after randomization. Results: Among 2370 men who were randomized (mean age, 33 years), 1773 (75%) attended the final 6-month study visit. Live birth outcomes were available for all couples, and 1629 men (69%) had semen available for analysis at 6 months after randomization. Live birth was not significantly different between treatment groups (404 [34%] in the folic acid and zinc group and 416 [35%] in the placebo group; risk difference, -0.9% [95% CI, -4.7% to 2.8%]). Most of the semen quality parameters (sperm concentration, motility, morphology, volume, and total motile sperm count) were not significantly different between treatment groups at 6 months after randomization. A statistically significant increase in DNA fragmentation was observed with folic acid and zinc supplementation (mean of 29.7% for percentage of DNA fragmentation in the folic acid and zinc group and 27.2% in the placebo group; mean difference, 2.4% [95% CI, 0.5% to 4.4%]). Gastrointestinal symptoms were more common with folic acid and zinc supplementation compared with placebo (abdominal discomfort or pain: 66 [6%] vs 40 [3%], respectively; nausea: 50 [4%] vs 24 [2%]; and vomiting: 32 [3%] vs 17 [1%]). Conclusions and Relevance: Among a general population of couples seeking infertility treatment, the use of folic acid and zinc supplementation by male partners, compared with placebo, did not significantly improve semen quality or couples' live birth rates. These findings do not support the use of folic acid and zinc supplementation by male partners in the treatment of infertility. Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01857310. ",
        "Mutations that prevent caspase cleavage of RIPK1 cause autoinflammatory disease. RIPK1 is a key regulator of innate immune signalling pathways. To ensure an optimal inflammatory response, RIPK1 is regulated post-translationally by well-characterized ubiquitylation and phosphorylation events, as well as by caspase-8-mediated cleavage1-7. The physiological relevance of this cleavage event remains unclear, although it is thought to inhibit activation of RIPK3 and necroptosis8. Here we show that the heterozygous missense mutations D324N, D324H and D324Y prevent caspase cleavage of RIPK1 in humans and result in an early-onset periodic fever syndrome and severe intermittent lymphadenopathy-a condition we term 'cleavage-resistant RIPK1-induced autoinflammatory syndrome'. To define the mechanism for this disease, we generated a cleavage-resistant Ripk1D325A mutant mouse strain. Whereas Ripk1-/- mice died postnatally from systemic inflammation, Ripk1D325A/D325A mice died during embryogenesis. Embryonic lethality was completely prevented by the combined loss of Casp8 and Ripk3, but not by loss of Ripk3 or Mlkl alone. Loss of RIPK1 kinase activity also prevented Ripk1D325A/D325A embryonic lethality, although the mice died before weaning from multi-organ inflammation in a RIPK3-dependent manner. Consistently, Ripk1D325A/D325A and Ripk1D325A/+ cells were hypersensitive to RIPK3-dependent TNF-induced apoptosis and necroptosis. Heterozygous Ripk1D325A/+ mice were viable and grossly normal, but were hyper-responsive to inflammatory stimuli in vivo. Our results demonstrate the importance of caspase-mediated RIPK1 cleavage during embryonic development and show that caspase cleavage of RIPK1 not only inhibits necroptosis but also maintains inflammatory homeostasis throughout life.

        "Nonviral polymeric nanoparticles for gene therapy in pediatric CNS malignancies. Together, medulloblastoma (MB) and atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumors (AT/RT) represent two of the most prevalent pediatric brain malignancies. Current treatment involves radiation, which has high risks of developmental sequelae for patients under the age of three. New safer and more effective treatment modalities are needed. Cancer gene therapy is a promising alternative, but there are challenges with using viruses in pediatric patients. We developed a library of poly(beta-amino ester) (PBAE) nanoparticles and evaluated their efficacy for plasmid delivery of a suicide gene therapy to pediatric brain cancer models-specifically herpes simplex virus type I thymidine kinase (HSVtk), which results in controlled apoptosis of transfected cells. In vivo, PBAE-HSVtk treated groups had a greater median overall survival in mice implanted with AT/RT (P\u202f=\u202f0.0083 vs. control) and MB (P\u202f<\u202f0.0001 vs. control). Our data provide proof of principle for using biodegradable PBAE nanoparticles as a safe and effective nanomedicine for treating pediatric CNS malignancies. ",
        "A Change Management Case Study for Safe Opioid Prescribing and Opioid Use Disorder Treatment. BACKGROUND: Given that prescribing practices have contributed to the current opioid epidemic and that primary care clinicians are the largest prescribers of opioids, family physicians must consider the twin goals of safely prescribing opioids for patients with chronic pain while effectively identifying and treating those who have developed opioid use disorder (OUD). However, family physicians may feel constrained by a culture and systems in their offices that do not support achieving these twin goals. METHODS: In a family medicine clinic within a larger academic institution that cares for an underserved, multicultural patient population in the greater Boston area, we provide a case study that illustrates the twin goals of safe opioid prescribing and treating OUD. We used 2 models of change management-Lewin's Three-Step Change Theory and the McKinsey 7S Model of Change-as a framework to describe our 5-year process of using cultural and structural elements to support these efforts. RESULTS: Deliberate use of change management theory to support both safe opioid prescribing and treating patients with OUD over the past 5 years resulted in changes to the practices, people, skills, and infrastructure within our clinic. These changes have demonstrated a sense of stability and sustainability and hence now represent our clinic's current culture. CONCLUSION: The Lewin and 7S models of change can be helpful guides to creating and maintaining a foundation of office-wide culture and structural support to meet the twin goals of safe opioid prescribing and treating patients with OUD.

        "The impact of childbirth education classes on delivery outcome. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether participating in childbirth classes is associated with pregnancy outcomes. METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted to review the medical records of all nulliparous women who participated in childbirth classes during their pregnancy and delivered in the authors' institute, between January 2014 and December 2017 (CB class group). The control group comprised nulliparous women who delivered in the same time period, but who did not participate in any education classes (Not attended CB class group). The controls were matched in a ratio of 1:1 for gestational age at delivery and neonatal birth weight. RESULTS: Overall, 159 patients were included in each group. The class group was characterized with above average income (28 [23.9%] vs 19 [16.7%]; P=0.001) and higher education level (80 [64.0%] vs 60 [45.1%]; P=0.002), higher rate of normal vaginal delivery (128 [80.5%] vs 93 [58.5%]; P<0.001), and lower rate of vacuum extraction (12 [7.5%] vs 36 [22.6%]; P<0.001) compared to the Not attended CB class group. By logistic regression analysis, after controlling for obstetrics and socioeconomic variables, participation in childbirth classes was found to be independently associated with successful normal vaginal delivery (odds ratio 2.90; 95% confidence interval 1.13-7.38; P=0.024). CONCLUSION: Participation in childbirth classes has a positive impact on pregnancy outcome. ",
        "Cystic fibrosis carriers are at increased risk for a wide range of cystic fibrosis-related conditions. Autosomal recessive diseases, such as cystic fibrosis (CF), require inheritance of 2 mutated genes. However, some studies indicate that CF carriers are at increased risk for some conditions associated with CF. These investigations focused on single conditions and included small numbers of subjects. Our goal was to determine whether CF carriers are at increased risk for a range of CF-related conditions. Using the Truven Health MarketScan Commercial Claims database (2001-2017), we performed a population-based retrospective matched-cohort study. We identified 19,802 CF carriers and matched each carrier with 5 controls. The prevalence of 59 CF-related diagnostic conditions was evaluated in each cohort. Odds ratios for each condition were computed for CF carriers relative to controls. All 59 CF-related conditions were more prevalent among carriers compared with controls, with significantly increased risk (P < 0.05) for 57 conditions. Risk was increased for some conditions previously linked to CF carriers (e.g., pancreatitis, male infertility, bronchiectasis), as well as some conditions not previously reported (e.g., diabetes, constipation, cholelithiasis, short stature, failure to thrive). We compared our results with 23,557 subjects with CF, who were also matched with controls; as the relative odds of a given condition increased among subjects with CF, so did the corresponding relative odds for carriers (P < 0.001). Although individual-level risk remained low for most conditions, because there are more than 10 million carriers in the US, population-level morbidity attributable to the CF carrier state is likely substantial. Genetic testing may inform prevention, diagnosis, and treatment for a broad range of CF carrier-related conditions. ",
        "Hospital-diagnosed overweight and obesity related to cancer risk: a 40-year Danish cohort study. BACKGROUND: Obesity is associated with metabolic abnormalities that predispose patients to increased cancer risk. Contemporary data on the long-term risk of specific cancers are sparse among patients with hospital-diagnosed overweight and obesity. OBJECTIVES: To examine the overall cancer incidence and specific site-related cancer incidences among patients with overweight and obesity, compared to the general Danish population. METHODS: For this 40-year (1977-2016), nationwide, Danish cohort study, we reviewed medical databases to identify individuals with hospital-based overweight and obesity diagnoses. We computed age- and gender-standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) for subsequent cancer compared to the general population. RESULTS: We observed 20\u00a0706 cancers among 313\u00a0321 patients diagnosed with overweight and obesity (median age 43\u00a0years; median follow-up 6.7\u00a0years, range 1-40\u00a0years) compared to the 18\u00a0480 cancers expected; thus, the SIR was 1.12 [95% confidence interval (95% CI): 1.11-1.14]. The SIR associated with overweight and obesity was increased with concomitant comorbidities, like type 2 diabetes (SIR: 1.18; 95% CI: 1.13-1.23) and alcoholism-related diseases (SIR: 1.62; 95% CI: 1.45-1.82). The SIR was 1.31 (95% CI: 1.28-1.34) for cancers previously identified as obesity-related, including pancreatic (SIR: 1.38; 95% CI; 1.27-1.49) and postmenopausal breast cancer (SIR: 1.14; 95% CI: 1.09-1.19). Obesity/overweight status also elevated the SIRs for haematological (SIR: 1.24; 95% CI: 1.18-1.29) and neurological cancers (SIR: 1.19; 95% CI: 1.11-1.27]. In contrast, SIRs were 1.01 (95% CI: 0.97-1.05) for immune-related cancers, 0.88 (95% CI: 0.82-0.95) for malignant melanoma, and 0.88 (95% CI: 0.85-0.92) for hormone-related cancers, other than postmenopausal breast cancer. CONCLUSION: In this large cohort study, overweight and obesity was associated with increased risk of several common cancers. ",
        "Extremely Low Concentrations of Acetic Acid Stimulate Cell Differentiation in Rice Blast Fungus. Metabolic switching and rewiring play a dynamic role in programmed cell differentiation. Many pathogenic microbes need to survive in nutrient-deficient conditions and use the glyoxylate cycle, an anaplerotic pathway of the tricarboxylic acid cycle, to produce carbohydrates. The plant pathogenic fungus Magnaporthe oryzae (Pyricularia oryzae) has a unique chitin deacetylase, Cbp1. The spatiotemporal activity of this protein is required for modification of the M.\u00a0oryzae wall and for cell differentiation into the specialized infection structure (appressorium). Here we show that acetic acid, another product released by the Cbp1-catalyzed conversion of chitin into chitosan, induces appressorium formation. An extremely low concentration (fM) of acetic acid restored cell differentiation in a \u0394cbp1 mutant possibly through the glyoxylate cycle. ",
        "Elucidating molecular interactions of L-nucleotides with HIV-1 reverse transcriptase and mechanism of M184V-caused drug resistance. Emtricitabine (FTC) and lamivudine (3TC), containing an oxathiolane ring with unnatural (-)-stereochemistry, are widely used nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) in anti-HIV therapy. Treatment with FTC or 3TC primarily selects for the HIV-1 RT M184V/I resistance mutations. Here we provide a comprehensive kinetic and structural basis for inhibiting HIV-1 RT by (-)-FTC-TP and (-)-3TC-TP and drug resistance by M184V. (-)-FTC-TP and (-)-3TC-TP have higher binding affinities (1/Kd) for wild-type RT but slower incorporation rates than dCTP. HIV-1 RT ternary crystal structures with (-)-FTC-TP and (-)-3TC-TP corroborate kinetic results demonstrating that their oxathiolane sulfur orients toward the DNA primer 3'-terminus and their triphosphate exists in two different binding conformations. M184V RT displays greater (>200-fold) Kd for the L-nucleotides and moderately higher (>9-fold) K.                         d.                      for the D-isomers compared to dCTP. The M184V RT structure illustrates how the mutation repositions the oxathiolane of (-)-FTC-TP and shifts its triphosphate into a non-productive conformation. ",
        "Short-Chain Fatty Acids Improve Poststroke Recovery via Immunological Mechanisms. Recovery after stroke is a multicellular process encompassing neurons, resident immune cells, and brain-invading cells. Stroke alters the gut microbiome, which in turn has considerable impact on stroke outcome. However, the mechanisms underlying gut-brain interaction and implications for long-term recovery are largely elusive. Here, we tested the hypothesis that short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), key bioactive microbial metabolites, are the missing link along the gut-brain axis and might be able to modulate recovery after experimental stroke. SCFA supplementation in the drinking water of male mice significantly improved recovery of affected limb motor function. Using in vivo wide-field calcium imaging, we observed that SCFAs induced altered contralesional cortex connectivity. This was associated with SCFA-dependent changes in spine and synapse densities. RNA sequencing of the forebrain cortex indicated a potential involvement of microglial cells in contributing to the structural and functional remodeling. Further analyses confirmed a substantial impact of SCFAs on microglial activation, which depended on the recruitment of T cells to the infarcted brain. Our findings identified that microbiota-derived SCFAs modulate poststroke recovery via effects on systemic and brain resident immune cells.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Previous studies have shown a bidirectional communication along the gut-brain axis after stroke. Stroke alters the gut microbiota composition, and in turn, microbiota dysbiosis has a substantial impact on stroke outcome by modulating the immune response. However, until now, the mediators derived from the gut microbiome affecting the gut-immune-brain axis and the molecular mechanisms involved in this process were unknown. Here, we demonstrate that short-chain fatty acids, fermentation products of the gut microbiome, are potent and proregenerative modulators of poststroke neuronal plasticity at various structural levels. We identified that this effect was mediated via circulating lymphocytes on microglial activation. These results identify short-chain fatty acids as a missing link along the gut-brain axis and as a potential therapeutic to improve recovery after stroke. ",
        "Sex-specific norms for verbal memory tests may improve diagnostic accuracy of amnestic MCI. OBJECTIVE: To examine whether the use of sex-specific norms and cut scores to identify memory impairment improves diagnostic accuracy of amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) compared to non-sex-specific (typical) norms/cut scores given the female advantage in verbal memory. METHODS: We calculated sex-specific and typical norms/cut scores (age and education specific) for impairment on the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test in the Mayo Clinic Study of Aging. Norms/cut scores were applied to 453 women and 532 men from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. We compared sex differences in rates of aMCI (Jak/Bondi criteria) for sex-specific vs typical norms/cut scores. Using sex-specific cut scores as the true condition and typical cut scores as the predicted condition, we categorized participants as true positives (TPs), false positives (FPs), true negative (TNs), or false negative (FNs). In cross-sectional analyses within sex, we compared positivity rates of CSF hyperphosphorylated tau/\u03b2-amyloid (A\u03b2) and cortical A\u03b2 deposition ([18F]AV45 PET) and APOE \u03b54 frequency among diagnostic comparison groups. RESULTS: The frequency of aMCI was higher in men when using typical norms/cut scores. Using sex-adjusted norms/cut scores led to the identification of 10% FNs (missed aMCI cases) among women and 10% FPs among men. Biomarker analyses supported the hypothesis that sex-specific diagnostic criteria improves diagnostic accuracy. Biomarkers rates were higher in FNs vs TNs and similar in FNs and TPs. Biomarker rates were lower in FPs vs TPs and similar between FPs and TNs. CONCLUSION: Results suggest that non-sex-specific aMCI diagnostic criteria led to a 20% diagnostic error rate. Accounting for sex differences in verbal memory performance may improve aMCI classification. ",
        "Characterization of Neurodevelopmental Abnormalities in iPSC-Derived Striatal Cultures from Patients with Huntington's Disease. BACKGROUND: Huntington's disease (HD) is an inherited neurodegenerative disease and is characterized by atrophy of certain regions of the brain in a progressive manner. HD patients experience behavioral changes and uncontrolled movements which can be primarily attributed to the atrophy of striatal neurons. Previous publications describe the models of the HD striatum using induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) derived from HD patients with a juvenile onset (JHD). In this model, the JHD iPSC-derived striatal cultures had altered neurodevelopment and contained a high number of nestin expressing progenitor cells at 42 days of differentiation. OBJECTIVE: To further characterize the altered neurodevelopmental phenotype and evaluate potential phenotypic reversal. METHODS: Differentiation of human iPSCs towards striatal fate and characterization by means of immunocytochemistry and stereological quantification. RESULTS: Here this study demonstrates a distinct delay in the differentiation of the JHD neural progenitor population. However, reduction of the JHD aberrant progenitor populations can be accomplished either by targeting the canonical Notch signaling pathway or by treatment with HTT antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs). CONCLUSIONS: In summary, this data is postulated to reflect a potential overall developmental delay in JHD. ",
        "Outcomes of Adult Heart Transplantation Using Hepatitis C-Positive Donors. Background This study evaluated the impact of hepatitis C-positive (HCV+) donors on outcomes of heart transplantation in the United States. Methods and Results Adults undergoing isolated heart transplantation in the United States between January 1, 2016, and December 31, 2018, were included. The primary outcome was 1-year post-transplant survival. Multivariable Cox regression and 2:1 propensity matching were used to compare outcomes between transplants with HCV+ and hepatitis C-negative (HCV-) donors. A subanalysis was performed to evaluate the impact of nucleic acid amplification test positivity on outcomes. Of 7889 isolated heart transplants performed during the study period, 343 (4.4%) used HCV+ donors. Overall unadjusted 1-year posttransplant survival was not statistically different between HCV- versus HCV+ donors (91.1% versus 90.2%; P=0.86), a finding that persisted after risk adjustment (hazard ratio, 1.05; 95% CI, 0.70-1.58; P=0.80). Propensity matching resulted in 675 well-balanced patients (437 HCV- and 238 HCV+). Overall 1-year posttransplant survival was not statistically different in propensity-matched analysis (89.8% HCV- versus 89.2% HCV+; P=0.88). Rates of 1-year drug-treated rejection (21.1% versus 22.1%; P=0.84), postoperative dialysis (11.4% versus 14.7%; P=0.22), and stroke (4.6% versus 2.1%; P=0.10) were also not statistically different between HCV- and HCV+ groups, respectively. Outcomes were not statistically different between nucleic acid amplification test-negative and nucleic acid amplification test-positive HCV+ donors. Conclusions Adult heart transplants using HCV+ donors, including those that are nucleic acid amplification test positive, can be performed without an adverse impact on 1-year survival. Wider implementation of protocols for using HCV+ donors and an assessment of longer-term outcomes including seroconversion rates will be important in maximizing the effect of HCV+ donors on national donor shortages.

        "Association of maternal prepregnancy weight and early childhood weight with obesity in adolescence: A population-based longitudinal cohort study in Japan. BACKGROUND: The impact of birth weight and obesity in early childhood on obesity in adolescence remains unclear. OBJECTIVES: To examine the association of overweight/obesity at age 15 years with birth weight, overweight/obesity in early childhood and overweight/obesity in mothers. METHODS: This population-based retrospective cohort study used early childhood and school age health check-up data of 1581 children in Japan, followed-up until age 15 years. Generalized estimation equation analyses were used to investigate the association of overweight/obesity at age 15 years with low/high birth weight, overweight/obesity in 3 years of age and overweight/obesity in mothers. The cutoff points for all variables were defined by international criteria. RESULTS: Of 1581 mother-child pairs, 130 (8.2%) children had low birth weight, while 93 (5.9%) and 167 (10.6%) were overweight/obese at age 3 and 15 years, respectively. Overweight/obesity at age 3 years and overweight/obesity in mothers were associated with overweight/obesity at age 15 years (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 4.26; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.51-7.25 and (aOR, 2.46; 95% CI: 1.41-4.30). No association between low birth weight and overweight/obesity at age 15 years was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Overweight/obesity in mothers and overweight/obesity at 3 years of age, but not birth weight, were associated with overweight/obesity at age 15 years. ",
        "A dual-action peptide-containing hydrogel targets wound infection and inflammation. There is a clinical need for improved wound treatments that prevent both infection and excessive inflammation. TCP-25, a thrombin-derived peptide, is antibacterial and scavenges pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), such as lipopolysaccharide, thereby preventing CD14 interaction and Toll-like receptor dimerization, leading to reduced downstream immune activation. Here, we describe the development of a hydrogel formulation that was functionalized with TCP-25 to target bacteria and associated PAMP-induced inflammation. In vitro studies determined the polymer prerequisites for such TCP-25-mediated dual action, favoring the use of noncharged hydrophilic hydrogels, which enabled peptide conformational changes and LPS binding. The TCP-25-functionalized hydrogels killed Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus and Gram-negative Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteria in vitro, as well as in experimental mouse models of subcutaneous infection. The TCP-25 hydrogel also mediated reduction of LPS-induced local inflammatory responses, as demonstrated by analysis of local cytokine production and in vivo bioimaging using nuclear factor \u03baB (NF-\u03baB) reporter mice. In porcine partial thickness wound models, TCP-25 prevented infection with S. aureus and reduced concentrations of proinflammatory cytokines. Proteolytic fragmentation of TCP-25 in vitro yielded a series of bioactive TCP fragments that were identical or similar to those present in wounds in vivo. Together, the results demonstrate the therapeutic potential of TCP-25 hydrogel, a wound treatment based on the body's peptide defense, for prevention of both bacterial infection and the accompanying inflammation.

        "Discussions of miscarriage and preterm births on Twitter. BACKGROUND: Experiences typically considered private, such as, miscarriages and preterm births are being discussed publicly on social media and Internet discussion websites. These data can provide timely illustrations of how individuals discuss miscarriages and preterm births, as well as insights into the wellbeing of women who have experienced a miscarriage. Here we aim to characterise how users discuss the topic of miscarriage and preterm births on Twitter, analyse trends and drivers, and describe the perceived emotional state of women who have experienced a miscarriage. METHODS: We obtained 291\u00a0443 Twitter postings on miscarriages and preterm births from January 2017 through December 2018. Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) was used to identify major topics of discussion. We applied time series decomposition methods to assess temporal trends and identify major drivers of discussion. Furthermore, four coders labelled the emotional content of 7282 personal miscarriage disclosure tweets into the following non-mutually exclusive categories: grief/sadness/depression, anger, relief, isolation, annoyance, and neutral. RESULTS: Topics in our data fell into eight groups: celebrity disclosures, Michelle Obama's disclosure, politics, healthcare, preterm births, loss and anxiety, flu vaccine and ectopic pregnancies. Political discussions around miscarriages were largely due to a misunderstanding between abortions and miscarriages. Grief and annoyance were the most commonly expressed emotions within the miscarriage self-disclosures; 50.6% (95% confidence interval [CI] 49.1, 52.2) and 16.2% (95% CI 15.2, 17.3). Postings increased with celebrity disclosures, pharmacists' refusal of prescribed medications and outrage over the high rate of preterm births in the United States. Miscarriage disclosures by celebrities also led to disclosures by women who had similar experiences. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that increase in discussions of miscarriage on social media are associated with several factors, including celebrity disclosures. Additionally, there is a misunderstanding of the potential physical, emotional and psychological impacts on individuals who lose a pregnancy due to a miscarriage. ",
        "Five-year effectiveness of bariatric surgery on disease remission, weight loss, and changes of metabolic parameters in obese patients with type 2 diabetes: A population-based propensity score-matched cohort study. AIMS: To compare disease remission rates, weight loss, and changes of metabolic parameters of patients after bariatric surgery with nonsurgical patients. METHODS: Based on the 2006-2017 Hospital Authority database, a population-based retrospective cohort of obese type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients with and without bariatric surgery were identified. Surgical patients were matched with nonsurgical patients on 1-to-5 propensity score. Remission rates of diabetes, hypertension, and dyslipidaemia were reported annually up to 60 months. Changes in weight loss measurements (Body Mass Index [BMI], percentage of total weight loss [%TWL], percentage of excess weight loss [%EWL], and percentage of rebound in excess weight loss [%REWL]) and metabolic parameters (haemoglobin A1c [HbA1c ], systolic blood pressure [SBP], diastolic blood pressure [DBP], and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol [LDL-C]) were measured for both groups. RESULTS: Four hundred one surgical patients (310 restrictive surgeries; 91 bypass surgeries) and 1894 nonsurgical patients were included. Surgical patients had higher remission rates in diabetes and dyslipidaemia and better glycaemic control at 12 to 60 months (all Ps < .01). SBP and DBP were significantly lower for surgical group up to 12 months and similar between two groups after 12 months. Surgical patients had significantly lower BMI during follow-up period. %TWL and %EWL were higher in the surgery group (15.7% vs 3.7%; 48.8% vs 12.0%) at 60 months (P < .001); differences in %REWL between two groups were insignificant. The effectiveness of restrictive and bypass surgeries was similar at 60 months, although restrictive surgeries were slightly more effective in T2DM remission. CONCLUSIONS: Bariatric surgery was effective in weight loss, remission of diabetes, and dyslipidaemia in 5-year post-surgery. ",
        "Microfluidic smartphone quantitation of Escherichia coli in synthetic urine. In spite of the clinical need, there is a major gap in rapid diagnostics for identification and quantitation of E. coli and other pathogens, also regarded as the biggest bottleneck in the fight against the spread of antimicrobial resistant bacterial strains. This study reports for the first time an optical, smartphone-based microfluidic fluorescence sandwich immunoassay capable of quantifying E. coli in buffer and synthetic urine in less than 25\u202fmin without sample preparation nor concentration. A limit of detection (LoD) up to 240\u202fCFU/mL, comensurate with cut-off for UTIs (103-105\u202fCFUs/mL) was achieved. Replicas of full response curves performed with 100-107\u202fCFUs/mL of E. coli K12 in synthetic urine yielded recovery values in the range 80-120%, assay reproducibility below 30% and precision below 20%, therefore similar to high-performance automated immunoassays. The unrivalled LoD was mainly linked to the 'open fluidics' nature of the 10-bore microfluidic strips used that enabled passing a large volume of sample through the microcapillaries coated with capture antibody. The new smartphone based test has the potential of being as a rapid, point-of-care test for rule-in of E. coli infections that are responsible for around 80% of UTIs, helping to stop the over-prescription of antibiotics and the monitoring of patients with other symptomatic communicable diseases caused by E. coli at global scale.

        "Using Death Certificates to Explore Changes in Alcohol-Related Mortality in the United States, 1999 to 2017. BACKGROUND: Alcohol consumption, alcohol-related emergency department visits, and hospitalizations have all increased in the last 2 decades, particularly among women and people middle-aged and older. The purpose of this study was to explore data from death certificates to assess whether parallel changes in alcohol-related mortality occurred in the United States in recent years. METHODS: U.S. mortality data from the National Center for Health Statistics were analyzed to estimate the annual number and rate of alcohol-related deaths by age, sex, race, and ethnicity between 1999 and 2017 among people aged 16+. Mortality data contained details from all death certificates filed nationally. For each death, an underlying cause and up to 20 multiple or contributing causes were indicated. Deaths were identified as alcohol-related if an alcohol-induced cause was listed as either an underlying or multiple cause. Joinpoint analyses were performed to assess temporal trends. RESULTS: The number of alcohol-related deaths per year among people aged 16+ doubled from 35,914 to 72,558, and the rate increased 50.9% from 16.9 to 25.5 per 100,000. Nearly 1 million alcohol-related deaths (944,880) were recorded between 1999 and 2017. In 2017, 2.6% of roughly 2.8 million deaths in the United States involved alcohol. Nearly half of alcohol-related deaths resulted from liver disease (30.7%; 22,245) or overdoses on alcohol alone or with other drugs (17.9%; 12,954). Rates of alcohol-related deaths were highest among males, people in age-groups spanning 45 to 74\u00a0years, and among non-Hispanic (NH) American Indians or Alaska Natives. Rates increased for all age-groups except 16 to 20 and 75+ and for all racial and ethnic groups except for initial decreases among Hispanic males and NH Blacks followed by increases. The largest annual increase occurred among NH White females. Rates of acute alcohol-related deaths increased more for people aged 55 to 64, but rates of chronic alcohol-related deaths, which accounted for the majority of alcohol-related deaths, increased more for younger adults aged 25 to 34. CONCLUSIONS: Death certificates suggest that alcohol-related mortality increased in the United States between 1999 and 2017. Given previous reports that death certificates often fail to indicate the contribution of alcohol, the scope of alcohol-related mortality in the United States is likely higher than suggested from death certificates alone. Findings confirm an increasing burden of alcohol on public health and support the need for improving surveillance of alcohol-involved mortality. ",
        "Mycobacterium tuberculosis Limits Host Glycolysis and IL-1\u03b2 by Restriction of PFK-M via MicroRNA-21. Increased glycolytic metabolism recently emerged as an essential process driving host defense against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), but little is known\u00a0about how this process is regulated during infection.\u00a0Here, we observe repression of host glycolysis in Mtb-infected macrophages, which is dependent on sustained upregulation of anti-inflammatory microRNA-21 (miR-21) by proliferating mycobacteria. The dampening of glycolysis by miR-21 is mediated through targeting of phosphofructokinase muscle (PFK-M) isoform at the committed step of glycolysis, which facilitates bacterial growth by limiting pro-inflammatory mediators, chiefly interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2). Unlike other glycolytic genes, PFK-M expression and activity is repressed during Mtb infection through miR-21-mediated regulation, while other less-active isoenzymes dominate. Notably, interferon-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3), which drives Mtb host defense, inhibits miR-21 expression, forcing an isoenzyme switch in the PFK complex, augmenting PFK-M expression and macrophage glycolysis. These findings place the targeting of PFK-M by miR-21 as a key node controlling macrophage immunometabolic function. ",
        "Associations of Leisure-Time Physical Activity Trajectories with Fruit and Vegetable Consumption from Childhood to Adulthood: The Cardiovascular Risk in Young Finns Study. A physically active lifestyle and a diet rich in vegetables and fruits have a central role in promoting health. This study examined the associations between leisure-time physical activity (LTPA) trajectories and fruit and vegetable consumption (FVC) from childhood to middle age. The data were drawn from the Cardiovascular Risk in Young Finns Study with six age cohorts. Participants were 9 to 18 years (n = 3536; 51% females) at baseline in 1980 and 33 to 48 years at the last follow-up in 2011. LTPA and FVC were self-reported. LTPA trajectories were identified using latent profile analyses, after which the mean differences in FVC across the trajectories were studied. Active, low-active, decreasingly and increasingly active trajectories were identified for both genders. An additional trajectory describing inactivity was identified for females. Those who were persistently active or increased their LTPA had higher FVC at many ages when compared to their inactive or low-active counterparts (p < 0.05). In females prior to age 42 and in males prior to age 24, FVC was higher at many ages in those with decreasing activity than in their inactive or low-active counterparts (p < 0.05). The development of LTPA and FVC from childhood to middle age seem to occur in tandem. ",
        "Cancer statistics, 2020. Each year, the American Cancer Society estimates the numbers of new cancer cases and deaths that will occur in the United States and compiles the most recent data on population-based cancer occurrence. Incidence data (through 2016) were collected by the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program; the National Program of Cancer Registries; and the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries. Mortality data (through 2017) were collected by the National Center for Health Statistics. In 2020, 1,806,590 new cancer cases and 606,520 cancer deaths are projected to occur in the United States. The cancer death rate rose until 1991, then fell continuously through 2017, resulting in an overall decline of 29% that translates into an estimated 2.9\u00a0million fewer cancer deaths than would have occurred if peak rates had persisted. This progress is driven by long-term declines in death rates for the 4 leading cancers (lung, colorectal, breast, prostate); however, over the past decade (2008-2017), reductions slowed for female breast and colorectal cancers, and halted for prostate cancer. In contrast, declines accelerated for lung cancer, from 3% annually during 2008 through 2013 to 5% during 2013 through 2017 in men and from 2% to almost 4% in women, spurring the largest ever single-year drop in overall cancer mortality of 2.2% from 2016 to 2017. Yet lung cancer still caused more deaths in 2017 than breast, prostate, colorectal, and brain cancers combined. Recent mortality declines were also dramatic for melanoma of the skin in the wake of US Food and Drug Administration approval of new therapies for metastatic disease, escalating to 7% annually during 2013 through 2017 from 1% during 2006 through 2010 in men and women aged 50 to 64\u00a0years and from 2% to 3% in those aged 20 to 49\u00a0years; annual declines of 5% to 6% in individuals aged 65\u00a0years and older are particularly striking because rates in this age group were increasing prior to 2013. It is also notable that long-term rapid increases in liver cancer mortality have attenuated in women and stabilized in men. In summary, slowing momentum for some cancers amenable to early detection is juxtaposed with notable gains for other common cancers. ",
        "Episiotomy use among vaginal deliveries and the association with anal sphincter injury: a population-based retrospective cohort study. BACKGROUND: The rate of obstetric anal sphincter injury has increased in recent years, particularly among operative vaginal deliveries. We sought to characterize temporal trends in episiotomy use and to quantify the association between episiotomy and obstetric anal sphincter injury. METHODS: Using a population-based retrospective cohort study design of hospital data from 2004 to 2017, we studied all vaginal deliveries of singleton infants at term gestation in Canada (excluding Quebec). Rates of obstetric anal sphincter injury were contrasted between women who had an episiotomy and those who did not. Log-binomial regression was used to estimate the association between episiotomy and obstetric anal sphincter injury among women with spontaneous and operative vaginal deliveries after controlling for confounders. RESULTS: The study population included 2 570 847 deliveries. Episiotomy use declined significantly among operative vaginal deliveries (53.1% in 2004 to 43.2% in 2017, p < 0.0001) and spontaneous vaginal deliveries (13.5% in 2004 to 6.5% in 2017, p < 0.0001). Episiotomy was associated with higher rates of obstetric anal sphincter injury among spontaneous vaginal deliveries (4.8 with episiotomy v. 2.4% without; adjusted rate ratio [RR] 2.06, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.00-2.11) and this association remained after stratification by parity and obstetric history. In contrast, episiotomy was associated with lower rates of obstetric anal sphincter injury among forceps deliveries in nulliparous women (adjusted RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.61-0.66), and women with vaginal birth after cesarean (adjusted RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.60-0.85), but not among parous women without a previous cesarean (adjusted RR 1.16, 95% CI 1.00-1.34). INTERPRETATION: Episiotomy use has declined in Canada for all vaginal deliveries. The protective association between episiotomy and obstetric anal sphincter injury among women who gave birth by operative vaginal delivery (especially forceps) warrants reconsideration of clinical practice among nulliparous women and those attempting vaginal birth after cesarean.

        "Multipotent RAG1+ progenitors emerge directly from haemogenic endothelium in human pluripotent stem cell-derived haematopoietic organoids. Defining the ontogeny of the human adaptive immune system during embryogenesis has implications for understanding childhood diseases including leukaemias and autoimmune conditions. Using RAG1:GFP human pluripotent stem cell reporter lines, we examined human T-cell genesis from pluripotent-stem-cell-derived haematopoietic organoids. Under conditions favouring T-cell development, RAG1+ cells progressively upregulated a cohort of recognized T-cell-associated genes, arresting development at the CD4+CD8+ stage. Sort and re-culture experiments showed that early RAG1+ cells also possessed B-cell, myeloid and erythroid potential. Flow cytometry and single-cell-RNA-sequencing data showed that early RAG1+ cells co-expressed the endothelial/haematopoietic progenitor markers CD34, VECAD and CD90, whereas imaging studies identified RAG1+ cells within CD31+ endothelial structures that co-expressed SOX17+ or the endothelial marker CAV1. Collectively, these observations provide evidence for a wave of human T-cell development that originates directly from haemogenic endothelium via a RAG1+ intermediate with multilineage potential. ",
        "Investigating E-Cigarette Particle Emissions and Human Airway Depositions under Various E-Cigarette-Use Conditions. E-cigarette use is dramatically increasing, particularly with adolescents. While the chemical composition of e-liquids and e-vapor is well characterized, the particle size distribution and the human airways deposition patterns of e-cigarette particles are understudied and poorly understood despite their likely contribution to adverse health effects from e-cigarette usage. In this study, we examined the impacts of e-cigarette device power, e-liquid composition, and vaping topography on e-cigarette particle sizes and their deposition in human airways. In addition, we observed that particle measurement conditions (dilution ratio, temperature, and humidity) significantly affect measured e-cigarette particle sizes. E-cigarette power output significantly increased particle count median diameters (CMD) from 174 \u00b1 13 (particles generated under 6.4 W) to 236 \u00b1 14 nm (particles generated under 31.1 W). E-cigarette particles generated from propylene glycol-based e-liquids (CMD = 145 \u00b1 8 nm and mass median diameter [MMD] = 3.06 \u00b1 0.17 \u03bcm) were smaller than those generated from vegetable glycerin-based e-liquids (CMD = 182 \u00b1 9 nm and MMD = 3.37 \u00b1 0.21 \u03bcm). Puff volume also impacted vapor particle size: CMD and MMD were 154 \u00b1 11 nm and 3.50 \u00b1 0.27 \u03bcm, 163 \u00b1 6 nm and 3.35 \u00b1 0.24 \u03bcm, and 146 \u00b1 12 nm and 2.95 \u00b1 0.14 \u03bcm, respectively, for 35, 90, and 170 mL puffs. Estimated e-cigarette particle mass deposition fractions in tracheobronchial and bronchoalveolar regions were 0.504-0.541 and 0.073-0.306, respectively. Interestingly, e-cigarette particles are smaller than the particles generated from cigarette smoking but have similar human airway deposition patterns. ",
        "Testing predictability of disease outbreaks with a simple model of pathogen biogeography. Predicting disease emergence and outbreak events is a critical task for public health professionals and epidemiologists. Advances in global disease surveillance are increasingly generating datasets that are worth more than their component parts for prediction-oriented work. Here, we use a trait-free approach which leverages information on the global community of human infectious diseases to predict the biogeography of pathogens through time. Our approach takes pairwise dissimilarities between countries' pathogen communities and pathogens' geographical distributions and uses these to predict country-pathogen associations. We compare the success rates of our model for predicting pathogen outbreak, emergence and re-emergence potential as a function of time (e.g. number of years between training and prediction), pathogen type (e.g. virus) and transmission mode (e.g. vector-borne). With only these simple predictors, our model successfully predicts basic network structure up to a decade into the future. We find that while outbreak and re-emergence potential are especially well captured by our simple model, prediction of emergence events remains more elusive, and sudden global emergences like an influenza pandemic are beyond the predictive capacity of the model. However, these stochastic pandemic events are unlikely to be predictable from such coarse data. Together, our model is able to use the information on the existing country-pathogen network to predict pathogen outbreaks fairly well, suggesting the importance in considering information on co-occurring pathogens in a more global view even to estimate outbreak events in a single location or for a single pathogen.

        "Re-assessing the diversity of negative strand RNA viruses in insects. The spectrum of viruses in insects is important for subjects as diverse as public health, veterinary medicine, food production, and biodiversity conservation. The traditional interest in vector-borne diseases of humans and livestock has drawn the attention of virus studies to hematophagous insect species. However, these represent only a tiny fraction of the broad diversity of Hexapoda, the most speciose group of animals. Here, we systematically probed the diversity of negative strand RNA viruses in the largest and most representative collection of insect transcriptomes from samples representing all 34 extant orders of Hexapoda and 3 orders of Entognatha, as well as outgroups, altogether representing 1243 species. Based on profile hidden Markov models we detected 488 viral RNA-directed RNA polymerase (RdRp) sequences with similarity to negative strand RNA viruses. These were identified in members of 324 arthropod species. Selection for length, quality, and uniqueness left 234 sequences for analyses, showing similarity to genomes of viruses classified in Bunyavirales (n = 86), Articulavirales (n = 54), and several orders within Haploviricotina (n = 94). Coding-complete genomes or nearly-complete subgenomic assemblies were obtained in 61 cases. Based on phylogenetic topology and the availability of coding-complete genomes we estimate that at least 20 novel viral genera in seven families need to be defined, only two of them monospecific. Seven additional viral clades emerge when adding sequences from the present study to formerly monospecific lineages, potentially requiring up to seven additional genera. One long sequence may indicate a novel family. For segmented viruses, cophylogenies between genome segments were generally improved by the inclusion of viruses from the present study, suggesting that in silico misassembly of segmented genomes is rare or absent. Contrary to previous assessments, significant virus-host codivergence was identified in major phylogenetic lineages based on two different approaches of codivergence analysis in a hypotheses testing framework. In spite of these additions to the known spectrum of viruses in insects, we caution that basing taxonomic decisions on genome information alone is challenging due to technical uncertainties, such as the inability to prove integrity of complete genome assemblies of segmented viruses.

        "Transcriptional response to metal starvation in the emerging pathogen Mycoplasma genitalium is mediated by Fur-dependent and -independent regulatory pathways. Transition metals participate in numerous enzymatic reactions and they are essential for survival in all living organisms. For this reason, bacterial pathogens have evolved dedicated machineries to effectively compete with their hosts and scavenge metals at the site of infection. In this study, we investigated the mechanisms controlling metal acquisition in the emerging human pathogen Mycoplasma genitalium. We observed a robust transcriptional response to metal starvation, and many genes coding for predicted lipoproteins and ABC-transporters were significantly up-regulated. Transcriptional analysis of a mutant strain lacking a metalloregulator of the Fur family revealed the activation of a full operon encoding a putative metal transporter system and a gene coding for a Histidine-rich lipoprotein (Hrl). We recognized a conserved sequence with dyad symmetry within the promoter region of the Fur-regulated genes. Mutagenesis of the predicted Fur operator within the hrl promoter abrogated Fur- and metal-dependent expression of a reporter gene. Metal starvation still impelled a strong transcriptional response in the fur mutant, demonstrating the existence of Fur-independent regulatory pathways controlling metal homeostasis. Finally, analysis of metal accumulation in the wild-type strain and the fur mutant by ICP-MS revealed an important role of Fur in nickel acquisition. ",
        "Co-transmission of Related Malaria Parasite Lineages Shapes Within-Host Parasite Diversity. In high-transmission regions, we expect parasite lineages within complex malaria infections to be unrelated due to parasite inoculations from different mosquitoes. This project was designed to test this prediction. We generated 485 single-cell genome sequences from fifteen P.\u00a0falciparum malaria patients from Chikhwawa, Malawi-an area of intense transmission. Patients harbored up to seventeen unique parasite lineages. Surprisingly, parasite lineages within infections tend to be closely related, suggesting that superinfection by repeated mosquito bites is\u00a0rarer than co-transmission of parasites from a single mosquito. Both closely and distantly related parasites comprise an infection, suggesting sequential transmission of complex infections between multiple hosts. We identified tetrads and reconstructed parental haplotypes, which revealed the inbred ancestry of infections and non-Mendelian inheritance. Our analysis suggests strong barriers to secondary infection and outbreeding amongst malaria parasites from a high transmission setting, providing unexpected insights into the biology and transmission of malaria.

        "Inhibiting Translation Elongation with SVC112 Suppresses Cancer Stem Cells and Inhibits Growth in Head and Neck Squamous Carcinoma. Cancer stem cells (CSC) drive growth, therapy resistance, and recurrence in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Regulation of protein translation is crucial for normal stem cells and CSCs; its inhibition could disrupt stemness properties, but translation inhibitors are limited clinically due to toxicity. SVC112 is a synthetic derivative of bouvardin, a plant-derived translation elongation inhibitor. SVC112 had greater antiproliferative effects on HNSCC cells compared with the FDA-approved translation inhibitor omacetaxine mepesuccinate (HHT). SVC112 preferentially inhibited cancer cells compared with patient-matched cancer-associated fibroblasts, whereas HHT was equally toxic to both. SVC112 reduced sphere formation by cell lines and CSCs. SVC112 alone inhibited the growth of patient-derived xenografts (PDX), and SVC112 combined with radiation resulted in tumor regression in HPV-positive and HPV-negative HNSCC PDXs. Notably, CSC depletion after SVC112 correlated with tumor response. SVC112 preferentially impeded ribosomal processing of mRNAs critical for stress response and decreased CSC-related proteins including Myc and Sox2. SVC112 increased cell-cycle progression delay and slowed DNA repair following radiation, enhancing colony and sphere formation radiation effects. In summary, these data demonstrate that SVC112 suppresses CSC-related proteins, enhances the effects of radiation, and blocks growth of HNSCC PDXs by inhibiting CSCs. SIGNIFICANCE: Inhibiting protein elongation with SVC112 reduces tumor growth in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and increases the effects of radiation by targeting the cancer stem cell pool. ",
        "Dectin-1 Binding to Annexins on Apoptotic Cells Induces Peripheral Immune Tolerance via NADPH Oxidase-2. Uptake of apoptotic cells (ACs) by dendritic cells (DCs) and induction of a tolerogenic DC phenotype\u00a0is\u00a0an important mechanism for establishing peripheral\u00a0tolerance to self-antigens. The receptors involved and underlying signaling pathways are not fully understood. Here, we identify Dectin-1 as a crucial tolerogenic receptor binding with nanomolar affinity to the core domain of several annexins (annexin A1, A5, and A13) exposed on ACs. Annexins bind to Dectin-1 on a site distinct from the interaction site of pathogen-derived \u03b2-glucans. Subsequent tolerogenic signaling induces selective phosphorylation of spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK), causing activation of NADPH oxidase-2 and moderate production of reactive oxygen species.\u00a0Thus, mice deficient for Dectin-1 develop autoimmune pathologies (autoantibodies and splenomegaly) and generate stronger immune responses (cytotoxic T\u00a0cells) against ACs. Our data describe an important immunological checkpoint system and provide a link between immunosuppressive signals of ACs and maintenance of peripheral immune tolerance. ",
        "Virus Isoelectric Point Determination Using Single-Particle Chemical Force Microscopy. Virus colloidal behavior is governed by the interaction of the viral surface and the surrounding environment. One method to characterize the virus surface charge is the isoelectric point (pI). Traditional determination of virus pI has focused on the bulk characterization of a viral solution. However, virus capsids are extremely heterogeneous, and a single-particle method may give more information on the range of surface charge observed across a population. One method to measure the virus pI is chemical force microscopy (CFM). CFM is a single-particle technique that measures the adhesion force of a functionalized atomic force microscope (AFM) probe and, in this case, a virus covalently bound to a surface. Non-enveloped porcine parvovirus (PPV) and enveloped bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) were used to demonstrate the use of CFM for viral particles with different surface properties. We have validated the CFM to determine the pI of PPV to be 4.8-5.1, which has a known pI value of 5.0 in the literature, and to predict the unknown pI of BVDV to be 4.3-4.5. Bulk measurements, \u03b6-potential, and aqueous two-phase system (ATPS) cross-partitioning methods were also used to validate the new CFM method for the virus pI. Most methods were in good agreement. CFM can detect the surface charge of viral capsids at a single-particle level and enable the comparison of surface charge between different types of viruses. ",
        "Daily Step Counts: A New Prognostic Factor in Locally Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer?. PURPOSE: Here we explore the prognostic value of baseline step count data captured using wearable devices for patients treated with definitive chemoradiation therapy for locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). METHODS AND MATERIALS: Patients with locally advanced NSCLC wore a commercial fitness tracker during a course of definitive, concurrent chemoradiation therapy as part of a clinical trial. Baseline step count average was defined as the average daily step total from study enrollment until completion of the first week of radiation therapy. Based on data from healthy individuals, study subjects were categorized as inactive (below the 25th percentile), moderately active (25th to 75th percentile), or highly active (above the 75th percentile). Fisher's exact test was used to examine activity level as a predictor of hospitalization during radiation therapy and of completing the planned radiation therapy course without delay exceeding 1 week. Median progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) durations were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Inactivity was tested as a predictor of PFS and OS using Cox proportional hazards models. RESULTS: Fifty subjects met eligibility criteria. Nine (18%) were categorized as highly active, 23 (46%) were moderately active, and 18 (36%) were inactive. Inactive subjects were more likely to be hospitalized during the radiation therapy course than other subjects (50% vs 9%, P = .004) and less likely to complete radiation therapy without delay exceeding 1 week (67% vs 97%, P = .006). Median PFS duration was 5.3 months for inactive subjects and 18.3 months for others (hazard ratio for inactivity = 5.10, P < .001). Median OS duration was 15.0 months for inactive subjects and not reached for others (hazard ratio = 3.91, P = .004). Performance status was not a significant predictor of PFS or OS. CONCLUSIONS: Baseline activity level measured using wearable devices may help identify patients with NSCLC who are fit for concurrent chemoradiation therapy and can predict clinical outcomes in this setting.

        "Declining blood lead levels among small-scale miners participating in a safer mining pilot programme in Nigeria. OBJECTIVES: Our objective was to monitor blood lead levels (BLLs) of miners and ore processors participating in a pilot programme to reduce lead poisoning and take-home exposures from artisanal small-scale gold mining. A medical surveillance programme was established to assess exposures as new methods aimed at reducing lead exposures from ore were introduced in a community in Nigeria where children experienced substantial lead-related morbidity and mortality. METHODS: Extensive outreach and education were offered to miners, and investments were made to adopt wet methods to reduce exposures during mining and processing. We conducted medical surveillance, including a physical exam and repeated blood lead testing, for 61 miners selected from among several hundred who participated in the safer mining pilot programme and consented to testing. Venous blood lead concentrations were analysed using the LeadCare II device at approximately 3-month intervals over a period of 19 months. RESULTS: Overall geometric mean (GM) BLLs decreased by 32% from 31.6 to 21.5\u2009\u00b5g/dL during the 19-month project. Women had a somewhat lower reduction in GM BLLs (23%) compared with men (36%). There was a statistically significant reduction in log BLLs from baseline to the final test taken by each participant (p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The observed reductions in GM BLLs during the pilot intervention among this representative group of miners and ore processors demonstrated the effectiveness of the safer mining programme in this community. Such measures are feasible, cost-effective and can greatly improve health outcomes in mining communities. ",
        "Improved pregnancy outcome in patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis who followed an ideal clinical pathway. OBJECTIVE: Among women with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) we aimed to assess the effect of optimal management of pregnancy, on a composite outcome of miscarriage and complicated birth. METHODS: Data were extracted from healthcare databases of the Lombardy Region, Italy (2004-2013), as a part of the RECord-linkage On Rheumatic Diseases Study. Analyses included women with RA identified through copayment exemption code (ICD9-CM code 714.0) and controls from the general population aged between 18 and 50. Seven healthcare quality indicators (HCQI) were constructed and summarized in 3 pathways indicators: A) diagnostic; B) therapeutic; C) and prenatal follow-up. The groups of complicated birth or miscarriage identified the adverse pregnancy outcome (APO). The relationship between HCQI and APO was analysed using logistic models and the results presented as odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95%CI). RESULTS: The study cohort included the first pregnancy observed in 443 patients with RA compared with 6097 women belonging to the general population. In RA population, patients who followed the ideal pathway had a reduced risk of overall APO with an OR=0.60 (95%CI 0.39, 0.94) and of miscarriage/perinatal death with an OR=0.40 (95%CI 0.24, 0.69) compared to those who did not. Compared with the general population, patients with RA who met all HCQI during pregnancy displayed a risk of APO with an OR=0.92 (95%CI 0.61, 1.38) and miscarriage/perinatal death with an OR=0.77 (95%CI 0.47,1.29). CONCLUSIONS: The adherence to the ideal clinical pathway in women with RA restored the risk of APO to that expected for the general population. ",
        "Association of Deceased Donor Acute Kidney Injury With Recipient Graft Survival. Importance: The shortage of deceased donor kidneys for transplants is an ongoing concern. Prior studies support transplanting kidneys from deceased donors with acute kidney injury (AKI), but those investigations have been subject to selection bias and small sample sizes. Current allocation practices of AKI kidneys in the United States are not well characterized. Objectives: To evaluate the association of deceased donor AKI with recipient graft survival and to characterize recovery and discard practices for AKI kidneys by organ procurement organizations. Design, Setting, and Participants: Registry-based, propensity score-matched cohort study from January 1, 2010, to December 31, 2013, in the United States. The dates of analysis were March 1 to November 1, 2019. From 2010 to 2013, a total of 6832 deceased donors with AKI and 15\u202f310 deceased donors without AKI had at least 1 kidney transplanted. This study used a 1:1, propensity score-matched analysis to match deceased donors with AKI to deceased donors without AKI and investigated outcomes in their corresponding kidney recipients. Exposure: Deceased donor AKI, defined as at least 50% or 0.3-mg/dL increase in terminal serum creatinine level from admission. Main Outcomes and Measures: Recipients were assessed for the time to death-censored graft failure and the following secondary outcomes: delayed graft function, primary nonfunction, and the time to all-cause graft failure. Results: Ninety-eight percent (6722 of 6832) of deceased donors with AKI were matched to deceased donors without AKI. The mean (SD) age of the 13\u202f444 deceased donors was 40.4 (14.4) years, and 63% (8529 of 13\u202f444) were male. A total of 25\u202f323 recipients were analyzed (15\u202f485 [61%] were male), and their mean (SD) age was 52.0 (14.7) years. Recipients were followed up for a median of 5 (interquartile range, 4-6) years. Deceased donor AKI status had no association with death-censored graft failure (hazard ratio, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.95-1.08) or all-cause graft failure (hazard ratio, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.93-1.02). The results were consistent after examining by AKI stage and adjusting for recipient and transplant characteristics. More recipients of AKI kidneys developed delayed graft function (29% vs 22%, P\u2009<\u2009.001). Few recipients (120 of 25\u202f323 [0.5%]) developed primary nonfunction regardless of deceased donor AKI status. Recovery and transplantation of AKI kidneys varied by organ procurement organization; most (39 of 58) had high recovery and high discard of AKI kidneys. Conclusions and Relevance: Deceased donor AKI kidneys transplanted in the study period had recipient graft survival comparable to that of non-AKI kidneys. This study's findings suggest that the transplant community should evaluate whether currently discarded AKI kidneys from donors without substantial comorbidities can be used more effectively. ",
        "Association of Opioid Overdose Risk Factors and Naloxone Prescribing in US Adults. BACKGROUND: Prescribing naloxone to patients is a key strategy to prevent opioid overdoses, but little is known about the reach of naloxone prescribing. OBJECTIVE: Determine patient factors associated with receiving naloxone and trends over time in patients with key overdose risk factors. DESIGN: Retrospective observational study. PARTICIPANTS: Using the Clinformatics DataMart, a US-wide health insurance claims dataset, we compared adults who received opioids and naloxone (opioid+naloxone) from January 2014 to June 2017 with adults who received opioids without naloxone (opioids only), matched on gender, age \u00b1 5 years, month/year of opioid fill, and number of opioid claims. MAIN MEASURES: Key patient-level opioid overdose risk factors included receipt of high-dosage opioids, concurrent benzodiazepines, history of opioid and other substance use disorders, and history of opioid overdose. RESULTS: We included 3963 opioid+naloxone and 19,815 opioid only patients. Key factors associated with naloxone fills included high opioid daily dosage (50 to < 90 morphine milligram equivalents (MME): AOR = 2.43, 95% CI 2.15-2.76 and \u2265 90 MME: AOR = 3.94, 95% CI 3.47-4.46; reference: < 50 MME), receiving concurrent benzodiazepines (AOR = 1.27, 95% CI 1.16-1.38), and having a diagnosis of opioid use disorder (AOR = 1.56, 95% CI 1.40-1.73). History of opioid overdose was not associated with naloxone (AOR = 0.92, 95% CI 0.74-1.15). The percent of patients receiving naloxone increased, yet less than 2% of patients in any of the key overdose risk factor groups received naloxone by the last 6 months of the study period. CONCLUSIONS: Naloxone prescribing has increased and was more likely to be co-prescribed to patients with some risk factors for overdose. However, overall prescribing remains minimal. Additional efforts are needed across health systems to increase naloxone prescribing for patients at risk for opioid overdose. ",
        "Ethnic Differences in Functional Limitations by Age Across the Adult Life Course. BACKGROUND: Despite compelling evidence from the United States of ethnic inequalities in physical functioning and ethnic differences in risk factors for poor physical functioning, very little is known about ethnic differences in the United Kingdom. Furthermore, the life stage at which these ethnic differentials are first observed has not been examined. METHODS: Using cross-sectional data from Wave 1 of the UK Household Longitudinal Study (UKHLS), we compared self-reported physical functioning among 35,816 White British, 4,450 South Asian and 2,512 African Caribbean men and women across different stages of adulthood (young adulthood, early middle age, late middle age, older age). Regression analyses examined ethnic differences in functional limitations, with adjustment for socioeconomic and clinical covariates. Ethnicity by sex and ethnicity by age-group interactions were examined, and subgroup heterogeneity was explored. RESULTS: Compared with White British adults over the age of 60, older South Asian men and women reported higher odds of functional limitations (odds ratio [OR] 2.77 [95% confidence interval {CI}: 2.00-3.89] and OR 3.99 [2.61-6.10], respectively); these ethnic differentials were observed as early as young adulthood. Young African Caribbean men had lower odds of functional limitations than White British men (OR 0.56 [0.34-0.94]), yet African Caribbean women reported higher odds of functional limitations in older age (OR 1.84 [1.21-2.79]). CONCLUSIONS: There is an elevated risk of functional limitations relating to ethnicity, even in young adulthood where the impact on future health and socioeconomic position is considerable. When planning and delivering health care services to reduce ethnic inequalities in functional health, the intersectionality with age and sex should be considered. ",
        "Trends in alcohol and marijuana detected in homicide victims in 9 US states: 2004-2016. Background: Use of alcohol and other drugs is a major risk factor for assaultive injuries and violent deaths. The purpose of this study was to examine the time trends in the prevalence of alcohol and marijuana detected in homicide victims. Methods: We analyzed toxicological testing data for homicide victims (n\u00a0=\u200912,638) from the 2004-2016 National Violent Death Reporting System in 9 US states (Colorado, Georgia, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Oregon, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Virginia, and Wisconsin). We used the Cochran-Armitage test for trend to assess the statistical significance of changes in the prevalence of alcohol and marijuana detected in these homicide victims during the study period. Results: Overall, 37.5% of the homicide victims tested positive for alcohol, 31.0% positive for marijuana, and 11.4% positive for both substances. During the study period, the prevalence of marijuana increased from 22.3% (95% confidence interval [CI]\u2009=\u200919.6, 25.0) in 2004 to 42.1% (95% CI\u2009=\u200939.2, 44.9) in 2016 (Z\u00a0=\u2009-15.7; P\u00a0<\u2009.001) while the prevalence of alcohol declined slightly (Z\u00a0=\u20091.5; P\u00a0=\u20090.143). Marked increases in the prevalence of marijuana were observed in both sexes and across age and racial groups. Conclusions: Marijuana is increasingly detected in homicide victims irrespective of demographic characteristics. Further research is needed to assess the causal role of marijuana use and concurrent use of marijuana and alcohol in homicide victimization. ",
        "A Quantitative Assessment of Gluten Cross-contact in the School Environment for Children With Celiac Disease. OBJECTIVES: A gluten-free (GF) diet is the primary treatment for celiac disease (CD). Gluten is used in schools, particularly in early childhood, art, and home-economics classrooms. This study aimed to measure gluten transfer from school supplies to GF foods that a child with CD may eat. Also, to measure efficacy of washing techniques to remove gluten from hands and tables. METHODS: Five experiments measured potential gluten cross-contact in classrooms: Play-Doh (n\u200a=\u200a30); baking project (n\u200a=\u200a30); paper m\u00e2ch\u00e9 (n\u200a=\u200a10); dry pasta in sensory table (n\u200a=\u200a10); cooked pasta in sensory table (n\u200a=\u200a10). Thirty participants ages 2 to 18 were enrolled. Following activities, gluten levels were measured on separate slices of GF bread rubbed on participant's hands and table surfaces. Participants were assigned 1 of 3 handwashing methods (soap and water, water alone, or wet wipe). Repeat gluten transfer measurements were taken from hands and tables. Gluten measurements made using R-Biopharm R7001 R5-ELISA Sandwich assay. RESULTS: Paper m\u00e2ch\u00e9, cooked pasta in sensory tables, and baking project resulted in rates of gluten transfer far greater than the 20\u200appm threshold set by Codex Alimentarius Commission. Play-Doh and dry pasta, however, resulted in few gluten transfers to GF bread >20\u200appm. Soap and water was consistently the most effective method for removing gluten, although other methods proved as effective in certain scenarios. CONCLUSIONS: The potential for gluten exposure at school is high for some materials and low for others. For high-risk materials, schools should provide GF supplies and have a robust strategy to prevent gluten cross-contact with food. ",
        "Identification of signature genes associated with therapeutic resistance to anti-VEGF therapy. VEGF-mediated tumor angiogenesis is a validated clinical target in many cancers, but modest efficacy and rapid development of resistance are major challenges of VEGF-targeted therapies. To establish a molecular signature of this resistance in ovarian cancer, we developed preclinical tumor models of adaptive resistance to chronic anti-VEGF treatment. We performed RNA-seq analysis and reverse-phase protein array to compare changes in gene and protein expressions in stroma and cancer cells from resistant and responsive tumors. We identified a unique set of stromal-specific genes that were strongly correlated with resistance phenotypes against two different anti-VEGF treatments, and selected the apelin/APJ signaling pathway for further in vitro validation. Using various functional assays, we showed that activation of apelin/APJ signaling reduces the efficacy of a VEGF inhibitor in endothelial cells. In patients with ovarian cancer treated with bevacizumab, increased expression of apelin was associated with significantly decreased disease-free survival. These findings link signature gene expressions with anti-VEGF response, and may thus provide novel targetable mechanisms of clinical resistance to anti-VEGF therapies. ",
        "The Risk of Head Injuries Associated With Antipsychotic Use Among Persons With Alzheimer's disease. BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Antipsychotic use is associated with risk of falls among older persons, but we are not aware of previous studies investigating risk of head injuries. We studied the association of antipsychotic use and risk of head injuries among community dwellers with Alzheimer's disease (AD). DESIGN: Nationwide register-based cohort study. SETTING: Medication Use and Alzheimer's Disease (MEDALZ) cohort, Finland. PARTICIPANTS: The MEDALZ cohort includes Finnish community dwellers who received clinically verified AD diagnosis in 2005 to 2011. Incident antipsychotic users were identified from the Prescription Register and matched with nonusers by age, sex, and time since AD diagnosis (21 795 matched pairs). Persons with prior head injury or history of schizophrenia were excluded. MEASUREMENTS: Outcomes were incident head injuries (International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision [ICD-10] codes S00-S09) and traumatic brain injuries (TBIs; ICD-10 codes S06.0-S06.9) resulting in a hospital admission (Hospital Discharge Register) or death (Causes of Death Register). Inverse probability of treatment (IPT) weighted Cox proportional hazard models were used to assess relative risks. RESULTS: Antipsychotic use was associated with an increased risk of head injuries (event rate per 100 person-years = 1.65 [95% confidence interval {CI} =\u20091.50-1.81] for users and 1.26 [95% CI = 1.16-1.37] for nonusers; IPT-weighted hazard ratio [HR] =\u20091.29 [95% CI = 1.14-1.47]) and TBIs (event rate per 100 person-years = 0.90 [95% CI = 0.79-1.02] for users and 0.72 [95% CI = 0.65-0.81] for nonusers; IPT-weighted HR = 1.22 [95% CI = 1.03-1.45]). Quetiapine users had higher risk of TBIs (IPT-weighted HR = 1.60 [95% CI = 1.15-2.22]) in comparison to risperidone users. CONCLUSIONS: These findings imply that in addition to previously reported adverse events and effects, antipsychotic use may increase the risk of head injuries and TBIs in persons with AD. Therefore, their use should be restricted to most severe neuropsychiatric symptoms, as recommended by the AGS Beers Criteria\u00ae. Additionally, higher relative risk of TBIs in quetiapine users compared to risperidone users should be confirmed in further studies. J Am Geriatr Soc 68:595-602, 2020. ",
        "Association of Insurance Status and Racial Disparities With the Detection of Early-Stage Breast Cancer. Importance: Compared with non-Hispanic white women, racial/ethnic minority women receive a diagnosis of breast cancer at a more advanced stage and have higher morbidity and mortality with breast cancer diagnosis. Access to care with adequate insurance may be associated with earlier diagnosis, expedited treatment, and improved prognosis. Objective: To examine the extent to which insurance is associated with access to timely breast cancer diagnosis and breast cancer stage differences among a large, diverse population of US patients with breast cancer. Design, Setting, and Participants: This retrospective, cross-sectional population-based study used data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program on 177\u202f075 women aged 40 to 64 years who received a diagnosis of stage I to III breast cancer between January 1, 2010, and December 31, 2016. Statistical analysis was performed from August 1, 2017, to October 1, 2019. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was the risk of having a more advanced stage of breast cancer at diagnosis (ie, stage III vs stages I and II). Mediation analyses were conducted to determine associations of race/ethnicity and proportion of observed differences mediated by health insurance status with earlier stage of diagnosis. Results: A total of 177\u202f075 women (mean [SD] age, 53.5 [6.8] years; 148\u202f124 insured and 28\u202f951 uninsured or receiving Medicaid) were included in the study. A higher proportion of women either receiving Medicaid or who were uninsured received a diagnosis of locally advanced breast cancer (stage III) compared with women with health insurance (20% vs 11%). In multivariable models, non-Hispanic black (odds ratio [OR], 1.46 [95% CI, 1.40-1.53]), American Indian or Alaskan Native (OR, 1.31 [95% CI, 1.07-1.61]) and Hispanic (OR, 1.35 [95% CI, 1.30-1.42]) women had higher odds of receiving a diagnosis of locally advanced disease (stage III) compared with non-Hispanic white women. When adjusting for health insurance and other socioeconomic factors, associations between race/ethnicity and risk of locally advanced breast cancer were attenuated (non-Hispanic black: OR, 1.29 [95% CI, 1.23-1.35]; American Indian or Alaskan Native: OR, 1.11 [95% CI, 0.91-1.35]; Hispanic: OR, 1.17 [95% CI, 1.12-1.22]). Nearly half (45%-47%) of racial differences in the risk of locally advanced disease were mediated by health insurance. Conclusions and Relevance: This study's findings suggest that nearly half of the observed racial/ethnic disparities in higher stage at breast cancer diagnosis are mediated by health insurance coverage.

        "New insights in the paradigm of upregulation of tumoral PSMA expression by androgen receptor blockade: Enzalutamide induces PSMA upregulation in castration-resistant prostate cancer even in patients having previously progressed on enzalutamide. PURPOSE: There is preliminary evidence for prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) upregulation effects of androgen receptor blockade in prostate cancer. In an attempt to find the best condition for PSMA radioligand therapy in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) patients, we evaluated the effect of oral enzalutamide in patients, predominantly having previously progressed on enzalutamide treatment. METHODS: Ten patients with advanced mCRPC scheduled for PSMA radioligand therapy were examined with 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT before and after a mean of 11.8\u00a0days of enzalutamide 160\u00a0mg/day. Imaging results were compared using total PSMA tumor burden quantification. We assessed whole-body total lesion PSMA (TLP), defined as SUVmean\u2009\u00d7\u2009tumor volume and calculated TLP-to-liver ratio (TLP-LR), TLP-to-parotid gland ratio (TLP-PR), and TLP-to-kidney ratio (TLP-KR). RESULTS: The mean (median) increase of TLP-LR, TLP-PR, and TLP-KR in the cohort was 49.3% (38.8%), 45.1% (23.5%), and 54.9% (37.6%), respectively. These increases were statistically significant (p\u2009=\u20090.002, p\u00a0=\u20090.014, and p\u00a0=\u20090.014), while PSA values did not change significantly (p\u2009=\u20090.846). Seven of the 10 patients had previously undergone enzalutamide treatment with eventual progression, formally classified as treatment failure. No side effects were noted in the short term. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that enzalutamide could be considered as a PSMA radioligand treatment enhancing primer medication, which may increase PSMA expression by a dimension of 50% in mCRPC. The effect was shown even in patients having previously failed enzalutamide treatment for arrest of progression in the mCRPC setting. Our observation deserves evaluation in a prospective setting. ",
        "Cryo-EM structure of the activated RET signaling complex reveals the importance of its cysteine-rich domain. Signaling through the receptor tyrosine kinase RET is essential during normal development. Both gain- and loss-of-function mutations are involved in a variety of diseases, yet the molecular details of receptor activation have remained elusive. We have reconstituted the complete extracellular region of the RET signaling complex together with Neurturin (NRTN) and GFR\u03b12 and determined its structure at 5.7-\u00c5 resolution by cryo-EM. The proteins form an assembly through RET-GFR\u03b12 and RET-NRTN interfaces. Two key interaction points required for RET extracellular domain binding were observed: (i) the calcium-binding site in RET that contacts GFR\u03b12 domain 3 and (ii) the RET cysteine-rich domain interaction with NRTN. The structure highlights the importance of the RET cysteine-rich domain and allows proposition of a model to explain how complex formation leads to RET receptor dimerization and its activation. This provides a framework for targeting RET activity and for further exploration of mechanisms underlying neurological diseases. ",
        "Mesothelioma Associated With the Use of Cosmetic Talc. OBJECTIVE: To describe 33 cases of malignant mesothelioma among individuals with no known asbestos exposure other than cosmetic talcum powder. METHODS: Cases were referred for medico-legal evaluation, and tissue digestions were performed in some cases. Tissue digestion for the six cases described was done according to standard methodology. RESULTS: Asbestos of the type found in talcum powder was found in all six cases evaluated. Talcum powder usage was the only source of asbestos for all 33 cases. CONCLUSIONS: Exposure to asbestos-contaminated talcum powders can cause mesothelioma. Clinicians should elicit a history of talcum powder usage in all patients presenting with mesothelioma. ",
        "PPP2R2A prostate cancer haploinsufficiency is associated with worse prognosis and a high vulnerability to B55\u03b1/PP2A reconstitution that triggers centrosome destabilization. The PPP2R2A gene encodes the B55\u03b1 regulatory subunit of PP2A. Here, we report that PPP2R2A is hemizygously lost in ~42% of prostate adenocarcinomas, correlating with reduced expression, poorer prognosis, and an increased incidence of hemizygous loss (>75%) in metastatic disease. Of note, PPP2R2A homozygous loss is less common (5%) and not increased at later tumor stages. Reduced expression of B55\u03b1 is also seen in prostate tumor tissue and cell lines. Consistent with the possibility that complete loss of PPP2R2A is detrimental in prostate tumors, PPP2R2A deletion in cells with reduced but present B55\u03b1 reduces cell proliferation by slowing progression through the cell cycle. Remarkably, B55\u03b1-low cells also appear addicted to lower B55\u03b1 expression, as even moderate increases in B55\u03b1 expression are toxic. Reconstitution of B55\u03b1 expression in prostate cancer (PCa) cell lines with low B55\u03b1 expression reduces proliferation, inhibits transformation and blocks xenograft tumorigenicity. Mechanistically, we show B55\u03b1 reconstitution reduces phosphorylation of proteins essential for centrosomal maintenance, and induces centrosome collapse and chromosome segregation failure; a first reported link between B55\u03b1/PP2A and the vertebrate centrosome. These effects are dependent on a prolonged metaphase/anaphase checkpoint and are lethal to PCa cells addicted to low levels of B55\u03b1. Thus, we propose the reduction in B55\u03b1 levels associated with hemizygous loss is necessary for centrosomal integrity in PCa cells, leading to selective lethality of B55\u03b1 reconstitution. Such a vulnerability could be targeted therapeutically in the large pool of patients with hemizygous PPP2R2A deletions, using pharmacologic approaches that enhance PP2A/B55\u03b1 activity. ",
        "Tea consumption and the risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality: The China-PAR project. AIMS: The role of tea consumption in the primary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease remains unclear in cohort studies. This prospective cohort study aimed to investigate the associations of tea consumption with the risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality. METHODS: We included 100,902 general Chinese adults from the project of Prediction for ASCVD Risk in China (China-PAR) in 15 provinces across China since 1998. Information on tea consumption was collected through standardized questionnaires. Outcomes were identified by interviewing study participants or their proxies, and checking hospital records and/or death certificates. Cox proportional hazard regression models were used to calculate hazard ratios and their corresponding 95% confidence intervals related to tea consumption. RESULTS: During a median follow-up of 7.3 years, 3683 atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease events, 1477 atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease deaths, and 5479 all-cause deaths were recorded. Compared with never or non-habitual tea drinkers, the hazard ratio and 95% confidence interval among habitual tea drinkers was 0.80 (0.75-0.87), 0.78 (0.69-0.88), and 0.85 (0.79-0.90) for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease incidence, atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease mortality, and all-cause mortality, respectively. Habitual tea drinkers had 1.41 years longer of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease-free years and 1.26 years longer of life expectancy at the index age of 50 years. The observed inverse associations were strengthened among participants who kept the habit during the follow-up period. CONCLUSION: Tea consumption was associated with reduced risks of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality, especially among those consistent habitual tea drinkers. ",
        "The Dynamic Transcriptional Cell Atlas of Testis Development during Human Puberty. The human testis undergoes dramatic developmental and structural changes during puberty, including proliferation and maturation of somatic niche cells, and the onset of spermatogenesis. To characterize this understudied process, we profiled and analyzed single-cell transcriptomes of \u223c10,000 testicular cells from four boys spanning puberty and compared them to those of infants and adults. During puberty, undifferentiated spermatogonia sequentially expand and differentiate prior to the initiation of gametogenesis. Notably, we identify a common pre-pubertal progenitor for Leydig and myoid cells and delineate candidate factors controlling pubertal differentiation. Furthermore, pre-pubertal Sertoli cells exhibit two distinct transcriptional states differing in metabolic profiles before converging to an alternative single mature population during puberty. Roles for testosterone in Sertoli cell maturation, antimicrobial peptide secretion, and spermatogonial differentiation are further highlighted through single-cell analysis of testosterone-suppressed transfemale testes. Taken together, our transcriptional atlas of the developing human testis provides multiple insights into developmental changes and key factors accompanying male puberty. ",
        "In vitro characterization of the human segmentation clock. The segmental organization of the vertebral column is established early in embryogenesis, when pairs of somites are rhythmically produced by the presomitic mesoderm (PSM). The tempo of somite formation is controlled by a molecular oscillator known as the segmentation clock1,2. Although this oscillator has been well-characterized in model organisms1,2, whether a similar oscillator exists in humans remains unknown. Genetic analyses of patients with severe spine segmentation defects have implicated several human orthologues of cyclic genes that are associated with the mouse segmentation clock, suggesting that this oscillator might be conserved in humans3. Here we show that human PSM cells derived in vitro-as well as those of the mouse4-recapitulate the oscillations of the segmentation clock. Human PSM cells oscillate with a period two times longer than that of mouse cells (5\u00a0h versus 2.5\u00a0h), but are similarly regulated by FGF, WNT, Notch and YAP\u00a0signalling5. Single-cell RNA sequencing reveals that mouse and human PSM cells in vitro follow a developmental trajectory similar to that of mouse PSM in vivo. Furthermore, we demonstrate that FGF signalling controls the phase and period of oscillations, expanding the role of this pathway beyond its classical interpretation in 'clock and wavefront' models1. Our work identifying the human segmentation clock represents an important milestone in understanding human developmental biology. ",
        "A fall in the previous 12\u00a0months predicts fracture in the subsequent 5\u00a0years in postmenopausal women. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate if a history of falls predicts future postmenopausal fractures and if this prediction variesaccording to frequency, mechanism, and severity of falls and site of fractures. METHODS: This study used data from OSTPRE prospective cohort. Total study population consisted of 8744 postmenopausal women (mean age 62.2\u00a0years) who responded to postal enquiry in 1999 (baseline) and in 2004 (follow-up). RESULTS: Women were classified by frequency (non/occasional/frequent fallers), mechanism (slip/nonslip), and severity (injurious/ non-injurious) of falls and fractures by site (major osteoporotic/other). A total of 1693 (19.4%) women reported a fall during the preceding 12\u00a0months in 1999; 812 a slip fall, 654 a nonslip, 379 an injurious fall, and 1308 a non-injurious fall. A total of 811 women (9.3%) sustained a fracture during the 5-year follow-up period (1999-2004); 431 major osteoporotic fractures and 380 other fractures. Compared with non-fallers, earlier falls predicted subsequent fractures with an OR of 1.41 (95% CI 1.19-1.67, p\u2009\u2264\u20090.001), 1.43 (95% CI 1.14-1.80, p\u2009=\u20090.002) for earlier slip falls, and 1.35 (95% CI 1.04-1.74, p\u2009=\u20090.02) for earlier nonslip falls. Earlier injurious falls predicted future fractures (OR\u2009=\u20091.64, 95% CI 1.21-2.23, p\u2009\u2264\u20090.01), especially other fractures (OR\u2009=\u20091.86, 95% CI 1.24-2.80, p\u2009\u2264\u20090.01), but not major osteoporotic fractures (OR\u2009=\u20091.37, 95% CI 0.89-2.10, p\u2009=\u20090.151). Fracture risk predictions for earlier non-injurious falls was OR\u2009=\u20091.36, 95% CI 1.12-1.64, p\u2009=\u20090.002. These risk patterns remain same after adjustments. CONCLUSION: History of falls (especially injurious falls) predicts subsequent fractures (mainly other fractures compared with major osteoporotic fractures) inpostmenopausal women. We aimed to investigate if history of falls (frequency, mechanism, and severity) is a predictor of future fractures in postmenopausal women. Our results indicate that history of falls (especially injurious falls) appeared to be an indicator for subsequent fracture overall. Earlier injurious falls were stronger predictors for future other fractures than for typical major osteoporotic fractures. ",
        "Solving the controversy of healthier organic fruit: Leaf wounding triggers distant gene expression response of polyphenol biosynthesis in strawberry fruit (Fragaria x ananassa). The claim that organic agriculture produces higher levels of phytochemicals has been controversial for decades. Using strawberries as a model crop in field conditions, a preharvest leaf wounding stress was applied to study the production of phytochemicals in fruits. As a result phenolic compounds (PCs) and total soluble sugars increased significantly, where specific phenylpropanoids showed increment up to 137% and several genes related to PCs biosynthesis and sugar transport were overexpressed. It was observed that the accumulation of PCs on fruits can be triggered by the application of wounding stress in a distant tissue and this accumulation is directly related to carbon partition and associated gene expression. This supports the idea that higher levels of healthy phytochemicals reported in organic fruits and vegetables could be due to the wounding component of the biotic stress attributed to insects to which the plant are exposed to.

        "The p75NTR Influences Cerebellar Circuit Development and Adult Behavior via Regulation of Cell Cycle Duration of Granule Cell Progenitors. Development of brain circuitry requires precise regulation and timing of proliferation and differentiation of neural progenitor cells. The p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR) is highly expressed in the proliferating granule cell precursors (GCPs) during development of the cerebellum. In a previous paper, we showed that proNT3 promoted GCP cell cycle exit via p75NTR. Here we used genetically modified rats and mice of both sexes to show that p75NTR regulates the duration of the GCP cell cycle, requiring activation of RhoA. Rats and mice lacking p75NTR have dysregulated GCP proliferation, with deleterious effects on cerebellar circuit development and behavioral consequences persisting into adulthood. In the absence of p75NTR, the GCP cell cycle is accelerated, leading to delayed cell cycle exit, prolonged GCP proliferation, increased glutamatergic input to Purkinje cells, and a deficit in delay eyeblink conditioning, a cerebellum-dependent form of learning. These results demonstrate the necessity of appropriate developmental timing of the cell cycle for establishment of proper connectivity and associated behavior.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT The cerebellum has been shown to be involved in numerous behaviors in addition to its classic association with motor function. Cerebellar function is disrupted in a variety of psychiatric disorders, including those on the autism spectrum. Here we show that the p75 neurotrophin receptor, which is abundantly expressed in the proliferating cerebellar granule cell progenitors, regulates the cell cycle of these progenitors. In the absence of this receptor, the cell cycle is dysregulated, leading to excessive progenitor proliferation, which alters the balance of inputs to Purkinje cells, disrupting the circuitry and leading to functional deficits that persist into adulthood.

        "Model-Based Nanoengineered Pharmacokinetics of Iron-Doped Copper Oxide for Nanomedical Applications. The progress in nanomedicine (NM) using nanoparticles (NPs) is mainly based on drug carriers for the delivery of classical chemotherapeutics. As low NM delivery rates limit therapeutic efficacy, an entirely different approach was investigated. A homologous series of engineered CuO NPs was designed for dual purposes (carrier and drug) with a direct chemical composition-biological functionality relationship. Model-based dissolution kinetics of CuO NPs in the cellular interior at post-exposure conditions were controlled through Fe-doping for intra/extra cellular Cu2+ and biological outcome. Through controlled ion release and reactions taking place in the cellular interior, tumors could be treated selectively, in\u2005vitro and in\u2005vivo. Locally administered NPs enabled tumor cells apoptosis and stimulated systemic anti-cancer immune responses. We clearly show therapeutic effects without tumor cells relapse post-treatment with 6\u2009% Fe-doped CuO NPs combined with myeloid-derived suppressor cell silencing. ",
        "Persistent genital arousal disorder: a special sense neuropathy. Introduction: Persistent genital arousal (PGAD) is a syndrome of unprovoked sexual arousal/orgasm of uncertain cause primarily reported in female patients. Most patients are referred for mental-health treatment, but as research suggests associations with neurological symptoms and conditions, there is need to analyze cases comprehensively evaluated by neurologists. Methods: The IRB waived consent requirements for this retrospective university-hospital study. We extracted and analyzed neurological symptoms, test, and treatment results from all qualifying participants' records and recontacted some for details. Results: All 10 participants were female; their PGAD symptoms began between ages 11 to 70 years. Two patterns emerged: 80% reported daily out-of-context sexual arousal episodes (\u226430/day) that usually included orgasm and 40% reported lesser, often longer-lasting, nonorgasmic arousals. Most also had symptoms consistent with sacral neuropathy-70% had urologic complaints and 60% had neuropathic perineal or buttock pain. In 90% of patients, diagnostic testing identified anatomically appropriate and plausibly causal neurological lesions. Sacral dorsal-root Tarlov cysts were most common (in 4), then sensory polyneuropathy (2). One had spina bifida occulta and another drug-withdrawal effect as apparently causal; lumbosacral disc herniation was suspected in another. Neurological treatments cured or significantly improved PGAD symptoms in 4/5 patients, including 2 cures. Conclusions: Although limited by small size and referral bias to neurologists, this series strengthens associations with Tarlov cysts and sensory polyneuropathy and suggests new ones. We hypothesize that many cases of PGAD are caused by unprovoked firing of C-fibers in the regional special sensory neurons that subserve sexual arousal. Some PGAD symptoms may share pathophysiologic mechanisms with neuropathic pain and itch. ",
        "The ecological cocktail party: Measuring brain activity during an auditory oddball task with background noise. Most experiments using EEG recordings take place in highly isolated and restricted environments, limiting their applicability to real-life scenarios. New technologies for mobile EEG are changing this by allowing EEG recording to take place outside of the laboratory. However, before results from experiments performed outside the laboratory can be fully understood, the effects of ecological stimuli on brain activity during cognitive tasks must be examined. In this experiment, participants performed an auditory oddball task while also listening to concurrent background noises of silence, white noise, and outdoor ecological sounds, as well as a condition in which the tones themselves were at a low volume. We found a significantly increased N1 and decreased P2 when participants performed the task with outdoor sounds and white noise in the background, with the largest differences in the outdoor sound condition. This modulation in the N1 and P2 replicates what we have previously found outside while people rode bicycles. No behavioral differences were found in response to the target tones. We interpret these modulations in early ERPs as indicative of sensory filtering of background sounds and that ecologically valid sounds require more filtering than simple synthetic sounds. Our results reveal that much of what we understand about the brain will need to be updated as cognitive neuroscience research begins to step outside of the lab. ",
        "A high-throughput microfluidic method for fabricating aligned collagen fibrils to study Keratocyte behavior. In vivo, keratocytes are surrounded by aligned type I collagen fibrils that are organized into lamellae. A growing body of literature suggests that the unique topography of the corneal stroma is an important regulator of keratocyte behavior. In this study we describe a microfluidic method to deposit aligned fibrils of type I collagen onto glass coverslips. This high-throughput method allowed for the simultaneous coating of up to eight substrates with aligned collagen fibrils. When these substrates were integrated into a PDMS microwell culture system they provided a platform for high-resolution imaging of keratocyte behavior. Through the use of wide-field fluorescence and differential interference contrast microscopy, we observed that the density of collagen fibrils deposited was dependent upon both the perfusion shear rate of collagen and the time of perfusion. In contrast, a similar degree of fibril alignment was observed over a range of shear rates. When primary normal rabbit keratocytes (NRK) were seeded on substrates with a high density of aligned collagen fibrils and cultured in the presence of platelet derived growth factor (PDGF) the keratocytes displayed an elongated cell body that was co-aligned with the underlying collagen fibrils. In contrast, when NRK were cultured on substrates with a low density of aligned collagen fibrils, the cells showed no preferential orientation. These results suggest that this simple and inexpensive method can provide a general platform to study how simultaneous exposure to topographical and soluble cues influence cell behavior. ",
        "Prediction of IDH and TERT promoter mutations in low-grade glioma from magnetic resonance images using a convolutional neural network. Identification of genotypes is crucial for treatment of glioma. Here, we developed a method to predict tumor genotypes using a pretrained convolutional neural network (CNN) from magnetic resonance (MR) images and compared the accuracy to that of a diagnosis based on conventional radiomic features and patient age. Multisite preoperative MR images of 164 patients with grade II/III glioma were grouped by IDH and TERT promoter (pTERT) mutations as follows: (1) IDH wild type, (2) IDH and pTERT co-mutations, (3) IDH mutant and pTERT wild type. We applied a CNN (AlexNet) to four types of MR sequence and obtained the CNN texture features to classify the groups with a linear support vector machine. The classification was also performed using conventional radiomic features and/or patient age. Using all features, we succeeded in classifying patients with an accuracy of 63.1%, which was significantly higher than the accuracy obtained from using either the radiomic features or patient age alone. In particular, prediction of the pTERT mutation was significantly improved by the CNN texture features. In conclusion, the pretrained CNN texture features capture the information of IDH and TERT genotypes in grade II/III gliomas better than the conventional radiomic features. ",
        "Disparities in Documented Diagnoses of Autism Spectrum Disorder Based on Demographic, Individual, and Service Factors. The objectives of our study were to (a) report how many children met an autism spectrum disorder (ASD) surveillance definition but had no clinical diagnosis of ASD in health or education records and (b) evaluate differences in demographic, individual, and service factors between children with and without a documented ASD diagnosis. ASD surveillance was conducted in selected areas of Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, Georgia, Maryland, Minnesota, Missouri, New Jersey, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Wisconsin. Children were defined as having ASD if sufficient social and behavioral deficits and/or an ASD diagnosis were noted in health and/or education records. Among 4,498 children, 1,135 (25%) had ASD indicators without having an ASD diagnosis. Of those 1,135 children without a documented ASD diagnosis, 628 (55%) were not known to receive ASD services in public school. Factors associated with not having a clinical diagnosis of ASD were non-White race, no intellectual disability, older age at first developmental concern, older age at first developmental evaluation, special education eligibility other than ASD, and need for fewer supports. These results highlight the importance of reducing disparities in the diagnosis of children with ASD characteristics so that appropriate interventions can be promoted across communities. Autism Res 2020, 13: 464-473. \u00a9 2019 International Society for AutismResearch,Wiley Periodicals, Inc. LAY SUMMARY: Children who did not have a clinical diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) documented in health or education records were more likely to be non-White and have fewer developmental problems than children with a clinical diagnosis of ASD. They were brought to the attention of healthcare providers at older ages and needed fewer supports than children with a clinical diagnosis of ASD. All children with ASD symptoms who meet diagnostic criteria should be given a clinical diagnosis so they can receive treatment specific to their needs. ",
        "Parents Still Matter: The Influence of Parental Enforcement of Bedtime on Adolescents' Depressive Symptoms. STUDY OBJECTIVES: The aim of the current study was to test a multilevel mediation model that examined how adolescent sleep duration might be linked to depressive symptoms via their daytime energy levels. Furthermore, the study examined how parents' enforcement of various types of bedtime rules predicted the duration of adolescent sleep. METHODS: A total of 193 adolescent (ages 14-17; Mage = 15.7 years old, SD = .94; 54.4% female; 71% Caucasian) and parent dyads completed baseline, online surveys, and adolescents also completed online 7-day, twice-daily (i.e., morning and evening) reports of their sleep duration (morning diary) and their energy levels and depressive symptoms throughout the day (evening diary). Parents (Mage = 47.6 years old, SD = 5.4; 80% female) completed assessments of enforcement of bedtime-related rules (i.e., bedtime, cessation of electronic media usage, prohibiting afternoon/evening caffeine consumption). Multilevel modeling enabled the testing of the mediation model both at the between-person level and within individuals. RESULTS: Results suggested that adolescents' energy levels mediated the association between adolescents' sleep duration and depressive symptoms. Furthermore, both greater enforcement of bedtimes and later school start times predicted longer sleep durations for adolescents, and were indirectly associated with adolescents' depressive symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: These findings underscore the importance of adolescents obtaining sufficient sleep to support their mental health and suggest a critical point of intervention for preventing or decreasing insufficient sleep. Given the diverse threats to adolescents' sleep as well as adolescents' desire for greater independence, collaborative, autonomy-promoting bedtime limit-setting is recommended to support adolescents' well-being.

        "Cardiac muscle thin filament structures reveal calcium regulatory mechanism. Contraction of striated muscles is driven by cyclic interactions of myosin head projecting from the thick filament with actin filament and is regulated by Ca2+ released from sarcoplasmic reticulum. Muscle thin filament consists of actin, tropomyosin and troponin, and Ca2+ binding to troponin triggers conformational changes of troponin and tropomyosin to allow actin-myosin interactions. However, the structural changes involved in this regulatory mechanism remain unknown. Here we report the structures of human cardiac muscle thin filament in the absence and presence of Ca2+ by electron cryomicroscopy. Molecular models in the two states built based on available crystal structures reveal the structures of a C-terminal region of troponin I and an N-terminal region of troponin T in complex with the head-to-tail junction of tropomyosin together with the troponin core on actin filament. Structural changes of the thin filament upon Ca2+ binding now reveal the mechanism of Ca2+ regulation of muscle contraction. ",
        "Functional Electron Microscopy, \"Flash and Freeze,\" of Identified Cortical Synapses in Acute Brain Slices. How structural and functional properties of synapses relate to each other is a fundamental question in neuroscience. Electrophysiology has elucidated mechanisms of synaptic transmission, and electron microscopy (EM) has provided insight into morphological properties of synapses. Here we describe an enhanced method for functional EM (\"flash and freeze\"), combining optogenetic stimulation with high-pressure freezing. We demonstrate that the improved method can be applied to intact networks in acute brain slices and organotypic slice cultures from mice. As a proof of concept, we probed vesicle pool changes during synaptic transmission at the hippocampal mossy fiber-CA3 pyramidal neuron synapse. Our findings show overlap of the docked vesicle pool and the functionally defined readily releasable pool and provide evidence of fast endocytosis at this synapse. Functional EM with acute slices and slice cultures has the potential to reveal the structural and functional mechanisms of transmission in intact, genetically perturbed, and disease-affected synapses.

        "Comprehensive Proteomics Analysis of Stressed Human Islets Identifies GDF15 as a Target for Type 1 Diabetes Intervention. Type 1 diabetes (T1D) results from the progressive loss of \u03b2 cells, a process propagated by pro-inflammatory cytokine signaling that disrupts the balance between pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins. To identify proteins involved in this process, we\u00a0performed comprehensive proteomics of human pancreatic islets treated with interleukin-1\u03b2 and\u00a0interferon-\u03b3, leading to the identification of 11,324 proteins, of which 387 were significantly regulated by treatment. We then tested the function of growth/differentiation factor 15 (GDF15), which\u00a0was repressed by the treatment. We found that GDF15 translation was blocked during inflammation, and it was depleted in islets from individuals with T1D. The addition of exogenous GDF15 inhibited interleukin-1\u03b2+interferon-\u03b3-induced apoptosis of human islets. Administration of GDF15 reduced by 53% the incidence of diabetes in NOD mice. Our approach provides a unique resource for the identification of the human islet proteins regulated by cytokines and was effective in discovering a potential target for T1D therapy. ",
        "Alternatives to Traditional Cast Immobilization in Pediatric Patients. Casts are commonly used for fracture management and postoperative immobilization in pediatric patients. However, cast immobilization is not without complications (eg, thermal injuries, pressure sores, infection, and neurovascular injury) and may be associated with additional costs and increased loss of school/work days for cast removal or other complications. The disadvantages of traditional casting can be minimized by alternative management strategies: waterproof casts to facilitate bathing and swimming; a Pavlik harness in infants, a single-leg spica cast, or flexible intramedullary nails to avoid complications with double-leg spica casts for femur fractures; and braces or splints to manage buckle and minimally displaced distal radius fractures, toddler's fractures, and stable foot/ankle fractures.

        "Sadness, but not all negative emotions, heightens addictive substance use. Do negative feelings in general trigger addictive behavior, or do specific emotions play a stronger role? Testing these alternative accounts of emotion and decision making, we drew on the Appraisal Tendency Framework to predict that sadness, specifically, rather than negative mood, generally, would 1) increase craving, impatience, and actual addictive substance use and 2) do so through mechanisms selectively heightened by sadness. Using a nationally representative, longitudinal survey, study 1 (n = 10,685) revealed that sadness, but not other negative emotions (i.e., fear, anger, shame), reliably predicted current smoking as well as relapsing 20 years later. Study 2 (n = 425) used an experimental design, and found further support for emotion specificity: Sadness, but not disgust, increased self-reported craving relative to a neutral state. Studies 3 and 4 (n = 918) introduced choice behavior as outcome variables, revealing that sadness causally increased impatience for cigarette puffs. Moreover, study 4 revealed that the effect of sadness on impatience was more fully explained by concomitant appraisals of self-focus, which are specific to sadness, than by concomitant appraisals of negative valence, which are general to all negative emotions. Importantly, study 4 also examined the topography of actual smoking behavior, finding that experimentally induced sadness (as compared to neutral emotion) causally increased the volume and duration of cigarette puffs inhaled. Together, the present studies provide support for a more nuanced model regarding the effects of emotion on tobacco use, in particular, as well as on addictive behavior, in general. ",
        "Structures of lipoprotein signal peptidase II from Staphylococcus aureus complexed with antibiotics globomycin and myxovirescin. Antimicrobial resistance is a major global threat that calls for new antibiotics. Globomycin and myxovirescin are two natural antibiotics that target the lipoprotein-processing enzyme, LspA, thereby compromising the integrity of the bacterial cell envelope. As part of a project aimed at understanding their mechanism of action and for drug development, we provide high-resolution crystal structures of the enzyme from the human pathogen methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) complexed with globomycin and with myxovirescin. Our results reveal an instance of convergent evolution. The two antibiotics possess different molecular structures. Yet, they appear to inhibit identically as non-cleavable tetrahedral intermediate analogs. Remarkably, the two antibiotics superpose along nineteen contiguous atoms that interact similarly with LspA. This 19-atom motif recapitulates a part of the substrate lipoprotein in its proposed binding mode. Incorporating this motif into a scaffold with suitable pharmacokinetic properties should enable the development of effective antibiotics with built-in resistance hardiness. ",
        "Prognostic implications of 5-hydroxymethylcytosines from circulating cell-free DNA in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. An elevated level of circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) has been associated with tumor bulk and poor prognosis in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), but the tumor-specific molecular alterations in cfDNA with prognostic significance remain unclear. We investigated the association between 5-hydroxymethylcytosines (5hmC), a mark of active demethylation and gene activation, in cfDNA from blood plasma and prognosis in newly diagnosed DLBCL patients. We used 5hmC-Seal, a highly sensitive chemical labeling technique, to profile genome-wide 5hmC in plasma cfDNA from 48 DLBCL patients at the University of Chicago Medical Center between 2010 and 2013. Patients were followed through 31 December 2017. We found a distinct genomic distribution of 5hmC in cfDNA marking tissue-specific enhancers, consistent with their putative roles in gene regulation. The 5hmC profiles in cfDNA differed by cell of origin and were associated with clinical prognostic factors, including stage and the International Prognostic Index. We developed a 29 gene-based weighted prognostic score (wp-score) for predicting event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) by applying the elastic net regularization on the Cox proportional-hazards model. The wp-scores outperformed (eg, prognostic accuracy, sensitivity, specificity) established prognostic factors in predicting EFS and OS. In multivariate Cox models, patients with high wp-scores had worse EFS (hazard ratio, 9.17; 95% confidence interval, 2.01-41.89; P = .004) compared with those in the low-risk group. Our findings suggest that the 5hmC signatures in cfDNA at the time of diagnosis are associated with clinical outcomes and may provide a novel minimally invasive prognostic approach for DLBCL. ",
        "Mouse genetics reveals Barttin as a genetic modifier of Joubert syndrome. Genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity and the lack of sufficiently large patient cohorts pose a significant challenge to understanding genetic associations in rare disease. Here we identify Bsnd (alias Barttin) as a genetic modifier of cystic kidney disease in Joubert syndrome, using a Cep290-deficient mouse model to recapitulate the phenotypic variability observed in patients by mixing genetic backgrounds in a controlled manner and performing genome-wide analysis of these mice. Experimental down-regulation of Bsnd in the parental mouse strain phenocopied the severe cystic kidney phenotype. A common polymorphism within human BSND significantly associates with kidney disease severity in a patient cohort with CEP290 mutations. The striking phenotypic modifications we describe are a timely reminder of the value of mouse models and highlight the significant contribution of genetic background. Furthermore, if appropriately managed, this can be exploited as a powerful tool to elucidate mechanisms underlying human disease heterogeneity. ",
        "Sensing of HIV-1 by TLR8 activates human T cells and reverses latency. During HIV infection, cell-to-cell transmission results in endosomal uptake of the virus by target CD4+\u00a0T cells and potential exposure of the viral ssRNA genome to endosomal Toll-like receptors (TLRs). TLRs are instrumental in activating inflammatory responses in innate immune cells, but their function in adaptive immune cells is less well understood. Here we show that synthetic ligands of TLR8 boosted T cell receptor signaling, resulting in increased cytokine production and upregulation of surface activation markers. Adjuvant TLR8 stimulation, but not TLR7 or TLR9, further promoted T helper cell differentiation towards Th1 and Th17. In addition, we found that endosomal HIV induced cytokine secretion from CD4+ T cells in a TLR8-specific manner. TLR8 engagement also enhanced HIV-1 replication and potentiated the reversal of latency in patient-derived T cells. The adjuvant TLR8 activity in T cells can contribute to viral dissemination in the lymph node and low-grade inflammation in HIV patients. In addition, it can potentially be exploited for therapeutic targeting and vaccine development. ",
        "NaCl Nanoparticles as a Cancer Therapeutic. Many inorganic nanoparticles are prepared and their behaviors in living systems are investigated. Yet, common electrolytes such as NaCl are left out of this campaign. The underlying assumption is that electrolyte nanoparticles will quickly dissolve in water and behave similarly as their constituent salts. Herein, this preconception is challenged. The study shows that NaCl nanoparticles (SCNPs) but not salts are highly toxic to cancer cells. This is because SCNPs enter cells through endocytosis, bypassing cell regulations on ion transport. When dissolved inside cancer cells, SCNPs cause a surge of osmolarity and rapid cell lysis. Interestingly, normal cells are much more resistant to the treatment due to their relatively low sodium levels. Unlike conventional chemotherapeutics, SCNPs cause immunogenic cell death or ICD. In vivo studies show that SCNPs not only kill cancer cells, but also boost an anticancer immunity. The discovery opens up a new perspective on nanoparticle-based therapeutics. ",
        "Bisphenol S rapidly depresses heart function through estrogen receptor-\u03b2 and decreases phospholamban phosphorylation in a sex-dependent manner. The health effects of the endocrine disruptor Bisphenol A (BPA) led to its partial replacement with Bisphenol S (BPS) in several products including food containers, toys, and thermal paper receipts. The acute effects of BPS on myocardial contractility are unknown. We perfused mouse hearts from both sexes for 15\u2009min with physiologically relevant doses of BPS or BPA. In females BPS (1\u2009nM) decreased left ventricular systolic pressure by 5\u2009min, whereas BPA (1\u2009nM) effects were delayed to 10\u2009min. BPS effects in male mice were attenuated. In both sexes ER-\u03b2 antagonism abolished the effects of BPS. Cardiac myofilament function was not impacted by BPS or BPA in either sex, although there were sex-dependent differences in troponin I phosphorylation. BPS increased phospholamban phosphorylation at S16 only in female hearts, whereas BPA reduced phosphorylation in both sexes. BPA decreased phospholamban phosphorylation at T17 in both sexes while BPS caused dephosphorylation only in females. This is the first study to compare sex differences in the acute myocardial response to physiologically relevant levels of BPS and BPA, and demonstrates a rapid ability of both to depress heart function. This study raises concerns about the safety of BPS as a replacement for BPA. ",
        "Persistent genital arousal disorder: a special sense neuropathy. Introduction: Persistent genital arousal (PGAD) is a syndrome of unprovoked sexual arousal/orgasm of uncertain cause primarily reported in female patients. Most patients are referred for mental-health treatment, but as research suggests associations with neurological symptoms and conditions, there is need to analyze cases comprehensively evaluated by neurologists. Methods: The IRB waived consent requirements for this retrospective university-hospital study. We extracted and analyzed neurological symptoms, test, and treatment results from all qualifying participants' records and recontacted some for details. Results: All 10 participants were female; their PGAD symptoms began between ages 11 to 70 years. Two patterns emerged: 80% reported daily out-of-context sexual arousal episodes (\u226430/day) that usually included orgasm and 40% reported lesser, often longer-lasting, nonorgasmic arousals. Most also had symptoms consistent with sacral neuropathy-70% had urologic complaints and 60% had neuropathic perineal or buttock pain. In 90% of patients, diagnostic testing identified anatomically appropriate and plausibly causal neurological lesions. Sacral dorsal-root Tarlov cysts were most common (in 4), then sensory polyneuropathy (2). One had spina bifida occulta and another drug-withdrawal effect as apparently causal; lumbosacral disc herniation was suspected in another. Neurological treatments cured or significantly improved PGAD symptoms in 4/5 patients, including 2 cures. Conclusions: Although limited by small size and referral bias to neurologists, this series strengthens associations with Tarlov cysts and sensory polyneuropathy and suggests new ones. We hypothesize that many cases of PGAD are caused by unprovoked firing of C-fibers in the regional special sensory neurons that subserve sexual arousal. Some PGAD symptoms may share pathophysiologic mechanisms with neuropathic pain and itch. ",
        "Regulatory T-cell Depletion Alters the Tumor Microenvironment and Accelerates Pancreatic Carcinogenesis. Regulatory T cells (Treg) are abundant in human and mouse pancreatic cancer. To understand the contribution to the immunosuppressive microenvironment, we depleted Tregs in a mouse model of pancreatic cancer. Contrary to our expectations, Treg depletion failed to relieve immunosuppression and led to accelerated tumor progression. We show that Tregs are a key source of TGF\u03b2 ligands and, accordingly, their depletion reprogramed the fibroblast population, with loss of tumor-restraining, smooth muscle actin-expressing fibroblasts. Conversely, we observed an increase in chemokines Ccl3, Ccl6, and Ccl8 leading to increased myeloid cell recruitment, restoration of immune suppression, and promotion of carcinogenesis, an effect that was inhibited by blockade of the common CCL3/6/8 receptor CCR1. Further, Treg depletion unleashed pathologic CD4+ T-cell responses. Our data point to new mechanisms regulating fibroblast differentiation in pancreatic cancer and support the notion that fibroblasts are a heterogeneous population with different and opposing functions in pancreatic carcinogenesis. SIGNIFICANCE: Here, we describe an unexpected cross-talk between Tregs and fibroblasts in pancreatic cancer. Treg depletion resulted in differentiation of inflammatory fibroblast subsets, in turn driving infiltration of myeloid cells through CCR1, thus uncovering a potentially new therapeutic approach to relieve immunosuppression in pancreatic cancer.See related commentary by Aykut et al., p. 345.This article is highlighted in the In This Issue feature, p. 327.

        "Infant and Adult Brains Are Coupled to the Dynamics of Natural Communication. Infancy is the foundational period for learning from adults, and the dynamics of the social environment have long been considered central to children's development. Here, we reveal a novel, naturalistic approach for studying live interactions between infants and adults. Using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), we simultaneously and continuously measured the brains of infants (N = 18; 9-15 months of age) and an adult while they communicated and played with each other. We found that time-locked neural coupling within dyads was significantly greater when dyad members interacted with each other than with control individuals. In addition, we characterized the dynamic relationship between neural activation and the moment-to-moment fluctuations of mutual gaze, joint attention to objects, infant emotion, and adult speech prosody. This investigation advances what is currently known about how the brains and behaviors of infants both shape and reflect those of adults during real-life communication. ",
        "Epidermal autonomous VEGFA/Flt1/Nrp1 functions mediate psoriasis-like disease. Psoriasis is a common chronic skin disorder characterized by keratinocyte hyperproliferation with altered differentiation accompanied by inflammation and increased angiogenesis. It remains unclear whether the first events that initiate psoriasis development occur in keratinocytes or inflammatory cells. Here, using different psoriasis mouse models, we showed that conditional deletion of Flt1 or Nrp1 in epidermal cells inhibited psoriasis mediated by Vegfa overexpression or c-Jun/JunB deletion. Administration of anti-Nrp1 antibody reverted the psoriasis phenotype. Using transcriptional and chromatin profiling of epidermal cells following Vegfa overexpression together with Flt1 or Nrp1 deletion, we identified the gene regulatory network regulated by Vegfa/Nrp1/Flt1 during psoriasis development and uncovered a key role of Fosl1 in regulating the chromatin remodeling mediated by Vegfa overexpression in keratinocytes. In conclusion, our study identifies an epidermal autonomous function of Vegfa/Nrp1/Flt1 that mediates psoriatic-like disease and demonstrates the clinical relevance of blocking Vegfa/Nrp1/Flt1 axis in psoriasis.

        "\"Fake it till You Make it\"! Contaminating Rubber Hands (\"Multisensory Stimulation Therapy\") to Treat Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder. Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a deeply enigmatic psychiatric condition associated with immense suffering worldwide. Efficacious therapies for OCD, like exposure and response prevention (ERP), are sometimes poorly tolerated by patients. As many as 25% of patients refuse to initiate ERP mainly because they are too anxious to follow exposure procedures. Accordingly, we proposed a simple and tolerable (immersive yet indirect) low-cost technique for treating OCD that we call \"multisensory stimulation therapy.\" This method involves contaminating a rubber hand during the so-called \"rubber hand illusion\" (RHI) in which tactile sensations may be perceived as arising from a fake hand. Notably, Jalal et al. (2015) showed that such fake hand contamination during the RHI provokes powerful disgust reactions in healthy volunteers. In the current study, we explored the therapeutic potential of this novel approach. OCD patients (n = 29) watched as their hidden real hand was being stroked together with a visible fake hand; either synchronously (inducing the RHI; i.e., the experimental condition; n = 16) or asynchronously (i.e., the control condition; n = 13). After 5 min of tactile stimulation, the rubber hand was contaminated with fake feces, simulating conventional exposure therapy. Intriguingly, results suggested sensory assimilation of contamination sensations into the body image via the RHI: patients undergoing synchronous stimulation did not report greater contamination sensations when the fake hand was initially contaminated relative to asynchronous stroking. But contrary to expectations, they did so after the rubber hand had been contaminated for 5 min, as assessed via disgust facial expressions (a secondary outcome) and in vivo exposure (upon discontinuing the illusion). Further, to our surprise, synchronous and asynchronous stroking induced an equally vivid and fast-emerging illusion, which helps explain why both conditions initially (5 min after initiating tactile stimulation) provoked contamination reactions of equal magnitude. This study is the first to suggest heightened malleability of body image in OCD. Importantly, it may pave the way for a tolerable technique for the treatment of OCD-highly suitable for poorly resourced and emergency settings, including low-income and developing countries with minimal access to high-tech solutions like virtual reality.

        "Association Between 21-Gene Assay Recurrence Score and Locoregional Recurrence Rates in Patients With Node-Positive Breast Cancer. Importance: The 21-gene assay recurrence score is increasingly used to personalize treatment recommendations for systemic therapy in postmenopausal women with estrogen receptor (ER)- or progesterone receptor (PR)-positive, node-positive breast cancer; however, the relevance of the 21-gene assay to radiotherapy decisions remains uncertain. Objective: To examine the association between recurrence score and locoregional recurrence (LRR) in a postmenopausal patient population treated with adjuvant chemotherapy followed by tamoxifen or tamoxifen alone. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study was a retrospective analysis of the Southwest Oncology Group S8814, a phase 3 randomized clinical trial of postmenopausal women with ER/PR-positive, node-positive breast cancer treated with tamoxifen alone, chemotherapy followed by tamoxifen, or concurrent tamoxifen and chemotherapy. Patients at North American clinical centers were enrolled from June 1989 to July 1995. Medical records from patients with recurrence score information were reviewed for LRR and radiotherapy use. Primary analysis included 316 patients and excluded 37 who received both mastectomy and radiotherapy, 9 who received breast-conserving surgery without documented radiotherapy, and 5 with unknown surgical type. All analyses were performed from January 22, 2016, to August 9, 2019. Main Outcomes and Measures: The LRR was defined as a recurrence in the breast; chest wall; or axillary, infraclavicular, supraclavicular, or internal mammary lymph nodes. Time to LRR was tested with log-rank tests and Cox proportional hazards regression for multivariate models. Results: The final cohort of this study comprised 316 women with a mean (range) age of 60.4 (44-81) years. Median (interquartile range) follow-up for those without LRR was 8.7 (7.0-10.2) years. Seven LRR events (5.8%) among 121 patients with low recurrence score and 27 LRR events (13.8%) among 195 patients with intermediate or high recurrence score occurred. The estimated 10-year cumulative incidence rates were 9.7% for those with a low recurrence score and 16.5% for the group with intermediate or high recurrence score (P\u2009=\u2009.02). Among patients who had a mastectomy without radiotherapy (n\u2009=\u2009252), the differences in the 10-year actuarial LRR rates remained significant: 7.7 % for the low recurrence score group vs 16.8% for the intermediate or high recurrence score group (P\u2009=\u2009.03). A multivariable model controlling for randomized treatment, number of positive nodes, and surgical type showed that a higher recurrence score was prognostic for LRR (hazard ratio [HR],\u20092.36; 95% CI, 1.02-5.45; P\u2009=\u2009.04). In a subset analysis of patients with a mastectomy and 1 to 3 involved nodes who did not receive radiation therapy, the group with a low recurrence score had a 1.5% rate of LRR, whereas the group with an intermediate or high recurrence score had a 11.1% LRR (P\u2009=\u2009.051). Conclusions and Relevance: This study found that higher recurrence scores were associated with increased LRR after adjustment for treatment, type of surgical procedure, and number of positive nodes. This finding suggests that the recurrence score may be used, along with accepted clinical variables, to assess the risk of LRR during radiotherapy decision-making. ",
        "Association of Adolescent Sport Participation With Cognition and Depressive Symptoms in Early Adulthood. Background: Recent studies have associated sport-related concussion with depression and impaired cognitive ability later in life in former professional football players. However, population studies with two 1950s-era cohorts did not find an association between high school football participation and impaired cognition or depressive symptoms in late adulthood. Purpose/Hypothesis: This study assessed whether actual/intended participation in contact sports during adolescence had an adverse effect on participants' cognition or depressive symptoms in early adulthood. We hypothesized that there would not be an association. Study Design: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 2. Methods: This study used a subsample (n = 10,951) from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health), a nationally (United States) representative prospective cohort study following participants through 4 waves of data collection from 1994 through 2008. Participants were categorized as actual/intended participation in no sports, noncontact sports only, and contact sports. We constructed 6 multivariate and logistic regression models predicting word recall, number recall, modified Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale, depression diagnosis, suicide ideation, and suicide attempts at wave IV as a function of sport participation during wave I. Sport participation was treated as a factor with the referent category noncontact sports. This analysis was repeated on a males-only sample (n = 5008). In the males-only analysis, participants were classified as actual/intended participation in no sports, noncontact sports, contact sports other than American football, and American football. The referent category remained noncontact sports. Results: Intention to participate in contact sports was not significantly associated with any of the outcomes in the full-sample analysis. Intention to participate in football was significantly associated with a reduced odds of depression diagnosis in adulthood (odds ratio, 0.70; P = .02) when compared with noncontact sports participation in the males-only sample. Football was not significantly associated with impaired cognitive ability, increased depressive symptoms, or increased suicide ideation. Conclusion: Actual/intended participation in contact sports during adolescence did not adversely affect Add Health participants' cognition or depressive symptoms in young adulthood. ",

        "Macropinocytosis drives T cell growth by sustaining the activation of mTORC1. Macropinocytosis is an evolutionarily-conserved, large-scale, fluid-phase form of endocytosis that has been ascribed different functions including antigen presentation in macrophages and dendritic cells, regulation of receptor density in neurons, and regulation of tumor growth under nutrient-limiting conditions. However, whether macropinocytosis regulates the expansion of non-transformed mammalian cells is unknown. Here we show that primary mouse and human T cells engage in macropinocytosis that increases in magnitude upon T cell activation to support T cell growth even under amino acid (AA) replete conditions. Mechanistically, macropinocytosis in T cells provides access of extracellular AA to an endolysosomal compartment to sustain activation of the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) that promotes T cell growth. Our results thus implicate a function of macropinocytosis in mammalian cell growth beyond Ras-transformed tumor cells via sustained mTORC1 activation. ",
        "Bilingual Peptide Nucleic Acids: Encoding the Languages of Nucleic Acids and Proteins in a Single Self-Assembling Biopolymer. Nucleic acids and proteins are the fundamental biopolymers that support all life on Earth. Nucleic acids store large amounts of information in nucleobase sequences while peptides and proteins utilize diverse amino acid functional groups to adopt complex structures and perform wide-ranging activities. Although nature has evolved machinery to read the nucleic acid code and translate it into amino acid code, the extant biopolymers are restricted to encoding amino acid or nucleotide sequences separately, limiting their potential applications in medicine and biotechnology. Here we describe the design, synthesis, and stimuli-responsive assembly behavior of a bilingual biopolymer that integrates both amino acid and nucleobase sequences into a single peptide nucleic acid (PNA) scaffold to enable tunable storage and retrieval of tertiary structural behavior and programmable molecular recognition capabilities. Incorporation of a defined sequence of amino acid side-chains along the PNA backbone yields amphiphiles having a \"protein code\" that directs self-assembly into micellar architectures in aqueous conditions. However, these amphiphiles also carry a \"nucleotide code\" such that subsequent introduction of a complementary RNA strand induces a sequence-specific disruption of assemblies through hybridization. Together, these properties establish bilingual PNA as a powerful biopolymer that combines two information systems to harness structural responsiveness and sequence recognition. The PNA scaffold and our synthetic system are highly generalizable, enabling fabrication of a wide array of user-defined peptide and nucleotide sequence combinations for diverse future biomedical and nanotechnology applications.

        "Spinal cord motor neuron plasticity accompanies second-degree burn injury and chronic pain. Burn injuries and associated complications present a major public health challenge. Many burn patients develop clinically intractable complications, including pain and other sensory disorders. Recent evidence has shown that dendritic spine neuropathology in spinal cord sensory and motor neurons accompanies central nervous system (CNS) or peripheral nervous system (PNS) trauma and disease. However, no research has investigated similar dendritic spine neuropathologies following a cutaneous thermal burn injury. In this retrospective investigation, we analyzed dendritic spine morphology and localization in alpha-motor neurons innervating a burn-injured area of the body (hind paw). To identify a molecular regulator of these dendritic spine changes, we further profiled motor neuron dendritic spines in adult mice treated with romidepsin, a clinically approved Pak1-inhibitor, or vehicle control at two postburn time points: Day 6 immediately after treatment, or Day 10 following drug withdrawal. In control treated mice, we observed an overall increase in dendritic spine density, including structurally mature spines with mushroom-shaped morphology. Pak1-inhibitor treatment reduced injury-induced changes to similar levels observed in animals without burn injury. The effectiveness of the Pak1-inhibitor was durable, since normalized dendritic spine profiles remained as long as 4\u00a0days despite drug withdrawal. This study is the first report of evidence demonstrating that a second-degree burn injury significantly affects motor neuron structure within the spinal cord. Furthermore, our results support the opportunity to study dendritic spine dysgenesis as a novel avenue to clarify the complexities of neurological disease following traumatic injury. ",
        "Generation of mesenchyme free intestinal organoids from human induced pluripotent stem cells. Efficient generation of human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived human intestinal organoids (HIOs) would facilitate the development of in vitro models for a variety of diseases that affect the gastrointestinal tract, such as inflammatory bowel disease or Cystic Fibrosis. Here, we report a directed differentiation protocol for the generation of mesenchyme-free HIOs that can be primed towards more colonic or proximal intestinal lineages in serum-free defined conditions. Using a CDX2eGFP iPSC knock-in reporter line to track the emergence of hindgut progenitors, we follow the kinetics of CDX2 expression throughout directed differentiation, enabling the purification of intestinal progenitors and robust generation of mesenchyme-free organoids expressing characteristic markers of small intestinal or colonic epithelium. We employ HIOs generated in this way to measure CFTR function using cystic fibrosis patient-derived iPSC lines before and after correction of the CFTR mutation, demonstrating their future potential for disease modeling and therapeutic screening applications.

        "20-year follow-up study of physical morbidity and mortality in relationship to antipsychotic treatment in a nationwide cohort of 62,250 patients with schizophrenia (FIN20). Antipsychotics are effective in preventing relapses of schizophrenia, but it is generally believed that their long-term use is harmful for patients' physical well-being. However, there are no long-term studies which have verified this view. This nationwide, register-based cohort study aimed to assess the risk of hospitalization due to physical health problems, as a marker for severe physical morbidity, and the risk of all-cause mortality, as well as of cardiovascular and suicidal death, associated with antipsychotic use in all patients treated for schizophrenia in inpatient care between 1972 and 2014 in Finland (N=62,250), with up to 20 years of follow-up (median: 14.1 years). The use of antipsychotic drugs (i.e., use of any antipsychotic compared with non-use) and the use of specific antipsychotics were investigated, and outcomes were somatic and cardiovascular hospitalization, and all-cause, cardiovascular and suicide death. Hospitalization-based outcomes were analyzed by a within-individual design to eliminate selection bias, comparing use and non-use periods in the same individual by stratified Cox model. Mortality outcomes were assessed by traditional between-individual Cox multivariate models. The adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) for any somatic hospitalization and cardiovascular hospitalization were 1.00 (95% CI: 0.98-1.03) and 1.00 (95% CI: 0.92-1.07) during use of any antipsychotic compared to non-exposure periods within the same individual. The aHRs were 0.48 (95% CI: 0.46-0.51) for all-cause mortality, 0.62 (95% CI: 0.57-0.67) for cardiovascular mortality, and 0.52 (95% CI: 0.43-0.62) for suicide mortality during use vs. non-use of any antipsychotic. The most beneficial\u00a0mortality outcome was associated with use of clozapine in terms of all-cause (aHR=0.39, 95% CI: 0.36-0.43), cardiovascular (aHR=0.55, 95% CI: 0.47-0.64) and suicide mortality (aHR=0.21, 95% CI: 0.15-0.29). The cumulative mortality rates during maximum follow-up of 20 years were 46.2% for no antipsychotic use, 25.7% for any antipsychotic use, and 15.6% for clozapine use. These data suggest that long-term antipsychotic use does not increase severe physical morbidity leading to hospitalization, and is associated with substantially decreased mortality, especially among patients treated with clozapine.

        "The Association between Popular Diets and Serum Testosterone among Men in the United States. PURPOSE: We examined the relationship of the serum testosterone level to low fat, Mediterranean and low carbohydrate diets in a large, nationally representative patient sample. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We queried the NHANES (National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey) from 1999 to 2000, 2003 to 2004 and 2011 to 2012. Men 18 to 80 years old who completed the 2-day dietary history and underwent serum testosterone testing were included in analysis. Diets were categorized as low fat, Mediterranean, low carbohydrate or nonrestrictive. Multivariable modeling was used to determine the relationship between diet and serum testosterone. RESULTS: Of the 3,128 men who met study inclusion criteria 457 (14.6%) and 764 (24.4%) met the criteria for a low fat and a Mediterranean diet, respectively. Only 2 men (less than 0.1%) met the criteria for a low carbohydrate diet, which was removed from further analysis. Mean \u00b1 SD serum testosterone was 435.5 \u00b1 6.7 ng/dl. Mean testosterone was lower among men with a low fat diet (410.8 \u00b1 8.1 vs 443.5 \u00b1 7.3, p=0.005) and a Mediterranean diet (412.9 \u00b1 9.1 vs 443.5 \u00b1 7.3, p=0.002). Multivariable analysis controlling for age, body mass index, activity level, diabetes, comorbidities and prostate cancer showed that men with a nonrestrictive diet had higher serum testosterone than those adhering to a low fat diet (\u00df -57.2, 95% CI -105.6 to -8.8, p <0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Men adhering to low fat diets had lower serum testosterone levels even when controlling for comorbidities, age, body mass index and activity levels. As differences in serum testosterone between the diets were modest, the avoidance of fat restrictive diets should be weighed against the potential benefits on an individual basis. ",
        "Proteomic Analysis of CSF from Patients with Leptomeningeal Melanoma Metastases Identifies Signatures Associated with Disease Progression and Therapeutic Resistance. PURPOSE: The development of leptomeningeal melanoma metastases (LMM) is a rare and devastating complication of the late-stage disease, for which no effective treatments exist. Here, we performed a multi-omics analysis of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from patients with LMM to determine how the leptomeningeal microenvironment shapes the biology and therapeutic responses of melanoma cells. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: A total of 45 serial CSF samples were collected from 16 patients, 8 of these with confirmed LMM. Of those with LMM, 7 had poor survival (<4 months) and one was an extraordinary responder (still alive with survival >35 months). CSF samples were analyzed by mass spectrometry and incubated with melanoma cells that were subjected to RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis. Functional assays were performed to validate the pathways identified. RESULTS: Mass spectrometry analyses showed the CSF of most patients with LMM to be enriched for pathways involved in innate immunity, protease-mediated damage, and IGF-related signaling. All of these were anticorrelated in the extraordinary responder. RNA-seq analysis showed CSF to induce PI3K/AKT, integrin, B-cell activation, S-phase entry, TNFR2, TGF\u03b2, and oxidative stress responses in the melanoma cells. ELISA assays confirmed that TGF\u03b2 expression increased in the CSF of patients progressing with LMM. CSF from poorly responding patients conferred tolerance to BRAF inhibitor therapy in apoptosis assays. CONCLUSIONS: These analyses identified proteomic/transcriptional signatures in the CSF of patients who succumbed to LMM. We further showed that the CSF from patients with LMM has the potential to modulate BRAF inhibitor responses and may contribute to drug resistance.See related commentary by Glitza Oliva and Tawbi, p. 2083.

        "Aftereffects and deactivation of completed prospective memory intentions: A systematic review. Prospective memory, the ability to perform an intended action in the future, is an essential aspect of goal-directed behavior. Intentions influence our behavior and shape the way we process and interact with our environment. One important question for research on prospective memory and goal-directed behavior is whether this influence stops after the intention has been completed successfully. Are intention representations deactivated from memory after their completion, and if so, how? Here, we systematically review 20 years of research on intention deactivation and so-called aftereffects of completed intentions across different research fields to offer an integrative perspective on this topic. We first introduce the currently dominant accounts of aftereffects (inhibition vs. retrieval) and illustrate the paradigms, findings, and interpretations that these accounts developed from. We then review the evidence for each account based on the extant research in these paradigms. While early studies proposed a rapid deactivation or even inhibition of completed intentions, more recent studies mostly suggested that intentions continue to be retrieved even after completion and interfere with subsequent performance. Although these accounts of aftereffects seem mutually exclusive, we will show that they might be two sides of the same coin. That is, intention deactivation and the occurrence of aftereffects are modulated by a multitude of factors that either foster a rapid deactivation or lead to continued retrieval of completed intentions. Lastly, we outline future directions and novel experimental procedures for research on mechanisms and modulators of intention deactivation and discuss practical implications of our findings.

        "Differential Sperm Motility Mediates the Sex Ratio Drive Shaping Mouse Sex Chromosome Evolution. The mouse sex chromosomes exhibit an extraordinary level of copy number amplification of postmeiotically expressed genes [1, 2], driven by an \"arms race\" (genomic conflict) between the X and Y chromosomes over the control of offspring sex ratio. The sex-linked ampliconic transcriptional regulators Slx and Sly [3-7] have opposing effects on global transcription levels of the sex chromosomes in haploid spermatids via regulation of postmeiotic sex chromatin (PMSC) [8-11] and opposing effects on offspring sex ratio. Partial deletions of the Y chromosome (Yq) that reduce Sly copy number lead to global overexpression of sex-linked genes in spermatids and either a distorted sex ratio in favor of females (smaller deletions) or sterility (larger deletions) [12-16]. Despite a large body of work studying the role of the sex chromosomes in regulating spermatogenesis (recent reviews [17-20]), most studies do not\u00a0address differential fertility effects on X-\u00a0and Y-bearing cells. Hence, in this study, we concentrate on identifying physiological differences between X-\u00a0and Y-bearing sperm from Yq-deleted males that affect their relative fertilizing ability and consequently lead to sex ratio skewing. We show that X- and Y-bearing sperm in these males have differential motility and morphology but are equally able to penetrate the cumulus and fertilize the egg once at the site\u00a0of fertilization. The altered motility is thus deduced to be the proximate cause of the skew. This represents the first demonstration of a specific difference in sperm function associated with sex ratio skewing. ",
        "HORMA Domain Proteins and a Trip13-like ATPase Regulate Bacterial cGAS-like Enzymes to Mediate Bacteriophage Immunity. Bacteria are continually challenged by foreign invaders, including bacteriophages, and have evolved a variety of defenses against these invaders. Here, we describe the structural and biochemical mechanisms of a bacteriophage immunity pathway found in a broad array of bacteria, including E.\u00a0coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. This pathway uses eukaryotic-like HORMA domain proteins that recognize specific peptides, then bind and activate a cGAS/DncV-like nucleotidyltransferase (CD-NTase) to generate a cyclic triadenylate (cAAA) second messenger; cAAA in turn activates an endonuclease effector, NucC. Signaling is attenuated by a homolog of the AAA+ ATPase Pch2/TRIP13, which binds and disassembles the active HORMA-CD-NTase complex. When expressed in non-pathogenic E.\u00a0coli, this pathway confers immunity against bacteriophage \u03bb through an abortive infection mechanism. Our findings reveal the molecular mechanisms of a bacterial defense pathway integrating a cGAS-like nucleotidyltransferase with HORMA domain proteins for threat sensing through protein detection and negative regulation by a Trip13 ATPase.

        "Deletion of iRhom2 protects against diet-induced obesity by increasing thermogenesis. OBJECTIVE: Obesity is the result of positive energy balance. It can be caused by excessive energy consumption but also by decreased energy dissipation, which occurs under several conditions including when the development or activation of brown adipose tissue (BAT) is impaired. Here we evaluated whether iRhom2, the essential cofactor for the Tumour Necrosis Factor (TNF) sheddase ADAM17/TACE, plays a role in the pathophysiology of metabolic syndrome. METHODS: We challenged WT versus iRhom2 KO mice to positive energy balance by chronic exposure to a high fat diet and then compared their metabolic phenotypes. We also carried out ex\u00a0vivo assays with primary and immortalized mouse brown adipocytes to establish the autonomy of the effect of loss of iRhom2 on thermogenesis and respiration. RESULTS: Deletion of iRhom2 protected mice from weight gain, dyslipidemia, adipose tissue inflammation, and hepatic steatosis and improved insulin sensitivity when challenged by a high fat diet. Crucially, the loss of iRhom2 promotes thermogenesis via BAT activation and beige adipocyte recruitment, enabling iRhom2 KO mice to dissipate excess energy more efficiently than WT animals. This effect on enhanced thermogenesis is cell-autonomous in brown adipocytes as iRhom2 KOs exhibit elevated UCP1 levels and increased mitochondrial proton leak. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that iRhom2 is a negative regulator of thermogenesis and plays a role in the control of adipose tissue homeostasis during metabolic disease. ",
        "Individual structural features constrain the mouse functional connectome. Whole brain dynamics intuitively depend upon the internal wiring of the brain; but to which extent the individual structural connectome constrains the corresponding functional connectome is unknown, even though its importance is uncontested. After acquiring structural data from individual mice, we virtualized their brain networks and simulated in silico functional MRI data. Theoretical results were validated against empirical awake functional MRI data obtained from the same mice. We demonstrate that individual structural connectomes predict the functional organization of individual brains. Using a virtual mouse brain derived from the Allen Mouse Brain Connectivity Atlas, we further show that the dominant predictors of individual structure-function relations are the asymmetry and the weights of the structural links. Model predictions were validated experimentally using tracer injections, identifying which missing connections (not measurable with diffusion MRI) are important for whole brain dynamics in the mouse. Individual variations thus define a specific structural fingerprint with direct impact upon the functional organization of individual brains, a key feature for personalized medicine. ",
        "Functional connectivity of the reading network is associated with prenatal polybrominated diphenyl ether concentrations in a community sample of 5 year-old children: A preliminary study. Genetic factors explain 60 percent of variance in reading disorder. Exposure to neurotoxicants, including polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), may be overlooked risk factors for reading problems. We used resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) to examine associations between prenatal PBDE concentrations and functional connectivity of a reading-related network (RN) in a community sample of 5-year-old children (N\u202f=\u202f33). Maternal serum PBDE concentrations (\u2211PBDE) were measured at 12.2\u202f\u00b1\u202f2.8\u202fweeks gestation (mean\u202f\u00b1\u202fSD). The RN was defined by 12 regions identified in prior task-based fMRI meta-analyses; global efficiency (GE) was used to measure network integration. Linear regression evaluated associations between \u2211PBDE, word reading, and GE of the RN and the default mode network (DMN); the latter to establish specificity of findings. Weighted quantile sum regression analyses evaluated the contributions of specific PBDE congeners to observed associations. Greater RN efficiency was associated with better word reading in these novice readers. Children with higher \u2211PBDE showed reduced GE of the RN; \u2211PBDE was not associated with DMN efficiency, demonstrating specificity of our results. Consistent with prior findings, \u2211PBDE was not associated word reading at 5-years-old. Altered efficiency and integration of the RN may underlie associations between \u2211PBDE concentrations and reading problems observed previously in older children. ",
        "Maturing Out of Alcohol Use in Young Adulthood: Latent Class Growth Trajectories and Concurrent Young Adult Correlates. BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to evaluate intraindividual variation in \"maturing out\" of alcohol use by using latent class growth trajectories of alcohol use from adolescence (age 17\u00a0years) through young adulthood (age 33\u00a0years). We also modeled trajectory group differences with regard to concurrent, age-relevant domains of substance use, health (e.g., physical health rating, sleep problems), interpersonal functioning (e.g., conflict with partner), and occupational functioning (e.g., intrinsic motivation). METHODS: Growth mixture modeling was used with a sample of 1,004 adolescents/young adults, and 3 trajectory groups were identified as follows: (i) a Normative Use group (n\u00a0=\u00a0646) with low alcohol use remaining stable from adolescence to young adulthood; (ii) a Moderate Increase group (n\u00a0=\u00a0300) with moderate alcohol use increasing slowly from adolescence to emergent adulthood (age 23\u00a0years) and then decreasing slightly from emergent adulthood to young adulthood (age 33\u00a0years); and (iii) a High Increase group (n\u00a0=\u00a058) with a high, increasing pattern of alcohol use from adolescence to emergent adulthood and then a small decrease in use from emergent adulthood to young adulthood. RESULTS: At age 33\u00a0years, trajectory groups differed, with High and Moderate Increase groups differing significantly from the Normative Use group in current alcohol and other substance use and other risk factors (e.g., friends' alcohol use). Furthermore, the High and Moderate Increase groups differed from the Normative Use group on indicators of health (poorer sleep and more sleep problems), social functioning (higher partner and work-family conflict), and occupational functioning (lower intrinsic work motivation). CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that trajectory group membership in alcohol use from adolescence to young adulthood is associated with the domains of substance use, health, and social and occupational functioning. Furthermore, the findings suggest that maturing out applies primarily to a subset of those individuals at moderate to higher levels of alcohol use. ",
        "Controlled phage therapy by photothermal ablation of specific bacterial species using gold nanorods targeted by chimeric phages. The use of bacteriophages (phages) for antibacterial therapy is under increasing consideration to treat antimicrobial-resistant infections. Phages have evolved multiple mechanisms to target their bacterial hosts, such as high-affinity, environmentally hardy receptor-binding proteins. However, traditional phage therapy suffers from multiple challenges stemming from the use of an exponentially replicating, evolving entity whose biology is not fully characterized (e.g., potential gene transduction). To address this problem, we conjugate the phages to gold nanorods, creating a reagent that can be destroyed upon use (termed \"phanorods\"). Chimeric phages were engineered to attach specifically to several Gram-negative organisms, including the human pathogens Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Vibrio cholerae, and the plant pathogen Xanthomonas campestris The bioconjugated phanorods could selectively target and kill specific bacterial cells using photothermal ablation. Following excitation by near-infrared light, gold nanorods release energy through nonradiative decay pathways, locally generating heat that efficiently kills targeted bacterial cells. Specificity was highlighted in the context of a P. aeruginosa biofilm, in which phanorod irradiation killed bacterial cells while causing minimal damage to epithelial cells. Local temperature and viscosity measurements revealed highly localized and selective ablation of the bacteria. Irradiation of the phanorods also destroyed the phages, preventing replication and reducing potential risks of traditional phage therapy while enabling control over dosing. The phanorod strategy integrates the highly evolved targeting strategies of phages with the photothermal properties of gold nanorods, creating a well-controlled platform for systematic killing of bacterial cells.

        "OCIAD1 contributes to neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease by inducing mitochondria dysfunction, neuronal vulnerability and synaptic damages. BACKGROUND: Hyperamyloidosis in the brain is known as the earliest neuropathological change and a unique etiological factor in Alzheimer's disease (AD), while progressive neurodegeneration in certain vulnerable brain regions forms the basis of clinical syndromes. It is not clear how early hyperamyloidosis is implicated in progressive neurodegeneration and what factors contribute to the selective brain vulnerability in AD. METHODS: Bioinformatics and experimental neurobiology methods were integrated to identify novel factors involved in the hyperamyloidosis-induced brain vulnerability in AD. We first examined neurodegeneration-specific gene signatures from sporadic AD patients and synaptic protein changes in young transgenic AD mice. Then, we systematically assessed the association of a top candidate gene with AD and investigated its mechanistic role in neurodegeneration. FINDINGS: We identified the ovary-orientated protein OCIAD1 (Ovarian-Carcinoma-Immunoreactive-Antigen-Domain-Containing-1) as a neurodegeneration-associated factor for AD. Higher levels of OCIAD1, found in vulnerable brain areas and dystrophic neurites, were correlated with disease severity. Multiple early AD pathological events, particularly A\u03b2/GSK-3\u03b2 signaling, elevate OCIAD1, which in turn interacts with BCL-2 to impair mitochondrial function and facilitates mitochondria-associated neuronal injury. Notably, elevated OCIAD1 by A\u03b2 increases cell susceptibility to other AD pathological challenges. INTERPRETATION: Our findings suggest that OCIAD1 contributes to neurodegeneration in AD by impairing mitochondria function, and subsequently leading to neuronal vulnerability, and synaptic damages.

        "A comparative study of autistic and non-autistic women's experience of motherhood. Background: Autism is a lifelong neurodevelopmental difference and disability, yet there is limited research examining parenting in autistic mothers. Objective: To explore autistic mothers' experience of the perinatal period and parenthood. This includes pregnancy, childbirth, the postpartum period, self-perception of parenting strengths and weaknesses, communication with professionals in relation to one's child, mental health difficulties and the social experience of motherhood. It also includes disclosing one's diagnosis of autism in parenting contexts. Methods: We used a community-based participatory research model, and recruited an advisory panel, with whom we co-developed an anonymous, online survey for autistic mothers. The online survey was completed by autistic and non-autistic mothers, and we compared their responses using Chi-squared analysis. Sample: Autistic mothers (n = 355), and non-autistic mothers (n = 132), each of whom had at least one autistic child, were included in our final analysis. Results: There were differences in education, gender identity and age of mother at birth of first child. Autistic mothers were more likely to have experienced additional psychiatric conditions, including pre- or post-partum depression, and reported greater difficulties in areas such as multi-tasking, coping with domestic responsibilities and creating social opportunities for their child. They were also more likely to report feeling misunderstood by professionals, and reported greater anxiety, higher rates of selective mutism, and not knowing which details were appropriate to share with professionals. They were also more likely to find motherhood an isolating experience, to worry about others judging their parenting, or feel unable to turn to others for support in parenting. However, despite these challenges, autistic mothers were able to act in the best interest of their child, putting their child's needs first. Conclusions: Autistic mothers face unique challenges and the stigma associated with autism may further exacerbate communication difficulties. Greater understanding and acceptance amongst individuals who interact with autistic mothers is needed, and autistic mothers would benefit from additional and better-tailored support. ",
        "Reversal of obesity and liver steatosis in mice via inhibition of aryl hydrocarbon receptor and altered gene expression of CYP1B1, PPAR\u03b1, SCD1, and osteopontin. BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Obesity is a global epidemic and the underlying basis for numerous comorbidities. We report that the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) plays a key role in the metabolism of obesity. The AHR is a promiscuous, ligand-activated nuclear receptor primarily known for regulating genes involved in xenobiotic metabolism and T cell polarization. The aims of the work reported here were to understand the underlying mechanism of AHR-based obesity and to determine whether inhibition of AHR activity would reverse obesity. METHODS: Mice were fed control (low fat) and Western (high fat) diets with and without the AHR antagonist alpha-naphthoflavone (aNF). Gene expression of identified AHR-regulated genes from liver and adipose tissue was characterized. To determine the role of the AHR in obesity reversal, selected mice in control and Western diet regimens were switched at midpoint to the respective control and Western diets containing aNF, and the identified AHR-regulated genes characterized. RESULTS: AHR inhibition prevented obesity in mice on a 40-week diet regimen. The likely AHR-regulated and cross-regulated downstream effectors of AHR-based obesity were shown to be CYP1B1, PPAR\u03b1-target genes, SCD1, and SPP1 (osteopontin). Western diet caused an increase of mRNA and protein expression of the Cyp1b1, Scd1, and Spp1, and PPAR\u03b1-target genes in the liver, and inhibition of the AHR maintained expression of these genes near control levels. The body weight of obese mice on Western diet switched to Western diet containing aNF decreased to that of mice on control diet concurrently with a reduction in the expression of liver CYP1B1, PPAR\u03b1-target genes, SCD1, and SPP1. AHR inhibition prevented hypertrophy and hyperplasia in visceral adipose tissue and limited expression levels of CYP1B1 and SPP1 to that of mice on control diet. CONCLUSIONS: AHR inhibition prevents and reverses obesity by likely reducing liver expression of the Cyp1b1, Scd1, Spp1, and PPAR\u03b1-target genes; and the AHR is a potentially potent therapeutic target for the treatment and prevention of obesity and linked diseases.

        "The Critical Care Resuscitation Unit Transfers More Patients From Emergency Departments Faster and Is Associated With Improved Outcomes. BACKGROUND: Transfer delays of critically ill patients from other hospitals' emergency departments (EDs) to an appropriate referral hospital's intensive care unit (ICU) are associated with poor outcomes. OBJECTIVES: We hypothesized that an innovative Critical Care Resuscitation Unit (CCRU) would be associated with improved outcomes by reducing transfer times to a quaternary care center and times to interventions for ED patients with critical illnesses. METHODS: This pre-post analysis compared 3 groups of patients: a CCRU group (patients transferred to the CCRU during its first year [July 2013 to June 2014]), a 2011-Control group (patients transferred to any ICU between July 2011 and June 2012), and a 2013-Control group (patients transferred to other ICUs between July 2013 and June 2014). The primary outcome was time from transfer request to ICU arrival. Secondary outcomes were the interval between ICU arrival to the operating room and in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: We analyzed 1565 patients (644 in the CCRU, 574 in the 2011-Control, and 347 in 2013-Control groups). The median time from transfer request to ICU arrival for CCRU patients was 108\u00a0min (interquartile range [IQR] 74-166\u00a0min) compared with 158\u00a0min (IQR 111-252\u00a0min) for the 2011-Control and 185\u00a0min (IQR 122-283\u00a0min) for the 2013-Control groups (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01). The median arrival-to-urgent operation for the CCRU group was 220\u00a0min (IQR 120-429\u00a0min) versus 439\u00a0min (IQR 290-645\u00a0min) and 356\u00a0min (IQR 268-575\u00a0min; p\u00a0<\u00a00.026) for the 2011-Control and 2013-Control groups, respectively. After adjustment with clinical factors, transfer to the CCRU was associated with lower mortality (odds ratio 0.64 [95% confidence interval 0.44-0.93], p\u00a0=\u00a00.019) in multivariable logistic regression. CONCLUSION: The CCRU, which decreased time from outside ED's transfer request to referral ICU arrival, was associated with lower mortality likelihood. Resuscitation units analogous to the CCRU, which transfer resource-intensive patients from EDs faster, may improve patient outcomes. ",
        "Individualized recovery of gut microbial strains post antibiotics. To further understand the impact of antibiotics on the gastrointestinal tract microbial community, the intra-individual recovery pattern of specific microbial strains was determined using metagenomic sequencing coupled with strain-tracking analyses. In a study where 18 individuals were administered a single antibiotic (cefprozil), new microbial genomic variants (herein strains) were transiently detected in 15 individuals, while in a second study that used a cocktail of three antibiotics (meropenem, gentamicin, and vancomycin), all 12 participants had either permanent or transient strain changes. The presence of distinct microbial genomic variants indicates a pattern of strain recovery that is intra-individual specific following disruption of the human gastrointestinal tract with antibiotics.

        "Incidental lymphopenia and mortality: a prospective cohort study. BACKGROUND: It is unknown if incidental lymphopenia detected in the general population is associated with higher all-cause and cause-specific mortality. We aimed to identify the associations between lymphopenia and all-cause and cause specific mortality. METHODS: In a prospective cohort study, we examined and followed participants enrolled in the Copenhagen General Population Study between November 2003 and April 2015. In our analysis, we modelled risks using Cox proportional hazards regression for 3 groups: participants with a lymphocyte count below the 2.5th percentile; those with a lymphocyte count at or between the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles (reference category); and those with a lymphocyte count above the 97.5th percentile. RESULTS: The cohort included 108 135 participants with a median age of 68 years. During a median follow-up of 9 (interquartile range [IQR] 0-14) years, 10 372 participants died. We found that participants with lymphopenia (lymphocyte count < 1.1 \u00d7 109/L) compared with those with a lymphocyte count in the reference range (1.1-3.7 \u00d7 109/L) had higher mortality with multivariable adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) of 1.63 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.51-1.76) for all causes, 1.67 (95% CI 1.42-1.97) for nonhematologic cancers, 2.79 (95% CI 1.82-4.28) for hematologic cancers, 1.88 (95% CI 1.61-2.20) for cardiovascular diseases, 1.88 (95% CI 1.55-2.29) for respiratory diseases, 1.86 (95% CI 1.53-2.25) for infectious diseases, and 1.50 (95% CI 1.19-1.88) for other causes. For all-cause mortality, the highest absolute 2-year risks of death were observed in women (61%) and men (75%) who smoked and were aged 80 years or older with lymphocyte counts less than 0.5 \u00d7 109/L. Participants with a lymphocyte count higher than the reference category had increased mortality (adjusted HR 1.17, 95% CI 1.04-1.31). INTERPRETATION: We found that lymphopenia was associated with an increased risk of all-cause and cause-specific mortality. ",
        "Structural connectivity alterations in chronic and episodic migraine: A diffusion magnetic resonance imaging connectomics study. OBJECTIVE: To identify possible structural connectivity alterations in patients with episodic and chronic migraine using magnetic resonance imaging data. METHODS: Fifty-four episodic migraine, 56 chronic migraine patients and 50 controls underwent T1-weighted and diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging acquisitions. Number of streamlines (trajectories of estimated fiber-tracts), mean fractional anisotropy, axial diffusivity and radial diffusivity were the connectome measures. Correlation analysis between connectome measures and duration and frequency of migraine was performed. RESULTS: Higher and lower number of streamlines were found in connections involving regions like the superior frontal gyrus when comparing episodic and chronic migraineurs with controls (p\u2009<\u2009.05 false discovery rate). Between the left caudal anterior cingulate and right superior frontal gyri, more streamlines were found in chronic compared to episodic migraine. Higher and lower fractional anisotropy, axial diffusivity, and radial diffusivity were found between migraine groups and controls in connections involving regions like the hippocampus. Lower radial diffusivity and axial diffusivity were found in chronic compared to episodic migraine in connections involving regions like the putamen. In chronic migraine, duration of migraine was positively correlated with fractional anisotropy and axial diffusivity. CONCLUSIONS: Structural strengthening of connections involving subcortical regions associated with pain processing and weakening in connections involving cortical regions associated with hyperexcitability may coexist in migraine.

        "Antibacterial Liquid Metals: Biofilm Treatment via Magnetic Activation. Antibiotic resistance has made the treatment of biofilm-related infections challenging. As such, the quest for next-generation antimicrobial technologies must focus on targeted therapies to which pathogenic bacteria cannot develop resistance. Stimuli-responsive therapies represent an alternative technological focus due to their capability of delivering targeted treatment. This study provides a proof-of-concept investigation into the use of magneto-responsive gallium-based liquid metal (LM) droplets as antibacterial materials, which can physically damage, disintegrate, and kill pathogens within a mature biofilm. Once exposed to a low-intensity rotating magnetic field, the LM droplets become physically actuated and transform their shape, developing sharp edges. When placed in contact with a bacterial biofilm, the movement of the particles resulting from the magnetic field, coupled with the presence of nanosharp edges, physically ruptures the bacterial cells and the dense biofilm matrix is broken down. The antibacterial efficacy of the magnetically activated LM particles was assessed against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial biofilms. After 90 min over 99% of both bacterial species became nonviable, and the destruction of the biofilms was observed. These results will impact the design of next-generation, LM-based biofilm treatments. ",
        "Prediction of gestational diabetes based on nationwide electronic health records. Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) poses increased risk of short- and long-term complications for mother and offspring1-4. GDM is typically diagnosed at 24-28\u2009weeks of gestation, but earlier detection is desirable as this may prevent or considerably reduce the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes5,6. Here we used a machine-learning approach to predict GDM on retrospective data of 588,622\u2009pregnancies in Israel for which comprehensive electronic health records were available. Our models predict GDM with high accuracy even at pregnancy initiation (area under the receiver operating curve (auROC)\u2009=\u20090.85), substantially outperforming a baseline risk score (auROC\u2009=\u20090.68). We validated our results on both a future validation set and a geographical validation set from the most populated city in Israel, Jerusalem, thereby emulating real-world performance. Interrogating our model, we uncovered previously unreported risk factors, including results of previous pregnancy glucose challenge tests. Finally, we devised a simpler model based on just nine questions that a patient could answer, with only a modest reduction in accuracy (auROC\u2009=\u20090.80). Overall, our models may allow early-stage intervention in high-risk women, as well as a cost-effective screening approach that could avoid the need for glucose tolerance tests by identifying low-risk women. Future prospective studies and studies on additional populations are needed to assess the real-world clinical utility of the model. ",
        "Longitudinal Associations of 12th-Grade Binge Drinking With Risky Driving and High-Risk Drinking. OBJECTIVE: To study the longitudinal associations of 12th-grade binge drinking with driving while impaired (DWI), riding with an impaired driver (RWI), blackouts, extreme binge drinking, and risky driving (self-reported Checkpoints Risky Driving Scale) among emerging adults up to 4 years after leaving high school. METHODS: The data were all 7 waves (W 1 to W 7 of the NEXT Generation Health Study; a US nationally representative study (N = 2785) with a probability cohort of 10th-graders (mean age = 16.2 years; SE = 0.03) starting in the 2009-2010 year. Binary and ordinal logistic regressions were used for the analysis. RESULTS: Binge drinking prevalence in W1 to W3 was 27.2%, 23.8%, and 26.8%, respectively. Twelfth-grade binge drinking was associated with a higher likelihood of DWI, RWI, blackouts, and risky driving in W4 to W7 and extreme binge drinking in W7. Adolescents who binged \u22653 times in high school were more likely to DWI, RWI, blackout (W4 to W7), be involved in extreme binge drinking (W7), and report riskier driving several years after high school. In some waves, parental practices appeared to have enduring effects in protecting against DWI, RWI, and blackouts. CONCLUSIONS: Twelfth-grade binge drinking is a robust predictor of early adulthood DWI, RWI, blackout, extreme binge drinking, and risky driving. Our study suggests that ongoing parental practices could be protective against DWI, RWI, and blackouts once adolescents transition from high school into early adulthood. Prevention programs that incorporate binge drinking-focused screening and bolster parental practices may reduce the likelihood of later major alcohol-related health-risk behaviors and consequences in emerging adults.

BACKGROUND: Sharing research data uses resources effectively; enables large, diverse data sets; and supports rigor and reproducibility. However, sharing such data increases privacy risks for participants who may be re-identified by linking study data to outside data sets. These risks have been investigated for genetic and medical records but rarely for environmental data. OBJECTIVES: We evaluated how data in environmental health (EH) studies may be vulnerable to linkage and we investigated, in a case study, whether environmental measurements could contribute to inferring latent categories (e.g., geographic location), which increases privacy risks. METHODS: We identified 12 prominent EH studies, reviewed the data types collected, and evaluated the availability of outside data sets that overlap with study data. With data from the Household Exposure Study in California and Massachusetts and the Green Housing Study in Boston, Massachusetts, and Cincinnati, Ohio, we used k-means clustering and principal component analysis to investigate whether participants' region of residence could be inferred from measurements of chemicals in household air and dust. RESULTS: All 12 studies included at least two of five data types that overlap with outside data sets: geographic location (9 studies), medical data (9 studies), occupation (10 studies), housing characteristics (10 studies), and genetic data (7 studies). In our cluster analysis, participants' region of residence could be inferred with 80%-98% accuracy using environmental measurements with original laboratory reporting limits. DISCUSSION: EH studies frequently include data that are vulnerable to linkage with voter lists, tax and real estate data, professional licensing lists, and ancestry websites, and exposure measurements may be used to identify subgroup membership, increasing likelihood of linkage. Thus, unsupervised sharing of EH research data potentially raises substantial privacy risks. Empirical research can help characterize risks and evaluate technical solutions. Our findings reinforce the need for legal and policy protections to shield participants from potential harms of re-identification from data sharing. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP4817. ",
        "Robust hepatitis E virus infection and transcriptional response in human hepatocytes. Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is the causative agent of hepatitis E in humans and the leading cause for acute viral hepatitis worldwide. The virus is classified as a member of the genus Orthohepevirus A within the Hepeviridae family. Due to the absence of a robust cell culture model for HEV infection, the analysis of the viral life cycle, the development of effective antivirals and a vaccine is severely limited. In this study, we established a protocol based on the HEV genotype 3 p6 (Kernow C-1) and the human hepatoma cell lines HepG2 and HepG2/C3A with different media conditions to produce intracellular HEV cell culture-derived particles (HEVcc) with viral titers between 105 and 106 FFU/mL. Viral titers could be further enhanced by an HEV variant harboring a mutation in the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. These HEVcc particles were characterized in density gradients and allowed the trans-complementation of subgenomic reporter HEV replicons. In addition, in vitro produced intracellular-derived particles were infectious in liver-humanized mice with high RNA copy numbers detectable in serum and feces. Efficient infection of primary human and swine hepatocytes using the developed protocol could be observed and was inhibited by ribavirin. Finally, RNA sequencing studies of HEV-infected primary human hepatocytes demonstrated a temporally structured transcriptional defense response. In conclusion, this robust cell culture model of HEV infection provides a powerful tool for studying viral-host interactions that should facilitate the discovery of antiviral drugs for this important zoonotic pathogen.

        "Molecular Architecture of a Network of Potential Intracellular EGFR Modulators: ARNO, CaM, Phospholipids, and the Juxtamembrane Segment. Epidermal growth factor receptors (EGFRs) are central cellular signaling interfaces whose misregulation is related to several severe diseases. Although ligand binding to the extracellular domain is the most obvious regulatory element, also intracellular factors can act as modulators of EGFR activity. The juxtamembrane (JM) segment seems to be the receptor's key interaction interface of these cytoplasmic factors. However, only a limited number of cytoplasmic EGFR modulators are known and a comprehensive understanding of their mode of action is lacking. Here, we report ARNO, a member of the cytohesin family, as another JM-binding protein and structurally characterize the ARNO-EGFR interaction interface. We reveal that its binding mode displays common features and distinct differences with JM's interaction with calmodulin and anionic phospholipids. Furthermore, we show that each interaction can be modulated by additional factors, generating a distinctly regulated network of possible EGFR modulators acting on the intracellular domain of the receptor.

        "Troponin Testing and Coronary Syndrome in Geriatric Patients With Nonspecific Complaints: Are We Overtesting?. BACKGROUND: Elderly patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) with nonspecific complaints (NSCs) often undergo troponin testing to assess for atypical acute coronary syndrome (ACS). However, the rate of ACS and utility of troponin testing in this population is unknown. We sought to determine the rate of ACS and diagnostic yield of troponin testing in elderly patients with NSCs. METHODS: We retrospectively identified all patients aged \u2265 65 years triaged in the ED with NSCs from January 1, 2017, to June 30, 2017. NSCs were defined a priori and included complaints such as weakness, dizziness, or fatigue. NSCs were verified in ED provider notes by trained abstractors blind to testing results. Exclusions were focal chief complaint in provider notes, fever, and no troponin ordered. ACS was strictly defined and independently adjudicated by two trained physician researchers blind to the study hypothesis. We calculated the proportion of patients with ACS within 30 days and the test characteristics of troponin to diagnose ACS. RESULTS: Screening identified 1,146 encounters, and 552 were excluded for fever or focal chief complaints in the provider notes. Of the remaining 594 patients, troponin was ordered in 412 (69%), comprising the study cohort. The mean (\u00b1SD) age was 78.7 (\u00b18.3) years, with 58% female and 75% admitted. Troponin elevation occurred in 81 patients (20%). ACS occurred in 5 of 412 (1.2%). Troponin was 100% sensitive (95% confidence interval [CI]\u00a0=\u00a048% to 100%) and 81% specific (95% CI\u00a0= 77% to 85%) for ACS. Of patients with elevated troponin, 93.8% were false positives (no ACS). All patients with troponin elevation were admitted, but only one underwent angiography and no patients received reperfusion therapy. CONCLUSIONS: While consideration for ACS is prudent in selected elderly patients with NSCs, ACS was rare and no patients received reperfusion therapy. Given the false-positive rate in our study, our results may not support routine troponin testing for ACS in this population. ",
        "Physiological responses to gravity in an insect. Gravity is one of the most ubiquitous environmental effects on living systems: Cellular and organismal responses to gravity are of central importance to understanding the physiological function of organisms, especially eukaryotes. Gravity has been demonstrated to have strong effects on the closed cardiovascular systems of terrestrial vertebrates, with rapidly responding neural reflexes ensuring proper blood flow despite changes in posture. Invertebrates possess open circulatory systems, which could provide fewer mechanisms to restrict gravity effects on blood flow, suggesting that these species also experience effects of gravity on blood pressure and distribution. However, whether gravity affects the open circulatory systems of invertebrates is unknown, partly due to technical measurement issues associated with small body size. Here we used X-ray imaging, radio-tracing of hemolymph, and micropressure measurements in the American grasshopper, Schistocerca americana, to assess responses to body orientation. Our results show that during changes in body orientation, gravity causes large changes in blood and air distribution, and that body position affects ventilation rate. Remarkably, we also found that insects show similar heart rate responses to body position as vertebrates, and contrasting with the classic understanding of open circulatory systems, have flexible valving systems between thorax and abdomen that can separate pressures. Gravitational effects on invertebrate cardiovascular and respiratory systems are likely to be widely distributed among invertebrates and to have broad influence on morphological and physiological evolution.

        "Association of Acquired and Heritable Factors With Intergenerational Differences in Age at Symptomatic Onset of Alzheimer Disease Between Offspring and Parents With Dementia. Importance: Acquired and heritable traits are associated with dementia risk; however, how these traits are associated with age at symptomatic onset (AAO) of Alzheimer disease (AD) is unknown. Identifying the associations of acquired and heritable factors with variability in intergenerational AAO of AD could facilitate diagnosis, assessment, and counseling of the offspring of parents with AD. Objective: To quantify the associations of acquired and heritable factors with intergenerational differences in AAO of AD. Design, Setting, and Participants: This nested cohort study used data from the Knight Alzheimer Disease Research Center that included community-dwelling participants with symptomatic AD, parental history of dementia, and available DNA data who were enrolled in prospective studies of memory and aging from September 1, 2005, to August 31, 2016. Clinical, biomarker, and genetic data were extracted on January 17, 2017, and data analyses were conducted from July 1, 2017, to August 20, 2019. Main Outcomes and Measures: The associations of acquired (ie, years of education; body mass index; history of cardiovascular disease, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes, active depression within 2 years, traumatic brain injury, tobacco use, and unhealthy alcohol use; and retrospective determination of AAO) and heritable factors (ie, ethnicity/race, paternal or maternal inheritance, parental history of early-onset dementia, APOE \u03b54 allele status, and AD polygenic risk scores) to intergenerational difference in AAO of AD were quantified using stepwise forward multivariable regression. Missense or frameshift variants within genes associated with AD pathogenesis were screened using whole-exome sequencing. Results: There were 164 participants with symptomatic AD, known parental history of dementia, and available DNA data (mean [SD] age, 70.9 [8.3] years; 90 [54.9%] women) included in this study. Offspring were diagnosed with symptomatic AD a mean (SD) 6.1 (10.7) years earlier than their parents (P\u2009<\u2009.001). The adjusted R2 for measured acquired and heritable factors for intergenerational difference in AAO of AD was 0.29 (F8,155\u2009=\u20099.13; P\u2009<\u2009.001). Paternal (\u03b2\u2009=\u2009-9.52 [95% CI, -13.79 to -5.25]) and maternal (\u03b2\u2009=\u2009-6.68 [95% CI, -11.61 to -1.75]) history of dementia, more years of education (\u03b2\u2009=\u2009-0.58 [95% CI -1.08 to -0.09]), and retrospective determination of AAO (\u03b2\u2009=\u2009-3.46 [95% CI, -6.40 to -0.52]) were associated with earlier-than-expected intergenerational difference in AAO of AD. Parental history of early-onset dementia (\u03b2\u2009=\u200921.30 [95% CI, 15.01 to 27.59]), presence of 1 APOE \u03b54 allele (\u03b2\u2009=\u20095.00 [95% CI, 2.11 to 7.88]), and history of hypertension (\u03b2\u2009=\u20093.81 [95% CI, 0.88 to 6.74]) were associated with later-than-expected intergenerational difference in AAO of AD. Missense or frameshift variants within genes associated with AD pathogenesis were more common in participants with the greatest unexplained variability in intergenerational AAO of AD (19 of 48 participants [39.6%] vs 26 of 116 participants [22.4%]; P\u2009=\u2009.03). Conclusions and Relevance: Acquired and heritable factors were associated with a substantial proportion of variability in intergenerational AAO of AD. Variants in genes associated with AD pathogenesis may contribute to unexplained variability, justifying further study. ",
        "Association of lead-exposure risk and family income with childhood brain outcomes. Socioeconomic factors influence brain development and structure, but most studies have overlooked neurotoxic insults that impair development, such as lead exposure. Childhood lead exposure affects cognitive development at the lowest measurable concentrations, but little is known about its impact on brain development during childhood. We examined cross-sectional associations among brain structure, cognition, geocoded measures of the risk of lead exposure and sociodemographic characteristics in 9,712 9- and 10-year-old children. Here we show stronger negative associations of living in high-lead-risk census tracts in children from lower- versus higher-income families. With increasing risk of exposure, children from lower-income families exhibited lower cognitive test scores, smaller cortical volume and smaller cortical surface area. Reducing environmental insults associated with lead-exposure risk might confer greater benefit to children experiencing more environmental adversity, and further understanding of the factors associated with high lead-exposure risk will be critical for improving such outcomes in children.

        "Ventilation-induced jet suggests biotrauma in reconstructed airways of the intubated neonate. We investigate respiratory flow phenomena in a reconstructed upper airway model of an intubated neonate undergoing invasive mechanical ventilation, spanning conventional to high-frequency ventilation (HFV) modes. Using high-speed tomographic particle image velocimetry, we resolve transient, three-dimensional flow fields and observe a persistent jet flow exiting the endotracheal tube whose strength is directly modulated according to the ventilation protocol. We identify this synthetic jet as the dominating signature of convective flow under intubated ventilation. Concurrently, our in silico wall shear stress analysis reveals a hitherto overlooked source of ventilator-induced lung injury as a result of jet impingement on the tracheal carina, suggesting damage to the bronchial epithelium; this type of injury is known as biotrauma. We find HFV advantageous in mitigating the intensity of such impingement, which may contribute to its role as a lung protective method. Our findings may encourage the adoption of less invasive ventilation procedures currently used in neonatal intensive care units. ",
        "Brain-wide functional architecture remodeling by alcohol dependence and abstinence. Alcohol abuse and alcohol dependence are key factors in the development of alcohol use disorder, which is a pervasive societal problem with substantial economic, medical, and psychiatric consequences. Although our understanding of the neurocircuitry that underlies alcohol use has improved, novel brain regions that are involved in alcohol use and novel biomarkers of alcohol use need to be identified. The present study used a single-cell whole-brain imaging approach to 1) assess whether abstinence from alcohol in an animal model of alcohol dependence alters the functional architecture of brain activity and modularity, 2) validate our current knowledge of the neurocircuitry of alcohol abstinence, and 3) discover brain regions that may be involved in alcohol use. Alcohol abstinence resulted in the whole-brain reorganization of functional architecture in mice and a pronounced decrease in modularity that was not observed in nondependent moderate drinkers. Structuring of the alcohol abstinence network revealed three major brain modules: 1) extended amygdala module, 2) midbrain striatal module, and 3) cortico-hippocampo-thalamic module, reminiscent of the three-stage theory. Many hub brain regions that control this network were identified, including several that have been previously overlooked in alcohol research. These results identify brain targets for future research and demonstrate that alcohol use and dependence remodel brain-wide functional architecture to decrease modularity. Further studies are needed to determine whether the changes in coactivation and modularity that are associated with alcohol abstinence are causal features of alcohol dependence or a consequence of excessive drinking and alcohol exposure.

        "A biomaterial-based vaccine eliciting durable tumour-specific responses against acute myeloid leukaemia. Acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) is a malignancy of haematopoietic origin that has limited therapeutic options. The standard-of-care cytoreductive chemotherapy depletes AML cells to induce remission, but is infrequently curative. An immunosuppressive AML microenvironment in the bone marrow and the paucity of suitable immunotherapy targets limit the induction of effective immune responses. Here, in mouse models of AML, we show that a macroporous-biomaterial vaccine that delivers the cytokine granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), the Toll-like-receptor-9 agonist cytosine-guanosine oligodeoxynucleotide and one or multiple leukaemia antigens (in the form of a defined peptide antigen, cell lysates or antigens sourced from AML cells recruited in vivo) induces local immune-cell infiltration and activated dendritic cells, evoking a potent anti-AML response. The biomaterial-based vaccine prevented the engraftment of AML cells when administered as a prophylactic and when combined with chemotherapy, and eradicated established AML even in the absence of a defined vaccine antigen. Biomaterial-based AML vaccination can induce potent immune responses, deplete AML cells and prevent disease relapse. ",
        "Disease-modifying effects of natural \u03949-tetrahydrocannabinol in endometriosis-associated pain. Endometriosis is a chronic painful disease highly prevalent in women that is defined by growth of endometrial tissue outside the uterine cavity and lacks adequate treatment. Medical use of cannabis derivatives is a current hot topic and it is unknown whether phytocannabinoids may modify endometriosis symptoms and development. Here we evaluate the effects of repeated exposure to \u03949-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in a mouse model of surgically-induced endometriosis. In this model, female mice develop mechanical hypersensitivity in the caudal abdomen, mild anxiety-like behavior and substantial memory deficits associated with the presence of extrauterine endometrial cysts. Interestingly, daily treatments with THC (2 mg/kg) alleviate mechanical hypersensitivity and pain unpleasantness, modify uterine innervation and restore cognitive function without altering the anxiogenic phenotype. Strikingly, THC also inhibits the development of endometrial cysts. These data highlight the interest of scheduled clinical trials designed to investigate possible benefits of THC for women with endometriosis. ",
        "Impact of a community-delivered parenting curriculum on perceived parenting stress and parent-reported outcomes in a low-income diverse population. INTRODUCTION: There is a need for effective, strengths-based parenting supports for diverse parent populations. We conducted a quasi-experimental study to investigate whether a 12-week parenting program delivered in the community decreases perceived parenting stress and improves parent-reported outcomes. METHOD: Parents in the intervention group participated in Parenting Journey, a curriculum designed to increase resilience and support nurturing family relationships. Parents who were eligible for Parenting Journey but did not enroll were included in the concurrent comparison group. Participants completed the Parenting Stress Index and the Parenting Journey Survey at baseline and follow-up. We conducted bivariate and multivariate analyses to evaluate differences between groups. RESULTS: We enrolled 244 parents, 123 in the intervention group and 121 in the comparison group. The majority of participants in the intervention and comparison groups were female, identified as Black or Latino, and reported an annual household income of less than $20,000. At baseline, intervention participants reported higher total parenting stress than comparison participants (mean percentile 70.7 vs. 55.8, p = .002). At follow-up, intervention participants' mean total parenting stress score decreased by 14.1 points, while comparison participants' score increased by 3.0 points (difference-in-difference p < .0001). Intervention participants were significantly more likely to demonstrate improvement in 4 or more of the 7 constructs measured by the Parenting Journey Survey (adjusted OR = 2.2, 95% CI [1.2, 4.1], p = .01). DISCUSSION: Participation in Parenting Journey is associated with decreased perceived parenting stress and improvement in parent-reported outcomes. Future work should evaluate the longitudinal impact on parental mental health and child socioemotional development. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved). ",
        "Integrating functional connectivity and MVPA through a multiple constraint network analysis. Traditional general linear model-based brain mapping efforts using functional neuroimaging are complemented by more recent multivariate pattern analyses (MVPA) that apply machine learning techniques to identify the cognitive states associated with regional BOLD activation patterns, and by connectivity analyses that identify networks of interacting regions that support particular cognitive processes. We introduce a novel analysis representing the union of these approaches, and explore the insights gained when MVPA and functional connectivity analyses are allowed to mutually constrain each other within a single model. We explored multisensory semantic representations of concrete object concepts using a self-paced multisensory imagery task. Multilayer neural networks learned the real-world categories associated with macro-scale cortical BOLD activity patterns from the task, with some models additionally encoding regional functional connectivity. Models trained to encode functional connections demonstrated superior classification accuracy and more pronounced lesion-site appropriate category-specific impairments. We replicated these results in a data set from the openneuro.org open fMRI data repository. We conclude that mutually constrained network analyses encourage parsimonious models that may benefit from improved biological plausibility and facilitate discovery. ",
        "Astrocytes monitor cerebral perfusion and control systemic circulation to maintain brain blood flow. Astrocytes provide neurons with essential metabolic and structural support, modulate neuronal circuit activity and may also function as versatile surveyors of brain milieu, tuned to sense conditions of potential metabolic insufficiency. Here we show that astrocytes detect falling cerebral perfusion pressure and activate CNS autonomic sympathetic control circuits to increase systemic arterial blood pressure and heart rate with the purpose of maintaining brain blood flow and oxygen delivery. Studies conducted in experimental animals (laboratory rats) show that astrocytes respond to acute decreases in brain perfusion with elevations in intracellular [Ca2+]. Blockade of Ca2+-dependent signaling mechanisms in populations of astrocytes that reside alongside CNS sympathetic control circuits prevents compensatory increases in sympathetic nerve activity, heart rate and arterial blood pressure induced by reductions in cerebral perfusion. These data suggest that astrocytes function as intracranial baroreceptors and play an important role in homeostatic control of arterial blood pressure and brain blood flow. ",
        "Effect of a Behavioral Intervention to Increase Vegetable Consumption on Cancer Progression Among Men With Early-Stage Prostate Cancer: The MEAL Randomized Clinical Trial. Importance: Guidelines endorsing vegetable-enriched diets to improve outcomes for prostate cancer survivors are based on expert opinion, preclinical studies, and observational data. Objective: To determine the effect of a behavioral intervention that increased vegetable intake on cancer progression in men with early-stage prostate cancer. Design, Setting, and Participants: The Men's Eating and Living (MEAL) Study (CALGB 70807 [Alliance]) was a randomized clinical trial conducted at 91 US urology and medical oncology clinics that enrolled 478 men aged 50 to 80 years with biopsy-proven prostate adenocarcinoma (International Society of Urological Pathology grade group\u2009=\u20091 in those <70 years and \u22642 in those \u226570 years), stage cT2a or less, and serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level less than 10 ng/mL. Enrollment occurred from January 2011 to August 2015; 24-month follow-up occurred from January 2013 to August 2017. Interventions: Patients were randomized to a counseling behavioral intervention by telephone promoting consumption of 7 or more daily vegetable servings (MEAL intervention; n\u2009=\u2009237) or a control group, which received written information about diet and prostate cancer (n\u2009=\u2009241). Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was time to progression; progression was defined as PSA level of 10 ng/mL or greater, PSA doubling time of less than 3 years, or upgrading (defined as increase in tumor volume or grade) on follow-up prostate biopsy. Results: Among 478 patients randomized (mean [SD] age, 64 [7] years; mean [SD] PSA level, 4.9 [2.1] ng/mL), 443 eligible patients (93%) were included in the primary analysis. There were 245 progression events (intervention: 124; control: 121). There were no significant differences in time to progression (unadjusted hazards ratio, 0.96 [95% CI, 0.75 to 1.24]; adjusted hazard ratio, 0.97 [95% CI, 0.76 to 1.25]). The 24-month Kaplan-Meier progression-free percentages were 43.5% [95% CI, 36.5% to 50.6%] and 41.4% [95% CI, 34.3% to 48.7%] for the intervention and control groups, respectively (difference, 2.1% [95% CI, -8.1% to 12.2%]). Conclusions and Relevance: Among men with early-stage prostate cancer managed with active surveillance, a behavioral intervention that increased vegetable consumption did not significantly reduce the risk of prostate cancer progression. The findings do not support use of this intervention to decrease prostate cancer progression in this population, although the study may have been underpowered to identify a clinically important difference.

        "Neural Stem Cell Extracellular Vesicles Disrupt Midline Shift Predictive Outcomes in Porcine Ischemic Stroke Model. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a clinically relevant non-invasive imaging tool commonly utilized to assess stroke progression in real time. This study investigated the utility of MRI as a predictive measure of clinical and functional outcomes when a stroke intervention is withheld or provided, in order to identify biomarkers for stroke functional outcome under these conditions. Fifteen MRI and ninety functional parameters were measured in a middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) porcine ischemic stroke model. Multiparametric analysis of correlations between MRI measurements and functional outcome was conducted. Acute axial and coronal midline shift (MLS) at 24 h post-stroke were associated with decreased survival and recovery measured by modified Rankin scale (mRS) and were significantly correlated with 52 measured acute (day 1 post) and chronic (day 84 post) gait and behavior impairments in non-treated stroked animals. These results suggest that MLS may be an important non-invasive biomarker that can be used to predict patient outcomes and prognosis as well as guide therapeutic intervention and rehabilitation in non-treated animals and potentially human patients that do not receive interventional treatments. Neural stem cell-derived extracellular vesicle (NSC EV) was a disruptive therapy because NSC EV administration post-stroke disrupted MLS correlations observed in non-treated stroked animals. MLS was not associated with survival and functional outcomes in NSC EV-treated animals. In contrast to untreated animals, NSC EVs improved stroked animal outcomes regardless of MLS severity. ",
        "Estimating the 'PrEP Gap': how implementation and access to PrEP differ between countries in Europe and Central Asia in 2019. In 2019, only 14 European and Central Asian countries provided reimbursed HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). Using EMIS-2017 data, we present the difference between self-reported use and expressed need for PrEP in individual countries and the European Union (EU). We estimate that 500,000 men who have sex with men in the EU cannot access PrEP, although they would be very likely to use it. PrEP's potential to eliminate HIV is currently unrealised by national healthcare systems. ",
        "Freestanding Emergency Department Entry and Market-level Spending on Emergency Care. BACKGROUND: Freestanding emergency departments (FrEDs) could reduce wait times in overcrowded emergency departments (EDs), but they might also increase usage and overall spending for emergency care. We investigate the relationship between the number of FrEDs entering a local market and overall spending on emergency care. METHODS: We accessed data from Arizona, Florida, North Carolina, and Texas in Blue Cross Blue Shield Axis; a limited data set of deidentified insurance data claims that we linked to Public Use Microdata Area (PUMA) data from the American Community Survey; and lists of licensed FrEDs from state agencies. Regression analysis was used to estimate the association between changes in the number of FrEDs in 495 PUMAs and total spending on emergency care, out-of-pocket spending, utilization, and price per visit from January 2013 to December 2017. Final estimates came from a PUMA-level fixed-effects model, with controls for state, quarter, and PUMA-level demographics. RESULTS: Entry of an additional FrED in a PUMA was associated with a 3.6 percentage point (pp; CI\u00a0= 2.4 to 4.9) increase in emergency provider reimbursement per insured beneficiary in Texas, Florida, and North Carolina. There was no change in spending (2.5 pp; CI\u00a0= -8.2 to 3.1) associated with a FrED's entry in Arizona. Entry of an additional FrED was associated with a 0.18 (CI\u00a0= 0.12 to 0.23) increase in the number of emergency care visits per 100 enrollees in Texas, Florida, and Arizona. In contrast, entry of another FrED was not associated with a change in utilization (-0.03; CI = \u00a0-0.09 to 0.02) in North Carolina. Estimated out-of-pocket payments for emergency care increased 3.6 pp (CI\u00a0=\u00a02.5 to 4.8) with the entry of a FrED in Texas, Florida, and Arizona, but declined by 15.3 pp (CI\u00a0= -26.8 to -3.7) in North Carolina. CONCLUSIONS: Rather than functioning as substitutes for hospital-based EDs, FrEDs have increased local market spending on emergency care in three of four states' markets where they have entered. State policy makers and researchers should carefully track spending and utilization of emergency care as FrEDs disseminate to better understand their potential health benefits and cost implications for patients.

        "Probiotic Bacillus subtilis Protects against \u03b1-Synuclein Aggregation in C.\u00a0elegans. Recent discoveries have implicated the gut microbiome in the progression and severity of Parkinson's disease; however, how gut bacteria affect such neurodegenerative disorders remains unclear. Here, we report that the Bacillus subtilis probiotic strain PXN21 inhibits \u03b1-synuclein aggregation and clears preformed aggregates in an established Caenorhabditis elegans model of synucleinopathy. This protection is seen in young and aging animals and is partly mediated by DAF-16. Multiple B.\u00a0subtilis strains trigger the protective effect via both spores and vegetative cells, partly due to a biofilm formation in the gut of the worms and the release of bacterial metabolites. We identify several host metabolic pathways differentially regulated in response to probiotic exposure, including sphingolipid metabolism. We further demonstrate functional roles of the sphingolipid metabolism genes lagr-1, asm-3, and sptl-3 in the anti-aggregation effect. Our findings provide a basis for exploring the disease-modifying potential of B.\u00a0subtilis as a dietary supplement. ",
        "Inhibiting bacterial cooperation is an evolutionarily robust anti-biofilm strategy. Bacteria commonly form dense biofilms encased in extracellular polymeric substances (EPS). Biofilms are often extremely tolerant to antimicrobials but their reliance on shared EPS may also be a weakness as social evolution theory predicts that inhibiting shared traits can select against resistance. Here we show that EPS of Salmonella biofilms is a cooperative trait whose benefit is shared among cells, and that EPS inhibition reduces both cell attachment and antimicrobial tolerance. We then compare an EPS inhibitor to conventional antimicrobials in an evolutionary experiment. While resistance against conventional antimicrobials rapidly evolves, we see no evolution of resistance to EPS inhibition. We further show that a resistant strain is outcompeted by a susceptible strain under EPS inhibitor treatment, explaining why resistance does not evolve. Our work suggests that targeting cooperative traits is a viable solution to the problem of antimicrobial resistance. ",

Identification of pheromone receptors plays a central role for uncovering signaling pathways that underlie chemical communication in animals. Here, we describe the synthesis and bioactivity of photoaffinity probes for the ascaroside ascr#8, a sex-pheromone of the model nematode, Caenorhabditis elegans. Structure-activity studies guided incorporation of alkyne- and diazirine-moieties and revealed that addition of functionality in the sidechain of ascr#8 was well tolerated, whereas modifications to the ascarylose moiety resulted in loss of biological activity. Our study will guide future probe design and provides a basis for pheromone receptor identification via photoaffinity labeling in C. elegans. ",
        "Vision-related quality of life and visual function in a 70-year-old Swedish population. PURPOSE: To investigate vision-related quality of life (VRQoL), visual function and predictors of poor vision in a population of 70-year-olds. METHODS: Self-reported ocular morbidity and responses to the National Eye Institute Visual Functioning Questionnaire-25 (NEI VFQ-25) in a cross-sectional population study (N\u00a0=\u00a01203) in Gothenburg, Sweden, were compared with results from ophthalmic examination (N\u00a0=\u00a0560). RESULTS: The most common self-reported ophthalmic morbidities were cataract (23.4%), age-related macular degeneration (AMD; 4.7%), glaucoma (4.3%) and diabetic retinopathy (1.4%). Cataract was more prevalent in women (p\u00a0=\u00a00.001). The composite score from NEI VFQ-25 for the entire cohort was 91.4 (standard deviation: 27.5). When comparing composite score for different eye diseases, persons with cataract or AMD exhibited lower scores (p\u00a0=\u00a00.029 and 0.018, respectively). Best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was normal (\u22650.5 decimal) in 98.9%; two individuals had low vision (<0.3). Men exhibited better BCVA (median: -0.08 logMAR) than women (-0.06; p\u00a0=\u00a00.005). Visual field defects were observed in 16.3% and uncorrected refractive errors in 61.5%. Poor vision was reported by 7.4% of participants with presenting visual acuity (PVA) \u22650.5 (decimal), while 66.7% with PVA <0.5 reported good vision. Of 27 individuals with PVA <0.5, 55.6% obtained a BCVA of \u22651.0 with the right correction. Low contrast sensitivity was a significant predictor of experiencing poor vision (p\u00a0=\u00a00.008), while PVA and visual field defects were not. CONCLUSIONS: Low contrast sensitivity is a predictor of experiencing poor vision. There is a discrepancy between subjective/objective visual function and a high prevalence of uncorrected refractive errors. Women have more cataract, and men demonstrate slightly better visual acuity. ",
        "Increased expression of schizophrenia-associated gene C4 leads to hypoconnectivity of prefrontal cortex and reduced social interaction. Schizophrenia is a severe mental disorder with an unclear pathophysiology. Increased expression of the immune gene C4 has been linked to a greater risk of developing schizophrenia; however, it is not known whether C4 plays a causative role in this brain disorder. Using confocal imaging and whole-cell electrophysiology, we demonstrate that overexpression of C4 in mouse prefrontal cortex neurons leads to perturbations in dendritic spine development and hypoconnectivity, which mirror neuropathologies found in schizophrenia patients. We find evidence that microglia-mediated synaptic engulfment is enhanced with increased expression of C4. We also show that C4-dependent circuit dysfunction in the frontal cortex leads to decreased social interactions in juvenile and adult mice. These results demonstrate that increased expression of the schizophrenia-associated gene C4 causes aberrant circuit wiring in the developing prefrontal cortex and leads to deficits in juvenile and adult social behavior, suggesting that altered C4 expression contributes directly to schizophrenia pathogenesis.

        "Phase separation of TPX2 enhances and spatially coordinates microtubule nucleation. Phase separation of substrates and effectors is proposed to enhance biological reaction rates and efficiency. Targeting protein for Xklp2 (TPX2) is an effector of branching microtubule nucleation in spindles and functions with the substrate tubulin by an unknown mechanism. Here we show that TPX2 phase separates into a co-condensate with tubulin, which mediates microtubule nucleation in vitro and in isolated cytosol. TPX2-tubulin co-condensation preferentially occurs on pre-existing microtubules, the site of branching microtubule nucleation, at the endogenous and physiologically relevant concentration of TPX2. Truncation and chimera versions of TPX2 suggest that TPX2-tubulin co-condensation enhances the efficiency of TPX2-mediated branching microtubule nucleation. Finally, the known inhibitor of TPX2, the importin-\u03b1/\u03b2 heterodimer, regulates TPX2 condensation in vitro and, consequently, branching microtubule nucleation activity in isolated cytosol. Our study demonstrates how regulated phase separation can simultaneously enhance reaction efficiency and spatially coordinate microtubule nucleation, which may facilitate rapid and accurate spindle formation.

        "Associations between indoor environmental quality in schools and symptom reporting in pupil-administered questionnaires. BACKGROUND: The associations between indoor environmental quality (IEQ) in homes and symptom reporting of children have been extensively studied, but only few large-scale studies have been done in schools. We examined associations between expert-assessed IEQ in schools and pupils' reporting of different symptoms, and whether associations were stronger if participants relate symptoms to the school environment. METHODS: The questionnaire survey was done in all primary and secondary schools in two areas of Helsinki, Finland. Primary school pupils (grade 3-6, n\u2009=\u20098775, 99 school-buildings) and secondary school pupils (grade 7-9, n\u2009=\u20093410, 30 school-buildings) reported their symptoms. Symptoms were combined into respiratory, lower respiratory, eye, skin, and general symptom groups. Surveys were also done among the parents of the primary school pupils (grade 1-6, n\u2009=\u20093540, 88 school buildings), but results are reported only in the supplement due to the low response rate (20% in 2017 and 13% in 2018). The associations between IEQ and symptoms were analyzed using multilevel logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: Several of the IEQ indicators were highly correlated and indicators were therefore mainly analyzed by combining them into a summary score and into latent classes. Dose-response associations were found between IEQ problems and higher reporting of respiratory and general symptoms among both primary and secondary school pupils. Some associations were also observed with lower respiratory and skin symptoms, but not with eye symptoms. The associations were somewhat stronger with symptoms related to the school environment compared to symptoms reported without such relation: for a unit change in IEQ summary score and respiratory symptoms in primary schools, odds ratios were 1.07 (95% CI 1.02-1.06) and 1.04 (95% CI 1.04-1.10), and in secondary schools 1.09 (95% CI 1.01-1.09) and 1.05 (95% CI 1.02-1.17), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Expert-assessed IEQ problems in schools were associated with increased reporting of especially respiratory and general symptoms. The associations were only somewhat stronger in magnitude for symptoms reported in relation to the school environment compared to symptoms reported without such relation. ",
        "Prevention of connexin-43 remodeling protects against Duchenne muscular dystrophy cardiomyopathy. Aberrant expression of the cardiac gap junction protein connexin-43 (Cx43) has been suggested as playing a role in the development of cardiac disease in the mdx mouse model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD); however, a mechanistic understanding of this association is lacking. Here, we identified a reduction of phosphorylation of Cx43 serines S325/S328/S330 in human and mouse DMD hearts. We hypothesized that hypophosphorylation of Cx43 serine-triplet triggers pathological Cx43 redistribution to the lateral sides of cardiomyocytes (remodeling). Therefore, we generated knockin mdx mice in which the Cx43 serine-triplet was replaced with either phospho-mimicking glutamic acids (mdxS3E) or nonphosphorylatable alanines (mdxS3A). The mdxS3E, but not mdxS3A, mice were resistant to Cx43 remodeling, with a corresponding reduction of Cx43 hemichannel activity. MdxS3E cardiomyocytes displayed improved intracellular Ca2+ signaling and a reduction of NADPH oxidase 2 (NOX2)/ROS production. Furthermore, mdxS3E mice were protected against inducible arrhythmias, related lethality, and the development of cardiomyopathy. Inhibition of microtubule polymerization by colchicine reduced both NOX2/ROS and oxidized CaMKII, increased S325/S328/S330 phosphorylation, and prevented Cx43 remodeling in mdx hearts. Together, these results demonstrate a mechanism of dystrophic Cx43 remodeling and suggest that targeting Cx43 may be a therapeutic strategy for preventing heart dysfunction and arrhythmias in DMD patients.

        "Inflammation-induced IgE promotes epithelial hyperplasia and tumour growth. IgE is the least abundant circulating antibody class but is constitutively present in healthy tissues bound to resident cells via its high-affinity receptor, Fc\u03b5RI. The physiological role of endogenous IgE antibodies is unclear but it has been suggested that they provide host protection against a variety of noxious environmental substances and parasitic infections at epithelial barrier surfaces. Here we show, in mice, that skin inflammation enhances levels of IgE antibodies that have natural specificities and a repertoire, VDJ rearrangements and CDRH3 characteristics similar to those of IgE antibodies in healthy tissue. IgE-bearing basophils are recruited to inflamed skin via CXCL12 and thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP)/IL-3-dependent upregulation of CXCR4. In the inflamed skin, IgE/Fc\u03b5RI-signalling in basophils promotes epithelial cell growth and differentiation, partly through histamine engagement of H1R and H4R. Furthermore, this IgE response strongly drives tumour outgrowth of epithelial cells harbouring oncogenic mutation. These findings indicate that natural IgE antibodies support skin barrier defences, but that during chronic tissue inflammation this role may be subverted to promote tumour growth. ",
        "Dynamic MAIT cell response with progressively enhanced innateness during acute HIV-1 infection. Mucosa-associated invariant T (MAIT) cell loss in chronic HIV-1 infection is a significant insult to antimicrobial immune defenses. Here we investigate the response of MAIT cells during acute HIV-1 infection utilizing the RV217 cohort with paired longitudinal pre- and post-infection samples. MAIT cells are activated and expand in blood and mucosa coincident with peak HIV-1 viremia, in a manner associated with emerging microbial translocation. This is followed by a phase with elevated function as viral replication is controlled to a set-point level, and later by their functional decline at the onset of chronic infection. Interestingly, enhanced innate-like pathways and characteristics develop progressively in MAIT cells during infection, in parallel with TCR repertoire alterations. These findings delineate the dynamic MAIT cell response to acute HIV-1 infection, and show how the MAIT compartment initially responds and expands with enhanced function, followed by progressive reprogramming away from TCR-dependent antibacterial responses towards innate-like functionality.

        "Cell division rates decrease with age, providing a potential explanation for the age-dependent deceleration in cancer incidence. A new evaluation of previously published data suggested to us that the accumulation of mutations might slow, rather than increase, as individuals age. To explain this unexpected finding, we hypothesized that normal stem cell division rates might decrease as we age. To test this hypothesis, we evaluated cell division rates in the epithelium of human colonic, duodenal, esophageal, and posterior ethmoid sinonasal tissues. In all 4 tissues, there was a significant decrease in cell division rates with age. In contrast, cell division rates did not decrease in the colon of aged mice, and only small decreases were observed in their small intestine or esophagus. These results have important implications for understanding the relationship between normal stem cells, aging, and cancer. Moreover, they provide a plausible explanation for the enigmatic age-dependent deceleration in cancer incidence in very old humans but not in mice. ",
        "Sensory innervation in porous endplates by Netrin-1 from osteoclasts mediates PGE2-induced spinal hypersensitivity in mice. Spinal pain is a major clinical problem, however, its origins and underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here we report that in mice, osteoclasts induce sensory innervation in the porous endplates which contributes to\u00a0spinal hypersensitivity in mice. Sensory innervation of the porous areas of sclerotic endplates in mice was confirmed. Lumbar spine instability (LSI), or aging, induces spinal hypersensitivity in mice. In these conditions, we show that there are elevated levels of PGE2 which activate sensory nerves, leading to sodium influx through Nav 1.8 channels. We show that knockout of PGE2 receptor 4 in sensory nerves significantly reduces spinal hypersensitivity. Inhibition of osteoclast formation by knockout Rankl in the osteocytes significantly inhibits LSI-induced porosity of endplates, sensory innervation, and spinal hypersensitivity. Knockout of Netrin-1 in osteoclasts abrogates sensory innervation into porous endplates and spinal hypersensitivity. These findings suggest that osteoclast-initiated porosity of endplates and sensory innervation are potential therapeutic targets for spinal pain. ",
        "Duodenum Intestine-Chip for preclinical drug assessment in a human relevant model. Induction of intestinal drug metabolizing enzymes can complicate the development of new drugs, owing to the potential to cause drug-drug interactions (DDIs) leading to changes in pharmacokinetics, safety and efficacy. The development of a human-relevant model of the adult intestine that accurately predicts CYP450 induction could help address this challenge as species differences preclude extrapolation from animals. Here, we combined organoids and Organs-on-Chips technology to create a human Duodenum Intestine-Chip that emulates intestinal tissue architecture and functions, that are relevant for the study of drug transport, metabolism, and DDI. Duodenum Intestine-Chip demonstrates the polarized cell architecture, intestinal barrier function, presence of specialized cell subpopulations, and in vivo relevant expression, localization, and function of major intestinal drug transporters. Notably, in comparison to Caco-2, it displays improved CYP3A4 expression and induction capability. This model could enable improved in vitro to in vivo extrapolation for better predictions of human pharmacokinetics and risk of DDIs. ",
        "Extremely Low Concentrations of Acetic Acid Stimulate Cell Differentiation in Rice Blast Fungus. Metabolic switching and rewiring play a dynamic role in programmed cell differentiation. Many pathogenic microbes need to survive in nutrient-deficient conditions and use the glyoxylate cycle, an anaplerotic pathway of the tricarboxylic acid cycle, to produce carbohydrates. The plant pathogenic fungus Magnaporthe oryzae (Pyricularia oryzae) has a unique chitin deacetylase, Cbp1. The spatiotemporal activity of this protein is required for modification of the M.\u00a0oryzae wall and for cell differentiation into the specialized infection structure (appressorium). Here we show that acetic acid, another product released by the Cbp1-catalyzed conversion of chitin into chitosan, induces appressorium formation. An extremely low concentration (fM) of acetic acid restored cell differentiation in a \u0394cbp1 mutant possibly through the glyoxylate cycle. ",
        "Sucrose intake lowers \u03bc-opioid and dopamine D2/3 receptor availability in porcine brain. Excessive sucrose consumption elicits addiction-like craving that may underpin the obesity epidemic. Opioids and dopamine mediate the rewarding effects of drugs of abuse, and of natural rewards from stimuli such as palatable food. We investigated the effects of sucrose using PET imaging with [11C]carfentanil (\u03bc-opioid receptor agonist) and [11C]raclopride (dopamine D2/3 receptor antagonist) in seven female anesthetized G\u00f6ttingen minipigs. We then gave minipigs access to sucrose solution for one hour on 12 consecutive days and performed imaging again 24\u2009hours after the final sucrose access. In a smaller sample of five minipigs, we performed an additional [11C]carfentanil PET session after the first sucrose exposure. We calculated voxel-wise binding potentials (BPND) using the cerebellum as a region of non-displaceable binding, analyzed differences with statistical non-parametric mapping, and performed a regional analysis. After 12 days of sucrose access, BPND of both tracers had declined significantly in striatum, nucleus accumbens, thalamus, amygdala, cingulate cortex and prefrontal cortex, consistent with down-regulation of receptor densities. After a single exposure to sucrose, we found decreased binding of [11C]carfentanil in nucleus accumbens and cingulate cortex, consistent with opioid release. The lower availability of opioid and dopamine receptors may explain the addictive potential associated with intake of sucrose. ",
        "Mesoporous silica with precisely controlled pores reduces food efficiency and suppresses weight gain in mice. Aim: Obesity is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease and diabetes. We aimed to elucidate the effects of distinct mesoporous silica particles (MSPs) supplemented in food on metabolic parameters in obesity. Materials & methods: MSPs with precisely controlled pore size were synthesized, characterized and compared with a control in a C57Bl/6 mouse diet-induced obesity model, studying weight, adiposity, metabolic regulation and food efficiency. Results: The most effective MSPs reduced adipose tissue formation to 6.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.5\u00a0g compared with 9.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.2\u00a0g, leptin levels nearly halved from 32.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a07.4 to 16.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.9\u00a0ng/ml and a 33% reduction of food efficiency. Control MSP showed no effects. Conclusion: Results demonstrate potential of distinct MSPs to improve metabolic risk factors. Further studies investigating mechanism of action and confirming human safety are needed. ",
        "One-Shot Tagging During Wake and Cueing During Sleep With Spatiotemporal Patterns of Transcranial Electrical Stimulation Can Boost Long-Term Metamemory of Individual Episodes in Humans. Targeted memory reactivation (TMR) during slow-wave oscillations (SWOs) in sleep has been demonstrated with sensory cues to achieve about 5-12% improvement in post-nap memory performance on simple laboratory tasks. But prior work has not yet addressed the one-shot aspect of episodic memory acquisition, or dealt with the presence of interference from ambient environmental cues in real-world settings. Further, TMR with sensory cues may not be scalable to the multitude of experiences over one's lifetime. We designed a novel non-invasive non-sensory paradigm that tags one-shot experiences of minute-long naturalistic episodes in immersive virtual reality (VR) with unique spatiotemporal amplitude-modulated patterns (STAMPs) of transcranial electrical stimulation (tES). In particular, we demonstrated that these STAMPs can be re-applied as brief pulses during SWOs in sleep to achieve about 10-20% improvement in the metamemory of targeted episodes compared to the control episodes at 48 hours after initial viewing. We found that STAMPs can not only facilitate but also impair metamemory for the targeted episodes based on an interaction between pre-sleep metamemory and the number of STAMP applications during sleep. Overnight metamemory improvements were mediated by spectral power increases following the offset of STAMPs in the slow-spindle band (8-12 Hz) for left temporal areas in the scalp electroencephalography (EEG) during sleep. These results prescribe an optimal strategy to leverage STAMPs for boosting metamemory and suggest that real-world episodic memories can be modulated in a targeted manner even with coarser, non-invasive spatiotemporal stimulation.

        "Solid-state nanopore fabrication by automated controlled breakdown. Solid-state nanopores are now well established as single-biomolecule sensors that hold great promise as sensing elements in diagnostic and sequencing applications. However, until recently this promise has been limited by the expensive, labor-intensive, and low-yield methods used to fabricate low-noise and precisely sized pores. To address this problem, we pioneered a low-cost and scalable solid-state nanopore fabrication method, termed controlled breakdown (CBD), which is rapidly becoming the method of choice for fabricating solid-state nanopores. Since its initial development, nanopore research groups around the world have applied and adapted the CBD method in a variety of ways, with varying levels of success. In this work, we present our accumulated knowledge of nanopore fabrication by CBD, including a detailed description of the instrumentation, software, and procedures required to reliably fabricate low-noise and precisely sized solid-state nanopores with a yield of >85% in less than 1 h. The assembly instructions for the various custom instruments can be found in the Supplementary Manual, and take approximately a day to complete, depending on the unit that the user is building and their level of skill with mechanical and electrical assembly. Unlike traditional beam-based nanopore fabrication technologies, the methods presented here are accessible to non-experts, lowering the cost of, and technical barriers to, fabricating nanoscale pores in thin solid-state membranes.

        "Epigenetic reprogramming at estrogen-receptor binding sites alters 3D chromatin landscape in endocrine-resistant breast cancer. Endocrine therapy resistance frequently develops in estrogen receptor positive (ER+) breast cancer, but the underlying molecular mechanisms are largely unknown. Here, we show that 3-dimensional (3D) chromatin interactions both within and between topologically associating domains (TADs) frequently change in ER+\u2009endocrine-resistant breast cancer cells and that the differential interactions are enriched for resistance-associated genetic variants at CTCF-bound anchors. Ectopic chromatin interactions are preferentially enriched at active enhancers and promoters and ER binding sites, and are associated with altered expression of ER-regulated genes, consistent with dynamic remodelling of ER pathways accompanying the development of endocrine resistance. We observe that loss of 3D chromatin interactions often occurs coincidently with hypermethylation and loss of ER binding. Alterations in active A and inactive B chromosomal compartments are also associated with decreased ER binding and atypical interactions and gene expression. Together, our results suggest that 3D epigenome remodelling is a key mechanism underlying endocrine resistance in ER+\u2009breast cancer. ",
        "The Risk of Head Injuries Associated With Antipsychotic Use Among Persons With Alzheimer's disease. BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Antipsychotic use is associated with risk of falls among older persons, but we are not aware of previous studies investigating risk of head injuries. We studied the association of antipsychotic use and risk of head injuries among community dwellers with Alzheimer's disease (AD). DESIGN: Nationwide register-based cohort study. SETTING: Medication Use and Alzheimer's Disease (MEDALZ) cohort, Finland. PARTICIPANTS: The MEDALZ cohort includes Finnish community dwellers who received clinically verified AD diagnosis in 2005 to 2011. Incident antipsychotic users were identified from the Prescription Register and matched with nonusers by age, sex, and time since AD diagnosis (21 795 matched pairs). Persons with prior head injury or history of schizophrenia were excluded. MEASUREMENTS: Outcomes were incident head injuries (International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision [ICD-10] codes S00-S09) and traumatic brain injuries (TBIs; ICD-10 codes S06.0-S06.9) resulting in a hospital admission (Hospital Discharge Register) or death (Causes of Death Register). Inverse probability of treatment (IPT) weighted Cox proportional hazard models were used to assess relative risks. RESULTS: Antipsychotic use was associated with an increased risk of head injuries (event rate per 100 person-years = 1.65 [95% confidence interval {CI} =\u20091.50-1.81] for users and 1.26 [95% CI = 1.16-1.37] for nonusers; IPT-weighted hazard ratio [HR] =\u20091.29 [95% CI = 1.14-1.47]) and TBIs (event rate per 100 person-years = 0.90 [95% CI = 0.79-1.02] for users and 0.72 [95% CI = 0.65-0.81] for nonusers; IPT-weighted HR = 1.22 [95% CI = 1.03-1.45]). Quetiapine users had higher risk of TBIs (IPT-weighted HR = 1.60 [95% CI = 1.15-2.22]) in comparison to risperidone users. CONCLUSIONS: These findings imply that in addition to previously reported adverse events and effects, antipsychotic use may increase the risk of head injuries and TBIs in persons with AD. Therefore, their use should be restricted to most severe neuropsychiatric symptoms, as recommended by the AGS Beers Criteria\u00ae. Additionally, higher relative risk of TBIs in quetiapine users compared to risperidone users should be confirmed in further studies. J Am Geriatr Soc 68:595-602, 2020. ",
        "Thematic analysis of spousal interaction patterns among Asian parents of children with chronic life-threatening illness. OBJECTIVE: This is the first known study which examines the evolutionary nature of spousal interaction patterns among Asian parents of children with chronic life-threatening illness, from the time of providing care to their child through bereavement. This study is informed by earlier findings that when a child is diagnosed with a chronic life-threatening illness, parents are faced with multiple stressors, leaving them with little time to invest in their spousal relationship. PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: A constructivist-phenomenological research paradigm was adopted and meaning-oriented interviews were conducted with 20 parental units (i.e., 6 couples, 12 lone mothers and 2 lone fathers) of Chinese, Malay and Indian ethnicities who lost their child to chronic life-threatening illness in Singapore. RESULTS: Qualitative thematic analysis of the data revealed four themes, which describe the evolutionary nature of spousal interaction patterns among Asian parents of children with chronic life-threatening illness, from caregiving through bereavement. Findings reveal participants' tendency to concentrate on pragmatic, solution-focused communication during the period of caregiving (pragmatic interaction), avoid discussion about their emotional pain as a means of protecting their spouse (partner-oriented self-regulation), respect and acknowledge their spouse's personal coping strategies (empathic responding) and show greater appreciation and emotional expression within the spousal relationship after their child's death (affective appreciation). CONCLUSION: Engaging in pragmatic discussions, deferring emotion-focused and potentially distressing conversations, and acknowledging their spouse's need for personal space are important coping strategies for Asian couples facing their child's chronic life-threatening illness and in the immediate aftermath of his/her death. Bereaved couples who have processed their grief individually feel ready to share their reflections with their spouse, deriving meaning and greater relational closeness through such disclosure. These findings are discussed from a cultural lens, with recommendations for healthcare professionals working with Asian parents of children with chronic life-threatening illness. ",
        "A Microglia Sublineage Protects from Sex-Linked Anxiety Symptoms and Obsessive Compulsion. Aberrant microglia activity is associated with many neurological and psychiatric disorders, yet our knowledge\u00a0about the pathological mechanisms is incomplete. Here, we describe a genetically defined microglia\u00a0sublineage in mice which has the ability to suppress obsessive compulsion and anxiety symptoms. These microglia derive from precursors expressing the transcription factor Hoxb8. Selective ablation of Hoxb8-lineage microglia or the Hoxb8 gene revealed that dysfunction in this cell type causes severe over-grooming and anxiety-like behavior and\u00a0stress responses. Moreover, we show that the severity of the pathology is set by female sex hormones. Together, our findings reveal that different microglia lineages have distinct functions. In addition, our data suggest a mechanistic link between biological sex and genetics, two major risk factors for developing anxiety and related disorders in humans. ",
        "A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of blue wavelength light exposure on sleep and recovery of brain structure, function, and cognition following mild traumatic brain injury. Sleep and circadian rhythms are among the most powerful but least understood contributors to cognitive performance and brain health. Here we capitalize on the circadian resetting effect of blue-wavelength light to phase shift the sleep patterns of adult patients (aged 18-48\u00a0years) recovering from mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI), with the aim of facilitating recovery of brain structure, connectivity, and cognitive performance. During a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 32 adults with a recent mTBI, we compared 6-weeks of daily 30-min pulses of blue light (peak \u03bb\u00a0=\u00a0469\u00a0nm) each morning versus amber placebo light (peak \u03bb\u00a0=\u00a0578\u00a0nm) on neurocognitive and neuroimaging outcomes, including gray matter volume (GMV), resting-state functional connectivity, directed connectivity using Granger causality, and white matter integrity using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Relative to placebo, morning blue light led to phase-advanced sleep timing, reduced daytime sleepiness, and improved executive functioning, and was associated with increased volume of the posterior thalamus (i.e., pulvinar), greater thalamo-cortical functional connectivity, and increased axonal integrity of these pathways. These findings provide insight into the contributions of the circadian and sleep systems in brain repair and lay the groundwork for interventions targeting the retinohypothalamic system to facilitate injury recovery.

        "Heat Shock Factor 2 Protects against Proteotoxicity by Maintaining Cell-Cell Adhesion. Maintenance of protein homeostasis, through inducible expression of molecular chaperones, is essential for cell survival under protein-damaging conditions. The expression and DNA-binding activity of heat shock factor 2 (HSF2), a member of the heat shock transcription factor family, increase upon exposure to prolonged proteotoxicity. Nevertheless, the specific roles of HSF2 and the global HSF2-dependent gene expression profile during sustained stress have remained unknown. Here, we found that HSF2 is critical for cell survival during prolonged proteotoxicity. Strikingly, our RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analyses revealed that impaired viability of HSF2-deficient cells is not caused by inadequate induction of molecular chaperones but is due to marked downregulation of cadherin superfamily genes. We demonstrate that HSF2-dependent maintenance of cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion is required for protection against stress induced by proteasome inhibition. This study identifies HSF2 as a key regulator of cadherin superfamily genes and defines cell-cell adhesion as a determinant of proteotoxic stress resistance. ",
        "Milk Fat Intake and Telomere Length in U.S. Women and Men: The Role of the Milk Fat Fraction. The associations between milk intake frequency and milk fat consumption and telomere length, an index of biological aging, were studied using an NHANES sample of 5,834 U.S. adults and a cross-sectional design. The milk consumption variables were assessed with the NHANES Diet Behavior and Nutrition questionnaire. The quantitative polymerase chain reaction method was used to measure leukocyte telomere length. Results showed that milk consumption frequency was not related to telomere length; however, there was a strong association between milk fat intake and telomere length. With the sample delimited to milk drinkers only, milk fat intake was linearly and inversely related to telomere length, after adjusting for the covariates (F = 8.6, P = 0.0066). For each 1 percentage point increase in milk fat consumed (e.g., 1% to 2%), adults had more than 4 years of additional biological aging. With milk fat intake divided into 5 categories (i.e., milk abstainers, nonfat, 1%, 2%, and full-fat milk), mean telomere lengths differed across the categories (F = 4.1, P = 0.0093). The mean telomere difference between the extremes of milk fat intake (nonfat vs. full-fat) was 145 base pairs, representing years of additional biological aging for full-fat milk consumers. Effect modification testing indicated that the milk fat and cellular aging association may be partly due to saturated fat intake differences across the milk fat groups. When the sample was delimited to adults reporting only high total saturated fat intake (tertile 3), the milk fat and telomere relationship was strong. However, when the sample was restricted to adults reporting only low saturated fat consumption (tertile 1), there was no relationship between milk fat intake and telomere length. Overall, the findings highlight an association of increased biological aging in U.S. adults who consumed high-fat milk. The results support the latest Dietary Guidelines for Americans (2015-2020), which recommend consumption of low-fat milk, but not high-fat milk, as part of a healthy diet. ",
        "Cerebellar oscillations driven by synaptic pruning deficits of cerebellar climbing fibers contribute to tremor pathophysiology. Essential tremor (ET) is one of the most common movement disorders and the prototypical disorder for abnormal rhythmic movements. However, the pathophysiology of tremor generation in ET remains unclear. Here, we used autoptic cerebral tissue from patients with ET, clinical data, and mouse models to report that synaptic pruning deficits of climbing fiber (CF)-to-Purkinje cell (PC) synapses, which are related to glutamate receptor delta 2 (GluR\u03b42) protein insufficiency, cause excessive cerebellar oscillations and might be responsible for tremor. The CF-PC synaptic pruning deficits were correlated with the reduction in GluR\u03b42 expression in the postmortem ET cerebellum. Mice with GluR\u03b42 insufficiency and CF-PC synaptic pruning deficits develop ET-like tremor that can be suppressed with viral rescue of GluR\u03b42 protein. Step-by-step optogenetic or pharmacological inhibition of neuronal firing, axonal activity, or synaptic vesicle release confirmed that the activity of the excessive CF-to-PC synapses is required for tremor generation. In vivo electrophysiology in mice showed that excessive cerebellar oscillatory activity is CF dependent and necessary for tremor and optogenetic-driven PC synchronization was sufficient to generate tremor in wild-type animals. Human validation by cerebellar electroencephalography confirmed that excessive cerebellar oscillations also exist in patients with ET. Our findings identify a pathophysiologic contribution to tremor at molecular (GluR\u03b42), structural (CF-to-PC synapses), physiological (cerebellar oscillations), and behavioral levels (kinetic tremor) that might have clinical applications for treating ET.

        "Immigration and transition: Changing demographics forecast the emerging trends in spina bifida care. Globally, the number of immigrants, refugees, and internally displaced persons is escalating. While immigration is often a result of social determinants, including political discrimination, poverty, education, and work-related prospects, immigration itself can also be conceptualized as a social determinant of health. Through the National Spina Bifida Patient Registry (NSBPR), investigators have begun to recognize existing disparities within growing minority populations affected by spina bifida. Concurrently these individuals are also living longer, therefore, these demographic shifts in age and ethnicity give rise to the dawn of a new era in care. Thus, a call has gone out for multicenter learning collaboratives to face these newfound challenges. An example of such emergent learning collaboratives is the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) Spina Bifida Transition Project, sponsored by the CDC, an approach in accordance with the recently published Guidelines for the Care of People with Spina Bifida. Henceforth, it can also be trusted that related original research published in JPRM will continue to serve as a catalyst for culturally-competent investigation and comparative analysis to improve care worldwide.

BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE: The benefits and harms of screening of Alzheimer disease and related dementias (ADRDs) are unknown. This study addressed the question of whether the benefits outweigh the harms of screening for ADRDs among older adults in primary care. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Single-blinded, two-arm, randomized controlled trial (October 2012-September 2016) in urban, suburban, and rural primary care settings in Indiana. A total of 4005 primary care patients (aged \u226565\u2009years) were randomized to ADRD screening (n = 2008) or control (n = 1997). INTERVENTION: Patients were screened using the Memory Impairment Screen or the Mini-Cog and referred for a voluntary follow-up diagnostic assessment if they screened positive on either or both screening tests. MEASUREMENTS: Primary measures were health-related quality of life (HRQOL; Health Utilities Index) at 12\u2009months, depressive symptoms (Patient Health Questionnaire-9), and anxiety symptoms (Generalized Anxiety Disorder seven-item scale) at 1 month. RESULTS: The mean age was 74.2\u2009years (SD = 6.9\u2009years); 2257 (66%) were female and 2301 (67%) were white. At 12\u2009months, we were unable to detect differences in HRQOL between the groups (effect size = 0.009 [95% confidence interval {CI} = -0.063 to 0.080]; P = .81). At 1 month, differences in mean depressive symptoms (mean difference = -0.23 [90% CI = -0.42 to -0.039]) and anxiety symptoms (mean difference = -0.087 [90% CI = -0.246 to 0.072]) were within prespecified equivalency range. Scores for depressive and anxiety symptoms were similar between the groups at all time points. No differences in healthcare utilization, advance care planning, and ADRD recognition by physicians were detected at 12\u2009months. CONCLUSION: We were unable to detect a difference in HRQOL for screening for ADRD among older adults. We found no harm from screening measured by symptoms of depression or anxiety. Missing data, low rates of dementia detection, and high rate of refusal for follow-up diagnostic assessments after a positive screen may explain these findings. J Am Geriatr Soc 68:535-543, 2020. ",
        "Post-discharge acute care and outcomes following readmission reduction initiatives: national retrospective cohort study of Medicare beneficiaries in the United States. OBJECTIVES: To determine whether patients discharged after hospital admissions for conditions covered by national readmission programs who received care in emergency departments or observation units but were not readmitted within 30 days had an increased risk of death and to evaluate temporal trends in post-discharge acute care utilization in inpatient units, emergency departments, and observation units for these patients. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Medicare claims data for 2008-16 in the United States. PARTICIPANTS: Patients aged 65 or older admitted to hospital with heart failure, acute myocardial infarction, or pneumonia-conditions included in the US Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Post-discharge 30 day mortality according to patients' 30 day acute care utilization; acute care utilization in inpatient and observation units and the emergency department during the 30 day and 31-90 day post-discharge period. RESULTS: 3\u2009772\u2009924 hospital admissions for heart failure, 1\u2009570\u2009113 for acute myocardial infarction, and 3\u2009131\u2009162 for pneumonia occurred. The overall post-discharge 30 day mortality was 8.7% for heart failure, 7.3% for acute myocardial infarction, and 8.4% for pneumonia. Risk adjusted mortality increased annually by 0.05% (95% confidence interval 0.02% to 0.08%) for heart failure, decreased by 0.06% (-0.09% to -0.04%) for acute myocardial infarction, and did not significantly change for pneumonia. Specifically, mortality increased for patients with heart failure who did not utilize any post-discharge acute care, increasing at a rate of 0.08% (0.05% to 0.12%) per year, exceeding the overall absolute annual increase in post-discharge mortality in heart failure, without an increase in mortality in observation units or the emergency department. Concurrent with a reduction in 30 day readmission rates, stays for observation and visits to the emergency department increased across all three conditions during and beyond the 30 day post-discharge period. Overall 30 day post-acute care utilization did not change significantly. CONCLUSIONS: The only condition with increasing mortality through the study period was heart failure; the increase preceded the policy and was not present among patients who received emergency department or observation unit care without admission to hospital. During this period, the overall acute care utilization in the 30 days after discharge significantly decreased for heart failure and pneumonia, but not for acute myocardial infarction. ",
        "A lung rescue team improves survival in obesity with acute respiratory distress syndrome. BACKGROUND: Limited data exist regarding ventilation in patients with class III obesity [body mass index (BMI)\u2009>\u200940\u2009kg/m2] and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The aim of the present study was to determine whether an individualized titration of mechanical ventilation according to cardiopulmonary physiology reduces the mortality in patients with class III obesity and ARDS. METHODS: In this retrospective study, we enrolled adults admitted to the ICU from 2012 to 2017 who had class III obesity and ARDS and received mechanical ventilation for >\u200948\u2009h. Enrolled patients were divided in two cohorts: one cohort (2012-2014) had ventilator settings determined by the ARDSnet table for lower positive end-expiratory pressure/higher inspiratory fraction of oxygen (standard protocol-based cohort); the other cohort (2015-2017) had ventilator settings determined by an individualized protocol established by a lung rescue team (lung rescue team cohort). The lung rescue team used lung recruitment maneuvers, esophageal manometry, and hemodynamic monitoring. RESULTS: The standard protocol-based cohort included 70 patients (BMI\u2009=\u200949\u2009\u00b1\u20099\u2009kg/m2), and the lung rescue team cohort included 50 patients (BMI\u2009=\u200954\u2009\u00b1\u200913\u2009kg/m2). Patients in the standard protocol-based cohort compared to lung rescue team cohort had almost double the risk of dying at 28\u2009days [31% versus 16%, P\u2009=\u20090.012; hazard ratio (HR) 0.32; 95% confidence interval (CI95%) 0.13-0.78] and 3\u00a0months (41% versus 22%, P\u2009=\u20090.006; HR 0.35; CI95% 0.16-0.74), and this effect persisted at 6\u00a0months and 1\u00a0year (incidence of death unchanged 41% versus 22%, P\u2009=\u20090.006; HR 0.35; CI95% 0.16-0.74). CONCLUSION: Individualized titration of mechanical ventilation by a lung rescue team was associated with decreased mortality compared to use of an ARDSnet table. ",
        "The lipid elongation enzyme ELOVL2 is a molecular regulator of aging in the retina. Methylation of the regulatory region of the elongation of very-long-chain fatty acids-like 2 (ELOVL2) gene, an enzyme involved in elongation of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids, is one of the most robust biomarkers of human age, but the critical question of whether ELOVL2 plays a functional role in molecular aging has not been resolved. Here, we report that Elovl2 regulates age-associated functional and anatomical aging in vivo, focusing on mouse retina, with direct relevance to age-related eye diseases. We show that an age-related decrease in Elovl2 expression is associated with increased DNA methylation of its promoter. Reversal of Elovl2 promoter hypermethylation in vivo through intravitreal injection of 5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-Aza-dc) leads to increased Elovl2 expression and rescue of age-related decline in visual function. Mice carrying a point mutation C234W that disrupts Elovl2-specific enzymatic activity show electrophysiological characteristics of premature visual decline, as well as early appearance of autofluorescent deposits, well-established markers of aging in the mouse retina. Finally, we find deposits underneath the retinal pigment epithelium in Elovl2 mutant mice, containing components\u00a0found in\u00a0human drusen, a pathologic hallmark of age related macular degeneration. These findings indicate that ELOVL2 activity regulates aging in mouse retina, provide a molecular link between polyunsaturated fatty acids elongation and visual function, and suggest novel therapeutic strategies for the treatment of age-related eye diseases.

        "Measurement of Microcystin and Nodularin Activity in Human Urine by Immunocapture-Protein Phosphatase 2A Assay. Microcystins (MC) and nodularin (NOD) are toxins released by cyanobacteria during harmful algal blooms. They are potent inhibitors of protein phosphatases 1 and 2A (PP1 and PP2A) and cause a variety of adverse symptoms in humans and animals if ingested. More than 250 chemically diverse congeners of MCs have been identified, but certified reference materials are only available for a few. A diagnostic test that does not require each reference material for detection is necessary to identify human exposures. To address this need, our lab has developed a method that uses an antibody to specifically isolate MCs and NOD from urine prior to detection via a commercially available PP2A kit. This assay quantitates the summed inhibitory activity of nearly all MCs and NOD on PP2A relative to a common MC congener, microcystin-LR (MC-LR). The quantitation range for MC-LR using this method is from 0.050-0.500 ng/mL. No background responses were detected in a convenience set of 50 individual urines. Interday and intraday % accuracies ranged from 94%-118% and relative standard deviations were 15% or less, meeting FDA guidelines for receptor binding assays. The assay detected low levels of MCs in urines from three individuals living in close proximity to harmful algal blooms (HABs) in Florida. ",
        "Stuck in the middle: a systematic review of authorship in collaborative health research in Africa, 2014-2016. Background: Collaborations are often a cornerstone of global health research. Power dynamics can shape if and how local researchers are included in manuscripts. This article investigates how international collaborations affect the representation of local authors, overall and in first and last author positions, in African health research. Methods: We extracted papers on 'health' in sub-Saharan Africa indexed in PubMed and published between 2014 and 2016. The author's affiliation was used to classify the individual as from the country of the paper's focus, from another African country, from Europe, from the USA/Canada or from another locale. Authors classified as from the USA/Canada were further subclassified if the author was from a top US university. In primary analyses, individuals with multiple affiliations were presumed to be from a high-income country if they contained any affiliation from a high-income country. In sensitivity analyses, these individuals were presumed to be from an African country if they contained any affiliation an African country. Differences in paper characteristics and representation of local coauthors are compared by collaborative type using \u03c7\u00b2 tests. Results: Of the 7100 articles identified, 68.3% included collaborators from the USA, Canada, Europe and/or another African country. 54.0% of all 43\u2009429 authors and 52.9% of 7100 first authors were from the country of the paper's focus. Representation dropped if any collaborators were from USA, Canada or Europe with the lowest representation for collaborators from top US universities-for these papers, 41.3% of all authors and 23.0% of first authors were from country of paper's focus. Local representation was highest with collaborators from another African country. 13.5% of all papers had no local coauthors. Discussion: Individuals, institutions and funders from high-income countries should challenge persistent power differentials in global health research. South-South collaborations can help African researchers expand technical expertise while maintaining presence on the resulting research. ",

        "Surfaceome analysis of Australian epidemic Bordetella pertussis reveals potential vaccine antigens. Since acellular vaccines (ACV) were introduced in Australia, epidemic Bordetella pertussis strains changed from single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) cluster II to SNP cluster I. Our previous proteomic analysis identified potential proteomic adaptations in the whole cell and secretome of SNP cluster I. Additionally, current ACVs were shown to be less efficacious against cluster I in mice models and there is a pressing need to discover new antigens to improve the ACV. One important source of novel antigens is the surfaceome. Therefore, in this study we established surface shaving in B. pertussis to compare the surfaceome of SNP cluster I (L1423) and II (L1191), and identify novel surface antigens for vaccine development. Surface shaving using 1\u202f\u03bcg of trypsin for 5\u202fmin identified 126 proteins with the most abundant being virulence-associated and known outer membrane proteins. Cell viability counts showed minimal lysis from shaving. The proportion of immunogenic proteins was higher in the surfaceome than in the whole cell and secretome. Key differences in the surfaceome were identified between SNP cluster I and II, consistent with those identified in the whole cell proteome and secretome. These differences include unique transport proteins and decreased immunogenic proteins in L1423, and provides further evidence of proteomic adaptation in SNP cluster I. Finally, a comparison of proteins in each sub-proteome identified 22 common proteins. These included 11 virulence proteins (Prn, PtxA, FhaB, CyaA, TcfA, SphB1, Vag8, BrkA, BopD, Bsp22 and BipA) and 11 housekeeping proteins (TuF, CtpA, TsF, OmpH, GltA, SucC, SucD, FusA, GroEL, BP3330 and BP3561) which were immunogenic, essential and consistently expressed thus demonstrating their potential as future targets. This study established surface shaving in B. pertussis, confirmed key expression differences and identified unknown surface proteins which may be potential vaccine antigens. ",
        "Characteristics and Reach Equity of Policies Restricting Flavored Tobacco Product Sales in the United States. In 2009, flavored cigarettes (except menthol) were banned in the United States, but other flavored tobacco products (FTPs) were allowed. Women, populations of color, youth, sexual minority, and low-socioeconomic status populations disproportionately use FTPs. Localities have passed sales restrictions on FTPs that may reduce disparities if vulnerable populations are reached. This study assessed the extent to which FTP restrictions reached these subgroups (\"reach equity\"). We identified 189 U.S. jurisdictions with FTP policies as of December 31, 2018. We linked jurisdictions with demographics of race/ethnicity, gender, age, partnered same-sex households and household poverty, and stratified by policy strength. We calculated Reach Ratios (ReRas) to assess reach equity among subgroups covered by FTP policies relative to their U.S. population representation. Flavor policies covered 6.3% of the U.S. population (20 million individuals) across seven states; 0.9% were covered by strong policies (12.7% of policies). ReRas indicated favorable reach equity to young adults, women, Hispanics, African Americans, Asians, partnered same-sex households, and those living below poverty. Youth, American Indians/Alaska Natives (AIAN) and Native Hawaiians/Pacific Islanders (NHPI) were underrepresented. Strong policies had favorable reach equity to young adults, those living below poverty, Asians, NHPIs, individuals of 2+ races, and partnered same-sex households, but unfavorable reach equity to women, youth, Hispanic, AIAN, and African American populations. U.S. flavor policies have greater reach to many, but not all, subgroups at risk of FTP use. Increased enactment of strong policies to populations not covered by flavor policies is warranted to ensure at-risk subgroups sufficiently benefit. ",
        "Cutting off the fuel supply to calcium pumps in pancreatic cancer cells: role of pyruvate kinase-M2 (PKM2). BACKGROUND: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) has poor survival and treatment options. PDAC cells shift their metabolism towards glycolysis, which fuels the plasma membrane calcium pump (PMCA), thereby preventing Ca2+-dependent cell death. The ATP-generating pyruvate kinase-M2 (PKM2) is oncogenic and overexpressed in PDAC. This study investigated the PKM2-derived ATP supply to the PMCA as a potential therapeutic locus. METHODS: PDAC cell growth, migration and death were assessed by using sulforhodamine-B/tetrazolium-based assays, gap closure assay and poly-ADP ribose polymerase (PARP1) cleavage, respectively. Cellular ATP and metabolism were assessed using luciferase/fluorescent-based assays and the Seahorse XFe96 analyzer, respectively. Cell surface biotinylation identified membrane-associated proteins. Fura-2 imaging was used to assess cytosolic Ca2+ overload and in situ Ca2+ clearance. PKM2 knockdown was achieved using siRNA. RESULTS: The PKM2 inhibitor (shikonin) reduced PDAC cell proliferation, cell migration and induced cell death. This was due to inhibition of glycolysis, ATP depletion, inhibition of PMCA and cytotoxic Ca2+ overload. PKM2 associates with plasma membrane proteins providing a privileged ATP supply to the PMCA. PKM2 knockdown reduced PMCA activity and reduced the sensitivity of shikonin-induced cell death. CONCLUSIONS: Cutting off the PKM2-derived ATP supply to the PMCA represents a novel therapeutic strategy for the treatment of PDAC. ",
        "Maximizing the ovarian reserve in mice by evading LINE-1 genotoxicity. Female reproductive success critically depends on the size and quality of a finite ovarian reserve. Paradoxically, mammals eliminate up to 80% of the initial oocyte pool through the enigmatic process of fetal oocyte attrition (FOA). Here, we interrogate the striking correlation of FOA with retrotransposon LINE-1 (L1) expression in mice to understand how L1 activity influences FOA and its biological relevance. We report that L1 activity triggers FOA through DNA damage-driven apoptosis and the complement system of immunity. We demonstrate this by combined inhibition of L1 reverse transcriptase activity and the Chk2-dependent DNA damage checkpoint to prevent FOA. Remarkably, reverse transcriptase inhibitor AZT-treated Chk2 mutant oocytes that evade FOA initially accumulate, but subsequently resolve, L1-instigated genotoxic threats independent of piRNAs and differentiate, resulting in an increased functional ovarian reserve. We conclude that FOA serves as quality control for oocyte genome integrity, and is not obligatory for oogenesis nor fertility. ",
        "Dopamine-Evoked Synaptic Regulation in the Nucleus Accumbens Requires Astrocyte Activity. Dopamine is involved in physiological processes like learning and memory, motor control and reward, and pathological conditions such as Parkinson's disease and addiction. In contrast to the extensive studies on neurons, astrocyte involvement in dopaminergic signaling remains largely unknown. Using transgenic mice, optogenetics, and pharmacogenetics, we studied the role of astrocytes on the dopaminergic system. We show that in freely behaving mice, astrocytes in the nucleus accumbens (NAc), a key reward center in the brain, respond with Ca2+ elevations to\u00a0synaptically released dopamine, a phenomenon enhanced by amphetamine. In brain slices, synaptically released dopamine increases astrocyte Ca2+, stimulates ATP/adenosine release, and depresses excitatory synaptic transmission through activation of presynaptic A1 receptors. Amphetamine depresses neurotransmission through stimulation of astrocytes and the consequent A1 receptor activation. Furthermore, astrocytes modulate the acute behavioral psychomotor effects of amphetamine. Therefore, astrocytes mediate the dopamine- and amphetamine-induced synaptic regulation, revealing a novel cellular pathway in the brain reward system. ",
        "Age-related alterations in inhibitory control investigated using the minimally delayed oculomotor response task. Healthy, older adults are widely reported to experience cognitive decline, including impairments in inhibitory control. However, this general proposition has recently come under scrutiny because ageing effects are highly variable between individuals, are task dependent, and are sometimes not distinguished from general age-related slowing. We recently developed the minimally delayed oculomotor response (MDOR) task in which participants are presented with a simple visual target step, and instructed to saccade not to the target when it appears (a prosaccade response), but when it disappears (i.e. on target offset). Varying the target display duration (TDD) prevents offset timing being predictable from the time of target onset, and saccades prior to the offset are counted as errors. A comparison of MDOR task performance in a group of 22 older adults (mean age 62 years, range 50-72 years) with that in a group of 39 younger adults (22 years, range 19-27 years) demonstrated that MDOR latency was significantly increased in the older group by 34-68 ms depending on TDD. However, when MDOR latencies were corrected by subtracting the latency observed in a standard prosaccade task, the latency difference between groups was abolished. There was a larger latency modulation with TDD in the older group which was observed even when their generally longer latencies were taken into account. Error rates were significantly increased in the older group. An analysis of the timing distribution of errors demonstrated that most errors were failures to inhibit responses to target onsets. When error distributions were used to isolate clear inhibition failures from other types of error, the older group still exhibited significantly higher error rates as well as a higher residual error rate. Although MDOR latency in older participants may largely reflect a general slowing in the oculomotor system with age, both the latency modulation and error rate results are consistent with an age-related inhibitory control deficit. How this relates to performance on other inhibitory control tasks remains to be investigated. ",
        "Prevalence of steatosis and fibrosis in young adults in the UK: a population-based study. BACKGROUND: The estimated worldwide prevalence of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in adults is 25%; however, prevalence in young adults remains unclear. We aimed to identify the prevalence of steatosis and fibrosis in young adults in a sample of participants recruited through the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC), based on transient elastography and controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) score. METHODS: In this population-based study, we invited active participants of the ALSPAC cohort to our Focus@24+ clinic at the University of Bristol (Bristol, UK) between June 5, 2015, and Oct 31, 2017, for assessment by transient elastography with FibroScan, to determine the prevalence of steatosis and fibrosis. FibroScan data were collected on histologically equivalent fibrosis stage (F0-F4) and steatosis grade (S0-S3); results with an IQR to median ratio of 30% or greater were excluded for median fibrosis results greater than 7\u00b71 kPa, and CAP scores for steatosis were excluded if less than ten valid readings could be obtained. Results were collated with data on serology (including alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and \u03b3-glutamyl transferase) and exposures of interest: alcohol consumption (via the Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test for Consumption [AUDIT-C] and the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-5 criteria for alcohol use disorder), body-mass index (BMI), waist-to-height ratio, socioeconomic status (based on predefined ALSPAC markers), and sex. We used logistic regression models to calculate odds ratios (ORs) for the effect of exposures of interest on risk of steatosis and fibrosis, after dichotomising the prevalences of fibrosis and steatosis and adjusting for covariates (excessive alcohol intake [hazardous drinking, AUDIT-C score \u22655; or harmful drinking, evidence of alcohol use disorder], social class, smoking, and BMI). FINDINGS: 10\u2008018 active ALSPAC participants were invited to our Focus@24+ clinic, and 4021 attended (1507 men and 2514 women), with a mean age of 24\u00b70 years (IQR 23\u00b70-25\u00b70). 3768 CAP scores were eligible for analysis. 780 (20\u00b77% [95% CI 19\u00b74-22\u00b70]) participants had suspected steatosis (S1-S3; \u2265248 dB/m), with 377 (10\u00b70%) presenting with S3 (severe) steatosis (\u2265280 dB/m). A BMI in the overweight or obese range was positively associated with steatosis when adjusted for excessive alcohol consumption, social class, and smoking (overweight BMI: OR 5\u00b717 [95% CI 4\u00b711-6\u00b750], p<0\u00b70001; obese BMI: 27\u00b727 [20\u00b754-36\u00b719], p<0\u00b70001). 3600 participants had valid transient elastography results for fibrosis analysis. 96 participants (2\u00b77% [95% CI 2\u00b72-3\u00b72]) had transient elastography values equivalent to suspected fibrosis (F2-F4; \u22657\u00b79 kPa), nine of whom had values equivalent to F4 fibrosis (\u226511\u00b77 kPa). Individuals with alcohol use disorder and steatosis had an increased risk of fibrosis when adjusted for smoking and social class (4\u00b702 [1\u00b724-13\u00b702]; p=0\u00b702). INTERPRETATION: One in five young people had steatosis and one in 40 had fibrosis around the age of 24 years. The risk of fibrosis appears to be greatest in young adults who have harmful drinking patterns and steatosis. A holistic approach to the UK obesity epidemic and excessive drinking patterns is required to prevent an increasing health-care burden of adults with advanced liver disease in later life.

        "When is My Baby Going Home? Moderate to Late Preterm Infants are Discharged at 36 Weeks Based on Admission Data. OBJECTIVE: \u2003This study evaluates the effect of admission characteristics of uncomplicated moderate to late preterm infants on timing of discharge. One of the first questions that families of infants admitted to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) ask is, \"When is my baby going home?\" Moderate to late preterm infants are the largest cohort of NICU patients but little data exist about their length of stay (LOS). STUDY DESIGN: \u2003A retrospective electronic chart review was completed on 12,498 infants admitted to our NICU between January 1, 2009 and December 31, 2015. All inborn infants with a gestational age between 320/7 and 366/7 weeks were studied. RESULTS: \u2003A total of 3,240 infants met our inclusion criteria. The mean postmenstrual age at discharge was 363/7 weeks. Infants who were small for gestational age were significantly more likely to have an increased LOS. Infants born between 34 and 366/7 weeks had a significantly increased LOS if they had respiratory distress syndrome. Admission diagnoses of neonatal abstinence syndrome, meconium aspiration syndrome, hydrops, hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy, biliary emesis, ABO incompatibly, and a genetic diagnosis all had increased LOS for all late preterm infants. CONCLUSION: \u2003For uncomplicated moderate to late preterm infants, clinicians can counsel families that their infants will likely be discharged at 36 weeks of postmenstrual age. Small for gestational age infants and those with specific diagnoses may stay longer. ",
        "The Non-amyloidal Component Region of \u03b1-Synuclein Is Important for \u03b1-Synuclein Transport Within Axons. Proper transport of the Parkinson's disease (PD) protein, \u03b1-synuclein (\u03b1-syn), is thought to be crucial for its localization and function at the synapse. Previous work has shown that defects in long distance transport within narrow caliber axons occur early in PD, but how such defects contribute to PD is unknown. Here we test the hypothesis that the NAC region is involved in facilitating proper transport of \u03b1-syn within axons via its association with membranes. Excess \u03b1-syn or fPD mutant \u03b1-synA53T accumulates within larval axons perturbing the transport of synaptic proteins. These \u03b1-syn expressing larvae also show synaptic morphological and larval locomotion defects, which correlate with the extent of \u03b1-syn-mediated axonal accumulations. Strikingly, deletion of the NAC region (\u03b1-syn\u039471-82) prevented \u03b1-syn accumulations and axonal blockages, and reduced its synaptic localization due to decreased axonal entry and axonal transport of \u03b1-syn, due to less \u03b1-syn bound to membranes. Intriguingly, co-expression \u03b1-syn\u039471-82 with full-length \u03b1-syn rescued \u03b1-syn accumulations and synaptic morphological defects, and decreased the ratio of the insoluble higher molecular weight (HMW)/soluble low molecular weight (LMW) \u03b1-syn, indicating that this region is perhaps important for the dimerization of \u03b1-syn on membranes. Together, our observations suggest that under physiological conditions, \u03b1-syn associates with membranes via the NAC region, and that too much \u03b1-syn perturbs axonal transport via aggregate formation, instigating synaptic and behavioral defects seen in PD.

        "Sport Specialization and Increased Injury Frequency in Youth Baseball Players: A Prospective Study. CONTEXT: Sport specialization is thought to be a primary contributor to the throwing-related injury risk in youth baseball players. OBJECTIVE: To (1) establish arm-injury incidence in a cohort of male youth (9-12 years old) baseball players and (2) examine sport specialization and the frequency of arm injuries in the same cohort. DESIGN: Cohort study. SETTING: Greenville, South Carolina, youth baseball programs and tournaments. PATIENTS OR OTHER PARTICIPANTS: A total of 159 asymptomatic youth baseball players (age = 11.1 \u00b1 1.1 years) were physically assessed and then were prospectively followed for 6.7 \u00b1 1.5 months. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Athlete demographics and playing and injury histories were initially recorded. Athlete-exposures and presence of arm injury were prospectively tracked. All injuries were physically confirmed by a licensed physical therapist. RESULTS: Youth players demonstrated an arm-injury incidence rate of 2.22 per 1000 athlete-exposures. Parents and players underestimated sport-specialization status based on the standard research definition (self versus research based: 31% versus 83%, respectively; P = .001). The frequency of arm injuries was higher in specialized players (100%) than in nonspecialized players (80%, P = .03) but did not differ between pitchers and position players (13.2% each, P = 1.00). CONCLUSIONS: Sport specialization was associated with throwing-related arm injuries in a small cohort of youth baseball players. It is concerning that 57.9% of parents and specialized players were unaware of the athletes' status. Larger studies with longer follow-up periods are needed to further evaluate injury-risk profiles in physically developing youth populations. ",
        "Tertiary lymphoid structures improve immunotherapy and survival in melanoma. Checkpoint blockade therapies that reactivate tumour-associated T cells can induce durable tumour control and result in the long-term survival of patients with advanced cancers1. Current predictive biomarkers for therapy response include high levels of intratumour immunological activity, a high tumour mutational burden and specific characteristics of the gut microbiota2,3. Although the role of T cells in antitumour responses has thoroughly been studied, other immune cells remain insufficiently explored. Here we use clinical samples of metastatic melanomas to investigate the role of B\u00a0cells in antitumour responses, and find that the co-occurrence of tumour-associated CD8+ T cells and CD20+ B\u00a0cells is associated with improved survival, independently of other clinical variables. Immunofluorescence staining of CXCR5 and CXCL13 in combination with CD20 reveals the formation of tertiary lymphoid structures in these CD8+CD20+ tumours. We derived a gene signature associated with tertiary lymphoid structures, which predicted clinical outcomes in cohorts of patients treated with immune\u00a0checkpoint blockade. Furthermore, B-cell-rich tumours were accompanied by increased levels of TCF7+ naive and/or memory T cells. This was corroborated by digital spatial-profiling data, in which T cells in tumours without tertiary lymphoid structures had a dysfunctional molecular phenotype. Our results indicate that tertiary lymphoid structures have a key role in the immune microenvironment in melanoma, by conferring distinct T cell phenotypes. Therapeutic strategies to induce the formation of tertiary lymphoid structures should be explored to improve responses to cancer immunotherapy. ",
        "HAS3-induced extracellular vesicles from melanoma cells stimulate IHH mediated c-Myc upregulation via the hedgehog signaling pathway in target cells. Intercellular communication is fundamental to the survival and maintenance of all multicellular systems, whereas dysregulation of communication pathways can drive cancer progression. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are mediators of cell-to-cell communication that regulate a variety of cellular processes involved in tumor progression. Overexpression of a specific plasma membrane enzyme, hyaluronan synthase 3 (HAS3), is one of the factors that can induce EV shedding. HAS3, and particularly its product hyaluronan (HA), are carried by EVs and are known to be associated with the tumorigenic properties of cancer cells. To elucidate the specific effects of cancerous, HAS3-induced EVs on target cells, normal human keratinocytes and melanoma cells were treated with EVs derived from GFP-HAS3 expressing metastatic melanoma cells. We found that the HA receptor CD44 participated in the regulation of EV binding to target cells. Furthermore, GFP-HAS3-positive EVs induced HA secretion, proliferation and invasion of target cells. Our results suggest that HAS3-EVs contains increased quantities of IHH, which activates the target cell hedgehog signaling cascade and leads to the activation of c-Myc and regulation of claspin expression. This signaling of IHH in HAS3-EVs resulted in increased cell proliferation. Claspin immunostaining correlated with HA content in human cutaneous melanocytic lesions, supporting our in vitro findings and suggesting a reciprocal regulation between claspin expression and HA synthesis. This study shows for the first time that EVs originating from HAS3 overexpressing cells carry mitogenic signals that induce proliferation and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in target cells. The study also identifies a novel feedback regulation between the hedgehog signaling pathway and HA metabolism in melanoma, mediated by EVs carrying HA and IHH. ",
        "Effects of Virtual Exercise Rehabilitation In-Home Therapy Compared with Traditional Care After Total Knee Arthroplasty: VERITAS, a Randomized Controlled Trial. BACKGROUND: Financial burden for patients, providers, and payers can reduce access to physical therapy (PT) after total knee arthroplasty (TKA). The purpose of the present study was to examine the effect of a virtual PT program on health-care costs and clinical outcomes as compared with traditional care after TKA. METHODS: At least 10 days before unilateral TKA, patients from 4 clinical sites were enrolled and randomized 1:1 to the virtual PT program (involving an avatar [digitally simulated] coach, in-home 3-dimensional biometrics, and telerehabilitation with remote clinician oversight by a physical therapist) or to traditional PT care in the home or outpatient clinic. The primary outcome was total health-care costs for the 12-week post-hospital period. Secondary (noninferiority) outcomes included 6 and 12-week Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS); 6-week knee extension, knee flexion, and gait speed; and 12-week safety measures (patient-reported falls, pain, and hospital readmissions). All outcomes were analyzed on a modified intent-to-treat basis. RESULTS: Of 306 patients (mean age, 65 years; 62.5% women) who were randomized from November 2016 to November 2017, 290 had TKA and 287 (including 143 in the virtual PT group and 144 in the usual care group) completed the trial. Virtual PT had lower costs at 12 weeks after discharge than usual care (median, $1,050 compared with $2,805; p < 0.001). Mean costs were $2,745 lower for virtual PT patients. Virtual PT patients had fewer rehospitalizations than the usual care group (12 compared with 30; p = 0.007). Virtual PT was noninferior to usual PT in terms of the KOOS at 6 weeks (difference, 0.77; 90% confidence interval [CI], -1.68 to 3.23) and 12 weeks (difference, -2.33; 90% CI, -4.98 to 0.31). Virtual PT was also noninferior to usual care at 6 weeks in terms of knee extension, knee flexion, and gait speed and at 12 weeks in terms of pain and hospital readmissions. Falls were reported by 19.4% of virtual PT patients and 14.6% of usual care patients (difference, 4.83%; 90% CI, -2.60 to 12.25). CONCLUSIONS: Relative to traditional home or clinic PT, virtual PT with telerehabilitation for skilled clinical oversight significantly lowered 3-month health-care costs after TKA while providing similar effectiveness. These findings have important implications for patients, health systems, and payers. Virtual PT with clinical oversight should be considered for patients managed with TKA. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic Level I. See Instructions for Authors for a complete description of levels of evidence. ",
        "Walnuts and Vegetable Oils Containing Oleic Acid Differentially Affect the Gut Microbiota and Associations with Cardiovascular Risk Factors: Follow-up of a Randomized, Controlled, Feeding Trial in Adults at Risk for Cardiovascular Disease. BACKGROUND: It is unclear whether the favorable effects of walnuts on the gut microbiota are attributable to the fatty acids, including \u03b1-linolenic acid (ALA), and/or the bioactive compounds and fiber. OBJECTIVE: This study examined between-diet gut bacterial differences in individuals at increased cardiovascular risk following diets that replace SFAs with walnuts or vegetable oils. METHODS: Forty-two adults at cardiovascular risk were included in a randomized, crossover, controlled-feeding trial that provided a 2-wk standard Western diet (SWD) run-in and three 6-wk isocaloric study diets: a diet containing whole walnuts (WD; 57-99\u00a0g/d walnuts; 2.7% ALA), a fatty acid-matched diet devoid of walnuts (walnut fatty acid-matched diet; WFMD; 2.6% ALA), and a diet replacing ALA with oleic acid without walnuts (oleic acid replaces ALA diet; ORAD; 0.4% ALA). Fecal samples were collected following the run-in and study diets to assess gut microbiota with 16S rRNA sequencing and Qiime2 for amplicon sequence variant picking. RESULTS: Subjects had elevated BMI (30\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01\u00a0kg/m2), blood pressure (121\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02/77\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01\u00a0mmHg), and LDL cholesterol (120\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05\u00a0mg/dL). Following the WD, Roseburia [relative abundance (RA)\u00a0=\u00a04.2%, linear discriminant analysis (LDA)\u00a0=\u00a04], Eubacterium eligensgroup (RA\u00a0=\u00a01.4%, LDA\u00a0=\u00a04), LachnospiraceaeUCG001 (RA\u00a0=\u00a01.2%, LDA\u00a0=\u00a03.2), Lachnospiraceae UCG004 (RA\u00a0=\u00a01.0%, LDA\u00a0=\u00a03), and Leuconostocaceae (RA\u00a0=\u00a00.03%, LDA\u00a0=\u00a02.8) were most abundant relative to taxa in the SWD (P\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.05 for all). The WD was also enriched in Gordonibacter relative to the WFMD. Roseburia (3.6%, LDA\u00a0=\u00a04) and Eubacterium eligensgroup (RA\u00a0=\u00a01.5%, LDA\u00a0=\u00a03.4) were abundant following the WFMD, and Clostridialesvadin BB60group (RA\u00a0=\u00a00.3%, LDA\u00a0=\u00a02) and gutmetagenome (RA\u00a0=\u00a00.2%, LDA\u00a0=\u00a02) were most abundant following the ORAD relative to the SWD (P\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.05 for all). Lachnospiraceae were inversely correlated with blood pressure and lipid/lipoprotein measurements following the WD. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate similar enrichment of Roseburia following the WD and WFMD, which could be explained by the fatty acid composition. Gordonibacter enrichment and the inverse association between Lachnospiraceae and cardiovascular risk factors following the WD suggest that the gut microbiota may contribute to the health benefits of walnut consumption in adults at cardiovascular risk. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT02210767. "
