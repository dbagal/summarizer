        "Racial differences in the relationship between alcohol/pregnancy policies and birth outcomes and prenatal care utilization: A legal epidemiology study. OBJECTIVES: State policies regarding alcohol use during pregnancy (alcohol/pregnancy policies) have been in effect for more than 40 years. Previous research finds some policies increase adverse birth outcomes and decrease prenatal care utilization. This research examines whether effects of alcohol/pregnancy policies vary by race; the general hypothesis is that health benefits of policies are concentrated among White women and health harms of policies are concentrated among Black women. METHODS: This study uses 1972-2015 Vital Statistics data and policy data from NIAAA's Alcohol Policy Information System and original legal research. The dataset includes more than 150 million singleton births. Outcomes are preterm birth (PTB), low birthweight (LBW), and prenatal care utilization. Logistic regression models include raceXpolicy interaction terms as main predictors, adjust for individual- and state-level controls, include fixed effects for state, year and state-specific time trends, and account for clustering by state. RESULTS: The impact of alcohol/pregnancy policies varied by race for preterm birth, varied in a few cases for low birthweight, and generally did not vary for prenatal care utilization. The hypothesis regarding the direction of differential effects was not supported. Six policies had an adverse impact on PTB and/or LBW for White women. Findings differed for Black women; for Black women, four policies had a beneficial impact for PTB and one had an adverse impact for LBW. CONCLUSIONS: The impact of alcohol/pregnancy policies on birth outcomes varies by race. Future research should explore why some policies appear to have opposite effects for White v. Black women. ",
        "Outcomes and change processes of an established family education program for carers of adults diagnosed with a serious mental health condition. BACKGROUND: Family education programs (FEPs) target caregiving-related psychological distress for carers of relatives/friends diagnosed with serious mental health conditions. While FEPs are efficacious in reducing distress, the mechanisms are not fully known. Peer group support and greater mental health knowledge are proposed to reduce carers' psychological distress by reducing stigmatising attitudes and self-blame, and strengthening carers' relationship with their relative. METHODS: Adult carers (n = 1016) who participated in Wellways Australia's FEP from 2009 to 2016 completed self-report questionnaires at the core program's start and end, during the consolidation period, and at a 6-month follow-up. Those who enrolled early completed questionnaires prior to a wait-list period. We used linear mixed-effects modelling to assess the program's effectiveness using a naturalistic wait-list control longitudinal design, and multivariate latent growth modelling to test a theory-based process change model. RESULTS: While there was no significant change over the wait-list period, psychological distress, self-blame and stigmatising attitudes significantly decreased, and communication and relationship quality/feelings increased from the core program's start to its end. Changes were maintained throughout the consolidation period and follow-up. Peer group support significantly predicted the declining trajectory of distress. Peer group support and greater knowledge significantly predicted declining levels of self-blame and stigmatising attitudes, and increasing levels of communication. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to quantitatively validate the mechanisms underlying the effect of FEPs on carers' psychological distress. Peer group support is key in modifying carers' appraisals of their friend/relatives' condition. Continued implementation of FEPs within mental health service systems is warranted. ",
        "The Prevalence and Academic Impact of Dysmenorrhea in 21,573 Young Women: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis. .                         Introduction:.                      Dysmenorrhea (period pain) and associated symptoms are very common in young women <25 years. This time corresponds with a significant stage in adolescents and young women's academic lives at both school and in higher education. Dysmenorrhea may cause absenteeism from class or result in reduced classroom concentration and performance. Owing to cultural and economic differences, any impact may vary by country. This systematic review and meta-analysis examines the prevalence of dysmenorrhea in young women and explores any impact it has on their academic performance and other school-related activities. .                         Materials and Methods:.                      A search in Medline, PsychINFO, EMBASE, and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature was carried out in June 2018. .                         Results:.                      Thirty-eight studies including 21,573 young women were eligible and included in the meta-analysis. Twenty-three studies were from low-, lower middle-, or upper middle-income countries, and 15 studies were from high-income countries. The prevalence of dysmenorrhea was high 71.1% (N\u2009=\u200937, n\u2009=\u200920,813, 95% confidence interval [CI] 66.6-75.2) irrespective of the economic status of the country. Rates of dysmenorrhea were similar between students at school (N\u2009=\u200924, 72.5%, 95% CI 67.5-77.0) and at university (N\u2009=\u20097, 74.9%, 95% CI 62.9-84.0). Academic impact was significant, with 20.1% reporting absence from school or university due to dysmenorrhea (N\u2009=\u200919, n\u2009=\u200911,226, 95% CI 14.9-26.7) and 40.9% reporting classroom performance or concentration being negatively affected (N\u2009=\u200910, n\u2009=\u20095126, 95% CI 28.3-54.9). .                         Conclusions:.                      The prevalence of dysmenorrhea was high, irrespective of country, with dysmenorrhea having a significant negative impact on academic performance both at school and during higher education. ",
        "Dermoscopy: A Review of the Structures That Facilitate Melanoma Detection. Melanoma is currently the fifth most common cancer in the United States, resulting in more than 9000 deaths each year. Despite numerous improvements in the management of advanced melanoma, the cornerstone to ensuring a cure remains early detection. Both patient and physician awareness regarding the signs and symptoms of early melanoma remain paramount. As a result, much effort has been and continues to be expended in developing and refining effective diagnostic algorithms to help identify melanomas and differentiate them from nevi, such as the ABCDE rule (A for asymmetry, B for border irregularity, C for color variegation, D for diameter >6 mm, and E for evolution in lesion size, shape, or color). To assist in the detection of more subtle melanomas requires technology to augment a visual examination. Toward this end, a simple instrument called a dermatoscope has transformed not only the appreciation of the morphology of melanoma but also its growth dynamics. The discipline of dermoscopy has improved the detection of melanoma and other skin cancers, has resulted in the detection of thinner melanomas, and has helped improve the ability to differentiate nevi (benign lesions) from melanomas, which, in turn, has resulted in fewer biopsies of benign lesions. Since patients often first present to their primary care physicians for their health-related concerns, it is imperative that primary care physicians be able to recognize the lesions that are suspicious for melanoma. This review is intended to introduce osteopathic physicians to the dermoscopic features associated primarily with melanomas located on nonglabrous skin. ",
        "Genetic and Environmental Risk Factors Associated With Trajectories of Depression Symptoms From Adolescence to Young Adulthood. Importance: Less favorable trajectories of depressive mood from adolescence to early adulthood are associated with current and later psychopathology, impaired educational attainment, and social dysfunction, yet the genetic and environmental risk factors associated with these trajectories are not fully established. Examining what risk factors are associated with different trajectories of depressive mood could help identify the nature of depression symptoms and improve preventive interventions for those at most risk. Objective: To examine the differential associations of genetic and environmental risk factors with trajectories of depression symptoms among individuals observed from ages 10 to 24 years. Design, Setting, and Participants: In a longitudinal cohort study established in 1990 and currently ongoing (the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children [ALSPAC]), growth mixture modeling was used to identify trajectories of depression symptoms in 9394 individuals in the United Kingdom. Associations of different risk factors with these trajectories were then examined. Analysis was conducted between August 2018 and January 2019. Main Outcomes and Measures: Trajectories were composed from depression symptoms measured using the Short Mood and Feelings Questionnaire at 9 occasions from ages 10 to 24 years. Risk factors included sex, a polygenic risk score taken from a recent genome-wide association study of depression symptoms, maternal postnatal depression, partner cruelty to the offspring's mother when the child was aged 2 to 4 years, childhood anxiety at age 8 years, and being bullied at age 10 years. Results: Data on all risk factors, confounders, and the outcome were available for 3525 individuals, including 1771 (50.2%) who were female. Trajectories were assessed between the mean (SD) age of 10.7 (0.3) years and mean (SD) age of 23.8 (0.5) years. Overall, 5 distinct trajectories of depression symptoms were identified: (1) stable low (2506 individuals [71.1%]), (2) adolescent limited (325 individuals [9.2%]), (3) childhood limited (203 individuals [5.8%]), (4) early-adult onset (393 individuals [11.1%]), and (5) childhood persistent (98 individuals [2.8%]). Of all the associations of risk factors with trajectories, sex (odds ratio [OR], 6.45; 95% CI, 2.89-14.38), the polygenic risk score for depression symptoms (OR, 1.47; 95% CI, 1.10-1.96), and childhood anxiety (OR, 1.30; 95% CI, 1.16-1.45) showed the strongest association with the childhood-persistent trajectory of depression symptoms compared with the stable-low trajectory. Maternal postnatal depression (OR, 2.39; 95% CI, 1.41-4.07) had the strongest association with the early-adult-onset trajectory, while partner cruelty to mother (OR, 2.30; 95% CI, 1.36-3.90) had the strongest association with the adolescent-limited trajectory. Bullying (OR, 8.08; 95% CI, 4.92-13.26) showed the strongest association with the childhood-limited trajectory. Conclusions and Relevance: The least favorable trajectories of depression symptoms (childhood persistent and early-adult onset) were associated with both genetic and environmental risk factors, but the 2 trajectories of limited duration that had resolved by early adulthood (childhood limited and adolescent limited) were not associated with the polygenic risk score or maternal postnatal depression. Bullying was strongly associated with both the childhood-persistent and childhood-limited trajectories, suggesting that this risk factor may have a time-specific effect. These findings suggest that examining genetic and multiple time-specific environmental antecedents could help identify trajectories of varying onset and chronicity. ",
        "Repurposed quinacrine synergizes with cisplatin, reducing the effective dose required for treatment of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. Despite highly toxic treatments, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) have poor outcomes. There is an unmet need for more effective, less toxic therapies. Repurposing of clinically-approved drugs, with known safety profiles, may provide a time- and cost-effective approach to address this need. We have developed the AcceleraTED platform to repurpose drugs for HNSCC treatment; using in vitro assays (cell viability, clonogenic survival, apoptosis) and in vivo models (xenograft tumors in NOD/SCID/gamma mice). Screening a library of clinically-approved drugs identified the anti-malarial agent quinacrine as a candidate, which significantly reduced viability in a concentration dependent manner in five HNSCC cell lines (IC50 0.63-1.85 \u03bcM) and in six primary HNSCC samples (IC50 ~2 \u03bcM). Decreased clonogenic survival, increased apoptosis and accumulation of LC3-II (indicating altered autophagy) were also observed. Effects were additional to those resulting from standard treatments (cisplatin +/- irradiation) alone. In vivo, daily treatment with 100 mg/kg oral quinacrine plus cisplatin significantly inhibited tumor outgrowth, extending median time to reach maximum tumor volume from 20 to 32 days (p < 0.0001) versus control, and from 28 to 32 days versus 2 mg/kg cisplatin alone. Importantly, combination therapy enabled the dose of cisplatin to be halved to 1 mg/kg, whilst maintaining the same impairment of tumor growth. Treatment was well tolerated; murine plasma levels reached a steady concentration of 0.5 \u03bcg/mL, comparable to levels achievable and tolerated in humans. Consequently, due to its favorable toxicity profile and proven safety, quinacrine may be particularly useful in reducing cisplatin dose, especially in frail and older patients; warranting a clinical trial.

        "Broadly protective human antibodies that target the active site of influenza virus neuraminidase. Better vaccines against influenza virus are urgently needed to provide broader protection against diverse strains, subtypes, and types. Such efforts are assisted by the identification of novel broadly neutralizing epitopes targeted by protective antibodies. Influenza vaccine development has largely focused on the hemagglutinin, but the other major surface antigen, the neuraminidase, has reemerged as a potential target for universal vaccines. We describe three human monoclonal antibodies isolated from an H3N2-infected donor that bind with exceptional breadth to multiple different influenza A and B virus neuraminidases. These antibodies neutralize the virus, mediate effector functions, are broadly protective in vivo, and inhibit neuraminidase activity by directly binding to the active site. Structural and functional characterization of these antibodies will inform the development of neuraminidase-based universal vaccines against influenza virus. ",
        "Vitamin D Trajectories From Birth to Early Childhood and Elevated Systolic Blood Pressure During Childhood and Adolescence. Vitamin D deficiency is associated with hypertension in adults. It is unknown to what degree vitamin D status in early life can affect blood pressure (BP) a decade later. This study investigated the effect of vitamin D trajectory through early life on systolic BP (SBP) in childhood. This is a prospective birth cohort study of 775 children enrolled from 2005 to 2012 and followed prospectively up to age 18 years at the Boston Medical Center, Boston, MA. Persistent low vitamin D status is defined as plasma 25(OH)D <11 ng/mL at birth and <25 ng/mL in early childhood. Elevated SBP is defined as SBP \u226575th percentile. Low vitamin D status at birth was associated with higher risk of elevated SBP at ages 3 to 18 years: odds ratio, 1.38; (95% CI, 1.01-1.87) compared to those with sufficient vitamin D. Low vitamin D status in early childhood was associated with a 1.59-fold (95% CI, 1.02-2.46) higher risk of elevated SBP at age 6 to 18 years. Persistent low vitamin D status from birth to early childhood was associated with higher risk of elevated SBP (odds ratio, 2.04; [95% CI, 1.13-3.67]) at ages 3 to 18 years. These results suggest that low vitamin D status and trajectory in early life were associated with increased risk of elevated SBP during childhood and adolescence. Our findings will help inform future clinical and public health strategies for vitamin D screening and supplementation in pregnancy and childhood to prevent or reduce risk of elevated BP across the lifespan and generations.

        "Discovery of O-glycans on atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) that affect both its proteolytic degradation and potency at its cognate receptor. Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) is a peptide hormone that in response to atrial stretch is secreted from atrial myocytes into the circulation, where it stimulates vasodilatation and natriuresis. ANP is an important biomarker of heart failure where low plasma concentrations exclude cardiac dysfunction. ANP is a member of the natriuretic peptide (NP) family, which also includes the B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) and the C-type natriuretic peptide. The proforms of these hormones undergo processing to mature peptides, and for proBNP, this process has previously been demonstrated to be regulated by O-glycosylation. It has been suggested that proANP also may undergo post-translational modifications. Here, we conducted a targeted O-glycoproteomics approach to characterize O-glycans on NPs and demonstrate that all NP members can carry O-glycans. We identified four O-glycosites in proANP in the porcine heart, and surprisingly, two of these were located on the mature bioactive ANP itself. We found that one of these glycans is located within a conserved sequence motif of the receptor-binding region, suggesting that O-glycans may serve a function beyond intracellular processing and maturation. We also identified an O-glycoform of proANP naturally occurring in human circulation. We demonstrated that site-specific O-glycosylation shields bioactive ANP from proteolytic degradation and modifies potency at its cognate receptor in vitro Furthermore, we showed that ANP O-glycosylation attenuates acute renal and cardiovascular ANP actions in vivo The discovery of novel glycosylated ANP proteoforms reported here significantly improves our understanding of cardiac endocrinology and provides important insight into the etiology of heart failure.

        "Neuroprotective effect of CuATSM on neurotoxin-induced motor neuron loss in an ALS mouse model. CuATSM is a PET-imaging agent that has recently received attention for its success in extending the lifespan in animals in several neurodegenerative disease models. In the SOD1G93A model of ALS, CuATSM prolonged mouse longevity far longer than any previously tested therapeutic agents. The mechanism underlying this outcome has not been fully understood, but studies suggest that this copper complex contributes to maintaining copper homeostasis in mitochondria. More specifically for the SOD1 model, the molecule supplies copper back to the SOD1 protein. Additionally, CuATSM demonstrated similar protective effects in various in vivo Parkinson's disease mouse models. In the current pilot study, we utilized a neurodegenerative mouse model of motor neuron degeneration induced by the neurotoxin \u03b2-sitosterol \u03b2-D-glucoside. In this model, slow but distinct and progressive features of sporadic ALS occur. Treatment with CuATSM kept animal behavioural performance on par with the controls and prevented the extensive motor neuron degeneration and microglia activation seen in the untreated animals. These outcomes support a broader neuroprotective role for CuATSM beyond mutant SOD models of ALS. ",
        "Enhancer signatures stratify and predict outcomes of non-functional pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors. Most pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PNETs) do not produce excess hormones and are therefore considered 'non-functional'1-3. As clinical behaviors vary widely and distant metastases are eventually lethal2,4, biological classifications might guide treatment. Using enhancer maps to infer gene regulatory programs, we find that non-functional PNETs fall into two major subtypes, with epigenomes and transcriptomes that partially resemble islet \u03b1- and \u03b2-cells. Transcription factors ARX and PDX1 specify these normal cells, respectively5,6, and 84% of 142 non-functional PNETs expressed one or the other factor, occasionally both. Among 103 cases, distant relapses occurred almost exclusively in patients with ARX+PDX1- tumors and, within this subtype, in cases with alternative lengthening of telomeres. These markedly different outcomes belied similar clinical presentations and histology and, in one cohort, occurred irrespective of MEN1 mutation. This robust molecular stratification provides insight into cell lineage correlates of non-functional PNETs, accurately predicts disease course and can inform postoperative clinical decisions. ",
        "Predicting development of adolescent drinking behaviour from whole brain structure at 14 years of age. Adolescence is a common time for initiation of alcohol use and development of alcohol use disorders. The present study investigates neuroanatomical predictors for trajectories of future alcohol use based on a novel voxel-wise whole-brain structural equation modeling framework. In 1814 healthy adolescents of the IMAGEN sample, the Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test (AUDIT) was acquired at three measurement occasions across five years. Based on a two-part latent growth curve model, we conducted whole-brain analyses on structural MRI data at age 14, predicting change in alcohol use score over time. Higher grey-matter volumes in the caudate nucleus and the left cerebellum at age 14 years were predictive of stronger increase in alcohol use score over 5 years. The study is the first to demonstrate the feasibility of running separate voxel-wise structural equation models thereby opening new avenues for data analysis in brain imaging. ",
        "Association of Revised WIC Food Package With Perinatal and Birth Outcomes: A Quasi-Experimental Study. Importance: The Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) serves more than one-quarter of pregnant and postpartum women. In October 2009, the WIC food package underwent revisions to improve nutritional content. No studies have investigated the downstream effects of this revision on maternal and infant health. Objective: To investigate whether the revised WIC food package improved perinatal and birth outcomes among recipients. Design, Setting, and Participants: We conducted a quasi-experimental difference-in-differences analysis, comparing WIC recipients (the treatment group) before and after the package revisions while accounting for temporal trends among nonrecipients (the control group). Multivariable linear regressions were adjusted for sociodemographic covariates. This study was conducted using linked birth certificate and hospital discharge data from California from January 2007 to December 2012. Analysis began July 2018. Exposures: Whether pregnant women received the revised WIC package, which included more whole grains, fruit, vegetables, and low-fat milk. Main Outcomes and Measures: Measures of maternal and infant health, including maternal preeclampsia, gestational diabetes, and gestational weight gain as well as infant gestational age, birth weight, and hospitalizations. Results: The sample included 2\u202f897\u202f537 infants born to 2\u202f441\u202f658 mothers. WIC recipients were more likely to be Hispanic, less educated, of greater parity, and younger than nonrecipients. The revised WIC food package was associated with reductions in maternal preeclampsia (-0.6% points; 95% CI, -0.8 to -0.4) and more than recommended gestational weight gain (-3.2% points; 95% CI, -3.6 to -2.7), increased likelihood of as recommended (2.3% points; 95% CI, 1.8 to 2.8) and less than recommended (0.9% points; 95% CI, 0.5 to 1.2) gestational weight gain, and longer gestational age (0.2 weeks; 95% CI, 0.001 to 0.034). Among infants, an increased likelihood of birth weight that was appropriate for gestational age was observed (0.9% points; 95% CI, 0.5 to 1.3). Although birth weight itself was reduced (-0.009 SDs; 95% CI, -0.016 to -0.001), this was accompanied by reductions in small for gestational age (-0.4% points; 95% CI, -0.7 to -0.1), large for gestational age (-0.5% points; 95% CI, -0.8 to -0.2), and low-birth-weight infants (-0.2% points; 95% CI, -0.4 to -0.004), suggesting that the revised food package improved distributions of birth weight. Conclusions and Relevance: The revised WIC food package, intended to improve women's nutrition during pregnancy, was associated with beneficial impacts on maternal and child health. This suggests that WIC policy may be an important lever to reduce health disparities among high-risk women and children at a critical juncture in the life course. ",
        "ARAF recurrent mutation causes central conducting lymphatic anomaly treatable with a MEK inhibitor. The treatment of lymphatic anomaly, a rare devastating disease spectrum of mostly unknown etiologies, depends on the patient manifestations1. Identifying the causal genes will allow for developing affordable therapies in keeping with precision medicine implementation2. Here we identified a recurrent gain-of-function ARAF mutation (c.640T>C:p.S214P) in a 12-year-old boy with advanced anomalous lymphatic disease unresponsive to conventional sirolimus therapy and in another, unrelated, adult patient. The mutation led to loss of a conserved phosphorylation site. Cells transduced with ARAF-S214P showed elevated ERK1/2 activity, enhanced lymphangiogenic capacity, and disassembly of actin skeleton and VE-cadherin junctions, which were rescued using the MEK inhibitor trametinib. The functional relevance of the mutation was also validated by recreating a lymphatic phenotype in a zebrafish model, with rescue of the anomalous phenotype using a MEK inhibitor. Subsequent therapy of the lead proband with a MEK inhibitor led to dramatic clinical improvement, with remodeling of the patient's lymphatic system with resolution of the lymphatic edema, marked improvement in his pulmonary function tests, cessation of supplemental oxygen requirements and near normalization of daily activities. Our results provide a representative demonstration of how knowledge of genetic classification and mechanistic understanding guides biologically based medical treatments, which in our instance was life-saving.

        "Four-Year Outcomes From a Prospective Phase II Clinical Trial of Moderately Hypofractionated Proton Therapy for Localized Prostate Cancer. PURPOSE: Moderately hypofractionated radiation therapy represents an effective treatment\u00a0for localized prostate cancer (PC). Although large randomized trials have reported the efficacy of photon-based hypofractionated therapy, hypofractionated proton therapy (HFPT) has not been extensively studied. This study was performed to determine the clinical and patient-reported outcomes for patients with PC treated with HFPT. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between 2010 and 2017, 184 men were enrolled on a trial of 70 Gy in 28 fractions of HFPT for low- to intermediate-risk PC. Acute and late toxicity was evaluated using National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0. Patient-reported outcomes were measured by International Prostate Symptom Score, International Index of Erectile Function Questionnaire, and Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite scores. RESULTS: Median follow-up was 49.2 months. Enrolled patients had low-risk (n = 18), favorable intermediate-risk (n = 78), and unfavorable intermediate-risk (n = 88) PC. Four-year rates of biochemical-clinical failure-free survival were 93.5% (95% confidence interval, 89%-98%), 94.4% (89%-100%), 92.5% (86%-100%), and 93.8% (88%-100%) in the overall group and the low-risk, favorable intermediate-risk, and unfavorable intermediate-risk cohorts, respectively (log-rank P > .4). The incidence of acute grade 2 or higher gastrointestinal (GI) and urologic toxicities were 3.8% and 12.5%, respectively. The 4-year incidence of late grade 2 or higher urologic and GI toxicity was 7.6% (4%-13%) and 13.6% (9%-20%), respectively. One late grade 3 GI toxicity was reported. All late toxicities were transient. Patient-reported International Prostate Symptom, International Index of Erectile Function, and Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite scores had no significant long-term changes after completion of HFPT (Supplementary Table 1, available at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijrobp.2019.05.069). CONCLUSIONS: HFPT is associated with low rates of toxicity and does not appear to negatively affect 4-year patient reported urinary and bowel health. Further comparative analyses are warranted to better understand differences between proton and photon HFRT. ",
        "Pancreatic adipocytes mediate hypersecretion of insulin in diabetes-susceptible mice. OBJECTIVE: Ectopic fat accumulation in the pancreas in response to obesity and its implication on the onset of type 2 diabetes remain poorly understood. Intermittent fasting (IF) is known to improve glucose homeostasis and insulinresistance. However, the effects of IF on fat in the pancreas and \u03b2-cell function remain largely unknown. Our aim was to evaluate the impact of IF on pancreatic fat accumulation and its effects on islet function. METHODS: New Zealand Obese (NZO) mice were fed a high-fat diet ad libitum (NZO-AL) or fasted every other day (intermittent fasting, NZO-IF) and pancreatic fat accumulation, glucose homoeostasis, insulin sensitivity, and islet function were determined and compared to ad libitum-fed B6.V-Lepob/ob (ob/ob) mice. To investigate the crosstalk of pancreatic adipocytes and islets, co-culture experiments were performed. RESULTS: NZO-IF mice displayed better glucose homeostasis and lower fat accumulation in both the pancreas (-32%) and the liver (-35%) than NZO-AL mice. Ob/ob animals were insulin-resistant and had low fat in the pancreas but high fat in the liver. NZO-AL mice showed increased fat accumulation in both organs and exhibited an impaired islet function. Co-culture experiments demonstrated that pancreatic adipocytes induced a hypersecretion of insulin and released higher levels of free fatty acids than adipocytes of inguinal white adipose tissue. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that pancreatic fat participates in diabetes development, but can be prevented byIF. ",
        "Maternal high-fat diet alters lung development and function in the offspring. The effects of maternal obesity on lung development have been recognized, and speculation is that these diseases are not simply because of accelerated pulmonary decline with aging but with a failure to achieve optimal lung development during early life. These studies tested the hypothesis that maternal obesity alters signaling pathways during the course of lung development that may affect life-long pulmonary health. Adult female mice were fed 60% fat [high-fat diet (HFD)] or 10% fat [control diet (CD)] for 8 wk before mating and through weaning. Pup lung tissues were collected at postnatal days (PN) 7, 21, and 90 (after receiving HFD or CD as adults). At PN7, body weights from HFD were greater than CD but lung weight-to-body weight ratios were lower. In lung tissues, NF\u03baB-mediated inflammation was greater in HFD pups at PN21 and phospho-/total STAT3, phospho-/total VEGF receptor 2, and total AKT protein levels were lower with maternal HFD and protein tyrosine phosphatase B1 levels were increased. Decreased platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule levels were observed at PN21 and at PN90 in the pups exposed to maternal HFD. Morphometry indicated that the pups exposed to maternal or adult HFD had fewer alveoli, and the effect was additive. Decreases in pulmonary resistance, elastance, and compliance were observed because of adult HFD diet and decreases in airway resistance and increases in inspiratory capacity because of maternal HFD. In conclusion, maternal HFD disrupts signaling pathways in the early developing lung and may contribute to deficiencies in lung function and increased susceptibility in adults. ",
        "Recapitulation and Reversal of Schizophrenia-Related Phenotypes in Setd1a-Deficient Mice. SETD1A, a lysine-methyltransferase, is a key schizophrenia susceptibility gene. Mice carrying a heterozygous loss-of-function mutation of the orthologous gene exhibit alterations in axonal branching and cortical synaptic dynamics accompanied by working memory deficits. We show that Setd1a binds both promoters and enhancers with a striking overlap between Setd1a and Mef2 on enhancers. Setd1a targets\u00a0are highly expressed in pyramidal neurons and display a complex pattern of transcriptional up- and downregulations shaped by presumed opposing functions of Setd1a on promoters and Mef2-bound enhancers. Notably, evolutionarily conserved Setd1a targets are associated with neuropsychiatric genetic risk burden. Reinstating Setd1a expression in adulthood rescues cognitive deficits. Finally, we identify LSD1 as a major counteracting demethylase for Setd1a and show that its pharmacological antagonism results in a full rescue of the behavioral and morphological deficits in Setd1a-deficient mice. Our findings advance understanding of how SETD1A mutations predispose to schizophrenia (SCZ) and point to novel therapeutic interventions. ",
        "Gray matter microglial activation in relapsing vs progressive MS: A [F-18]PBR06-PET study. Objective: To determine the value of [F-18]PBR06-PET for assessment of microglial activation in the cerebral gray matter in patients with MS. Methods: Twelve patients with MS (7 relapsing-remitting and 5 secondary progressive [SP]) and 5 healthy controls (HCs) had standardized uptake value (SUV) PET maps coregistered to 3T MRI and segmented into cortical and subcortical gray matter regions. SUV ratios (SUVRs) were global brain normalized. Voxel-by-voxel analysis was performed using statistical parametric mapping (SPM). Normalized brain parenchymal volumes (BPVs) were determined from MRI using SIENAX. Results: Cortical SUVRs were higher in the hippocampus, amygdala, midcingulate, posterior cingulate, and rolandic operculum and lower in the medial-superior frontal gyrus and cuneus in the MS vs HC group (all p < 0.05). Subcortical gray matter SUVR was higher in SPMS vs RRMS (+10.8%, p = 0.002) and HC (+11.3%, p = 0.055) groups. In the MS group, subcortical gray matter SUVR correlated with the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score (r = 0.75, p = 0.005) and timed 25-foot walk (T25FW) (r = 0.70, p = 0.01). Thalamic SUVRs increased with increasing EDSS scores (r = 0.83, p = 0.0008) and T25FW (r = 0.65, p = 0.02) and with decreasing BPV (r = -0.63, p = 0.03). Putaminal SUVRs increased with increasing EDSS scores (0.71, p = 0.009) and with decreasing BPV (r = -0.67, p = 0.01). On SPM analysis, peak correlations of thalamic voxels with BPV were seen in the pulvinar and with the EDSS score and T25FW in the dorsomedial thalamic nuclei. Conclusions: This study suggests that [F-18]PBR06-PET detects widespread abnormal microglial activation in the cerebral gray matter in MS. Increased translocator protein binding in subcortical gray matter regions is associated with brain atrophy and may link to progressive MS. ",
        "Associations of acetylcholinesterase activity with depression and anxiety symptoms among adolescents growing up near pesticide spray sites. BACKGROUND: The cholinergic system has an important role in mood regulation. Cholinesterase inhibitor pesticides (e.g. organophosphates) appear to increase depression and anxiety symptoms in the few existing animal and human studies. Human studies have not described such associations using biomarkers of exposure and studies among children are needed. METHODS: We studied 529 adolescents (ages 11-17y) in agricultural communities in the Ecuadorian Andes (ESPINA study). Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity was measured in a finger-stick sample. Anxiety and depression symptoms were assessed using the CDI-2 and MASC-2 (greater scores reflect greater internalizing symptoms). Models adjusted for age, gender, hemoglobin, income among others. RESULTS: The median age was 14.38y and 51% were female. The mean (SD) of the following parameters were: AChE 3.7 U/mL (0.55), depression T-score 53.0 (9.4) and anxiety T-score: 57.6 (9.8). Lower AChE activity (reflecting greater cholinesterase inhibitor exposure) was associated with higher depression symptoms (difference per SD decrease of AChE [\u03b2 [95% CI:]]: 1.09 [0.02, 2.16]), was stronger among girls (\u03b2\u202f=\u202f1.61) than boys (\u03b2\u202f=\u202f0.69), and among younger (<14.38y, \u03b2\u202f=\u202f1.61) vs. older children (\u03b2\u202f=\u202f0.57). The associations were strongest among girls <14.38y (\u03b2\u202f=\u202f3.30 [0.54, 6.05], OR for elevated symptoms per SD decrease in AChE\u202f=\u202f2.58 [1.26, 5.27]). No associations were observed with anxiety scores. Analyses of AChE change between 2008 and 2016 concurred with these findings. DISCUSSION: We observed associations between a biomarker of pesticide exposure and children's depression symptoms. Lower AChE activity may create risk for depression in teenagers, particularly among girls during early adolescence. ",
        "Molecular interactions underlying liquid-liquid phase separation of the FUS low-complexity domain. The low-complexity domain of the RNA-binding protein FUS (FUS LC) mediates liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS), but the interactions between the repetitive SYGQ-rich sequence of FUS LC that stabilize the liquid phase are not known in detail. By combining NMR and Raman spectroscopy, mutagenesis, and molecular simulation, we demonstrate that heterogeneous interactions involving all residue types underlie LLPS of human FUS LC. We find no evidence that FUS LC adopts conformations with traditional secondary structure elements in the condensed phase; rather, it maintains conformational heterogeneity. We show that hydrogen bonding, \u03c0/sp2, and hydrophobic interactions all contribute to stabilizing LLPS of FUS LC. In addition to contributions from tyrosine residues, we find that glutamine residues also participate in contacts leading to LLPS of FUS LC. These results support a model in which FUS LC forms dynamic, multivalent interactions via multiple residue types and remains disordered in the densely packed liquid phase. ",
        "Anatomical basis and physiological role of cerebrospinal fluid transport through the murine cribriform plate. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flows through the brain, transporting chemical signals and removing waste. CSF production in the brain is balanced by a constant outflow of CSF, the anatomical basis of which is poorly understood. Here, we characterized the anatomy and physiological function of the CSF outflow pathway along the olfactory sensory nerves through the cribriform plate, and into the nasal epithelia. Chemical ablation of olfactory sensory nerves greatly reduced outflow of CSF through the cribriform plate. The reduction in CSF outflow did not cause an increase in intracranial pressure (ICP), consistent with an alteration in the pattern of CSF drainage or production. Our results suggest that damage to olfactory sensory neurons (such as from air pollution) could contribute to altered CSF turnover and flow, providing a potential mechanism for neurological diseases.

        "De novo design of symmetric ferredoxins that shuttle electrons in vivo. A symmetric origin for bacterial ferredoxins was first proposed over 50 y ago, yet, to date, no functional symmetric molecule has been constructed. It is hypothesized that extant proteins have drifted from their symmetric roots via gene duplication followed by mutations. Phylogenetic analyses of extant ferredoxins support the independent evolution of N- and C-terminal sequences, thereby allowing consensus-based design of symmetric 4Fe-4S molecules. All designs bind two [4Fe-4S] clusters and exhibit strongly reducing midpoint potentials ranging from -405 to -515 mV. One of these constructs efficiently shuttles electrons through a designed metabolic pathway in Escherichia coli These finding establish that ferredoxins consisting of a symmetric core can be used as a platform to design novel electron transfer carriers for in vivo applications. Outer-shell asymmetry increases sequence space without compromising electron transfer functionality. ",
        "Rhodoquinone biosynthesis in C. elegans requires precursors generated by the kynurenine pathway. Parasitic helminths infect over a billion humans. To survive in the low oxygen environment of their hosts, these parasites use unusual anaerobic metabolism - this requires rhodoquinone (RQ), an electron carrier that is made by very few animal species. Crucially RQ is not made or used by any parasitic hosts and RQ synthesis is thus an ideal target for anthelmintics. However, little is known about how RQ is made and no drugs are known to block RQ synthesis. C. elegans makes RQ and can use RQ-dependent metabolic pathways - here, we use C. elegans genetics to show that tryptophan degradation via the kynurenine pathway is required to generate the key amine-containing precursors for RQ synthesis. We show that C. elegans requires RQ for survival in hypoxic conditions and, finally, we establish a high throughput assay for drugs that block RQ-dependent metabolism. This may drive the development of a new class of anthelmintic drugs. This study is a key first step in understanding how RQ is made in parasitic helminths. ",
        "A de novo substitution in BCL11B leads to loss of interaction with transcriptional complexes and craniosynostosis. Craniosynostosis, the premature ossification of cranial sutures, is a developmental disorder of the skull vault, occurring in approximately 1 in 2250 births. The causes are heterogeneous, with a monogenic basis identified in ~25% of patients. Using whole-genome sequencing, we identified a novel, de novo variant in BCL11B, c.7C>A, encoding an R3S substitution (p.R3S), in a male patient with coronal suture synostosis. BCL11B is a transcription factor that interacts directly with the nucleosome remodelling and deacetylation complex (NuRD) and polycomb-related complex 2 (PRC2) through the invariant proteins RBBP4 and RBBP7. The p.R3S substitution occurs within a conserved amino-terminal motif (RRKQxxP) of BCL11B and reduces interaction with both transcriptional complexes. Equilibrium binding studies and molecular dynamics simulations show that the p.R3S substitution disrupts ionic coordination between BCL11B and the RBBP4-MTA1 complex, a subassembly of the NuRD complex, and increases the conformational flexibility of Arg-4, Lys-5 and Gln-6 of BCL11B. These alterations collectively reduce the affinity of BCL11B p.R3S for the RBBP4-MTA1 complex by nearly an order of magnitude. We generated a mouse model of the BCL11B p.R3S substitution using a CRISPR-Cas9-based approach, and we report herein that these mice exhibit craniosynostosis of the coronal suture, as well as other cranial sutures. This finding provides strong evidence that the BCL11B p.R3S substitution is causally associated with craniosynostosis and confirms an important role for BCL11B in the maintenance of cranial suture patency.

        "Antidepressants Reduced Risk of Mortality in Patients With Diabetes Mellitus: A Population-Based Cohort Study in Taiwan. CONTEXT: The effect of antidepressant (ATD) use on mortality in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) has not yet been sufficiently studied, although comorbid depression is common in this population. OBJECTIVE: To explore the impact of ATDs on mortality among DM patients. DESIGN: A retrospective cohort study in a national database. SETTING: This population-based study used the National Health Insurance Research Database in Taiwan. Since 2000, we identified 53,412 cases of newly diagnosed patients with DM and depression. Patient cases were followed for assessing mortality until 2013. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The association between mortality and ATD use was explored adjusting for cumulative dosing. RESULTS: Using the time-dependent Cox regression model, ATD use was associated with significantly reduced mortality among patients with DM [in the highest dose group: hazard ratio (HR), 0.65; 95% CI, 0.59 to 0.71]. Further analysis showed that differences in mortality existed across ATD categories: selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (HR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.56 to 0.71), serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (HR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.44 to 0.78), norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitors (HR, 0.20; 95% CI, 0.07 to 0.63), mirtazapine (HR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.45 to 0.82), tricyclic/tetracyclic antidepressants (HR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.54 to 0.97), and trazodone (HR, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.29 to 0.91). However, reversible inhibitor of monoamine oxidase A (RIMA) was found to be associated with an increase, rather than a decrease, in total mortality (HR, 1.48; 95% CI, 1.09 to 1.99). CONCLUSION: Most ATDs, but not RIMA, were associated with significantly reduced mortality among a population with comorbid DM and depression. ",
        "Association of Radioactive Iodine Treatment With Cancer Mortality in Patients With Hyperthyroidism. Importance: Radioactive iodine (RAI) has been used extensively to treat hyperthyroidism since the 1940s. Although widely considered a safe and effective therapy, RAI has been associated with elevated risks of total and site-specific cancer death among patients with hypothyroidism. Objective: To determine whether greater organ- or tissue-absorbed doses from RAI treatment are associated with overall and site-specific cancer mortality in patients with hyperthyroidism. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study is a 24-year extension of the multicenter Cooperative Thyrotoxicosis Therapy Follow-up Study, which has followed up US and UK patients diagnosed and treated for hyperthyroidism for nearly 7 decades, beginning in 1946. Patients were traced using records from the National Death Index, Social Security Administration, and other resources. After exclusions, 18\u202f805 patients who were treated with RAI and had no history of cancer at the time of the first treatment were eligible for the current analysis. Excess relative risks (ERRs) per 100-mGy dose to the organ or tissue were calculated using multivariable-adjusted linear dose-response models and were converted to relative risks (RR\u2009=\u20091 + ERR). The current analyses were conducted from April 28, 2017, to January 30, 2019. Exposures: Mean total administered activity of sodium iodide I 131 was 375 MBq for patients with Graves disease and 653 MBq for patients with toxic nodular goiter. Mean organ or tissue dose estimates ranged from 20 to 99 mGy (colon or rectum, ovary, uterus, prostate, bladder, and brain/central nervous system), to 100 to 400 mGy (pancreas, kidney, liver, stomach, female breast, lung, oral mucosa, and marrow), to 1.6 Gy (esophagus), and to 130 Gy (thyroid gland). Main Outcomes and Measures: Site-specific and all solid-cancer mortality. Results: A total of 18\u202f805 patients were included in the study cohort, and the mean (SD) entry age was 49 (14) years. Most patients were women (14\u202f671 [78.0%]), and most had a Graves disease diagnosis (17\u202f615 [93.7%]). Statistically significant positive associations were observed for all solid cancer mortality (n\u2009=\u20091984; RR at 100-mGy dose to the stomach\u2009=\u20091.06; 95% CI, 1.02-1.10; P\u2009=\u2009.002), including female breast cancer (n\u2009=\u2009291; RR at 100-mGy dose to the breast\u2009=\u20091.12; 95% CI, 1.003-1.32; P\u2009=\u2009.04) and all other solid cancers combined (n\u2009=\u20091693; RR at 100-mGy dose to the stomach\u2009=\u20091.05; 95% CI, 1.01-1.10; P\u2009=\u2009.01). The 100-mGy dose to the stomach and breast corresponded to a mean (SD) administered activity of 243 (35) MBq and 266 (58) MBq in patients with Graves disease. For every 1000 patients with hyperthyroidism receiving typical doses to the stomach (150 to 250 mGy), an estimated lifetime excess of 19 (95% CI, 3-40) to 32 (95% CI, 5-66) solid cancer deaths could occur. Conclusions and Relevance: In RAI-treated patients with hyperthyroidism, greater organ-absorbed doses appeared to be modestly positively associated with risk of death from solid cancer, including breast cancer. Additional studies are needed of the risks and advantages of all major treatment options available to patients with hyperthyroidism. ",
        "Impact Of Medicare Readmissions Penalties On Targeted Surgical Conditions. The Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program, announced in 2010 to penalize excess readmissions for patients with selected medical diagnoses, was expanded in 2013 to include targeted surgical diagnoses, beginning with hip and knee replacements. Whether these surgical penalties reduced procedure-specific readmissions is not well understood. Using Medicare claims, we evaluated the penalty announcements' effects on risk-adjusted readmission rates, episode payments, lengths-of-stay, and observation status use. Risk-adjusted readmission rates declined for both procedures from 7.6\u00a0percent in 2008 to 5.5\u00a0percent in 2016. These rates were decreasing before the program was announced, but the rate of reductions doubled after the announcement of medical penalties in March\u00a02010 (from -0.05 percentage points to -0.10 percentage points per quarter). After targeted surgical penalties were announced in August\u00a02013, readmission reductions returned to near the baseline trend. During the same time period, mean episode payments and lengths-of-stay decreased substantially, and trends in observation status were unchanged. This suggests that medical readmission penalties led to readmission reductions for surgical patients as well, that targeted surgical penalties did not have an additional effect, and that readmission reductions are approaching a \"floor\" below which further reductions may be unlikely.

        "Sequencing Analysis at 8p23 Identifies Multiple Rare Variants in DLC1 Associated with Sleep-Related Oxyhemoglobin Saturation Level. Average arterial oxyhemoglobin saturation during sleep (AvSpO2S) is a clinically relevant measure of physiological stress associated with sleep-disordered breathing, and this measure predicts incident cardiovascular disease and mortality. Using high-depth whole-genome sequencing data from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine (TOPMed) project and focusing on genes with linkage evidence on chromosome 8p23,1,2 we observed that six coding and 51 noncoding variants in a gene that encodes the GTPase-activating protein (DLC1) are significantly associated with AvSpO2S and replicated in independent subjects. The combined DLC1 association evidence of discovery and replication cohorts reaches genome-wide significance in European Americans (p = 7.9\u00a0\u00d7 10-7). A risk score for these variants, built on an independent dataset, explains 0.97% of the AvSpO2S variation and contributes to the linkage evidence. The 51 noncoding variants are enriched in regulatory features in a human lung fibroblast cell line and contribute to DLC1 expression variation. Mendelian randomization analysis using these variants indicates a significant causal effect of DLC1 expression in fibroblasts on AvSpO2S. Multiple sources of information, including genetic variants, gene expression, and methylation, consistently suggest that DLC1 is a gene associated with AvSpO2S. ",
        "Long-term, genome-wide kinetic analysis of the effect of the circadian clock and transcription on the repair of cisplatin-DNA adducts in the mouse liver. Cisplatin is the most commonly used chemotherapeutic drug for managing solid tumors. However, toxicity and the innate or acquired resistance of cancer cells to the drug limit its usefulness. Cisplatin kills cells by forming cisplatin-DNA adducts, most commonly the Pt-d(GpG) diadduct. We recently showed that, in mice, repair of this adduct 2 h following injection is controlled by two circadian programs. 1) The circadian clock controls transcription of 2000 genes in liver and, via transcription-directed repair, controls repair of the transcribed strand (TS) of these genes in a rhythmic fashion unique to each gene's phase of transcription. 2) The excision repair activity itself is controlled by the circadian clock with a single phase at which the repair of the nontranscribed strand (NTS) and the rest of the genome takes place. Here, we followed the repair kinetic for long periods genome-wide both globally and at single nucleotide resolution by the Excision Repair-sequencing (XR-seq) method to better understand cisplatin DNA damage and repair. We find that transcription-driven repair is nearly complete after 2 days, whereas weeks are required for repair of the NTS and the rest of the genome. TS repair oscillates in rhythmically expressed genes up to 2 days post injection, and in all expressed genes, we see a trend in TS repair with time from the 5' to 3' end. These findings help to understand the circadian- and transcription-dependent and -independent control of repair in response to cisplatin, and should aid in designing cisplatin chemotherapy regimens with improved therapeutic indexes.

        "Use of Cannabis to Relieve Pain and Promote Sleep by Customers at an Adult Use Dispensary. Medical cannabis patients consistently report using cannabis as a substitute for prescription medications; however, little is known about individuals accessing cannabis through adult-use markets. A survey at two retail stores was conducted in Colorado, United States. Between August 2016 and October 2016, store staff asked customers if they wanted to participate and, if so, provided an electronic survey link. All customers reporting medical certification were excluded. Of 1,000 adult-use only customer respondents, 65% reported taking cannabis to relieve pain and 74% reported taking cannabis to promote sleep. Among respondents taking cannabis for pain, 80% reported that it was very or extremely helpful, and most of those taking over-the-counter pain medications (82%) or opioid analgesics (88%) reported reducing or stopping use of those medications. Among respondents taking cannabis for sleep, 84% found it very or extremely helpful, and most of those taking over-the-counter (87%) or prescription sleep aids (83%) reported reducing or stopping use of those medications. De facto medical use of cannabis for symptom relief was common among adult-use dispensary customers and the majority reported that cannabis decreased their medication use. Adult use cannabis laws may broaden access to cannabis for the purpose of symptom relief. ",
        "Exercise effects on quality of life, mood, and self-worth in overweight children: the SMART randomized controlled trial. Overweight children are at risk for poor quality of life (QOL), depression, self-worth, and behavior problems. Exercise trials with children have shown improved mood and self-worth. Few studies utilized an attention control condition, QOL outcomes, or a follow-up evaluation after the intervention ends. The purpose is to test effects of an exercise program versus sedentary program on psychological factors in overweight children. One hundred seventy-five overweight children (87% black, 61% female, age 9.7 \u00b1 0.9 years, 73% obese) were randomized to an 8 month aerobic exercise or sedentary after-school program. Depressive symptoms, anger expression, self-worth, and QOL were measured at baseline and post-test. Depressive symptoms and QOL were also measured at follow-up. Intent-to-treat mixed models evaluated intervention effects, including sex differences. At post-test, QOL, depression, and self-worth improved; no group by time or sex by group by time interaction was detected for QOL or self-worth. Boys' depressive symptoms improved more and anger control decreased in the sedentary intervention relative to the exercise intervention at post-test. At follow-up, depressive symptoms in boys in the sedentary group decreased more than other groups. Exercise provided benefits to QOL, depressive symptoms, and self-worth comparable to a sedentary program. Sedentary programs with games and artistic activities, interaction with adults and peers, and behavioral structure may be more beneficial to boys' mood than exercise. Some benefits of exercise in prior studies are probably attributable to program elements such as attention from adults. Trial Registration: Clinicaltrials.gov, NCT02227095. ",
        "Papaverine identified as an inhibitor of high mobility group box 1/receptor for advanced glycation end-products interaction suppresses high mobility group box 1-mediated inflammatory responses. The interaction of high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), which is secreted from immune and dying cells during cellular infection and injury, and receptor for advanced glycation end-products (RAGE) appears to be critical for acute and chronic inflammatory disorders. Here we designed a unique cyclic \u03b2-hairpin peptide (Pepb2), which mimics the predicted RAGE-binding domain of HMGB1. Pepb2 competitively inhibited HMGB1/RAGE interaction. We then identified papaverine as a Pepb2 mimetic by in silico 3D-structural similarity screening from the DrugBank library. Papaverine was found to directly inhibit HMGB1/RAGE interaction. It also suppressed the HMGB1-mediated production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1, in mouse macrophage-like RAW264.7\u202fcells and bone marrow-derived macrophages. In addition, papaverine attenuated mortality in cecal ligation puncture-induced sepsis model mice. Taken together, these findings indicate that papaverine could become a useful therapeutic against HMGB1/RAGE-mediated sepsis and other inflammatory diseases. ",

Nursing home resident obesity increases the complexity of nursing care, and nursing homes report avoiding residents with obesity when choosing which prospective residents to accept. The objective of this study was to examine the associations between nursing home obesity prevalence rate and nursing home organizational, staffing, resident, and geographic factors within a profit maximization framework. The study cohort included U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services data from U.S. nursing homes in 2013. Study findings supported hypothesized associations between obesity prevalence rate and higher occupancy, higher bed capacity, and multi-facility affiliation, but findings did not support a relationship between obesity prevalence rate and for-profit status.

        "Long noncoding RNA NEAT1 mediates neuronal histone methylation and age-related memory impairment. Histone methylation is critical for the formation and maintenance of long-term memories. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are regulators of histone methyltransferases and other chromatin-modifying enzymes (CMEs), thereby epigenetically modifying gene expression. Here, we investigated how the lncRNA NEAT1 may epigenetically contribute to hippocampus-dependent, long-term memory formation using a combination of transcriptomics, RNA-binding protein immunoprecipitation, CRISPR-mediated gene activation (CRISPRa), and behavioral approaches. Knockdown of the lncRNA Neat1 revealed widespread changes in gene transcription, as well as perturbations of histone 3 lysine 9 dimethylation (H3K9me2), a repressive histone modification mark that was increased in the hippocampus of aging rodents. We identified a NEAT1-dependent mechanism of transcriptional repression by H3K9me2 at the c-Fos promoter, corresponding with observed changes in c-Fos mRNA expression. Overexpression of hippocampal NEAT1 using CRISPRa was sufficient to impair memory formation in young adult mice, recapitulating observed memory deficits in old adult mice, whereas knocking down NEAT1 in both young and old adult mice improved behavior test-associated memory. These results suggest that the lncRNA NEAT1 is an epigenetic suppressor of hippocampus-dependent, long-term memory formation. ",
        "Exercise-induced enhancement of synaptic function triggered by the inverse BAR protein, Mtss1L. Exercise is a potent enhancer of learning and memory, yet we know little of the underlying mechanisms that likely include alterations in synaptic efficacy in the hippocampus. To address this issue, we exposed mice to a single episode of voluntary exercise, and permanently marked activated mature hippocampal dentate granule cells using conditional Fos-TRAP mice. Exercise-activated neurons (Fos-TRAPed) showed an input-selective increase in dendritic spines and excitatory postsynaptic currents at 3 days post-exercise, indicative of exercise-induced structural plasticity. Laser-capture microdissection and RNASeq of activated neurons revealed that the most highly induced transcript was Mtss1L, a little-studied I-BAR domain-containing gene, which we hypothesized could be involved in membrane curvature and dendritic spine formation. shRNA-mediated Mtss1L knockdown in vivo prevented the exercise-induced increases in spines and excitatory postsynaptic currents. Our results link short-term effects of exercise to activity-dependent expression of Mtss1L, which we propose as a novel effector of activity-dependent rearrangement of synapses. ",
        "Introduction and Executive Summary of the Supplement, Role of Milk and Dairy Products in Health and Prevention of Noncommunicable Chronic Diseases: A Series of Systematic Reviews. Milk and dairy products contain multiple nutrients and contribute significantly to meet the nutritional requirements for protein, calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, potassium, zinc, selenium, vitamin A, riboflavin, vitamin B-12, and pantothenic acid. However, consumption of dairy is decreasing and moving away from the advised level in many countries and the potential benefits of milk and dairy products for health have come under question. This, in spite that numerous studies report health benefits associated with dairy consumption. The present supplement aims to assess and summarize scientific evidence regarding the impact of dairy intake on health and all-cause mortality, and on the prevention of diverse chronic diseases, mainly from meta-analyses of observational studies and randomized controlled trials (RCTs). There seem to positive associations between moderate maternal milk intake during pregnancy and infant birth weight, length and bone mineral content during childhood. Moreover, consumption of dairy products in older subjects may reduce the risk of frailty and decrease the risk for sarcopenia. The highest consumption of dairy products did not show a clear association with total osteoporotic fracture and hip fracture risk; however, a diminished risk of vertebral fracture was found. Analysis of the differences between high and low dairy consumption and for dose-response found no association between dairy product consumption and risk of all-cause mortality. Total and low-fat dairy consumption is associated with a reduced risk of developing metabolic syndrome and current evidence supports that consumption of dairy does not adversely affect the risk of cardiovascular outcomes and may even have a subtle protective effect. Moreover, evidence has been provided of an inverse association between the consumption of dairy products and ischemic heart disease and myocardial infarction. Also, the evidence suggests that dairy consumption, particularly low-fat dairy and yogurt is associated with a lower risk of type 2 diabetes. Likewise, moderate compared with medium consumption of dairy is associated lower risk for colorectal and bladder cancer and has no association with prostate cancer. Finally, consumption of milk or dairy products did not show a proinflammatory effect on healthy subjects, overweight/obese individuals, or individuals with other metabolic abnormalities, and fortification of dairy products with phytosterols and \u03c9-3 fatty acids seems to be a good approach to improve cardiometabolic risk biomarkers. In conclusion, the systematic reviews and meta-analyses of the present supplement support adequate milk consumption at various stages of life and in the prevention/control of various noncommunicable chronic diseases.

        "Impact of combat exposure on mental health trajectories in later life: Longitudinal findings from the VA Normative Aging Study. Cross-sectional studies have shown contradictory results concerning the impact of combat exposure on mental health in later life. We examined whether combat exposure influences trajectories of mental health symptoms in older male veterans using longitudinal data collected from 1985 to 1991 in the Veterans Affairs Normative Aging Study (N = 1,105, age range = 40-86 years in 1985). Noncombat veterans showed little systematic change in depressive and anxiety symptoms with age, whereas combat veterans showed U-shaped nonlinear changes, with higher levels in midlife decreasing until the mid-60s and then increasing again in the 70s and 80s. These findings support the notion that military service, and especially combat exposure, is a hidden variable in aging research. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved). ",
        "Effects of a Home-based Exercise Program on Anxiety and Mood Disturbances in Older Adults with Cancer Receiving Chemotherapy. BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE: Exercise interventions improve anxiety and mood disturbances in patients with cancer. However, studies are limited in older adults with cancer. We assessed the effects of exercise on anxiety, mood, and social and emotional well-being in older patients with cancer during their first 6 weeks of chemotherapy. DESIGN: Exploratory secondary analysis of a randomized controlled trial (RCT). SETTING: Community oncology practices. PARTICIPANTS: Older patients (aged 60\u2009years or older) undergoing chemotherapy (N\u2009=\u2009252). INTERVENTION: Patients were randomized to Exercise for Cancer Patients (EXCAP) or usual care (control) for the first 6 weeks of chemotherapy. EXCAP is a home-based, low- to moderate-intensity progressive walking and resistance training program. MEASUREMENTS: Analysis of covariance, with study arm as the factor, baseline value as the covariate, and study arm \u00d7 baseline interaction, was used to evaluate arm effects on postintervention anxiety (State Trait Anxiety Inventory [STAI]), mood (Profile of Mood States [POMS]), and social and emotional well-being (Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General subscales) after 6 weeks. RESULTS: Median age was 67\u2009years; 77% had breast cancer. Statistically significant group differences were observed in the STAI score (P\u2009=\u2009.001), POMS score (P\u2009=\u2009.022), social well-being (P\u2009=\u2009.002), and emotional well-being (P\u2009=\u2009.048). For each outcome, EXCAP patients with worse baseline scores had larger improvements at 6 weeks; these improvements were clinically significant for STAI score and social well-being. CONCLUSIONS: Among older cancer patients receiving chemotherapy, a 6-week structured exercise program improved anxiety and mood, especially among those participants with worse baseline symptoms. Additional RCTs are needed to confirm these findings and evaluate the appropriate exercise prescription for managing anxiety, mood, and well-being in this patient population.

        "A Transcriptionally Definable Subgroup of Triple-Negative Breast and Ovarian Cancer Samples Shows Sensitivity to HSP90 Inhibition. PURPOSE: We hypothesized that integrated analysis of cancer types from different lineages would reveal novel molecularly defined subgroups with unique therapeutic vulnerabilities. On the basis of the molecular similarities between subgroups of breast and ovarian cancers, we analyzed these cancers as a single cohort to test our hypothesis. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Identification of transcriptional subgroups of cancers and drug sensitivity analyses were performed using mined data. Cell line sensitivity to Hsp90 inhibitors (Hsp90i) was tested in vitro. The ability of a transcriptional signature to predict Hsp90i sensitivity was validated using cell lines, and cell line- and patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models. Mechanisms of Hsp90i sensitivity were uncovered using immunoblot and RNAi. RESULTS: Transcriptomic analyses of breast and ovarian cancer cell lines uncovered two mixed subgroups comprised primarily of triple-negative breast and multiple ovarian cancer subtypes. Drug sensitivity analyses revealed that cells of one mixed subgroup are significantly more sensitive to Hsp90i compared with cells from all other cancer lineages evaluated. A gene expression classifier was generated that predicted Hsp90i sensitivity in vitro, and in cell line- and PDXs. Cells from the Hsp90i-sensitive subgroup underwent apoptosis mediated by Hsp90i-induced upregulation of the proapoptotic proteins Bim and PUMA. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings identify Hsp90i as a potential therapeutic strategy for a transcriptionally defined subgroup of ovarian and breast cancers. This study demonstrates that gene expression profiles may be useful to identify therapeutic vulnerabilities in tumor types with limited targetable genetic alterations, and to identify molecularly definable cancer subgroups that transcend lineage.

        "ARMC 5 Variants and Risk of Hypertension in Blacks: MH- GRID Study. Background We recently found that ARMC 5 variants may be associated with primary aldosteronism in blacks. We investigated a cohort from the MH - GRID (Minority Health Genomics and Translational Research Bio-Repository Database) and tested the association between ARMC 5 variants and blood pressure in black s. Methods and Results Whole exome sequencing data of 1377 black s were analyzed. Target single-variant and gene-based association analyses of hypertension were performed for ARMC 5, and replicated in a subset of 3015 individuals of African descent from the UK Biobank cohort. Sixteen rare variants were significantly associated with hypertension ( P=0.0402) in the gene-based (optimized sequenced kernel association test) analysis; the 16 and one other, rs116201073, together, showed a strong association ( P=0.0003) with blood pressure in this data set. The presence of the rs116201073 variant was associated with lower blood pressure. We then used human embryonic kidney 293 and adrenocortical H295R cells transfected with an ARMC 5 construct containing rs116201073 (c.*920T>C). The latter was common in both the discovery ( MH - GRID ) and replication ( UK Biobank) data and reached statistical significance ( P=0.044 [odds ratio, 0.7] and P=0.007 [odds ratio, 0.76], respectively). The allele carrying rs116201073 increased levels of ARMC5 mRNA , consistent with its protective effect in the epidemiological data. Conclusions ARMC 5 shows an association with hypertension in black s when rare variants within the gene are considered. We also identified a protective variant of the ARMC 5 gene with an effect on ARMC 5 expression confirmed in\u00a0vitro. These results extend our previous report of ARMC 5's possible involvement in the determination of blood pressure in blacks. ",
        "Insula serotonin 2A receptor binding and gene expression contribute to serotonin transporter polymorphism anxious phenotype in primates. Genetic variation in the serotonin transporter gene (SLC6A4) is associated with vulnerability to affective disorders and pharmacotherapy efficacy. We recently identified sequence polymorphisms in the common marmoset SLC6A4 repeat region (AC/C/G and CT/T/C) associated with individual differences in anxiety-like trait, gene expression, and response to antidepressants. The mechanisms underlying the effects of these polymorphisms are unknown, but a key mediator of serotonin action is the serotonin 2A receptor (5HT2A). Thus, we correlated 5HT2A binding potential (BP) and RNA gene expression in 16 SLC6A4 genotyped marmosets with responsivity to 5HT2A antagonism during the human intruder test of anxiety. Voxel-based analysis and RNA measurements showed a reduction in 5HT2A BP and gene expression specifically in the right posterior insula of individuals homozygous for the anxiety-related variant AC/C/G. These same marmosets displayed an anxiogenic, dose-dependent response to the human intruder after 5HT2A pharmacological antagonism, while CT/T/C individuals showed no effect. A voxel-based correlation analysis, independent of SLC6A4 genotype, revealed that 5HT2A BP in the adjacent right anterior insula and insula proisocortex was negatively correlated with trait anxiety scores. Moreover, 5HT2A BP in both regions was a good predictor of the size and direction of the acute emotional response to the human intruder threat after 5HT2A antagonism. Our findings suggest that genetic variation in the SLC6A4 repeat region may contribute to the trait anxious phenotype via neurochemical changes in brain areas implicated in interoceptive and emotional processing, with a critical role for the right insula 5HT2A in the regulation of affective responses to threat.

        "Risks of stillbirth and neonatal death with advancing gestation at term: A systematic review and meta-analysis of cohort studies of 15 million pregnancies. BACKGROUND: Despite advances in healthcare, stillbirth rates remain relatively unchanged. We conducted a systematic review to quantify the risks of stillbirth and neonatal death at term (from 37 weeks gestation) according to gestational age. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We searched the major electronic databases Medline, Embase, and Google Scholar (January 1990-October 2018) without language restrictions. We included cohort studies on term pregnancies that provided estimates of stillbirths or neonatal deaths by gestation week. We estimated the additional weekly risk of stillbirth in term pregnancies that continued versus delivered at various gestational ages. We compared week-specific neonatal mortality rates by gestational age at delivery. We used mixed-effects logistic regression models with random intercepts, and computed risk ratios (RRs), odds ratios (ORs), and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Thirteen studies (15 million pregnancies, 17,830 stillbirths) were included. All studies were from high-income countries. Four studies provided the risks of stillbirth in mothers of White and Black race, 2 in mothers of White and Asian race, 5 in mothers of White race only, and 2 in mothers of Black race only. The prospective risk of stillbirth increased with gestational age from 0.11 per 1,000 pregnancies at 37 weeks (95% CI 0.07 to 0.15) to 3.18 per 1,000 at 42 weeks (95% CI 1.84 to 4.35). Neonatal mortality increased when pregnancies continued beyond 41 weeks; the risk increased significantly for deliveries at 42 versus 41 weeks gestation (RR 1.87, 95% CI 1.07 to 2.86, p = 0.012). One additional stillbirth occurred for every 1,449 (95% CI 1,237 to 1,747) pregnancies that advanced from 40 to 41 weeks. Limitations include variations in the definition of low-risk pregnancy, the wide time span of the studies, the use of registry-based data, and potential confounders affecting the outcome. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest there is a significant additional risk of stillbirth, with no corresponding reduction in neonatal mortality, when term pregnancies continue to 41 weeks compared to delivery at 40 weeks.

        "Recognition of early and late stages of bladder cancer using metabolites and machine learning. INTRODUCTION: Bladder cancer (BCa) is one of the most common\u00a0and aggressive cancers. It is the sixth most frequently occurring cancer in men and its rate of occurrence increases with age. The current method of BCa diagnosis includes a cystoscopy and biopsy. This process is expensive, unpleasant, and may have severe side effects. Recent growth in the power and accessibility of machine-learning software has allowed for the development of new, non-invasive diagnostic methods whose accuracy and sensitivity are uncompromising to function. OBJECTIVES: The goal of this research was to elucidate the biomarkers including metabolites and corresponding genes for different stages of BCa, show their distinguishing and common features, and create a machine-learning model for classification of stages of BCa. METHODS: Sets of metabolites for early and late stages, as well as common for both stages were analyzed using MetaboAnalyst and Ingenuity\u00ae Pathway Analysis (IPA\u00ae) software. Machine-learning methods were utilized in the development of a binary classifier for early- and late-stage metabolites of BCa. Metabolites were quantitatively characterized using EDragon 1.0 software. The two modeling methods used are Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) and Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) with a logistic regression loss function. RESULTS: We explored metabolic pathways related to early-stage BCa (Galactose metabolism\u00a0and Starch and sucrose metabolism) and to late-stage BCa (Glycine, serine, and threonine metabolism, Arginine and proline metabolism, Glycerophospholipid metabolism, and Galactose metabolism) as well as those common to both stages pathways. The central metabolite impacting the most cancerogenic genes (AKT, EGFR, MAPK3) in early stage is D-glucose, while late-stage BCa is characterized by significant fold changes in several metabolites: glycerol, choline, 13(S)-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid, 2'-fucosyllactose. Insulin was also seen to play an important role in late stages of BCa. The\u00a0best performing model was able to predict metabolite class with an accuracy of 82.54% and\u00a0the area under\u00a0precision-recall curve (PRC) of 0.84 on the training set. The same model was applied to three separate sets of metabolites obtained from public sources, one set of the late-stage metabolites and two sets of the early-stage metabolites. The model was better at predicting early-stage metabolites with accuracies of 72% (18/25) and 95% (19/20) on the early sets, and an accuracy of 65.45% (36/55) on the late-stage metabolite set. CONCLUSION: By examining the biomarkers present in the urine samples of BCa patients as compared with normal patients, the biomarkers associated with this cancer can be pinpointed and lead to the elucidation of affected metabolic pathways that are specific to different stages of cancer. Development of machine-learning model including metabolites and their chemical descriptors made it possible to achieve considerable accuracy of prediction of stages of BCa. ",
        "T cell-selective deletion of Oct1 protects animals from autoimmune neuroinflammation while maintaining neurotropic pathogen response. BACKGROUND: Treatments for autoimmune diseases aim to dampen autoreactivity while preserving normal immune function. In CD4+ T cells, the transcription factor Oct1/Pou2f1 is a dispensable transcription factor for T cell development and response to primary infection, but promotes expression of target genes, including Il2 and Ifng, under conditions of antigen reencounter. As a result, they are more strongly expressed upon secondary stimulation. Such repeated antigen encounters occur in memory recall responses, in autoimmunity where self-antigen can be recognized multiple times, and in chronic infection where foreign antigen is persistent. Based on these previous findings, we hypothesized that Oct1 loss would protect animals from autoimmunity but maintain normal responses to pathogens in the CNS. OBJECTIVE: We used a conditional mouse Oct1 (Pou2f1) allele and a CD4-Cre driver to determine the effect of T cell-specific Oct1 loss on autoimmune- and viral-induced neuroinflammation using an autoantigen-driven EAE model of autoimmunity and a JHMV model of viral infection. RESULTS: Oct1 conditional deletion mitigated clinical scores and reduced infiltrating T cells and cytokine production in the EAE model. Consistently, Oct1-deficient CD4+ T cells stimulated in vitro showed increased expression of markers associated with T cell anergy, particularly in the absence of co-stimulatory signals. In contrast, anti-viral T cell effector functions are intact in the absence of Oct1, with no changes in neuroinflammation, infiltrating T cells or cytokine production. CONCLUSION: Our findings uncover a significant difference between the effect of Oct1 loss on autoimmune and anti-pathogen responses, which potentially could be exploited for therapeutic benefit. ",
        "Identifying and targeting cancer-specific metabolism with network-based drug target prediction. BACKGROUND: Metabolic rewiring allows cancer cells to sustain high proliferation rates. Thus, targeting only the cancer-specific cellular metabolism will safeguard healthy tissues. METHODS: We developed the very efficient FASTCORMICS RNA-seq workflow (rFASTCORMICS) to build 10,005 high-resolution metabolic models from the TCGA dataset to capture metabolic rewiring strategies in cancer cells. Colorectal cancer (CRC) was used as a test case for a repurposing workflow based on rFASTCORMICS. FINDINGS: Alternative pathways that are not required for proliferation or survival tend to be shut down and, therefore, tumours display cancer-specific essential genes that are significantly enriched for known drug targets. We identified naftifine, ketoconazole, and mimosine as new potential CRC drugs, which were experimentally validated. INTERPRETATION: The here presented rFASTCORMICS workflow successfully reconstructs a metabolic model based on RNA-seq data and successfully predicted drug targets and drugs not yet indicted for colorectal cancer. FUND: This study was supported by the University of Luxembourg (IRP grant scheme; R-AGR-0755-12), the Luxembourg National Research Fund (FNR PRIDE PRIDE15/10675146/CANBIO), the Fondation Cancer (Luxembourg), the European Union's Horizon2020 research and innovation programme under the Marie Sklodowska- Curie grant agreement No 642295 (MEL-PLEX), and the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) within the project MelanomSensitivity (BMBF/BM/7643621).

        "Neural Mechanisms for Accepting and Rejecting Artificial Social Partners in the Uncanny Valley. Artificial agents are becoming prevalent across human life domains. However, the neural mechanisms underlying human responses to these new, artificial social partners remain unclear. The uncanny valley (UV) hypothesis predicts that humans prefer anthropomorphic agents but reject them if they become too humanlike-the so-called UV reaction. Using fMRI, we investigated neural activity when subjects evaluated artificial agents and made decisions about them. Across two experimental tasks, the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC) encoded an explicit representation of subjects' UV reactions. Specifically, VMPFC signaled the subjective likability of artificial agents as a nonlinear function of humanlikeness, with selective low likability for highly humanlike agents. In exploratory across-subject analyses, these effects explained individual differences in psychophysical evaluations and preference choices. Functionally connected areas encoded critical inputs for these signals: the temporoparietal junction encoded a linear humanlikeness continuum, whereas nonlinear representations of humanlikeness in dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (DMPFC) and fusiform gyrus emphasized a human-nonhuman distinction. Following principles of multisensory integration, multiplicative combination of these signals reconstructed VMPFC's valuation function. During decision making, separate signals in VMPFC and DMPFC encoded subjects' decision variable for choices involving humans or artificial agents, respectively. A distinct amygdala signal predicted rejection of artificial agents. Our data suggest that human reactions toward artificial agents are governed by a neural mechanism that generates a selective, nonlinear valuation in response to a specific feature combination (humanlikeness in nonhuman agents). Thus, a basic principle known from sensory coding-neural feature selectivity from linear-nonlinear transformation-may also underlie human responses to artificial social partners.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Would you trust a robot to make decisions for you? Autonomous artificial agents are increasingly entering our lives, but how the human brain responds to these new artificial social partners remains unclear. The uncanny valley (UV) hypothesis-an influential psychological framework-captures the observation that human responses to artificial agents are nonlinear: we like increasingly anthropomorphic artificial agents, but feel uncomfortable if they become too humanlike. Here we investigated neural activity when humans evaluated artificial agents and made personal decisions about them. Our findings suggest a novel neurobiological conceptualization of human responses toward artificial agents: the UV reaction-a selective dislike of highly humanlike agents-is based on nonlinear value-coding in ventromedial prefrontal cortex, a key component of the brain's reward system.

        "Advances in the Understanding of Skin Cancer: Ultraviolet Radiation, Mutations, and Antisense Oligonucleotides as Anticancer Drugs. Skin cancer has always been and remains the leader among all tumors in terms of occurrence. One of the main factors responsible for skin cancer, natural and artificial UV radiation, causes the mutations that transform healthy cells into cancer cells. These mutations inactivate apoptosis, an event required to avoid the malignant transformation of healthy cells. Among these deadliest of cancers, melanoma and its 'younger sister', Merkel cell carcinoma, are the most lethal. The heavy toll of skin cancers stems from their rapid progression and the fact that they metastasize easily. Added to this is the difficulty in determining reliable margins when excising tumors and the lack of effective chemotherapy. Possibly the biggest problem posed by skin cancer is reliably detecting the extent to which cancer cells have spread throughout the body. The initial tumor is visible and can be removed, whereas metastases are invisible to the naked eye and much harder to eliminate. In our opinion, antisense oligonucleotides, which can be used in the form of targeted ointments, provide real hope as a treatment that will eliminate cancer cells near the tumor focus both before and after surgery.

        "Sleep Deprivation by Exposure to Novel Objects Increases Synapse Density and Axon-Spine Interface in the Hippocampal CA1 Region of Adolescent Mice. Sleep has been hypothesized to rebalance overall synaptic strength after ongoing learning during waking leads to net synaptic potentiation. If so, because synaptic strength and size are correlated, synapses on average should be larger after wake and smaller after sleep. This prediction was recently confirmed in mouse cerebral cortex using serial block-face electron microscopy (SBEM). However, whether these findings extend to other brain regions is unknown. Moreover, sleep deprivation by gentle handling was reported to produce hippocampal spine loss, raising the question of whether synapse size and number are differentially affected by sleep and waking. Here we applied SBEM to measure axon-spine interface (ASI), the contact area between pre-synapse and post-synapse, and synapse density in CA1 stratum radiatum. Adolescent YFP-H mice were studied after 6-8 h of sleep (S = 6), spontaneous wake at night (W = 4) or wake enforced during the day by novelty exposure (EW = 4; males/females balanced). In each animal \u2265425 ASIs were measured and synaptic vesicles were counted in ~100 synapses/mouse. Reconstructed dendrites included many small, nonperforated synapses and fewer large, perforated synapses. Relative to S, ASI sizes in perforated synapses shifted toward higher values after W and more so after EW. ASI sizes in nonperforated synapses grew after EW relative to S and W, and so did their density. ASI size correlated with presynaptic vesicle number but the proportion of readily available vesicles decreased after EW, suggesting presynaptic fatigue. Thus, CA1 synapses undergo changes consistent with sleep-dependent synaptic renormalization and their number increases after extended wake.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Sleep benefits learning, memory consolidation, and the integration of new with old memories, but the underlying mechanisms remain highly debated. One hypothesis suggests that sleep's cognitive benefits stem from its ability to renormalize total synaptic strength, after ongoing learning during wake leads to net synaptic potentiation. Supporting evidence for this hypothesis mainly comes from the cerebral cortex, including the observation that cortical synapses are larger after wake and smaller after sleep. Using serial electron microscopy, we find here that sleep/wake synaptic changes consistent with sleep-dependent synaptic renormalization also occur in the CA1 region. Thus, the role of sleep in maintaining synaptic homeostasis may extend to the hippocampus, a key area for learning and synaptic plasticity. ",
        "Improved Neurodevelopmental Outcomes Associated with Bovine Milk Fat Globule Membrane and Lactoferrin in Infant Formula: A Randomized, Controlled Trial. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate neurodevelopment, growth, and health outcomes in infants receiving bovine milk fat globule membrane (MFGM) and lactoferrin in infant formula. STUDY DESIGN: Healthy term infants were randomized to a cow's milk-based infant formula or MFGM\u00a0+\u00a0LF (a similar infant formula, with an added source of bovine milk fat globule membrane [bMFGM; whey protein-lipid concentrate, 5\u00a0g/L] and bovine lactoferrin [0.6\u00a0g/L]) through 365\u00a0days of age. The Bayley Scales of Infant Development, 3rd edition cognitive composite score at day 365 was the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes included tolerance measures through day 365, additional neurodevelopmental and language outcomes, growth, and medically confirmed adverse events through day\u00a0545. RESULTS: Of 451 infants enrolled (control, 228; MFGM\u00a0+\u00a0LF, 223), 291 completed study feeding and Bayley-III testing at day 365 (control, 148; MFGM\u00a0+\u00a0LF, 143). The mean cognitive (+8.7), language (+12.3), and motor (+12.6) scores were higher (P\u00a0< .001) for the MFGM\u00a0+\u00a0LF group; no differences were observed at day 545. Global development scores from day 120 to day 275 and attention at day 365 were significantly improved. Few group differences in day 545 neurodevelopmental outcomes were detected, however scores of some subcategories of the MacArthur-Bates Communicative Development Inventories were higher (P\u00a0< .05) in the MFGM\u00a0+\u00a0LF group. The overall incidence of respiratory-associated adverse events and diarrhea were significantly lower for the MFGM\u00a0+\u00a0LF group through day\u00a0545. CONCLUSIONS: Infants receiving formula with added bovine MFGM and bovine lactoferrin had an accelerated neurodevelopmental profile at day 365 and improved language subcategories at day 545. Formulas were associated with age-appropriate growth and significantly fewer diarrhea and respiratory-associated adverse events through 545\u00a0days of age.

        "Tobacco smoking and risk of 36 cardiovascular disease subtypes: fatal and non-fatal outcomes in a large prospective Australian study. BACKGROUND: Tobacco smoking is a leading cause of cardiovascular disease (CVD) morbidity and mortality. Evidence on the relation of smoking to different subtypes of CVD, across fatal and non-fatal outcomes, is limited. METHODS: A prospective study of 188,167 CVD- and cancer-free individuals aged \u2265\u200945\u2009years from the Australian general population joining the 45 and Up Study from 2006 to 2009, with linked questionnaire, hospitalisation and death data up to the end of 2015. Hazard ratios (HRs) for hospitalisation with or mortality from CVD among current and past versus never smokers were estimated, including according to intensity and recency of smoking, using Cox regression, adjusting for age, sex, urban/rural residence, alcohol consumption, income and education. Population-attributable fractions were estimated. RESULTS: During a mean 7.2\u2009years follow-up (1.35 million person-years), 27,511 (crude rate 20.4/1000\u00a0person-years) incident fatal and non-fatal major CVD events occurred, including 4548 (3.2) acute myocardial infarction (AMI), 3991 (2.8) cerebrovascular disease, 3874 (2.7) heart failure and 2311 (1.6) peripheral arterial disease (PAD) events. At baseline, 8% of participants were current and 34% were past smokers. Of the 36 most common specific CVD subtypes, event rates for 29 were increased significantly in current smokers. Adjusted HRs in current versus never smokers were as follows: 1.63 (95%CI 1.56-1.71) for any major CVD, 2.45 (2.22-2.70) for AMI, 2.16 (1.93-2.42) for cerebrovascular disease, 2.23 (1.96-2.53) for heart failure, 5.06 (4.47-5.74) for PAD, 1.50 (1.24-1.80) for paroxysmal tachycardia, 1.31 (1.20-1.44) for atrial fibrillation/flutter, 1.41 (1.17-1.70) for pulmonary embolism, 2.79 (2.04-3.80) for AMI mortality, 2.26 (1.65-3.10) for cerebrovascular disease mortality and 2.75 (2.37-3.19) for total CVD mortality. CVD risks were elevated at almost all levels of current smoking intensity examined and increased with smoking intensity, with HRs for total CVD mortality in current versus never smokers of 1.92 (1.11-3.32) and 4.90 (3.79-6.34) for 4-6 and \u2265\u200925 cigarettes/day, respectively. Risks diminished with quitting, with excess risks largely avoided by quitting before age 45. Over one third of CVD deaths and one quarter of acute coronary syndrome hospitalisations in Australia aged <\u200965 can be attributed to smoking. CONCLUSIONS: Current smoking increases the risk of virtually all CVD subtypes, at least doubling the risk of many, including AMI, cerebrovascular disease and heart failure. Paroxysmal tachycardia is a newly identified smoking-related risk. Where comparisons are possible, smoking-associated relative risks for fatal and non-fatal outcomes are similar. Quitting reduces the risk substantially. In an established smoking epidemic, with declining and low current smoking prevalence, smoking accounts for a substantial proportion of premature CVD events.

        "Optochemogenetic Stimulation of Transplanted iPS-NPCs Enhances Neuronal Repair and Functional Recovery after Ischemic Stroke. Cell transplantation therapy provides a regenerative strategy for neural repair. We tested the hypothesis that selective excitation of transplanted induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neural progenitor cells (iPS-NPCs) could recapitulate an activity-enriched microenvironment that confers regenerative benefits for the treatment of stroke. Mouse iPS-NPCs were transduced with a novel optochemogenetics fusion protein, luminopsin 3 (LMO3), which consisted of a bioluminescent luciferase, Gaussia luciferase, and an opsin, Volvox Channelrhodopsin 1. These LMO3-iPS-NPCs can be activated by either photostimulation using light or by the luciferase substrate coelenterazine (CTZ). In vitro stimulations of LMO3-iPS-NPCs increased expression of synapsin-1, postsynaptic density 95, brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and stromal cell-derived factor 1 and promoted neurite outgrowth. After transplantation into the ischemic cortex of mice, LMO3-iPS-NPCs differentiated into mature neurons. Synapse formation between implanted and host neurons was identified using immunogold electron microscopy and patch-clamp recordings. Stimulation of transplanted cells with daily intranasal administration of CTZ enhanced axonal myelination, synaptic transmission, improved thalamocortical connectivity, and functional recovery. Patch-clamp and multielectrode array recordings in brain slices showed that CTZ or light stimulation facilitated synaptic transmission and induced neuroplasticity mimicking the LTP of EPSPs. Stroke mice received the combined LMO3-iPS-NPC/CTZ treatment, but not cell or CTZ alone, showed enhanced neural network connections in the peri-infarct region, promoted optimal functional recoveries after stroke in male and female, young and aged mice. Thus, excitation of transplanted cells via the noninvasive optochemogenetics treatment provides a novel integrative cell therapy with comprehensive regenerative benefits after stroke.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Neural network reconnection is critical for repairing damaged brain. Strategies that promote this repair are expected to improve functional outcomes. This study pioneers the generation and application of an optochemogenetics approach in stem cell transplantation therapy after stroke for optimal neural repair and functional recovery. Using induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neural progenitor cells (iPS-NPCs) expressing the novel optochemogenetic probe luminopsin (LMO3), and intranasally delivered luciferase substrate coelenterazine, we show enhanced regenerative properties of LMO3-iPS-NPCs in vitro and after transplantation into the ischemic brain of different genders and ages. The noninvasive repeated coelenterazine stimulation of transplanted cells is feasible for clinical applications. The synergetic effects of the combinatorial cell therapy may have significant impacts on regenerative approach for treatments of CNS injuries. ",
        "Atom Probe Tomography for 3D Structural and Chemical Analysis of Individual Proteins. Determination of the 3D structure of proteins and other biomolecules is a major goal in structural biology, to provide insights to their biological function. Such structures are historically unveiled experimentally by X-ray crystallography or NMR spectroscopy, and in recent years using cryo-electron microscopy. Here, a method for structural analysis of individual proteins on the sub-nanometer scale using atom probe tomography is described. This technique offers a combination of high-resolution analysis of biomolecules in 3D, and the chemical sensitivity of mass spectrometry. As a model protein, the well-characterized antibody IgG is used. IgG is encapsulated in an amorphous solid silica matrix via a sol-gel process to provide the requisite support for atom probe analysis. The silica synthesis is tuned to resemble physiological conditions. The 3D reconstructions show good agreement with the protein databank IgG crystal structure. This suggests that the silica-embedding strategy can open the field of atom probe tomography to the analysis of biological molecules. In addition to high-resolution structural information, the technique may potentially provide chemical information on the atomic scale using isotopic labeling. It is envisaged that this method may constitute a useful complement to existing tools in structural biology, particularly for the examination of proteins with low propensity for crystallization. ",

Anabolic resistance and impaired myocellular quality contribute to age-related sarcopenia, which exacerbates with obesity. Diet-induced muscle mass loss is attenuated by resistance or aerobic plus resistance exercise compared to aerobic exercise in obese elderly. We assessed chronic effects of weight loss plus different exercise modalities on muscle protein synthesis response to feeding and myocellular quality. Obese older adults were randomized to a weight-management program plus aerobic, resistance, or combined aerobic and resistance exercise or to control. Participants underwent vastus lateralis biopsies at baseline and 6\u00a0months. Muscle protein synthesis rate increased more in resistance and combined than in control. Autophagy mediators' expression decreased more in combined than in aerobic, which experienced a higher increase in inflammation and mitochondrial regulators' expression. In obese elderly, combined aerobic and resistance exercise is superior to either mode independently for improving muscle protein synthesis and myocellular quality, thereby maintaining muscle mass during weight-loss therapy.

        "On the potential of in vitro organ-chip models to define temporal pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic relationships. Functional human-on-a-chip systems hold great promise to enable quantitative translation to in vivo outcomes. Here, we explored this concept using a pumpless heart only and heart:liver system to evaluate the temporal pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PKPD) relationship for terfenadine. There was a time dependent drug-induced increase in field potential duration in the cardiac compartment in response to terfenadine and that response was modulated using a metabolically competent liver module that converted terfenadine to fexofenadine. Using this data, a mathematical model was developed to predict the effect of terfenadine in preclinical species. Developing confidence that microphysiological models could have a transformative effect on drug discovery, we also tested a previously discovered proprietary AstraZeneca small molecule and correctly determined the cardiotoxic response to its metabolite in the heart:liver system. Overall our findings serve as a guiding principle to future investigations of temporal concentration response relationships in these innovative in vitro models, especially, if validated across multiple time frames, with additional pharmacological mechanisms and molecules representing a broad chemical diversity.

        "Systematic biases in disease forecasting - The role of behavior change. In a simple susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model, the initial speed at which infected cases increase is indicative of the long-term trajectory of the outbreak. Yet during real-world outbreaks, individuals may modify their behavior and take preventative steps to reduce infection risk. As a consequence, the relationship between the initial rate of spread and the final case count may become tenuous. Here, we evaluate this hypothesis by comparing the dynamics arising from a simple SIR epidemic model with those from a modified SIR model in which individuals reduce contacts as a function of the current or cumulative number of cases. Dynamics with behavior change exhibit significantly reduced final case counts even though the initial speed of disease spread is nearly identical for both of the models. We show that this difference in final size projections depends critically in the behavior change of individuals. These results also provide a rationale for integrating behavior change into iterative forecast models. Hence, we propose to use a Kalman filter to update models with and without behavior change as part of iterative forecasts. When the ground truth outbreak includes behavior change, sequential predictions using a simple SIR model perform poorly despite repeated observations while predictions using the modified SIR model are able to correct for initial forecast errors. These findings highlight the value of incorporating behavior change into baseline epidemic and dynamic forecast models. ",
        "ABCB1 protects bat cells from DNA damage induced by genotoxic compounds. Bats are unusual mammals, with the ability to fly, and long lifespans. In addition, bats have a low incidence of cancer, but the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon remain elusive. Here we discovered that bat cells are more resistant than human and mouse cells to DNA damage induced by genotoxic drugs. We found that bat cells accumulate less chemical than human and mouse cells, and efficient drug efflux mediated by the ABC transporter ABCB1 underlies this improved response to genotoxic reagents. Inhibition of ABCB1 triggers an accumulation of doxorubicin, DNA damage, and cell death. ABCB1 is expressed at higher levels in several cell lines and tissues derived from bats compared to humans. Furthermore, increased drug efflux and high expression of ABCB1 are conserved across multiple bat species. Our findings suggest that enhanced efflux protects bat cells from DNA damage induced by genotoxic compounds, which may contribute to their low cancer incidence. ",
        "Controlling Visually Guided Behavior by Holographic Recalling of Cortical Ensembles. Neurons in cortical circuits are often coactivated as ensembles, yet it is unclear whether ensembles play a functional role in behavior. Some ensemble neurons have pattern completion properties, triggering the entire ensemble when activated. Using two-photon holographic optogenetics in mouse primary visual cortex, we tested whether recalling ensembles by activating pattern completion neurons alters behavioral performance in a visual task. Disruption of behaviorally relevant ensembles by activation of non-selective neurons decreased performance, whereas activation of only two pattern completion neurons from behaviorally relevant ensembles improved performance, by reliably recalling the whole ensemble. Also, inappropriate behavioral choices were evoked by the mistaken activation of behaviorally relevant ensembles. Finally, in absence of visual stimuli, optogenetic activation of two pattern completion neurons could trigger behaviorally relevant ensembles and correct behavioral responses. Our results demonstrate a causal role of neuronal ensembles in a visually guided behavior and suggest that ensembles implement internal representations of perceptual states. ",
        "Enhancer signatures stratify and predict outcomes of non-functional pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors. Most pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PNETs) do not produce excess hormones and are therefore considered 'non-functional'1-3. As clinical behaviors vary widely and distant metastases are eventually lethal2,4, biological classifications might guide treatment. Using enhancer maps to infer gene regulatory programs, we find that non-functional PNETs fall into two major subtypes, with epigenomes and transcriptomes that partially resemble islet \u03b1- and \u03b2-cells. Transcription factors ARX and PDX1 specify these normal cells, respectively5,6, and 84% of 142 non-functional PNETs expressed one or the other factor, occasionally both. Among 103 cases, distant relapses occurred almost exclusively in patients with ARX+PDX1- tumors and, within this subtype, in cases with alternative lengthening of telomeres. These markedly different outcomes belied similar clinical presentations and histology and, in one cohort, occurred irrespective of MEN1 mutation. This robust molecular stratification provides insight into cell lineage correlates of non-functional PNETs, accurately predicts disease course and can inform postoperative clinical decisions. ",
        "Modeling and Structural Characterization of the Sweet Taste Receptor Heterodimer. Sweet taste receptor, a heterodimer belonging to the class C G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) family and composed of the T1R2 and T1R3 subunits, is responsible for the perception of natural sugars, sweet proteins, various d-amino acids, as well as artificial sweeteners. Despite the critical importance of the sweet receptor not only in mediating gustation but also in its role in the food industry, the architecture of the T1R2-T1R3 complex and the mechanism by which extracellular stimuli induce conformational changes that are propagated to the intracellular milieu, i.e., the signal transduction pathway, remain largely unknown. Here, we constructed and characterized a full-length structural model of the T1R2-T1R3 receptor, including both the transmembrane (TM) and extracellular (EC) domains of the heterodimer, using comparative modeling and extensive all-atom molecular dynamics simulations. Several heterodimer interfaces were first examined for the TM domain, and conformational changes occurring at the intracellular side and associated with the receptor's activation were characterized. From the analysis on the simulated data, putative allosteric binding sites for ligands, ions, and cholesterol were proposed. Also, insights into the protein interface of the TM domain upon activation are provided. The EC domain of the heterodimer, including both the Venus flytrap and cysteine-rich domains, was also investigated. Several important intersubunit interactions located at regions responsible for the receptor's proper function were observed, which resemble those recently identified in other class C GPCR members. Integration of the results from the TM and EC domains facilitates the generation of a full-length T1R2-T1R3 receptor. These findings along with the full-length structural model of the T1R2-T1R3 receptor provide a structural framework that may assist in understanding the mechanistic details associated with the receptor activation process for the sweet T1R2-T1R3 receptor as well as other members of the same family.

        "An ultrafast system for signaling mechanical pain in human skin. The canonical view is that touch is signaled by fast-conducting, thickly myelinated afferents, whereas pain is signaled by slow-conducting, thinly myelinated (\"fast\" pain) or unmyelinated (\"slow\" pain) afferents. While other mammals have thickly myelinated afferents signaling pain (ultrafast nociceptors), these have not been demonstrated in humans. Here, we performed single-unit axonal recordings (microneurography) from cutaneous mechanoreceptive afferents in healthy participants. We identified A-fiber high-threshold mechanoreceptors (A-HTMRs) that were insensitive to gentle touch, encoded noxious skin indentations, and displayed conduction velocities similar to A-fiber low-threshold mechanoreceptors. Intraneural electrical stimulation of single ultrafast A-HTMRs evoked painful percepts. Testing in patients with selective deafferentation revealed impaired pain judgments to graded mechanical stimuli only when thickly myelinated fibers were absent. This function was preserved in patients with a loss-of-function mutation in mechanotransduction channel PIEZO2. These findings demonstrate that human mechanical pain does not require PIEZO2 and can be signaled by fast-conducting, thickly myelinated afferents. ",
        "Exercise training improves motor skill learning via selective activation of mTOR. Physical exercise improves learning and memory, but little in vivo evidence has been provided to illustrate the molecular mechanisms. Here, we show that chronic treadmill exercise activates the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway in mouse motor cortex. Both ex vivo and in vivo recordings suggest that mTOR activation leads to potentiated postsynaptic excitation and enhanced neuronal activity of layer 5 pyramidal neurons after exercise, in association with increased oligodendrogenesis and axonal myelination. Exercise training also increases dendritic spine formation and motor learning. Together, exercise activates mTOR pathway, which is necessary for spinogenesis, neuronal activation, and axonal myelination leading to improved motor learning. This model provides new insights for neural network adaptations through exercises and supports the intervention of cognitive deficits using exercise training. ",
        "An integrated genomic regulatory network of virulence-related transcriptional factors in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The virulence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a Gram-negative opportunistic pathogen, is regulated by many transcriptional factors (TFs) that control the expression of quorum sensing and protein secretion systems. Here, we report a genome-wide, network-based approach to dissect the crosstalk between 20 key virulence-related TFs. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq), as well as RNA-seq, we identify 1200 TF-bound genes and 4775 differentially expressed genes. We experimentally validate 347 of these genes as functional target genes, and describe the regulatory relationships of the 20 TFs with their targets in a network that we call 'Pseudomonas aeruginosa genomic regulatory network' (PAGnet). Analysis of the network led to the identification of novel functions for two TFs (ExsA and GacA) in quorum sensing and nitrogen metabolism. Furthermore, we present an online platform and R package based on PAGnet to facilitate updating and user-customised analyses. ",
        "Orthopaedic Physician Attire Influences Patient Perceptions in an Urban Inpatient Setting. BACKGROUND: Prior research suggests that physician attire has an important effect on patient perceptions, and can influence the patient-physician relationship. Previous studies have established the effect of specialty, location, and setting on patient preferences for physician attire, and the importance of these preferences and perceptions on both the physician-patient relationship and first impressions. To date, no studies have examined the influence of attire in the inpatient orthopaedic surgery setting on these perceptions. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: (1) Do differences in orthopaedic physician attire influence patient confidence in their surgeon, perception of trustworthiness, safety, how caring their physician is, how smart their surgeon is, how well the surgery would go, and how willing they are to discuss personal information with the surgeon? (2) Do patients perceive physicians who are men and women differently with respect to those endpoints?. METHODS: Ninety-three of 110 patients undergoing orthopaedic surgery at an urban academic medical center participated in a three-part survey. In the first part, each patient was randomly presented 10 images of both men and women surgeons, each dressed in five different outfits: business attire (BA), a white coat over business attire (WB), scrubs alone (SA), a white coat over scrubs (WS), and casual attire (CA). Respondents rated each image on a five-point Likert scale regarding how confident, trustworthy, safe, caring, and smart the surgeon appeared, how well the surgery would go, and the patient's willingness to discuss personal information with the surgeon. In the second part, the respondent ranked all images, by gender, from the most to least confident based on attire. RESULTS: Pair-wise comparisons for women surgeons demonstrated no difference in patient preference between white coat over business attire compared with white coat over scrubs or scrubs alone, though each was preferable to business attire and casual attire (WS versus WB: mean difference [MD], 0.1 \u00b1 0.6; 95% CI, 0.0-0.2; p = 1.0; WS versus SA: MD, 0.2 \u00b1 0.7; 95% CI, 0-0.3; p = 0.7; WB versus SA: 0.1 \u00b1 0.9; 95% CI, -0.1 to 0.2; p = 1.0). The same results were found when rating the surgeon's perceived intelligence, skill, trust, confidentiality, caring, and safety. In the pair-wise comparisons for male surgeons, white coat over scrubs was not preferred to white coat over business attire, scrubs alone, or business attire (WS versus WB: MD, -0.1 \u00b1 0.6; 95% CI, 0-0.1; p = 1.0; WS versus SA: MD, 0 \u00b1 0.4; 95% CI, -0.2 to 0; p = 1.0; WS versus BA: MD, 0.2 \u00b1 0.8; 95% CI, 0-0.4; p = 0.6). WB and SA were not different (MD, 0.0 \u00b1 0.6; 95% CI, -0.1 to 0.2; p = 1.0), though both were preferred to BA and CA (WB versus BA: MD, 0.3 \u00b1 0.8; 95% CI, 0.1-0.5; p = 0.02; WB versus CA: 1.0 \u00b1 1.0; 95% CI, 0.8-1.2; p < 0.01). We found no difference between SA and BA (MD, 0.3 \u00b1 0.7; 95% CI, 0.1-0.4; p = 0.06). We found that each was preferred to CA (SA versus CA: 0.9 \u00b1 1.0; 95% CI, 0.7-1.2; p < 0.01; BA versus CA: 0.7 \u00b1 1.0; 95% CI, 0.5-0.9; p < 0.01), with similar results in all other categories. When asked to rank all types of attire, patients preferred WS or WB for both men and women surgeons, followed by SA, BA, and CA. CONCLUSIONS: Similar to findings in the outpatient orthopaedic setting, in the inpatient setting, we found patients had a moderate overall preference for physicians wearing a white coat, either over scrubs or business attire, and, to some extent, scrubs alone. Respondents did not show any difference in preference based on the gender of the pictured surgeon. For men and women orthopaedic surgeons in the urban inpatient setting, stereotypical physician's attire such as a white coat over either scrubs or business attire, or even scrubs alone may improve numerous components of the patient-physician relationship and should therefore be strongly considered to enhance overall patient care. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level II, therapeutic study. ",
        "A Christianson syndrome-linked deletion mutation (\u0394287ES288) in SLC9A6 impairs hippocampal neuronal plasticity. Christianson Syndrome is a rare but increasingly diagnosed X-linked intellectual disability disorder that arises from mutations in SLC9A6/NHE6, a pH-regulating transporter that localizes to early and recycling endosomes. We have recently reported that one of the originally identified disease-causing mutations in NHE6 (p.E287-S288del, or \u0394ES) resulted in a loss of its pH regulatory function. However, the impact of this mutation upon neuronal synapse formation and plasticity is unknown. Here, we investigate the consequences of the \u0394ES mutant upon mouse hippocampal pyramidal neurons by expressing a fluorescently-labeled \u0394ES NHE6 construct into primary hippocampal neurons. Neurons expressing the \u0394ES mutant showed significant reductions in mature dendritic spine density with a concurrent increase in immature filopodia. Furthermore, compared to wild-type (WT), \u0394ES-containing endosomes are redirected away from early and recycling endosomes toward lysosomes. In parallel, the \u0394ES mutant reduced the trafficking of glutamatergic AMPA receptors to excitatory synapses and increased their accumulation within lysosomes for potential degradation. Upon long-term potentiation (LTP), neurons expressing \u0394ES failed to undergo significant structural and functional changes as observed in controls and WT transfectants. Interestingly, synapse density and LTP-induced synaptic remodeling in \u0394ES-expressing neurons were partially restored by bafilomycin, a vesicular alkalinisation agent, or by leupeptin, an inhibitor of lysosomal proteolytic degradation. Overall, our results demonstrate that the \u2206ES mutation attenuates synapse density and structural and functional plasticity in hippocampal neurons. These deficits may be partially due to the mistargeting of AMPA receptors and other cargos to lysosomes, thereby preventing their trafficking during synaptic remodeling. This mechanism may contribute to the cognitive learning deficits observed in patients with Christianson Syndrome and suggests a potential therapeutic strategy for treatment. ",
        "Genomic landscape of epithelium with low-grade atypia on gastric cancer after Helicobacter pylori eradiation therapy. BACKGROUND: Gastric cancer may develop after successful eradication of Helicobacter pylori, although the incidence is lower than in non-eradicated individuals. We previously reported the appearance of characteristic epithelium with low-grade atypia (ELA) on the surface of gastric cancer after H. pylori eradication. However, whether ELA originates from cancer after re-differentiation or from the non-cancerous surrounding mucosa is unknown. METHODS: We isolated ELA regions from 10 early gastric cancer patients and analyzed the nucleotide sequences for 90 oncogenes and 35 fusion oncogenes, comparing them with counterpart cancer tissue, normal gastric mucosa, and blood cell-derived DNA. Somatic mutations in each tissue were identified by comparing them with the sequences from whole blood-derived DNA. RESULT: Gene alterations were observed in nine of the ten patients, and up to 42 and 70 somatic mutations were seen in cancer and ELA samples, respectively. Common mutations shared between cancer and ELA tissues were found in eight of these nine patients. In contrast, common mutations between non-cancer mucosa and ELA were only detected in one patient, who also had common mutation between cancer and ELA. ELA-specific nucleotide substitutions were seen in seven patients. In contrast, cancer-specific substitutions were only found in two patients. 18 out of 19 amino acid substitutions present in cancer tissue were also identified in ELA. These results suggest that ELA originated from cancer tissue and accumulated further nucleotide substitutions. CONCLUSIONS: Differential diagnosis of ELA and normal mucosa should be carefully performed to prevent misdiagnosis of ELA as normal mucosa with atypia. ",
        "Targeting a ceramide double bond improves insulin resistance and hepatic steatosis. Ceramides contribute to the lipotoxicity that underlies diabetes, hepatic steatosis, and heart disease. By genetically engineering mice, we deleted the enzyme dihydroceramide desaturase 1 (DES1), which normally inserts a conserved double bond into the backbone of ceramides and other predominant sphingolipids. Ablation of DES1 from whole animals or tissue-specific deletion in the liver and/or adipose tissue resolved hepatic steatosis and insulin resistance in mice caused by leptin deficiency or obesogenic diets. Mechanistic studies revealed ceramide actions that promoted lipid uptake and storage and impaired glucose utilization, none of which could be recapitulated by (dihydro)ceramides that lacked the critical double bond. These studies suggest that inhibition of DES1 may provide a means of treating hepatic steatosis and metabolic disorders. ",
        "Alcohol Consumption in Later Life and Mortality in the United States: Results from 9 Waves of the Health and Retirement Study. BACKGROUND: Alcohol consumption in later life has increased in the past decade, and the relationship between alcohol consumption and mortality is controversial. Recent studies suggest little, if any, health benefit to alcohol. Yet most rely on single-time point consumption assessments and minimal confounder adjustments. METHODS: We report on 16\u00a0years of follow-up from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) cohorts born 1931 to 1941 (N\u00a0=\u00a07,904, baseline mean age\u00a0=\u00a061, SD\u00a0=\u00a03.18). Respondents were queried about drinking frequency/quantity. Mortality was established via exit interviews and confirmed with the national death index. Time-varying confounders included but were not limited to household assets, smoking, body mass index, health/functioning, depression, chronic disease; time-invariant confounders included baseline age, education, sex, and race. RESULTS: After adjustment, current abstainers had the highest risk of subsequent mortality, consistent with sick quitters, and moderate (men: HR\u00a0=\u00a00.74, 95% CI: 0.60 to 0.91; women: HR\u00a0=\u00a00.82, 95% CI: 0.63 to 1.07) drinking was associated with a lower mortality rate compared with occasional drinking, though smokers and men evidenced less of an inverse association. Quantitative bias analyses indicated that omitted confounders would need to be associated with ~4-fold increases in mortality rates for men and ~9-fold increases for women to change the results. CONCLUSIONS: There are consistent associations between moderate/occasional drinking and lower mortality, though residual confounding remains a threat to validity. Continued efforts to conduct large-scale observational studies of alcohol consumption and mortality are needed to characterize the changing patterns of consumption in older age. ",
        "Interaction between the nasal microbiota and S. pneumoniae in the context of live-attenuated influenza vaccine. Streptococcus pneumoniae is the main bacterial pathogen involved in pneumonia. Pneumococcal acquisition and colonization density is probably affected by viral co-infections, the local microbiome composition and mucosal immunity. Here, we report the interactions between live-attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV), successive pneumococcal challenge, and the healthy adult nasal microbiota and mucosal immunity using an experimental human\u00a0challenge model. Nasal microbiota profiles at baseline are associated with consecutive pneumococcal carriage outcome (non-carrier, low-dense and high-dense pneumococcal carriage), independent of LAIV co-administration. Corynebacterium/Dolosigranulum-dominated profiles are associated with low-density colonization. Lowest rates of natural viral co-infection at baseline and post-LAIV influenza replication are detected in the low-density carriers. Also, we detected the fewest microbiota perturbations and mucosal cytokine responses in the low-density carriers compared to non-carriers or high-density carriers. These results indicate that the complete respiratory ecosystem affects pneumococcal behaviour following challenge, with low-density carriage representing the most stable ecological state. ",
        "Objectively measured sedentary time before and after transition to retirement:The Finnish Retirement and Aging Study (FIREA). BACKGROUND: Retirement is associated with an increase in self-reported daily sedentary time, but no longitudinal evidence exists on how objectively measured sedentary time changes during retirement transition. The aim of this study was to compare objectively measured daily and hourly sedentary time before and after retirement and examine whether these changes differ by gender and occupational status. METHODS: The study population consisted of 478 participants (mean age 63.2 years, SD 1.7, 85% women) from the Finnish Retirement and Aging Study (FIREA). Sedentary time was measured using a wrist-worn triaxial ActiGraph accelerometer before and after transition to retirement with one year interval. Pre-retirement occupational status was categorized as manual and non-manual. RESULTS: Daily sedentary time was 8 hours 10 minutes in women and 9 hours 49 minutes in men before retirement. Considering all measurement days before and after retirement, daily sedentary time increased in women by 29 minutes (95% CI 20 to 38). Especially women retiring from manual occupations showed marked increase in sedentary time (63 min, 95% CI 50 to 77). When only non-working days before retirement were considered, increase in daily sedentary time among women was less marked (16 min, 95% CI 7 to 25). Among men, daily sedentary time did not change in retirement transition (-7 minutes, 95% CI -26 to 12). CONCLUSIONS: Objectively measured sedentary time increases among women and remains at high level among men during the retirement transition. Attention should be paid to reduce daily sedentary time in retiring women and men. ",
        "Metabolic Trajectories Following Contrasting Prudent and Western Diets from Food Provisions: Identifying Robust Biomarkers of Short-Term Changes in Habitual Diet. A large body of evidence has linked unhealthy eating patterns with an alarming increase in obesity and chronic disease worldwide. However, existing methods of assessing dietary intake in nutritional epidemiology rely on food frequency questionnaires or dietary records that are prone to bias and selective reporting. Herein, metabolic phenotyping was performed on 42 healthy participants from the Diet and Gene Intervention (DIGEST) pilot study, a parallel two-arm randomized clinical trial that provided complete diets to all participants. Matching single-spot urine and fasting plasma specimens were collected at baseline, and then following two weeks of either a Prudent or Western diet with a weight-maintaining menu plan designed by a dietician. Targeted and nontargeted metabolite profiling was conducted using three complementary analytical platforms, where 80 plasma metabolites and 84 creatinine-normalized urinary metabolites were reliably measured (CV < 30%) in the majority of participants (>75%) after implementing a rigorous data workflow for metabolite authentication with stringent quality control. We classified a panel of metabolites with distinctive trajectories following two weeks of food provisions when using complementary univariate and multivariate statistical models. Unknown metabolites associated with contrasting dietary patterns were identified with high-resolution MS/MS, as well as co-elution after spiking with authentic standards if available. Overall, 3-methylhistidine and proline betaine concentrations increased in both plasma and urine samples after participants were assigned a Prudent diet (q < 0.05) with a corresponding decrease in the Western diet group. Similarly, creatinine-normalized urinary imidazole propionate, hydroxypipecolic acid, dihydroxybenzoic acid, and enterolactone glucuronide, as well as plasma ketoleucine and ketovaline increased with a Prudent diet (p < 0.05) after adjustments for age, sex, and BMI. In contrast, plasma myristic acid, linoelaidic acid, linoleic acid, \u03b1-linoleic acid, pentadecanoic acid, alanine, proline, carnitine, and deoxycarnitine, as well as urinary acesulfame K increased among participants following a Western diet. Most metabolites were also correlated (r > \u00b1 0.30, p < 0.05) to changes in the average intake of specific nutrients from self-reported diet records reflecting good adherence to assigned food provisions. Our study revealed robust biomarkers sensitive to short-term changes in habitual diet, which is needed for accurate monitoring of healthy eating patterns in free-living populations, and evidence-based public health policies for chronic disease prevention.

        "Caspase-1 initiates apoptosis in the absence of gasdermin D. Caspase-1 activated in inflammasomes triggers a programmed necrosis called pyroptosis, which is mediated by gasdermin D (GSDMD). However, GSDMD-deficient cells are still susceptible to caspase-1-mediated cell death. Therefore, here, we investigate the mechanism of caspase-1-initiated cell death in GSDMD-deficient cells. Inflammasome stimuli induce apoptosis accompanied by caspase-3 activation in GSDMD-deficient macrophages, which largely relies on caspase-1. Chemical dimerization of caspase-1 induces pyroptosis in GSDMD-sufficient cells, but apoptosis in GSDMD-deficient cells. Caspase-1-induced apoptosis involves the Bid-caspase-9-caspase-3 axis, which can be followed by GSDME-dependent secondary necrosis/pyroptosis. However, Bid ablation does not completely abolish the cell death, suggesting the existence of an additional mechanism. Furthermore, cortical neurons and mast cells exhibit little or low GSDMD expression and undergo apoptosis after oxygen glucose deprivation and nigericin stimulation, respectively, in a caspase-1- and Bid-dependent manner. This study clarifies the molecular mechanism and biological roles of caspase-1-induced apoptosis in GSDMD-low/null cell types. ",
        "Association Between Androgen Deprivation Therapy Use and Diagnosis of Dementia in Men With Prostate Cancer. Importance: The association between androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) exposure and dementia is uncertain. Objective: To analyze the association between ADT exposure and diagnosis of Alzheimer disease or dementia among elderly men with prostate cancer. Design, Setting, and Participants: This retrospective cohort study used data from the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare linked database. Participants were 154\u202f089 elderly men newly diagnosed with prostate cancer between 1996 and 2003. The analyses were conducted between November 1, 2018, and December 31, 2018. Exposure: Androgen deprivation therapy. Main Outcomes and Measures: Patients receiving ADT within 2 years of prostate cancer diagnosis were identified. Survival analysis was used to determine the association between ADT exposure and diagnosis of Alzheimer disease or dementia in the follow-up period. Propensity score and instrumental variable approaches were used to minimize measured and unmeasured selection bias. The association by dose of ADT was also examined. Results: Of the 295\u202f733 men diagnosed with prostate cancer between 1996 and 2003, 154\u202f089 met the study criteria. Of these, 62\u202f330 (mean [SD] age, 76.0 [6.0] years) received ADT within 2 years of prostate cancer diagnosis, and 91\u202f759 (mean [SD] age, 74.3 [6.0] years) did not receive ADT. Mean (SD) follow-up was 8.3 (4.7) years. Exposure to ADT, compared with no ADT exposure, was associated with a diagnosis of Alzheimer disease (13.1% vs 9.4%; difference, 3.7%; 95% CI, 3.3%-3.9%; P\u2009<\u2009.001; hazard ratio [HR], 1.14; 95% CI, 1.10-1.18) and dementia (21.6% vs 15.8%; difference, 5.8%; 95% CI, 5.4%-6.2%; P\u2009<\u2009.001; HR, 1.20; 95% CI, 1.17-1.24). For 1 to 4 doses of ADT, the HR was 1.19 (95% CI, 1.15-1.24) for Alzheimer disease and 1.19 (95% CI, 1.15-1.23) for dementia. For 5 to 8 doses of ADT, the HR was 1.28 (95% CI, 1.22-1.35) for Alzheimer disease and 1.24 (95% CI, 1.19-1.29) for dementia. For more than 8 doses of ADT, the HR was 1.24 (95% CI, 1.16-1.34) for Alzheimer disease and 1.21 (95% CI, 1.15-1.28) for dementia. The number needed to harm was 18 patients (95% CI, 17-19 patients) and 10 patients (95% CI, 9.5-11 patients) for Alzheimer disease and dementia, respectively. Conclusions and Relevance: Among elderly patients with prostate cancer, ADT exposure was associated with subsequent diagnosis of Alzheimer disease or dementia over a follow-up period of at least 10 years.

        "Motile curved bacteria are Pareto-optimal. Curved rods are a ubiquitous bacterial phenotype, but the fundamental question of why they are shaped this way remains unanswered. Through in silico experiments, we assessed freely swimming straight- and curved-rod bacteria of a wide diversity of equal-volume shapes parameterized by elongation and curvature, and predicted their performances in tasks likely to strongly influence overall fitness. Performance trade-offs between these tasks lead to a variety of shapes that are Pareto-optimal, including coccoids, all straight rods, and a range of curvatures. Comparison with an extensive morphological survey of motile curved-rod bacteria indicates that the vast majority of species fall within the Pareto-optimal region of morphospace. This result is consistent with evolutionary trade-offs between just three tasks: efficient swimming, chemotaxis, and low cell construction cost. We thus reveal the underlying selective pressures driving morphological diversity in a widespread component of microbial ecosystems. ",

Importance: The Implicit Association Test (IAT) is a validated tool used to measure implicit biases, which are mental associations shaped by one's environment that influence interactions with others. Direct evidence of implicit gender biases about women in medicine has yet not been reported, but existing evidence is suggestive of subtle or hidden biases that affect women in medicine. Objectives: To use data from IATs to assess (1) how health care professionals associate men and women with career and family and (2) how surgeons associate men and women with surgery and family medicine. Design, Setting, and Participants: This data review and cross-sectional study collected data from January 1, 2006, through December 31, 2017, from self-identified health care professionals taking the Gender-Career IAT hosted by Project Implicit to explore bias among self-identified health care professionals. A novel Gender-Specialty IAT was also tested at a national surgical meeting in October 2017. All health care professionals who completed the Gender-Career IAT were eligible for the first analysis. Surgeons of any age, gender, title, and country of origin at the meeting were eligible to participate in the second analysis. Data were analyzed from January 1, 2018, through March 31, 2019. Main Outcomes and Measures: Measure of implicit bias derived from reaction times on the IATs and a measure of explicit bias asked directly to participants. Results: Almost 1 million IAT records from Project Implicit were reviewed, and 131 surgeons (64.9% men; mean [SD] age, 42.3 [11.5] years) were recruited to complete the Gender-Specialty IAT. Healthcare professionals (n\u2009=\u200942\u202f991; 82.0% women; mean [SD] age, 32.7 [11.8] years) held implicit (mean [SD] D score, 0.41 [0.36]; Cohen d\u2009=\u20091.14) and explicit (mean [SD], 1.43 [1.85]; Cohen d\u2009=\u20090.77) biases associating men with career and women with family. Similarly, surgeons implicitly (mean [SD] D score, 0.28 [0.37]; Cohen d\u2009=\u20090.76) and explicitly (men: mean [SD], 1.27 [0.39]; Cohen d\u2009=\u20090.93; women: mean [SD], 0.73 [0.35]; Cohen d\u2009=\u20090.53) associated men with surgery and women with family medicine. There was broad evidence of consensus across social groups in implicit and explicit biases with one exception. Women in healthcare (mean [SD], 1.43 [1.86]; Cohen d\u2009=\u20090.77) and surgery (mean [SD], 0.73 [0.35]; Cohen d\u2009=\u20090.53) were less likely than men to explicitly associate men with career (B coefficient, -0.10; 95% CI, -0.15 to -0.04; P\u2009<\u2009.001) and surgery (B coefficient, -0.67; 95% CI, -1.21 to -0.13; P\u2009=\u2009.001) and women with family and family medicine. Conclusions and Relevance: The main contribution of this work is an estimate of the extent of implicit gender bias within surgery. On both the Gender-Career IAT and the novel Gender-Specialty IAT, respondents had a tendency to associate men with career and surgery and women with family and family medicine. Awareness of the existence of implicit biases is an important first step toward minimizing their potential effect. ",
        "HDAC Inhibition Enhances the In Vivo Efficacy of MEK Inhibitor Therapy in Uveal Melanoma. PURPOSE: The clinical use of MEK inhibitors in uveal melanoma is limited by the rapid acquisition of resistance. This study has used multiomics approaches and drug screens to identify the pan-HDAC inhibitor panobinostat as an effective strategy to limit MEK inhibitor resistance.Experimental Design: Mass spectrometry-based proteomics and RNA-Seq were used to identify the signaling pathways involved in the escape of uveal melanoma cells from MEK inhibitor therapy. Mechanistic studies were performed to evaluate the escape pathways identified, and the efficacy of the MEK-HDAC inhibitor combination was demonstrated in multiple in vivo models of uveal melanoma. RESULTS: We identified a number of putative escape pathways that were upregulated following MEK inhibition, including the PI3K/AKT pathway, ROR1/2, and IGF-1R signaling. MEK inhibition was also associated with increased GPCR expression, particularly the endothelin B receptor, and this contributed to therapeutic escape through ET-3-mediated YAP signaling. A screen of 289 clinical grade compounds identified HDAC inhibitors as potential candidates that suppressed the adaptive YAP and AKT signaling that followed MEK inhibition. In vivo, the MEK-HDAC inhibitor combination outperformed either agent alone, leading to a long-term decrease of tumor growth in both subcutaneous and liver metastasis models and the suppression of adaptive PI3K/AKT and YAP signaling. CONCLUSIONS: Together, our studies have identified GPCR-mediated YAP activation and RTK-driven AKT signaling as key pathways involved in the escape of uveal melanoma cells from MEK inhibition. We further demonstrate that HDAC inhibition is a promising combination partner for MEK inhibitors in advanced uveal melanoma. ",
        "RGD conjugated cell uptake off to on responsive NIR-AZA fluorophores: applications toward intraoperative fluorescence guided surgery. The use of NIR-fluorescence imaging to demarcate tumour boundaries for real-time guidance of their surgical resection has a huge untapped potential. However, fluorescence imaging using molecular fluorophores, even with a targeting biomolecule attached, has a major shortcoming of signal interference from non-specific background fluorescence outside the region of interest. This poor selectivity necessitates prolonged time delays to allow clearance of background fluorophore and retention within the tumour prior to image acquisition. In this report, an innovative approach to overcome this issue is described in which cancer targeted off to on bio-responsive NIR-fluorophores are utilised to switch-on first within the tumour. Bio-responsive cRGD, iRGD and PEG conjugates have been synthesised using activated ester/amine or maleimide/thiol couplings to link targeting and fluorophore components. Their off to on emission responses were measured and compared with an always-on non-responsive control with each bio-responsive derivative showing large fluorescence enhancement values. Live cell imaging experiments using metastatic breast cancer cells confirmed in vitro bio-responsive capabilities. An in vivo assessment of MDA-MB 231 tumour imaging performance for bio-responsive and always-on fluorophores was conducted with monitoring of fluorescence distributions over 96 h. As anticipated, the always-on fluorophore gave an immediate, non-specific and very strong emission throughout whereas the bio-responsive derivatives initially displayed very low fluorescence. All three bio-responsive derivatives switched on within tumours at time points consistent with their conjugated targeting groups. cRGD and iRGD conjugates both had effective tumour turn-on in the first hour, though the cRGD derivative had superior specificity for tumour over the iRGD conjugate. The pegylated derivative had similar switch-on characteristics but over a much longer period, taking 9 h before a significant emission was observable from the tumour. Evidence for in vivo active tumour targeting was obtained for the best performing cRGD bio-responsive NIR-AZA derivative from competitive binding studies. Overall, this cRGD-conjugate has the potential to overcome the inherent drawback of targeted always-on fluorophores requiring prolonged clearance times and shows excellent potential for clinical translation for intraoperative use in fluorescence guided tumour resections.

        "Development of a high-throughput strategy for discovery of potent analogues of antibiotic lysocin E. Lysocin E, a 37-membered natural depsipeptide, induces rapid bacteriolysis in methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus via a unique menaquinone-dependent mechanism, presenting a promising therapeutic lead. Despite the great medical importance, exploring the potential utility of its derivatives as new platform structures for antibiotic development has remained a significant challenge. Here, we report a high-throughput strategy that enabled the preparation of thousands of analogues of lysocin E and large-scale structure-activity relationship analyses. We integrate 26-step total synthesis of 2401 cyclic peptides, tandem mass spectrometry-sequencing, and two microscale activity assays to identify 23 candidate compounds. Re-synthesis of these candidates shows that 11 of them (A1-A11) exhibit antimicrobial activity superior or comparable to that of lysocin E, and that lysocin E and A1-A11 share L-Leu-6 and L-Ile-11. Therefore, the present strategy allows us to efficiently decipher biologically crucial residues and identify potentially useful agents for the treatment of infectious diseases. ",
        "Identification of a novel EphB4 phosphodegron regulated by the autocrine IGFII/IRA axis in malignant mesothelioma. Malignant mesothelioma is a deadly disease with limited therapeutic options. EphB4 is an oncogenic tyrosine kinase receptor expressed in malignant mesothelioma as well as in a variety of cancers. It is involved in tumor microenvironment mediating angiogenesis and invasive cellular effects via both EphrinB2 ligand-dependent and independent mechanisms. The molecular network underlying EphB4 oncogenic effects is still unclear. Here we show that EphB4 expression in malignant mesothelioma cells is markedly decreased upon neutralization of cancer-secreted IGF-II. In particular, we demonstrate that EphB4 protein expression in malignant mesothelioma cells depend upon a degradation rescue mechanism controlled by the autocrine IGF-II-insulin receptor-A specific signaling axis. We show that the regulation of EphB4 expression is linked to a competing post-translational modification of its carboxy-terminal tail via phosphorylation of its tyrosine 987 by the Insulin receptor isoform-A kinase-associated activity in response to the autocrine IGF-II stimuli. Neutralization of this autocrine-induced EphB4-phosphorylation by IGF-II associates with the increased ubiquitination of EphB4 carboxy-terminal tail and with its rapid degradation. We also describe a novel Ubiquitin binding motif in the targeted region as part of the identified EphB4 phosphodegron and provide 3D modeling data supporting a possible model for the acute EphB4 PTM-driven regulation by IGF-II. Altogether, these findings disclose a novel molecular mechanism for the maintenance of EphB4-expression in malignant mesothelioma cells and other IGF-II-secreting cancers (IGF2omas). ",
        "Possible mechanisms of polyphosphate-induced amyloid fibril formation of \u03b22-microglobulin. Polyphosphate (polyP), which is found in various microorganisms and human cells, is an anionic biopolymer consisting of inorganic phosphates linked by high-energy phosphate bonds. Previous studies revealed that polyPs strongly promoted the amyloid formation of several amyloidogenic proteins; however, the mechanism of polyP-induced amyloid formation remains unclear. In the present study using \u03b22-microglobulin (\u03b22m), a protein responsible for dialysis-related amyloidosis, we investigated amyloid formation in the presence of various chain lengths of polyPs at different concentrations under both acidic (pH 2.0 to 2.5) and neutral pH (pH 7.0 to 7.5) conditions. We found that the amyloid formation of \u03b22m at acidic pH was significantly accelerated by the addition of polyPs at an optimal polyP concentration, which decreased with an increase in chain length. The results obtained indicated that electrostatic interactions between positively charged \u03b22m and negatively charged polyPs play a major role in amyloid formation. Under neutral pH conditions, long polyP with 60 to 70 phosphates induced the amyloid formation of \u03b22m at several micromoles per liter, a similar concentration range to that in vivo. Since \u03b22m with an isoelectric point of 6.4 has a slightly negative net charge at pH 7, polyPs were unlikely to interact with \u03b22m electrostatically. PolyPs appear to dehydrate water molecules around \u03b22m under the unfolded conformation, leading to the preferential stabilization of less water-exposed amyloid fibrils. These results not only revealed the pH-dependent mechanism of the amyloid formation of \u03b22m but also suggested that polyPs play an important role in the development of dialysis-related amyloidosis.

        "Dosage Related Efficacy and Tolerability of Cannabidiol in Children With Treatment-Resistant Epileptic Encephalopathy: Preliminary Results of the CARE-E Study. Purpose: There is uncertainty regarding the appropriate dose of Cannabidiol (CBD) for childhood epilepsy. We present the preliminary data of seven participants from the Cannabidiol in Children with Refractory Epileptic Encephalopathy (CARE-E) study. Methods: The study is an open-label, prospective, dose-escalation trial. Participants received escalating doses of a Cannabis Herbal Extract (CHE) preparation of 1:20 \u03949-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC): CBD up to 10-12 mg CBD/kg/day. Seizure frequency was monitored in daily logs, participants underwent regular electroencephalograms, and parents filled out modified Quality of Life in Childhood Epilepsy (QOLCE) and Side Effect rating scale questionnaires. Steady-state trough levels (Css, Min) of selected cannabinoids were quantified. Results: All seven participants tolerated the CHE up to 10-12 mg CBD/kg/day and had improvements in seizure frequency and QOLCE scores. CSS, Min plasma levels for CBD, THC, and cannabichromene (CBC) showed dose-independent pharmacokinetics in all but one participant. CSS, Min CBD levels associated with a >50% reduction in seizures and seizure freedom were lower than those reported previously with purified CBD. In most patients, CSS, Min levels of THC remained lower than what would be expected to cause intoxication. Conclusion: The preliminary data suggest an initial CBD target dose of 5-6 mg/kg/day when a 1:20 THC:CBD CHE is used. Possible non-linear pharmacokinetics of CBD and CBC needs investigation. The reduction in seizure frequency seen suggests improved seizure control when a whole plant CHE is used. Plasma THC levels suggest a low risk of THC intoxication when a 1:20 THC:CBD CHE is used in doses up to 12 mg/kg CBD/kg/day. ",
        "Metabolomic profiling identifies pathways associated with minimal residual disease in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. BACKGROUND: End-induction minimal residual disease (MRD) is the strongest predictor of relapse in paediatric acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL), but an understanding of the biological pathways underlying early treatment response remains elusive. We hypothesized that metabolomic profiling of diagnostic bone marrow plasma could provide insights into the underlying biology of early treatment response and inform treatment strategies for high-risk patients. METHODS: We performed global metabolomic profiling of samples from discovery (N\u202f=\u202f93) and replication (N\u202f=\u202f62) cohorts treated at Texas Children's Hospital. Next, we tested the cytotoxicity of drugs targeting central carbon metabolism in cell lines and patient-derived xenograft (PDX) cells. FINDINGS: Metabolite set enrichment analysis identified altered central carbon and amino acid metabolism in MRD-positive patients from both cohorts at a 5% false discovery rate. Metabolites from these pathways were used as inputs for unsupervised hierarchical clustering. Two distinct clusters were identified, which were independently associated with MRD after adjustment for immunophenotype, cytogenetics, and NCI risk group. Three nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT) inhibitors, which reduce glycolytic/TCA cycle activities, demonstrated nanomolar-range cytotoxicity in B- and T-ALL cell lines and PDX cells. INTERPRETATION: This study provides new insights into the role of central carbon metabolism in early treatment response and as a potential targetable pathway in high-risk disease.

        "Nature of Cardiac Rehabilitation Around the Globe. Background: Cardiac rehabilitation (CR) is a clinically-effective but complex model of care. The purpose of this study was to characterize the nature of CR programs around the world, in relation to guideline recommendations, and compare this by World Health Organization (WHO) region. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, a piloted survey was administered online to CR programs globally. Cardiac associations and local champions facilitated program identification. Quality (benchmark of \u2265\u00a075% of programs in a given country meeting each of 20 indicators) was ranked. Results were compared by WHO region using generalized linear mixed models. Findings: 111/203 (54.7%) countries in the world offer CR; data were collected in 93 (83.8%; N\u202f=\u202f1082 surveys, 32.1% program response rate). The most commonly-accepted indications were: myocardial infarction (n\u202f=\u202f832, 97.4%), percutaneous coronary intervention (n\u202f=\u202f820, 96.1%; 0.10), and coronary artery bypass surgery (n\u202f=\u202f817, 95.8%). Most programs were led by physicians (n\u202f=\u202f680; 69.1%). The most common CR providers (mean\u202f=\u202f5.9\u202f\u00b1\u202f2.8/program) were: nurses (n\u202f=\u202f816, 88.1%; low in Africa, p\u202f<\u202f0.001), dietitians (n\u202f=\u202f739, 80.2%), and physiotherapists (n\u202f=\u202f733, 79.3%). The most commonly-offered core components (mean\u202f=\u202f8.7\u202f\u00b1\u202f1.9 program) were: initial assessment (n\u202f=\u202f939, 98.8%; most commonly for hypertension, tobacco, and physical inactivity), risk factor management (n\u202f=\u202f928, 98.2%), patient education (n\u202f=\u202f895, 96.9%), and exercise (n\u202f=\u202f898, 94.3%; lower in Western Pacific, p\u202f<\u202f0.01). All regions met \u2265\u00a016/20 quality indicators, but quality was <\u00a075% for tobacco cessation and return-to-work counseling (lower in Americas, p\u202f=\u202f<\u00a00.05).

        "Financial Implications of 12-Month Dispensing of Oral Contraceptive Pills in the Veterans Affairs Health Care System. Importance: The Veterans Affairs (VA) health care system is the largest integrated health care system in the United States. Like most US health plans, the VA currently stipulates a 3-month maximum dispensing limit for all medications, including oral contraceptive pills (OCPs). However, 12-month OCP dispensing has been shown to improve continuation of use, decrease coverage gaps, and reduce unintended pregnancy in other practice settings. Objective: To estimate the financial and reproductive health implications for the VA of implementing a 12-month OCP dispensing option, with the goal of informing policy change. Design, Setting, and Participants: A decision model from the VA payer perspective was developed to estimate incremental costs to the health care system of allowing the option to receive a 12-month supply of OCPs up front, compared with the standard 3-month maximum, during a 1-year time horizon. A model cohort of 24\u202f309 reproductive-aged, heterosexually active, female VA enrollees who wish to avoid pregnancy for at least 1 year was assumed. Probabilities of continuation of OCP use, coverage gaps, pregnancy, and pregnancy outcomes were drawn from published data. Costs of OCP provision and pregnancy-related care and the number of women using OCPs were drawn from VA administrative data. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to assess model robustness. Main Outcomes and Measures: Incremental per-woman and total costs to the VA of allowing for 12-month dispensing of OCPs compared with standard 3-month dispensing. Results: The 12-month OCP dispensing option, modeled from the VA health system perspective using a cohort of 240 309 women, resulted in anticipated VA annual cost savings of $87.12 per woman compared with the cost of 3-month dispensing, or an estimated total savings of $2\u202f117\u202f800 annually. Cost savings resulted from an absolute reduction of 24 unintended pregnancies per 1000 women per year with 12-month dispensing, or 583 unintended pregnancies averted annually. Expected cost savings with 12-month dispensing were sensitive to changes in the probability of OCP coverage gaps with 3-month dispensing, the probability of pregnancy during coverage gaps, and the proportion of pregnancies paid for by the VA. When simultaneously varying all variables across plausible ranges, the 12-month strategy was cost saving in 95.4% of model iterations. Conclusions and Relevance: Adoption of a 12-month OCP dispensing option is expected to produce substantial cost savings for the VA while better supporting reproductive autonomy and reducing unintended pregnancy among women veterans.

        "Combinatorial targeting of cancer bone metastasis using mRNA engineered stem cells. BACKGROUND: Bone metastases are common and devastating to cancer patients. Existing treatments do not specifically target the disease sites and are therefore ineffective and systemically toxic. Here we present a new strategy to treat bone metastasis by targeting both the cancer cells (\"the seed\"), and their surrounding niche (\"the soil\"), using stem cells engineered to home to the bone metastatic niche and to maximise local delivery of multiple therapeutic factors. METHODS: We used mesenchymal stem cells engineered using mRNA to simultaneously express P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1)/Sialyl-Lewis X (SLEX) (homing factors), and modified versions of cytosine deaminase (CD) and osteoprotegerin (OPG) (therapeutic factors) to target and treat breast cancer bone metastases in two mouse models, a xenograft intratibial model and a syngeneic model of spontaneous bone metastasis. FINDINGS: We first confirmed that MSC engineered using mRNA produced functional proteins (PSGL-1/SLEX, CD and OPG) using various in vitro assays. We then demonstrated that mRNA-engineered MSC exhibit enhanced homing to the bone metastatic niche likely through interactions between PSGL-1/SLEX and P-selectin expressed on tumour vasculature. In both the xenograft intratibial model and syngeneic model of spontaneous bone metastasis, engineered MSC can effectively kill tumour cells and preserve bone integrity. The engineered MSC also exhibited minimal toxicity in vivo, compared to its non-targeted chemotherapy counterpart (5-fluorouracil). INTERPRETATION: Our combinatorial targeting of both the cancer cells and the niche represents a simple, safe and effective way to treat metastatic bone diseases, otherwise difficult to manage with existing strategies. It can also be applied to other cell types (e.g., T cells) and cargos (e.g., genome editing components) to treat a broad range of cancer and other complex diseases.

        "Methylome and transcriptome maps of human visceral and subcutaneous adipocytes reveal key epigenetic differences at developmental genes. Adipocytes support key metabolic and endocrine functions of adipose tissue. Lipid is stored in two major classes of depots, namely visceral adipose (VA) and subcutaneous adipose (SA) depots. Increased visceral adiposity is associated with adverse health outcomes, whereas the impact of SA tissue is relatively metabolically benign. The precise molecular features associated with the functional differences between the adipose depots are still not well understood. Here, we characterised transcriptomes and methylomes of isolated adipocytes from matched SA and VA tissues of individuals with normal BMI to identify epigenetic differences and their contribution to cell type and depot-specific function. We found that DNA methylomes were notably distinct between different adipocyte depots and were associated with differential gene expression within pathways fundamental to adipocyte function. Most striking differential methylation was found at transcription factor and developmental genes. Our findings highlight the importance of developmental origins in the function of different fat depots. ",
        "Kratom Use and Toxicities in the United States. BACKGROUND: Kratom is an herbal supplement containing alkaloids with opioid properties. This review was conducted to determine toxicities associated with kratom use in the United States in order to provide insight into its safety as a dietary supplement. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective review of kratom exposures reported to the National Poison Data System to determine the toxicities associated with kratom use. We also reviewed records from a county medical examiner's office in New York State to identify kratom-associated fatalities. RESULTS: A total of 2312 kratom exposures were reported, with 935 cases involving kratom as the only substance. Kratom most commonly caused agitation (18.6%), tachycardia (16.9%), drowsiness (13.6%), vomiting (11.2%), and confusion (8.1%). Serious effects of seizure (6.1%), withdrawal (6.1%), hallucinations (4.8%), respiratory depression (2.8%), coma (2.3%), and cardiac or respiratory arrest (0.6%) were also reported. Kratom was listed as a cause or contributing factor in the death of four decedents identified by the county medical examiner's office. CONCLUSIONS: Kratom use is increasing and is associated with significant toxicities. Our findings suggest kratom is not reasonably expected to be safe and poses a public health threat due to its availability as an herbal supplement. ",
        "Electromigration of cell surface macromolecules in DC electric fields during cell polarization and galvanotaxis. DC electric fields (EFs) can often induce cellular polarity, and direct migration of cells toward one of the electrical poles. The mechanism(s) by which cells sense weak EFs is not established. We present here a molecular flux model to describe electromigration of plasma membrane macromolecules and compare its predictions to electromigration of a lipid-anchored surface protein, tdTomato-GPI, under different experimental conditions. Gradients of tdTomato-GPI are assembled based on its electrophoretic and electro-osmotic mobilities and collapsed by its own diffusion. The flux model predicts greatest cathodal accumulation for tdTomato-GPI under slightly acidic conditions, and weak cathodal accumulation under alkaline conditions. Predictions by the flux model align closely with measurements of the electromigration of tdTomato-GPI except at pH 6, the only condition examined in which the protein exhibits a net positive surface charge. We use the model to predict the time course and relative steady state concentration difference for asymmetric accumulation of other surface macromolecules based on their physical properties. We also describe a method for identifying the physical properties of the plasma membrane proteins in zebrafish keratocytes, in order to predict likely candidates for the electric field receptor in this model migratory system that exhibits cathodal galvanotaxis, and to predict the asymmetric distribution of proteins in other cell types. We provide a physical basis for predicting the dynamics of electromigration for numerous cell surface macromolecules and provide evidence for supporting the role of electromigration in directing cell polarity, migration and growth in response to weak EFs.

        "Optical flow sensor for continuous invasive measurement of blood flow velocity. Continuous monitoring of intrapulse measurement of blood flow in humans is currently not achievable with clinically available instruments. In this paper, we demonstrate a method of measuring the instantaneous variations in flow during pulsatile blood flow with an optical flow sensor comprising a fiber Bragg grating sensor and illumination from a 565\u2009nm Light-Emitting-Diode. The LED illumination heats the blood and fluctuations in temperature, due to variations in flow, are detected by the fiber sensor. A set of experiments at different flow rates (20 to 900\u2009mL/min) are performed in a simulated cardiac circulation setup with pulsatile flow. Data are compared with an in-line time of flight ultrasound flow sensor. Our results show that the optical and ultrasonic signals correlate with Pearson coefficients ranging from -0.83 to -0.98, dependent on the pulsatile frequency. Average flow determined by ultrasound and the optical fiber sensor showed a parabolic relationship with R2 = 0.99. An abrupt step change in flow induced by occlusion and release of the circuit tubing demonstrated that the optical fiber and ultrasound sensor had similar response. The method described is capable of intrapulse blood flow measurement under pulsatile flow conditions, with potential applications in medicine where continuous blood flow sensing is desired. ",
        "Small-Molecule Ferroptotic Agents with Potential to Selectively Target Cancer Stem Cells. Effective management of advanced cancer requires systemic treatment including small molecules that target unique features of aggressive tumor cells. At the same time, tumors are heterogeneous and current evidence suggests that a subpopulation of tumor cells, called tumor initiating or cancer stem cells, are responsible for metastatic dissemination, tumor relapse and possibly drug resistance. Classical apoptotic drugs are less effective against this critical subpopulation. In the course of generating a library of open-chain epothilones, we discovered a new class of small molecule anticancer agents that has no effect on tubulin but instead kills selected cancer cell lines by harnessing reactive oxygen species to induce ferroptosis. Interestingly, we find that drug sensitivity is highest in tumor cells with a mesenchymal phenotype. Furthermore, these compounds showed enhanced toxicity towards mesenchymal breast cancer populations with cancer stem cell properties in vitro. In summary, we have identified a new class of small molecule ferroptotic agents that warrant further investigation. ",
        "Effects of Nutritional Supplements and Dietary Interventions on Cardiovascular Outcomes: An Umbrella Review and Evidence Map. Background: The role of nutritional supplements and dietary interventions in preventing mortality and cardiovascular disease (CVD) outcomes is unclear. Purpose: To examine evidence about the effects of nutritional supplements and dietary interventions on mortality and cardiovascular outcomes in adults. Data Sources: PubMed, CINAHL, and the Cochrane Library from inception until March 2019; ClinicalTrials.gov (10 March 2019); journal Web sites; and reference lists. Study Selection: English-language, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and meta-analyses of RCTs that assessed the effects of nutritional supplements or dietary interventions on all-cause mortality or cardiovascular outcomes, such as death, myocardial infarction, stroke, and coronary heart disease. Data Extraction: Two independent investigators abstracted data, assessed the quality of evidence, and rated the certainty of evidence. Data Synthesis: Nine systematic reviews and 4 new RCTs were selected that encompassed a total of 277 trials, 24 interventions, and 992\u00a0129 participants. A total of 105 meta-analyses were generated. There was moderate-certainty evidence that reduced salt intake decreased the risk for all-cause mortality in normotensive participants (risk ratio [RR], 0.90 [95% CI, 0.85 to 0.95]) and cardiovascular mortality in hypertensive participants (RR, 0.67 [CI, 0.46 to 0.99]). Low-certainty evidence showed that omega-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid (LC-PUFA) was associated with reduced risk for myocardial infarction (RR, 0.92 [CI, 0.85 to 0.99]) and coronary heart disease (RR, 0.93 [CI, 0.89 to 0.98]). Folic acid was associated with lower risk for stroke (RR, 0.80 [CI, 0.67 to 0.96]; low certainty), whereas calcium plus vitamin D increased the risk for stroke (RR, 1.17 [CI, 1.05 to 1.30]; moderate certainty). Other nutritional supplements, such as vitamin B6, vitamin A, multivitamins, antioxidants, and iron and dietary interventions, such as reduced fat intake, had no significant effect on mortality or cardiovascular disease outcomes (very low- to moderate-certainty evidence). Limitations: Suboptimal quality and certainty of evidence. Conclusion: Reduced salt intake, omega-3 LC-PUFA use, and folate supplementation could reduce risk for some cardiovascular outcomes in adults. Combined calcium plus vitamin D might increase risk for stroke. Primary Funding Source: None. ",
        "Participation in local food projects is associated with better psychological well-being: evidence from the East of England. BACKGROUND: Studies suggest that local food may contribute to well-being, but do not use standardized measures, or control groups. METHODS: An online survey compared participants of local food initiatives (n = 302) with members of the general population (n = 157) in terms of scores on standardized measures of well-being and distress. Using hierarchical ordinary least squares regression models, we explored the relationship between participation and well-being via four mediators-nature connectedness, psychological need satisfaction, diet and physical activity. RESULTS: Participants scored higher than non-participants on life satisfaction (t(346) = 2.30, P = 0.02, \u03c1r = 0.12) and the WEMWBS scale (t(335) = 2.12, P = 0.04, \u03c1r = 0.10), but differences in psychological distress were insignificant. More actively engaged participants scored higher on positive well-being and longer duration participation was associated with higher life satisfaction and less psychological distress. Finally, we found that participation contributes to psychological need satisfaction, better diet and connection to nature, three known drivers of well-being. CONCLUSIONS: Well-being may be a co-benefit of local food initiatives beyond the physical and psychological benefits of growing food. Further research is needed to explore the mediators driving these effects, quantify benefits, and track impacts over time and across different social groups. ",
        "A Randomized Controlled Trial of Metacognitive Therapy for Depression: Analysis of 1-Year Follow-Up. This paper reports the 1-year follow-up results from a randomized controlled trial (RCT), which examined the efficacy of metacognitive therapy (MCT) for unipolar depression compared to a waiting condition. Thirty-nine patients with major depression were offered MCT and were divided into two conditions; immediate MCT with 10 weekly sessions or a waiting period that had a 10-week delayed MCT start. Two participants dropped out during the waiting condition. Thirty-four patients participated in the follow-up assessment. Based on the intent-to-treat sample and all patients, 67% were classified as recovered, 13% improved, and 20% were unchanged at 1-year follow-up. For the completers sample 73% recovered, 12% improved, and 15% were unchanged. Five of the 31 patients (13%) that were in remission at post-treatment experienced relapse at 1-year follow-up. Within-group effect sizes were large for reductions in symptoms of depression (d = 2.09) and anxiety (d = 1.16) at 1-year. Treatment response was associated with reductions in rumination, worry, and metacognitive beliefs as predicted by the metacognitive model, but reductions in metacognitions independently predicted reductions in depression scores from pre-treatment to 1-year follow-up. The results suggest that treatment gains are stable at 1-year follow-up. The study sets the stage for future research, which should evaluate MCT over a longer term and compare it with active treatments using suitably powered RCTs. ",
        "Cryo-EM structures reveal coordinated domain motions that govern DNA cleavage by Cas9. The RNA-guided Cas9 endonuclease from Streptococcus pyogenes is a single-turnover enzyme that displays a stable product state after double-stranded-DNA cleavage. Here, we present cryo-EM structures of precatalytic, postcatalytic and product states of the active Cas9-sgRNA-DNA complex in the presence of Mg2+. In the precatalytic state, Cas9 adopts the 'checkpoint' conformation with the HNH nuclease domain positioned far away from the DNA. Transition to the postcatalytic state involves a dramatic ~34-\u00c5 swing of the HNH domain and disorder of the REC2 recognition domain. The postcatalytic state captures the cleaved substrate bound to the catalytically competent HNH active site. In the product state, the HNH domain is disordered, REC2 returns to the precatalytic conformation, and additional interactions of REC3 and RuvC with nucleic acids are formed. The coupled domain motions and interactions between the enzyme and the RNA-DNA hybrid provide new insights into the mechanism of genome editing by Cas9. ",
        "The spatial chronnectome reveals a dynamic interplay between functional segregation and integration. The brain is highly dynamic, reorganizing its activity at different interacting spatial and temporal scales, including variation within and between brain networks. The chronnectome is a model of the brain in which nodal activity and connectivity patterns change in fundamental and recurring ways over time. Most literature assumes fixed spatial nodes/networks, ignoring the possibility that spatial nodes/networks may vary in time. Here, we introduce an approach to calculate a spatially fluid chronnectome (called the spatial chronnectome for clarity), which focuses on the variations of networks coupling at the voxel level, and identify a novel set of spatially dynamic features. Results reveal transient spatially fluid interactions between intra- and internetwork relationships in which brain networks transiently merge and separate, emphasizing dynamic segregation and integration. Brain networks also exhibit distinct spatial patterns with unique temporal characteristics, potentially explaining a broad spectrum of inconsistencies in previous studies that assumed static networks. Moreover, we show anticorrelative connections to brain networks are transient as opposed to constant across the entire scan. Preliminary assessments using a multi-site dataset reveal the ability of the approach to obtain new information and nuanced alterations that remain undetected during static analysis. Patients with schizophrenia (SZ) display transient decreases in voxel-wise network coupling within visual and auditory networks, and higher intradomain coupling variability. In summary, the spatial chronnectome represents a new direction of research enabling the study of functional networks which are transient at the voxel level, and the identification of mechanisms for within- and between-subject spatial variability.

        "Global phylogeography and ancient evolution of the widespread human gut virus crAssphage. Microbiomes are vast communities of microorganisms and viruses that populate all natural ecosystems. Viruses have been considered to be the most variable component of microbiomes, as supported by virome surveys and examples of high genomic mosaicism. However, recent evidence suggests that the human gut virome is remarkably stable compared with that of other environments. Here, we investigate the origin, evolution and epidemiology of crAssphage, a widespread human gut virus. Through a global collaboration, we obtained DNA sequences of crAssphage from more than one-third of the world's countries and showed that the phylogeography of crAssphage is locally clustered within countries, cities and individuals. We also found fully colinear crAssphage-like genomes in both Old-World and New-World primates, suggesting that the association of crAssphage with primates may be millions of years old. Finally, by exploiting a large cohort of more than 1,000 individuals, we tested whether crAssphage is associated with bacterial taxonomic groups of the gut microbiome, diverse human health parameters and a wide range of dietary factors. We identified strong correlations with different clades of bacteria that are related to Bacteroidetes and weak associations with several diet categories, but no significant association with health or disease. We conclude that crAssphage is a benign cosmopolitan virus that may have coevolved with the human lineage and is an integral part of the normal human gut virome. ",
        "Role of vitamin D in cell-cell interaction of fetal endothelial progenitor cells and umbilical cord endothelial cells in a preeclampsia-like model. Maternal endothelial dysfunction is a cental feature of preeclampsia (PE), a hypertensive disorder of pregnancy. Factors in the maternal circulation are thought to contribute to this endothelial dysfunction. Although understudied, factors in the fetal circulation may influence fetal endothelial cell interactions with endothelial progenitor cells as critical steps in placental angiogenesis. We hypothesize that cell-cell interactions that are important for pregnancy health are impaired by fetal serum from PE pregnancies and that 1,25(OH)2-vitamin D3 attenuates the negative effects of this serum on cell function. We tested the ability of fetal cord blood-derived endothelial progenitor cells [endothelial colony-forming cells (ECFCs)] to invade into established monolayers and capillary tubule-like structures of human fetal umbilical venous endothelial cells (HUVECs), while in the presence/absence of fetal cord serum from uncomplicated or PE pregnancies, and tested the ability of 1,25(OH)2-vitamin D3 to modulate the serum-mediated effects. PE cord serum reduced the invasion of fetal ECFCs into HUVEC monolayers or tubule networks. Vitamin D attenuated these effects of PE fetal serum on endothelial functional properties. Immunocytochemical studies revealed involvement of VE-cadherin contacts in interactions between ECFCs and mature fetal endothelial cells. PE cord serum reduces the ability of fetal endothelial progenitor cells to incorporate into fetal endothelial cell networks. Physiologic concentrations of vitamin D reverse these PE serum-mediated effects. These data appear consistent with lines of evidence that vitamin D has antipreeclampsia effects. ",
        "Family history of Alzheimer's disease alters cognition and is modified by medical and genetic factors. In humans, a first-degree family history of dementia (FH) is a well-documented risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD); however, the influence of FH on cognition across the lifespan is poorly understood. To address this issue, we developed an internet-based paired-associates learning (PAL) task and tested 59,571 participants between the ages of 18-85. FH was associated with lower PAL performance in both sexes under 65 years old. Modifiers of this effect of FH on PAL performance included age, sex, education, and diabetes. The Apolipoprotein E \u03b54 allele was also associated with lower PAL scores in FH positive individuals. Here we show, FH is associated with reduced PAL performance four decades before the typical onset of AD; additionally, several heritable and non-heritable modifiers of this effect were identified. ",
        "Divergent Auditory Nerve Encoding Deficits Between Two Common Etiologies of Sensorineural Hearing Loss. Speech intelligibility can vary dramatically between individuals with similar clinically defined severity of hearing loss based on the audiogram. These perceptual differences, despite equal audiometric-threshold elevation, are often assumed to reflect central-processing variations. Here, we compared peripheral-processing in auditory nerve (AN) fibers of male chinchillas between two prevalent hearing loss etiologies: metabolic hearing loss (MHL) and noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL). MHL results from age-related reduction of the endocochlear potential due to atrophy of the stria vascularis. MHL in the present study was induced using furosemide, which provides a validated model of age-related MHL in young animals by reversibly inhibiting the endocochlear potential. Effects of MHL on peripheral processing were assessed using Wiener-kernel (system identification) analyses of single AN fiber responses to broadband noise, for direct comparison to previously published AN responses from animals with NIHL. Wiener-kernel analyses show that even mild NIHL causes grossly abnormal coding of low-frequency stimulus components. In contrast, for MHL the same abnormal coding was only observed with moderate to severe loss. For equal sensitivity loss, coding impairment was substantially less severe with MHL than with NIHL, probably due to greater preservation of the tip-to-tail ratio of cochlear frequency tuning with MHL compared with NIHL rather than different intrinsic AN properties. Differences in peripheral neural coding between these two pathologies-the more severe of which, NIHL, is preventable-likely contribute to individual speech perception differences. Our results underscore the need to minimize noise overexposure and for strategies to personalize diagnosis and treatment for individuals with sensorineural hearing loss.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Differences in speech perception ability between individuals with similar clinically defined severity of hearing loss are often assumed to reflect central neural-processing differences. Here, we demonstrate for the first time that peripheral neural processing of complex sounds differs dramatically between the two most common etiologies of hearing loss. Greater processing impairment with noise-induced compared with an age-related (metabolic) hearing loss etiology may explain heightened speech perception difficulties in people overexposed to loud environments. These results highlight the need for public policies to prevent noise-induced hearing loss, an entirely avoidable hearing loss etiology, and for personalized strategies to diagnose and treat sensorineural hearing loss.

        "Vaccine-induced autoimmunity: the role of molecular mimicry and immune crossreaction. Since the early 1800s vaccines have saved numerous lives by preventing lethal infections. However, during the past two decades, there has been growing awareness of possible adverse events associated with vaccinations, cultivating heated debates and leading to significant fluctuations in vaccination rates. It is therefore pertinent for the scientific community to seriously address public concern of adverse effects of vaccines to regain public trust in these important medical interventions. Such adverse reactions to vaccines may be viewed as a result of the interaction between susceptibility of the vaccinated subject and various vaccine components. Among the implicated mechanisms for these reactions is molecular mimicry. Molecular mimicry refers to a significant similarity between certain pathogenic elements contained in the vaccine and specific human proteins. This similarity may lead to immune crossreactivity, wherein the reaction of the immune system towards the pathogenic antigens may harm the similar human proteins, essentially causing autoimmune disease. In this review, we address the concept of molecular mimicry and its application in explaining post vaccination autoimmune phenomena. We further review the principal examples of the influenza, hepatitis B, and human papilloma virus vaccines, all suspected to induce autoimmunity via molecular mimicry. Finally, we refer to possible implications on the potential future development of better, safer vaccines. ",
        "Race/Ethnicity and Neighborhood Characteristics Are Associated With Bystander Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation in Pediatric Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest in the United States: A Study From CARES. Background Whether racial and neighborhood characteristics are associated with bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation ( BCPR ) in pediatric out-of-hospital cardiac arrest ( OHCA ) is unknown. Methods and Results An analysis was conducted of CARES (Cardiac Arrest Registry to Enhance Survival) for pediatric nontraumatic OHCA s from 2013 to 2017. An index (range, 0-4) was created for each arrest based on neighborhood characteristics associated with low BCPR (>80% black; >10% unemployment; <80% high school; median income, <$50\u00a0000). The primary outcome was BCPR . BCPR occurred in 3399 of 7086 OHCA s (48%). Compared with white children, BCPR was less likely in other races/ethnicities (black: adjusted odds ratio [ aOR ], 0.59; 95% CI , 0.52-0.68; Hispanic: aOR , 0.78; 95% CI , 0.66-0.94; and other: aOR , 0.54; 95% CI , 0.40-0.72). Compared with arrests in neighborhoods with an index score of 0, BCPR occurred less commonly for arrests with an index score of 1 ( aOR , 0.80; 95% CI , 0.70-0.91), 2 ( aOR , 0.75; 95% CI , 0.65-0.86), 3 ( aOR , 0.52; 95% CI , 0.45-0.61), and 4 ( aOR , 0.46; 95% CI , 0.36-0.59). Black children had an incrementally lower likelihood of BCPR with increasing index score while white children had an overall similar likelihood at most scores. Black children with an index of 4 were approximately half as likely to receive BCPR compared with white children with a score of 0. Conclusions Racial and neighborhood characteristics are associated with BCPR in pediatric OHCA . Targeted CPR training for nonwhite, low-education, and low-income neighborhoods may increase BCPR and improve pediatric OHCA outcomes. ",
        "Mucosal-Associated Invariant T Cells Display Diminished Effector Capacity in Oesophageal Adenocarcinoma. Oesophageal adenocarcinoma (OAC) is an aggressive malignancy with poor prognosis, and incidence is increasing rapidly in the Western world. Mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells recognize bacterial metabolites and kill infected cells, yet their role in OAC is unknown. We aimed to elucidate the role of MAIT cells during cancer development by characterizing the frequency, phenotype, and function of MAIT cells in human blood and tissues, from OAC and its pre-malignant inflammatory condition Barrett's oesophagus (BO). Blood and tissues were phenotyped by flow cytometry and conditioned media from explanted tissue was used to model the effects of the tumor microenvironment on MAIT cell function. Associations were assessed between MAIT cell frequency, circulating inflammatory markers, and clinical parameters to elucidate the role of MAIT cells in inflammation driven cancer. MAIT cells were decreased in BO and OAC blood compared to healthy controls, but were increased in oesophageal tissues, compared to BO-adjacent tissue, and remained detectable after neo-adjuvant treatment. MAIT cells in tumors expressed CD8, PD-1, and NKG2A but lower NKG2D than BO cohorts. MAIT cells produced less IFN-\u03b3 and TNF-\u03b1 in the presence of tumor-conditioned media. OAC cell line viability was reduced upon exposure to expanded MAIT cells. Serum levels of chemokine IP-10 were inversely correlated with MAIT cell frequency in both tumors and blood. MAIT cells were higher in the tumors of node-negative patients, but were not significantly associated with other clinical parameters. This study demonstrates that OAC tumors are infiltrated by MAIT cells, a type of CD8 T cell featuring immune checkpoint expression and cytotoxic potential. These findings may have implications for immunotherapy and immune scoring approaches. ",

        "Quality of Chronic Kidney Disease Management in Canadian Primary Care. Importance: Although patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) are routinely managed in primary care settings, no nationally representative study has assessed the quality of care received by these patients in Canada. Objective: To evaluate the current state of CKD management in Canadian primary care practices to identify care gaps to guide development and implementation of national quality improvement initiatives. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cross-sectional study leveraged Canadian Primary Care Sentinel Surveillance Network data from January 1, 2010, to December 31, 2015, to develop a cohort of 46\u202f162 patients with CKD managed in primary care practices. Data analysis was performed from August 8, 2018, to July 31, 2019. Main Outcomes and Measures: The study examined the proportion of patients with CKD who met a set of 12 quality indicators in 6 domains: (1) detection and recognition of CKD, (2) testing and monitoring of kidney function, (3) use of recommended medications, (4) monitoring after initiation of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), (5) management of blood pressure, and (6) monitoring for glycemic control in those with diabetes and CKD. The study also analyzed associations of divergence from these quality indicators. Results: The cohort comprised 46\u202f162 patients (mean [SD] age, 69.2 [14.0] years; 25 855 [56.0%] female) with stage 3 to 5 CKD. Only 4 of 12 quality indicators were met by 75% or more of the study cohort. These indicators were receipt of an outpatient serum creatinine test within 18 months after confirmation of CKD, receipt of blood pressure measurement at any time during follow-up, achieving a target blood pressure of 140/90 mm Hg or lower, and receiving a hemoglobin A1c test for monitoring diabetes during follow-up. Indicators in the domains of detection and recognition of CKD, testing and monitoring of kidney function (specifically, urine albumin to creatinine ratio testing), use of recommended medications, and appropriate monitoring after initiation of treatment with ACEIs or ARBs were not met. Only 6529 patients (18.4%) with CKD received a urine albumin test within 6 months of CKD diagnosis, and 3954 (39.4%) had a second measurement within 6 months of an abnormal baseline urine albumin level. Older age (\u226585 years) and CKD stage 5 were significantly associated with not satisfying the criteria for the quality indicators across all domains. Across age categories, younger patients (aged 18-49 years) and older patients (\u226575 years) were less likely to be tested for albuminuria (314 of 1689 patients aged 18-49 years [18.5%], 1983 of 11 919 patients aged 75-84 years [61.6%], and 614 of 5237 patients aged \u226585 years [11.7%] received the urine albumin to creatinine ratio test within 6 months of initial estimated glomerular filtration rate <60 mL/min per 1.73 m2; P\u2009<\u2009.001). Patients aged 18 to 49 years were less commonly prescribed recommended medications (222 of 2881 [7.7%]), whereas patients aged 75 to 84 years were prescribed ACEIs or ARBs most frequently (2328 of 5262 [44.2%]; P\u2009<\u2009.001). Conclusions and Relevance: The findings suggest that management of CKD across primary care practices in Canada varies according to quality indicator. This study revealed potential priority areas for quality improvement initiatives in Canadian primary care practices. ",
        "Decreased maternal serum acetate and impaired fetal thymic and regulatory T cell development in preeclampsia. Maternal immune dysregulation seems to affect fetal or postnatal immune development. Preeclampsia is a pregnancy-associated disorder with an immune basis and is linked to atopic disorders in offspring. Here we show reduction of fetal thymic size, altered thymic architecture and reduced fetal thymic regulatory T (Treg) cell output in preeclamptic pregnancies, which persists up to 4 years of age in human offspring. In germ-free mice, fetal thymic CD4+ T cell and Treg cell development are compromised, but rescued by maternal supplementation with the intestinal bacterial metabolite short chain fatty acid (SCFA) acetate, which induces upregulation of the autoimmune regulator (AIRE), known to contribute to Treg cell generation. In our human cohorts, low maternal serum acetate is associated with subsequent preeclampsia, and correlates with serum acetate in the fetus. These findings suggest a potential role of acetate in the pathogenesis of preeclampsia and immune development in offspring. ",
        "Eteplirsen Treatment Attenuates Respiratory Decline in Ambulatory and Non-Ambulatory Patients with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy. BACKGROUND: Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) patients experience skeletal muscle degeneration, including respiratory muscles. Respiratory decline in glucocorticoid-treated DMD patients, measured by percent predicted forced vital capacity (FVC% p), is typically 5% annually in patients aged 10 to 18 years. OBJECTIVE: Evaluate the effects of eteplirsen on FVC% p annual change in 3 trials versus matched Cooperative International Neuromuscular Research Group Duchenne Natural History Study (CINRG DNHS) controls. METHODS: Eteplirsen studies 201/202 evaluated eligible ambulatory DMD patients for at least 4 years, study 204 evaluated primarily non-ambulatory DMD patients for 2 years, and ongoing study 301 is evaluating ambulatory DMD patients for 2 years (interim analysis is included). Eteplirsen-treated patients (n\u200a=\u200a74) were amenable to exon 51 skipping and were receiving glucocorticoids. Three CINRG DNHS cohorts included: glucocorticoid-treated patients amenable to exon 51 skipping (Exon 51 CINRG DNHS; n\u200a=\u200a20), all glucocorticoid-treated CINRG patients (All CINRG DNHS; n\u200a=\u200a172), and all glucocorticoid-treated genotyped CINRG DNHS patients (Genotyped CINRG DNHS; n\u200a=\u200a148). FVC% p assessments between ages 10 and\u200a<18 years were included for all patients; mixed-model analyses characterized FVC% p annual change. RESULTS: FVC% p annual change was greater for CINRG DNHS Exon 51 controls (- 6.00) versus patients in studies 201/202, study 204, and study 301 (- 2.19, P\u200a<\u200a0.001; - 3.66, P 0.004; and - 3.79, P 0.017, respectively). FVC% p annual change in all eteplirsen studies suggested treatment benefit compared with the Genotyped CINRG DNHS (- 5.67) and All CINRG DNHS (- 5.56) cohorts (P\u200a<\u200a0.05, all comparisons). CONCLUSIONS: Significant, clinically meaningful attenuation of FVC%p decline was observed in eteplirsen-treated patients versus CINRG DNHS controls. ",
        "Sharing of clinical trial data and results reporting practices among large pharmaceutical companies: cross sectional descriptive study and pilot of a tool to improve company practices. OBJECTIVES: To develop and pilot a tool to measure and improve pharmaceutical companies' clinical trial data sharing policies and practices. DESIGN: Cross sectional descriptive analysis. SETTING: Large pharmaceutical companies with novel drugs approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in 2015. DATA SOURCES: Data sharing measures were adapted from 10 prominent data sharing guidelines from expert bodies and refined through a multi-stakeholder deliberative process engaging patients, industry, academics, regulators, and others. Data sharing practices and policies were assessed using data from ClinicalTrials.gov, Drugs@FDA, corporate websites, data sharing platforms and registries (eg, the Yale Open Data Access (YODA) Project and Clinical Study Data Request (CSDR)), and personal communication with drug companies. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Company level, multicomponent measure of accessibility of participant level clinical trial data (eg, analysis ready dataset and metadata); drug and trial level measures of registration, results reporting, and publication; company level overall transparency rankings; and feasibility of the measures and ranking tool to improve company data sharing policies and practices. RESULTS: Only 25% of large pharmaceutical companies fully met the data sharing measure. The median company data sharing score was 63% (interquartile range 58-85%). Given feedback and a chance to improve their policies to meet this measure, three companies made amendments, raising the percentage of companies in full compliance to 33% and the median company data sharing score to 80% (73-100%). The most common reasons companies did not initially satisfy the data sharing measure were failure to share data by the specified deadline (75%) and failure to report the number and outcome of their data requests. Across new drug applications, a median of 100% (interquartile range 91-100%) of trials in patients were registered, 65% (36-96%) reported results, 45% (30-84%) were published, and 95% (69-100%) were publicly available in some form by six months after FDA drug approval. When examining results on the drug level, less than half (42%) of reviewed drugs had results for all their new drug applications trials in patients publicly available in some form by six months after FDA approval. CONCLUSIONS: It was feasible to develop a tool to measure data sharing policies and practices among large companies and have an impact in improving company practices. Among large companies, 25% made participant level trial data accessible to external investigators for new drug approvals in accordance with the current study's measures; this proportion improved to 33% after applying the ranking tool. Other measures of trial transparency were higher. Some companies, however, have substantial room for improvement on transparency and data sharing of clinical trials. ",
        "Observational analysis of disparities in obesity in children in the UK: Has Leeds bucked the trend?. BACKGROUND: The prevalence of obesity in childhood is of high concern, especially in deprived populations. We explored trends in obesity following the introduction of a citywide strategy focused on preschool children. METHODS: Analysis of obesity prevalence using the National Child Measurement Programme 2009 to 2017 for primary-school children in Leeds using 5-year aggregated data for Leeds, comparable cities, and England as a whole. RESULTS: Prevalence of obesity in Leeds for school entry children fell significantly (9.4% to 8.8%), whilst comparable cities (CC) and England as a whole showed no change (comparison of trends: P\u00a0<\u00a00.001 and P\u00a0<\u00a00.001). The reduction in Leeds was primarily in the most deprived (11.5% to 10.5%; trend comparison CC: P\u00a0<\u00a00.001, Eng: P\u00a0<\u00a00.001), but also amongst the affluent (6.8% to 6.0%; trend comparison CC: P\u00a0=\u00a00.087, Eng: P\u00a0=\u00a00.012). Prevalence in older children in Leeds was unchanged whilst it increased for comparable cities and England (trend comparison CC: P\u00a0<\u00a00.001, Eng: P\u00a0<\u00a00.001). In the deprived, obesity increased: Leeds by 1.4%; CC 1.3%, England 1% (trend comparison Eng: P\u00a0=\u00a00.004). In the affluent, obesity prevalence reduced more in Leeds than elsewhere: 2% in Leeds, 0.8% in CC, and 0.7% in England (trend comparison CC: P\u00a0<\u00a00.001, Eng: P\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.001). CONCLUSIONS: There has been a notable decrease in the prevalence of obesity especially amongst the most disadvantaged children at entry to primary school in Leeds. How this was achieved merits in-depth consideration. ",
        "An acquired scaffolding function of the DNAJ-PKAc fusion contributes to oncogenic signaling in fibrolamellar carcinoma. Fibrolamellar carcinoma (FLC) is a rare liver cancer. FLCs uniquely produce DNAJ-PKAc, a chimeric enzyme consisting of a chaperonin-binding domain fused to the C\u03b1 subunit of protein kinase A. Biochemical analyses of clinical samples reveal that a unique property of this fusion enzyme is the ability to recruit heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70). This cellular chaperonin is frequently up-regulated in cancers. Gene-editing of mouse hepatocytes generated disease-relevant AML12DNAJ-PKAc cell lines. Further analyses indicate that the proto-oncogene A-kinase anchoring protein-Lbc is up-regulated in FLC and functions to cluster DNAJ-PKAc/Hsp70 sub-complexes with a RAF-MEK-ERK kinase module. Drug screening reveals Hsp70 and MEK inhibitor combinations that selectively block proliferation of AML12DNAJ-PKAc cells. Phosphoproteomic profiling demonstrates that DNAJ-PKAc biases the signaling landscape toward ERK activation and engages downstream kinase cascades. Thus, the oncogenic action of DNAJ-PKAc involves an acquired scaffolding function that permits recruitment of Hsp70 and mobilization of local ERK signaling. ",
        "Activation of Rod Input in a Model of Retinal Degeneration Reverses Retinal Remodeling and Induces Formation of Functional Synapses and Recovery of Visual Signaling in the Adult Retina. A major cause of human blindness is the death of rod photoreceptors. As rods degenerate, synaptic structures between rod and rod bipolar cells disappear and the rod bipolar cells extend their dendrites and occasionally make aberrant contacts. Such changes are broadly observed in blinding disorders caused by photoreceptor cell death and are thought to occur in response to deafferentation. How the remodeled retinal circuit affects visual processing following rod rescue is not known. To address this question, we generated male and female transgenic mice wherein a disrupted cGMP-gated channel (CNG) gene can be repaired at the endogenous locus and at different stages of degeneration by tamoxifen-inducible cre-mediated recombination. In normal rods, light-induced closure of CNG channels leads to hyperpolarization of the cell, reducing neurotransmitter release at the synapse. Similarly, rods lacking CNG channels exhibit a resting membrane potential that was ~10 mV hyperpolarized compared to WT rods, indicating diminished glutamate release. Retinas from these mice undergo stereotypic retinal remodeling as a consequence of rod malfunction and degeneration. Upon tamoxifen-induced expression of CNG channels, rods recovered their structure and exhibited normal light responses. Moreover, we show that the adult mouse retina displays a surprising degree of plasticity upon activation of rod input. Wayward bipolar cell dendrites establish contact with rods to support normal synaptic transmission, which is propagated to the retinal ganglion cells. These findings demonstrate remarkable plasticity extending beyond the developmental period and support efforts to repair or replace defective rods in patients blinded by rod degeneration.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Current strategies for treatment of neurodegenerative disorders are focused on the repair of the primary affected cell type. However, the defective neurons function within a complex neural circuitry, which also becomes degraded during disease. It is not known whether rescued neurons and the remodeled circuit will establish communication to regain normal function. We show that the adult mammalian neural retina exhibits a surprising degree of plasticity following rescue of rod photoreceptors. The wayward dendrites of rod bipolar cells re-establish contact with rods to support normal synaptic transmission, which is propagated to the retinal ganglion cells. These findings support efforts to repair or replace defective rods in patients blinded by rod cell loss. ",
        "Does Disordered Sleep Moderate the Relationship Between Pain, Disability and Downstream Health Care Utilization in Patients With Low Back Pain?: A Longitudinal Cohort From the US Military Health System. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective cohort. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the influence of disordered sleep on the relationship between pain and health care utilization (HCU) and pain-related disability and HCU in individuals with low back pain (LBP). SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Disordered sleep and pain influence LBP outcomes, but their relationship with health care seeking after an episode of LBP has not been investigated and could help identify who is at risk for long-term medical care. METHODS: This study included patients with LBP participating in a self-management class at a large US military hospital between March 1, 2010 and December 4, 2012. Pain intensity, disability (Oswestry Disability Index), and sleepiness (Epworth Sleepiness Scale) were captured at baseline. Medical visits for a sleep disorder in the 12 months before the class and LBP-related healthcare utilization for the 12 months following the class were abstracted from the Military Health System Data Repository. Separate multivariate analyses evaluating pain intensity and disability as predictors of HCU were developed, with sleepiness and the presence of a sleep disorder as potential moderators. Analyses were adjusted for age, sex, history of back pain, and mental health comorbidities. RESULTS: A total of 757 consecutive participants were included, with 195 (26.8%) diagnosed with a subsequent sleep disorder. Sleepiness was not a significant predictor of HCU. The main effects of disability, pain intensity, and presence of a sleep disorder were significant across all analyses, with higher disability, pain intensity, and presence of a sleep disorder associated with higher predicted visits and costs for LBP. The presence of a sleep disorder was not a significant moderator in any model. CONCLUSION: Higher pain intensity and disability predicted higher pain-related HCU in the year following a LBP self-management class. The presence of a sleep disorder diagnosis, as recorded in medical records, had a significant independent effect on LBP-related health care visits and costs beyond the influences of pain intensity, disability, and other key demographic and health-related characteristics, but did not moderate these relationships.

        "Cryo-EM structure of the CFA/I pilus rod. Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) are common agents of diarrhea for travelers and a major cause of mortality in children in developing countries. To attach to intestinal cells ETEC express colonization factors, among them CFA/I, which are the most prevalent factors and are the archetypical representative of class 5 pili. The helical quaternary structure of CFA/I can be unwound under tensile force and it has been shown that this mechanical property helps bacteria to withstand shear forces from fluid motion. We report in this work the CFA/I pilus structure at 4.3\u2005\u00c5 resolution from electron cryomicroscopy (cryo-EM) data, and report details of the donor strand complementation. The CfaB pilins modeled into the cryo-EM map allow us to identify the buried surface area between subunits, and these regions are correlated to quaternary structural stability in class 5 and chaperone-usher pili. In addition, from the model built using the EM structure we also predicted that residue 13 (proline) of the N-terminal \u03b2-strand could have a major impact on the filament's structural stability. Therefore, we used optical tweezers to measure and compare the stability of the quaternary structure of wild type CFA/I and a point-mutated CFA/I with a propensity for unwinding. We found that pili with this mutated CFA/I require a lower force to unwind, supporting our hypothesis that Pro13 is important for structural stability. The high-resolution CFA/I pilus structure presented in this work and the analysis of structural stability will be useful for the development of novel antimicrobial drugs that target adhesion pili needed for initial attachment and sustained adhesion of ETEC.

        "Subclinical Cardiovascular Disease and Fall Risk in Older Adults: Results From the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study. BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Falls are frequent and often devastating events among older adults. Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is associated with greater fall risk; however, it is unknown if pathways that contribute to CVD, such as subclinical myocardial damage or wall strain, are related to future falls. We hypothesized that elevations in high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T (hs-cTnT) and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), measured in older adults, would be associated with greater fall risk. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study participants without known coronary heart disease, heart failure, or stroke. MEASUREMENTS: We measured hs-cTnT or NT-proBNP in 2011 to 2013. Falls were identified from hospital discharge International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9), codes or Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services claims. We used Poisson models adjusted for age, sex, and race/study center to quantify fall rates across approximate quartiles of hs-cTnT (less than 8, 8-10, 11-16, and 17\u2009or greater ng/L) and NT-proBNP (less than 75, 75-124, 125-274, and 275\u2009or greater pg/mL). We used Cox models to determine the association of cardiac markers with fall risk, adjusted for age, sex, race/center, and multiple fall risk factors. RESULTS: Among 3973 participants (mean age = 76\u2009\u00b1\u20095 years, 62% women, 22% black), 457 had a subsequent fall during a median follow-up of 4.5 years. Incidence rates across quartiles of hs-cTnT and NT-proBNP were 17.1, 20.0, 26.2, and 36.4 per 1000 person-years and 12.8, 22.2, 28.7, and 48.4 per 1000 person-years, respectively. Comparing highest vs lowest quartiles of either hs-cTnT or NT-proBNP demonstrated a greater than two-fold higher fall risk, with hazard ratios of 2.17 (95% confidence interval {CI} = 1.60-2.95) and 2.34 (95% CI = 1.73-3.16), respectively. In a joint model, the relationships of hs-cTnT and NT-proBNP with falls were significant and independent. CONCLUSION: Subclinical elevations of cardiac damage and wall strain were each associated with a higher fall risk in older adults. Further research is needed to determine whether interventions that lower hs-cTnT or NT-proBNP also lower fall risk. J Am Geriatr Soc 67:1795-1802, 2019. ",
        "The genome of cowpea (Vigna unguiculata [L.] Walp.). Cowpea (Vigna unguiculata [L.] Walp.) is a major crop for worldwide food and nutritional security, especially in sub-Saharan Africa, that is resilient to hot and drought-prone environments. An assembly of the single-haplotype inbred genome of cowpea IT97K-499-35 was developed by exploiting the synergies between single-molecule real-time sequencing, optical and genetic mapping, and an assembly reconciliation algorithm. A total of 519\u00a0Mb is included in the assembled sequences. Nearly half of the assembled sequence is composed of repetitive elements, which are enriched within recombination-poor pericentromeric regions. A comparative analysis of these elements suggests that genome size differences between Vigna species are mainly attributable to changes in the amount of Gypsy retrotransposons. Conversely, genes are more abundant in more distal, high-recombination regions of the chromosomes; there appears to be more duplication of genes within the NBS-LRR and the SAUR-like auxin superfamilies compared with other warm-season legumes that have been sequenced. A surprising outcome is the identification of an inversion of 4.2\u00a0Mb among landraces and cultivars, which includes a gene that has been associated in other plants with interactions with the parasitic weed Striga gesnerioides. The genome sequence facilitated the identification of a putative syntelog for multiple organ gigantism in legumes. A revised numbering system has been adopted for cowpea chromosomes based on synteny with common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris). An estimate of nuclear genome size of 640.6\u00a0Mbp based on cytometry is presented. ",
        "Examining the Association Between Electrodermal Activity and Problem Behavior in Severe Autism Spectrum Disorder: A Feasibility Study. Background: Many individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) engage in problem behavior, presenting significant challenges for those providing care and services for this population. Psychophysiological measures of arousal, such as electrodermal activity (EDA), may provide an early indication of subsequent problem behavior. However, variability in EDA patterns associated with behaviors may limit this predictive ability. Methods: EDA data was sampled from eight individuals with severe ASD in a naturalistic setting, while participating in educational programming in a school setting at a residential facility for severely affected individuals with developmental disabilities, to examine variability in EDA patterns. Results: An anticipatory rise in EDA only occurred 60% of the time prior to the problem behavior. Additionally, EDA after a problem behavior returned to median baseline levels only 45% of the time. Conclusions: Heterogeneity of EDA responses in those with the most severe forms of ASD will be an important consideration in future studies utilizing psychophysiological tools such as EDA to anticipate problem behavior, including the need for monitoring of return to baseline after problem behaviors. Incorporation of this consideration may lead to greater reliability of these approaches to help anticipate and manage problem behaviors. ",
        "Mitochondrial protein import is regulated by p17/PERMIT to mediate lipid metabolism and cellular stress. How lipid metabolism is regulated at the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM) for transducing stress signaling remains largely unknown. We show here that this process is controlled by trafficking of ceramide synthase 1 (CerS1) from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the OMM by a previously uncharacterized p17, which is now renamed protein that mediates ER-mitochondria trafficking (PERMIT). Data revealed that p17/PERMIT associates with newly translated CerS1 on the ER surface to mediate its trafficking to the OMM. Cellular stress induces Drp1 nitrosylation/activation, releasing p17/PERMIT to retrieve CerS1 for its OMM trafficking, resulting in mitochondrial ceramide generation, mitophagy and cell death. In vivo, CRISPR-Cas9-dependent genetic ablation of p17/PERMIT prevents acute stress-mediated CerS1 trafficking to OMM, attenuating mitophagy in p17/PERMIT-/- mice, compared to controls, in various metabolically active tissues, including brain, muscle, and pancreas. Thus, these data have implications in diseases associated with accumulation of damaged mitochondria such as cancer and/or neurodegeneration. ",
        "Human cytomegalovirus evades antibody-mediated immunity through endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation of the FcRn receptor. Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) can persistently infect humans, but how HCMV avoids humoral immunity is not clear. The neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) controls IgG transport from the mother to the fetus and prolongs IgG half-life. Here we show that US11 inhibits the assembly of FcRn with \u03b22m and retains FcRn in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), consequently blocking FcRn trafficking to the endosome. Furthermore, US11 recruits the ubiquitin enzymes Derlin-1, TMEM129 and UbE2J2 to engage FcRn, consequently initiating the dislocation of FcRn from the ER to the cytosol and facilitating its degradation. Importantly, US11 inhibits IgG-FcRn binding, resulting in a reduction of IgG transcytosis across intestinal or placental epithelial cells and IgG degradation in endothelial cells. Hence, these results identify the mechanism by which HCMV infection exploits an ER-associated degradation pathway through US11 to disable FcRn functions. These results have implications for vaccine development and immune surveillance. ",
        "Reduction in Drinking was Associated With Improved Clinical Outcomes in Women With HIV Infection and Unhealthy Alcohol Use: Results From a Randomized Clinical Trial of Oral Naltrexone Versus Placebo. BACKGROUND: Alcohol consumption is associated with poor health outcomes in women living with HIV (WLWH), but whether medication can help to reduce drinking in non-treatment-seeking women or whether reduction in drinking improves HIV outcomes is unclear. We conducted a randomized clinical trial (RCT) of daily oral naltrexone (50\u00a0mg) versus placebo in WLWH who met criteria for current unhealthy alcohol use. METHODS: WLWH with current unhealthy alcohol use (>7\u00a0drinks/wk or >3\u00a0drinks/occasion) were randomly assigned to daily oral naltrexone 50\u00a0mg (n\u00a0=\u00a096) or placebo (n\u00a0=\u00a098) for 4\u00a0months. Drinking outcomes, including the proportion of women who reduced (<unhealthy use criteria) or quit drinking, were assessed at baseline, 2\u00a0months, 4\u00a0months (end of treatment), and 7\u00a0months. In a secondary analysis, HIV viral suppression and changes in CD4 counts were compared in women who did or did not reduce/quit drinking, regardless of intervention assignment. RESULTS: The participants' mean age was 48\u00a0years, 86% were African American, and 94% were receiving HIV antiretroviral therapy. Among all participants, 89% and 85% completed the 4-month and 7-month follow-ups, respectively. Participants in both groups substantially reduced drinking over time. At 1 and 3\u00a0months, naltrexone was associated with a greater reduction in drinking (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05), but the proportion who reduced/quit drinking at 4\u00a0months (52% vs. 45%, p\u00a0=\u00a00.36) or 7\u00a0months (64% in both groups) was not different. HIV viral suppression at follow-up was significantly better in participants who reduced/quit drinking versus those continuing unhealthy alcohol use at 4\u00a0months (72% vs. 53%, p\u00a0=\u00a00.02) and 7\u00a0months (74% vs. 54%, p\u00a0=\u00a00.02). CONCLUSIONS: Participating in an RCT to reduce drinking was associated with significant drinking reduction regardless of medication assignment, suggesting that nonmedication aspects of research study participation (e.g., repeated assessments and support from research staff) could be important interventions to help reduce drinking outside of research studies. Drinking reduction was associated with improved HIV viral suppression, providing evidence to support recommendations to avoid unhealthy alcohol use among WLWH. ",
        "Botulinum toxin for chronic pelvic pain in women with endometriosis: a cohort study of a pain-focused treatment. BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Many women with endometriosis continue to have pelvic pain despite optimal surgical and hormonal treatment; some also have palpable pelvic floor muscle spasm. We describe changes in pain, spasm, and disability after pelvic muscle onabotulinumtoxinA injection in women with endometriosis-associated pelvic pain, a specific population not addressed in prior pelvic pain studies on botulinum toxin. METHODS: We present an open-label proof-of-concept case series of women with surgically diagnosed endometriosis. Under conscious sedation and with topical anesthetic, 100 units of onabotulinumtoxinA was injected transvaginally into pelvic floor muscle spasm areas under electromyography guidance. Changes in pain intensity, muscle spasm, disability, and pain medication use were assessed at periodic visits for up to 1 year after injection. RESULTS: Thirteen women underwent botulinum toxin injection and were followed for at least 4 months. Before injection, 11 of the 13 women had spasm in >4/6 assessed pelvic muscles and reported moderate pain (median visual analog scale (VAS): 5/10; range: 2-7). By 4-8 weeks after injection, spasm was absent/less widespread (\u22643 muscles) in all (p=0.0005). Eleven rated their postinjection pain as absent/mild (median VAS: 2; range: 0-5; p<0.0001); 7/13 reduced pain medication. Disability decreased in 6/8 women with at least moderate preinjection disability (p=0.0033). Relief lasted 5-11 months in 7 of the 11 patients followed for up to 1 year. Adverse events were mild and transient. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest pelvic floor spasm may be a major contributor to endometriosis-associated pelvic pain. Botulinum toxin injection may provide meaningful relief of pain and associated disability. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT01553201. ",
        "A human liver cell atlas reveals heterogeneity and epithelial progenitors. The human liver is an essential multifunctional organ. The incidence of liver diseases is rising and there are limited treatment options. However, the cellular composition of the liver remains poorly understood. Here we performed single-cell RNA sequencing of about 10,000 cells from normal liver tissue from nine human donors to construct a human liver cell atlas. Our analysis identified previously unknown subtypes of endothelial cells, Kupffer cells, and hepatocytes, with transcriptome-wide zonation of some of these populations. We show that the EPCAM+ population is heterogeneous, comprising hepatocyte-biased and cholangiocyte populations as well as a TROP2int progenitor population with strong potential to form bipotent liver organoids. As a proof-of-principle, we used our atlas to unravel the phenotypic changes that occur in hepatocellular carcinoma cells and in human hepatocytes and liver endothelial cells engrafted into a mouse liver. Our human liver cell atlas provides a powerful resource to enable the discovery of previously unknown cell types in normal and diseased livers. ",
        "Nutritional Lifestyle Intervention in Obese Pregnant Women, Including Lower Carbohydrate Intake, Is Associated With Increased Maternal Free Fatty Acids, 3-\u03b2-Hydroxybutyrate, and Fasting Glucose Concentrations: A Secondary Factorial Analysis of the European Multicenter, Randomized Controlled DALI Lifestyle Intervention Trial. OBJECTIVE: In our randomized controlled trial, we investigated the impact of healthy eating (HE) aiming for restricted gestational weight gain (GWG) and physical activity (PA) interventions on maternal and neonatal lipid metabolism. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Obese pregnant women (n = 436) were included before 20 weeks' gestation and underwent glucose testing (oral glucose tolerance test) and lipid profiling at baseline and 24-28 and 35-37 gestational weeks after an at least 10-h overnight fast. This secondary analysis had a factorial design with comparison of HE (n = 221) versus no HE (n = 215) and PA (n = 218) versus no PA (n = 218). Maternal changes in triglycerides (TG), LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, free fatty acids (FFAs), and leptin from baseline to end of pregnancy and neonatal outcomes were analyzed using general linear models with adjustment for relevant parameters. RESULTS: At 24-28 weeks' gestation, FFAs (mean \u00b1 SD, 0.60 \u00b1 0.19 vs. 0.55 \u00b1 0.17 mmol/L, P < 0.01) were increased after adjustment for FFA at baseline, maternal age, BMI at time of examination, gestational week, insulin resistance, self-reported food intake, self-reported physical activity, and maternal smoking, and GWG was lower (3.3 \u00b1 2.6 vs. 4.3 \u00b1 2.8 kg, P < 0.001, adjusted mean differences -1.0 [95% CI -1.5; -0.5]) in HE versus no HE. Fasting glucose levels (4.7 \u00b1 0.4 vs. 4.6 \u00b1 0.4 mmol/L, P < 0.05) and 3-\u03b2-hydroxybutyrate (3BHB) (0.082 \u00b1 0.065 vs. 0.068 \u00b1 0.067 mmol/L, P < 0.05) were higher in HE. Significant negative associations between carbohydrate intake and FFA, 3BHB, and fasting glucose at 24-28 weeks' gestation were observed. No differences between groups were found in oral glucose tolerance test or leptin or TG levels at any time. Furthermore, in PA versus no PA, no similar changes were found. In cord blood, elevated FFA levels were found in HE after full adjustment (0.34 \u00b1 0.22 vs. 0.29 \u00b1 0.16 mmol/L, P = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: HE intervention was associated with reduced GWG, higher FFAs, higher 3BHB, and higher fasting glucose at 24-28 weeks of gestation, suggesting induction of lipolysis. Increased FFA was negatively associated with carbohydrate intake and was also observed in cord blood. These findings support the hypothesis that maternal antenatal dietary restriction including carbohydrates is associated with increased FFA mobilization. ",
        "Population density and water balance influence the global occurrence of hepatitis E epidemics. In developing countries, the waterborne transmission of hepatitis E virus (HEV), caused by HEV genotypes 1 (HEV-1) and 2 (HEV-2), leads to the onset of large recurrent outbreaks. HEV infections are of particular concern among pregnant women, due to very high mortality rates (up to 70%). Unfortunately, good understanding of the factors that trigger the occurrence of HEV epidemics is currently lacking; therefore, anticipating the onset of an outbreak is yet not possible. In order to map the geographical regions at higher risk of HEV epidemics and the conditions most favorable for the transmission of the virus, we compiled a dataset of HEV waterborne outbreaks and used it to obtain models of geographical suitability for HEV across the planet. The main three variables that best predict the geographical distribution of HEV outbreaks at global scale are population density, annual potential evapotranspiration and precipitation seasonality. At a regional scale, the temporal occurrence of HEV outbreaks in the Ganges watershed is negatively correlated with the discharge of the river (r\u2009=\u2009-0.77). Combined, our findings suggest that ultimately, population density and water balance are main parameters influencing the occurrence of HEV-1 and HEV-2 outbreaks. This study expands the current understanding of the combination of factors shaping the biogeography and seasonality of waterborne viral pathogens such as HEV-1 and HEV-2, and contributes to developing novel concepts for the prediction and control of human waterborne viruses in the near future.

        "C-Reactive Protein Testing to Guide Antibiotic Prescribing for COPD Exacerbations. BACKGROUND: Point-of-care testing of C-reactive protein (CRP) may be a way to reduce unnecessary use of antibiotics without harming patients who have acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). METHODS: We performed a multicenter, open-label, randomized, controlled trial involving patients with a diagnosis of COPD in their primary care clinical record who consulted a clinician at 1 of 86 general medical practices in England and Wales for an acute exacerbation of COPD. The patients were assigned to receive usual care guided by CRP point-of-care testing (CRP-guided group) or usual care alone (usual-care group). The primary outcomes were patient-reported use of antibiotics for acute exacerbations of COPD within 4 weeks after randomization (to show superiority) and COPD-related health status at 2 weeks after randomization, as measured by the Clinical COPD Questionnaire, a 10-item scale with scores ranging from 0 (very good COPD health status) to 6 (extremely poor COPD health status) (to show noninferiority). RESULTS: A total of 653 patients underwent randomization. Fewer patients in the CRP-guided group reported antibiotic use than in the usual-care group (57.0% vs. 77.4%; adjusted odds ratio, 0.31; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.20 to 0.47). The adjusted mean difference in the total score on the Clinical COPD Questionnaire at 2 weeks was -0.19 points (two-sided 90% CI, -0.33 to -0.05) in favor of the CRP-guided group. The antibiotic prescribing decisions made by clinicians at the initial consultation were ascertained for all but 1 patient, and antibiotic prescriptions issued over the first 4 weeks of follow-up were ascertained for 96.9% of the patients. A lower percentage of patients in the CRP-guided group than in the usual-care group received an antibiotic prescription at the initial consultation (47.7% vs. 69.7%, for a difference of 22.0 percentage points; adjusted odds ratio, 0.31; 95% CI, 0.21 to 0.45) and during the first 4 weeks of follow-up (59.1% vs. 79.7%, for a difference of 20.6 percentage points; adjusted odds ratio, 0.30; 95% CI, 0.20 to 0.46). Two patients in the usual-care group died within 4 weeks after randomization from causes considered by the investigators to be unrelated to trial participation. CONCLUSIONS: CRP-guided prescribing of antibiotics for exacerbations of COPD in primary care clinics resulted in a lower percentage of patients who reported antibiotic use and who received antibiotic prescriptions from clinicians, with no evidence of harm.

        "Neurocognitive Function and Head Impact Burden over Two Seasons of Youth Tackle Football. This prospective cohort study sought to determine the association of repetitive sub-concussive head impacts with neurocognitive outcomes in youth tackle football players. The study sample included 166 youth tackle football players over two seasons: 70 primary school players ages 9-12 and 96 high school players ages 15-18. Helmet-based sensors recorded head impacts during practices and games, and impacts were summed to provide a cumulative measure of impact for each season. Participants also were stratified by \"high intensity\" and \"low intensity\" groups based on whether they sustained high or low g-force impacts. Participants completed assessments on a variety of neurologic, cognitive, and behavioral outcomes before and after each football season. In the subgroup of 55 players who participated in both seasons, the average combined cumulative impact for primary school and high school players was 7127 (standard deviation [SD] 4670) and 6558 (SD 4438) g-forces, respectively. Neither cumulative impact nor impact intensity predicted change scores from pre-season 1 to post-season 2 on any outcome measures. Instead, younger age group and history of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) predicted worse change scores on several cognitive measures and an ADHD symptom reporting scale. In the full 166-player cohort, a computerized test of processing speed declined over time, while the remaining 22 outcome measures either did not change or improved over time. Minimal changes were observed in neurocognitive outcomes associated with participation in youth tackle football over the course of two seasons, and there was no correlation with the number and severity of head impacts sustained over that time. However, longer prospective follow-up times will be beneficial. ",
        "A Multifaceted Intervention Improves Prescribing for Acute Respiratory Infection for Adults and Children in Emergency Department and Urgent Care Settings. BACKGROUND: Antibiotics are commonly prescribed during emergency department (ED) and urgent care center (UCC) visits for viral acute respiratory infection (ARI). We evaluate the comparative effectiveness of an antibiotic stewardship intervention adapted for acute care ambulatory settings (adapted intervention) to a stewardship intervention that additionally incorporates behavioral nudges (enhanced intervention) in reducing inappropriate prescriptions. METHODS: This study was a pragmatic, cluster-randomized clinical trial conducted in three academic health systems comprising five adult and pediatric EDs and four UCCs. Randomization of the nine sites was stratified by health system; all providers at each site received either the adapted or the enhanced intervention. The main outcome was the proportion of antibiotic-inappropriate ARI diagnosis visits that received an outpatient antibiotic prescription by individual providers. We estimated a hierarchical mixed-effects logistic regression model comparing visits during the influenza season for 2016 to 2017 (baseline) and 2017 to 2018 (intervention). RESULTS: There were 44,820 ARI visits among 292 providers across all nine cluster sites. Antibiotic prescribing for ARI visits dropped from 6.2% (95% confidence interval [CI]\u00a0= 4.5% to 7.9%) to 2.4% (95% CI\u00a0= 1.3% to 3.4%) during the study period. We found a significant reduction in inappropriate prescribing after adjusting for health-system and provider-level effects from 2.2% (95% CI\u00a0= 1.0% to 3.4%) to 1.5% (95% CI\u00a0= 0.7% to 2.3%) with an odds ratio of 0.67 (95% CI\u00a0= 0.54 to 0.82). Difference-in-differences between the two interventions was not significantly different. CONCLUSION: Implementation of antibiotic stewardship for ARI is feasible and effective in the ED and UCC settings. More intensive behavioral nudging methods were not more effective in high-performance settings. ",
        "Molecular optical imaging probes for early diagnosis of drug-induced acute kidney injury. Drug-induced acute kidney injury (AKI) with a high morbidity and mortality is poorly diagnosed in hospitals and deficiently evaluated in drug discovery. Here, we report the development of molecular renal probes (MRPs) with high renal clearance efficiency for in vivo optical imaging of drug-induced AKI. MRPs specifically activate their near-infrared fluorescence or chemiluminescence signals towards the prodromal biomarkers of AKI including the superoxide anion, N-acetyl-\u03b2-D-glucosaminidase and caspase-3, enabling an example of longitudinal imaging of multiple molecular events in the kidneys of living mice. Importantly, they in situ report the sequential occurrence of oxidative stress, lysosomal damage and cellular apoptosis, which precedes clinical manifestation of AKI (decreased glomerular filtration). Such an active imaging mechanism allows MRPs to non-invasively detect the onset of cisplatin-induced AKI at least 36\u2009h earlier than the existing imaging methods. MRPs can also act as exogenous tracers for optical urinalysis that outperforms typical clinical/preclinical assays, demonstrating their clinical promise for early diagnosis of AKI. ",
        "Epigenetic dynamics in infancy and the impact of maternal engagement. The contribution of nature versus nurture to the development of human behavior has been debated for centuries. Here, we offer a piece to this complex puzzle by identifying the human endogenous oxytocin system-known for its critical role in mammalian sociality-as a system sensitive to its early environment and subject to epigenetic change. Recent animal work suggests that early parental care is associated with changes in DNA methylation of conserved regulatory sites within the oxytocin receptor gene (OXTRm). Through dyadic modeling of behavior and OXTRm status across the first year and a half of life, we translated these findings to 101 human mother-infant dyads. We show that OXTRm is dynamic in infancy and its change is predicted by maternal engagement and reflective of behavioral temperament. We provide evidence for an early window of environmental epigenetic regulation of the oxytocin system, facilitating the emergence of individual differences in human behavior. ",
        "The utility of robotic assisted pancreas transplants - a single center retrospective study. The prevalence of obesity within the diabetic population is on the rise. This development poses unique challenges for pancreas transplantation candidates as obese individuals are often denied access to transplant. The introduction of robotic approach to transplant has been shown to improve outcomes in obese patients. A single center retrospective review of pancreas transplant cases over a 4-year period ending December 2018 was performed. Patients undergoing robotic surgery were compared to their counterparts undergoing open transplant. 49 patients (10 robot, 39 open) received pancreas transplants over the study period. Mean age was 43.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a07.5 vs. 42.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a09.7\u00a0years. There were no significant differences in demographics except body mass index (33.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.2 vs. 27.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.6, P\u00a0=\u00a00.005). Operative duration (7.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.6 vs. 5.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.4, P\u00a0<\u00a00.001), and warm ischemia times [45.5 (IQR: 13.7) vs. 33 (7), P\u00a0<\u00a00.001] were longer in the robotic arm. There were no wound complications in the robotic approach patients. Graft (100% vs. 88%, P\u00a0=\u00a00.37) and patient survival (100% vs. 100%, P\u00a0=\u00a00.72) after 1\u00a0year were similar. Our findings suggest that robotic pancreas is both safe and effective in obese diabetic patients, without added risk of wound complications. Wide adoption of the technique is encouraged while long term follow-up of our recipients is awaited. ",
        "Noncoding deletions reveal a gene that is critical for intestinal function. Large-scale genome sequencing is poised to provide a substantial increase in the rate of discovery of disease-associated mutations, but the functional interpretation of such mutations remains challenging. Here we show that deletions of a sequence on human chromosome 16 that we term the intestine-critical region (ICR) cause intractable congenital diarrhoea in infants1,2. Reporter assays in transgenic mice show that the ICR contains a regulatory sequence that activates transcription during the development of the gastrointestinal system. Targeted deletion of the ICR in mice caused symptoms that recapitulated the human condition. Transcriptome analysis revealed that an unannotated open reading frame (Percc1) flanks the regulatory sequence, and the expression of this gene was lost in the developing gut of mice that lacked the ICR. Percc1-knockout mice displayed phenotypes similar to those observed upon ICR deletion in mice and patients, whereas an ICR-driven Percc1 transgene was sufficient to rescue the phenotypes found in mice that lacked the ICR. Together, our results identify a gene that is critical for intestinal function and underscore the need for targeted in vivo studies to interpret the growing number of clinical genetic findings that do not affect known protein-coding genes.

        "Neural Cell Responses Upon Exposure to Human Endogenous Retroviruses. Human endogenous retroviruses (HERVs) are ancient retroviral elements, which invaded the human germ line several million years ago. Subsequent retrotransposition events amplified these sequences, resulting in approximately 8% of the human genome being composed of HERV sequences today. These genetic elements, normally dormant within human genomes, can be (re)-activated by environmental factors such as infections with other viruses, leading to the expression of viral proteins and, in some instances, even to viral particle production. Several studies have shown that the expression of these retroviral elements correlates with the onset and progression of neurological diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Further studies provided evidence on additional roles for HERVs in schizophrenia (SCZ). Since these diseases are still not well understood, HERVs might constitute a new category of pathogenic components that could significantly change our understanding of these pathologies. Moreover, knowledge about their mode of action might also help to develop novel and more powerful approaches for the treatment of these complex diseases. Therefore, the main scope of this review is a description of the current knowledge on the involvement of HERV-W and HERV-K in neurological disease specifically focusing on the effects they exert on neural cells of the central nervous system.

        "Mechanisms of Progression of Myeloid Preleukemia to Transformed Myeloid Leukemia in Children with Down Syndrome. Myeloid leukemia in Down syndrome (ML-DS) clonally evolves from transient abnormal myelopoiesis (TAM), a preleukemic condition in DS newborns. To define mechanisms of leukemic transformation, we combined exome and targeted resequencing of 111 TAM and 141 ML-DS samples with functional analyses. TAM requires trisomy 21 and truncating mutations in GATA1; additional TAM variants are usually not pathogenic. By contrast, in ML-DS, clonal and subclonal variants are functionally required. We identified a recurrent and oncogenic hotspot gain-of-function mutation in myeloid cytokine receptor CSF2RB. By a multiplex CRISPR/Cas9 screen in an in\u00a0vivo murine TAM model, we tested loss-of-function of 22 recurrently mutated ML-DS genes. Loss of 18 different genes produced leukemias that phenotypically, genetically, and transcriptionally mirrored ML-DS. ",
        "Oncogene Amplification in Growth Factor Signaling Pathways Renders Cancers Dependent on Membrane Lipid Remodeling. Advances in DNA sequencing technologies have reshaped our understanding of the molecular basis of cancer, providing a precise genomic view of tumors. Complementary biochemical and biophysical perspectives of cancer point toward profound shifts in nutrient uptake and utilization that propel tumor growth and major changes in the structure of the plasma membrane of tumor cells. The molecular mechanisms that bridge these fundamental aspects of tumor biology remain poorly understood. Here, we show that the lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase LPCAT1 functionally links specific genetic alterations in cancer with aberrant metabolism and plasma membrane remodeling to drive tumor growth. Growth factor receptor-driven cancers are found to depend on LPCAT1 to shape plasma membrane composition through enhanced saturated phosphatidylcholine content that is, in turn, required for the transduction of oncogenic signals. These results point to a genotype-informed strategy that prioritizes lipid remodeling pathways as therapeutic targets for diverse cancers. ",
        "The overuse of radioactive iodine in low-risk papillary thyroid cancer patients. BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to use current American Thyroid Association (ATA) management guidelines to identify groups who might be at risk of overtreatment with radioactive iodine (RAI) ablation after surgery for low-risk papillary thyroid cancer (PTC). METHODS: PTC patients were identified using the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results database. Characteristics of low-risk patients (defined as T1 without metastasis) were compared to those not low-risk. Predictors of receiving RAI for low-risk disease were determined using logistic regression. RESULTS: Of 32,229 cases, 17,286 (53.6%) were low-risk. Low-risk patients, compared to others, were older (mean age 51.3 versus 48.5 years), and more often female (81.6% versus 71.7%), white (69.7% versus 62.0%), and insured (87.6% versus 85.6%)(all p-values\u202f<\u202f0.001). Nearly 25% of low-risk patients received RAI. Predictors of overtreatment with RAI included age <45 years (OR: 1.393; 95% CI: 1.250-1.552), age 45-64 years (OR: 1.275; 95% CI: 1.152-1.412), male sex (OR: 1.191; 95% CI: 1.086-1.305), Hispanic (OR: 1.236; 95% CI: 1.110-1.376) and Asian (OR: 1.306; 95% CI: 1.159-1.473) race, and extensive lymphadenectomy (OR: 1.243; 95% CI: 1.119-1.381). CONCLUSION: Low-risk PTC patients were more likely to receive post-surgical RAI when not indicated under ATA guidelines if they were younger, male, Hispanic or Asian, or underwent extensive lymph node surgery. Identification of groups at risk for overtreatment can help impact practice patterns and improve the effective utilization of healthcare resources. ",
        "Notum produced by Paneth cells attenuates regeneration of aged intestinal epithelium. A decline in stem cell function impairs tissue regeneration during ageing, but the role of the stem-cell-supporting niche in ageing is not well understood. The small intestine is maintained by actively cycling intestinal stem cells that are regulated by the Paneth cell niche1,2. Here we show that the regenerative potential of human and mouse intestinal epithelium diminishes with age owing to defects in both stem cells and their niche. The functional decline was caused by a decrease in stemness-maintaining Wnt signalling due to production of Notum, an extracellular Wnt inhibitor, in aged Paneth cells. Mechanistically, high activity of\u00a0mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) in aged Paneth cells inhibits\u00a0activity of peroxisome proliferator activated receptor \u03b1 (PPAR-\u03b1)3, and lowered PPAR-\u03b1 activity increased Notum expression. Genetic targeting of Notum or Wnt supplementation restored function of aged intestinal organoids. Moreover, pharmacological inhibition of Notum in mice enhanced the regenerative capacity of aged stem cells and promoted recovery from chemotherapy-induced damage. Our results reveal a role of the stem cell niche in ageing and demonstrate that targeting of Notum can promote regeneration of aged tissues. ",
        "Determining clinically meaningful decline in preclinical Alzheimer disease. OBJECTIVE: To determine the time required for a preclinical Alzheimer disease population to decline in a meaningful way, use estimates of decline to update previous clinical trial design assumptions, and identify factors that modify \u03b2-amyloid (A\u03b2)-related decline. METHODS: In 1,120 cognitively unimpaired individuals from 3 international cohorts, we estimated the relationship between A\u03b2 status and longitudinal changes across multiple cognitive domains and assessed interactions between A\u03b2 and baseline factors. Power analyses were performed to explore sample size as a function of treatment effect. RESULTS: Cognitively unimpaired A\u03b2+ participants approach mild cognitive impairment (MCI) levels of performance 6 years after baseline, on average. Achieving 80% power in a simulated 4-year treatment trial, assuming a 25% treatment effect, required 2,000 participants/group. Multiple factors interacted with A\u03b2 to predict cognitive decline; however, these findings were all cohort-specific. Despite design differences across the cohorts, with large sample sizes and sufficient follow-up time, the A\u03b2+ groups declined consistently on cognitive composite measures. CONCLUSIONS: A preclinical AD population declines to the cognitive performance of an early MCI population in 6 years. Slowing this rate of decline by 40%-50% delays clinically relevant impairment by 3 years-a potentially meaningful treatment effect. However, assuming a 40%-50% drug effect highlights the difficulties in preclinical AD trial design, as a more commonly assumed treatment effect of 25% results in a required sample size of 2,000/group. Designers of preclinical AD treatment trials need to prepare for larger and longer trials than are currently being considered. Interactions with A\u03b2 status were inconsistent and not readily generalizable. ",
        "TREM2 Acts Downstream of CD33 in Modulating Microglial Pathology in Alzheimer's Disease. The microglial receptors CD33 and TREM2 have been associated with risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here, we investigated crosstalk between CD33 and TREM2. We showed that knockout of CD33 attenuated amyloid beta (A\u03b2) pathology and improved cognition in 5xFAD mice, both of which were abrogated by additional TREM2 knockout. Knocking out TREM2 in 5xFAD mice exacerbated A\u03b2 pathology and neurodegeneration but reduced Iba1+ cell numbers, all of which could not be rescued by additional CD33 knockout. RNA-seq profiling of microglia revealed that genes related to phagocytosis and signaling (IL-6, IL-8, acute phase response) are upregulated in 5xFAD;CD33-/- and downregulated in 5xFAD;TREM2-/- mice. Differential gene expression in 5xFAD;CD33-/- microglia depended on the presence of TREM2, suggesting TREM2 acts downstream of CD33. Crosstalk between CD33 and TREM2 includes regulation of the IL-1\u03b2/IL-1RN axis and a gene set in the \"receptor activity chemokine\" cluster. Our results should facilitate AD therapeutics targeting these receptors. ",
        "Chemical depletion of phagocytic immune cells in Anopheles gambiae reveals dual roles of mosquito hemocytes in anti-Plasmodium immunity. Mosquito immunity is composed of both cellular and humoral factors that provide protection from invading pathogens. Immune cells known as hemocytes, have been intricately associated with phagocytosis and innate immune signaling. However, the lack of genetic tools has limited hemocyte study despite their importance in mosquito anti-Plasmodium immunity. To address these limitations, we employ the use of a chemical-based treatment to deplete phagocytic immune cells in Anopheles gambiae, demonstrating the role of phagocytes in complement recognition and prophenoloxidase production that limit the ookinete and oocyst stages of malaria parasite development, respectively. Through these experiments, we also define specific subtypes of phagocytic immune cells in An. gambiae, providing insights beyond the morphological characteristics that traditionally define mosquito hemocyte populations. Together, this study represents a significant advancement in our understanding of the roles of mosquito phagocytes in mosquito vector competence and demonstrates the utility of clodronate liposomes as an important tool in the study of invertebrate immunity.

        "Reducing New-Onset Atrial Fibrillation After Coronary Artery Bypass Graft Surgery. Postoperative atrial fibrillation is the most common dysrhythmia to occur after coronary artery bypass graft surgery. It develops in 10% to 40% of patients and can lead to complications such as hemodynamic instability, heart failure, and stroke. Risk factors include hypertension, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and obesity. Patients who experience postoperative atrial fibrillation often have longer hospital stays, are at higher risk for readmission, and have increased mortality. Protocols designed to reduce the incidence of the condition can decrease hospital costs, improve patient outcomes, and increase overall quality of care. This quality improvement project took place in a tertiary care center located in southeastern Michigan and focused on the development and implementation of an evidence-based postoperative atrial fibrillation prophylaxis protocol using amiodarone. The outcomes of this project suggest that amiodarone prophylaxis can reduce the incidence of postoperative atrial fibrillation in patients with no previous history of atrial fibrillation undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery.

        "Calories Purchased by Hospital Employees After Implementation of a Cafeteria Traffic Light-Labeling and Choice Architecture Program. Importance: Nearly one-third of the 150 million US adults who are employed are obese. A workplace program that reduces employees' caloric intake could help prevent obesity. Objective: To determine if implementation of a hospital workplace cafeteria healthy eating program was associated with reduction in calories purchased by employees over 2 years. Design, Setting, and Participants: A longitudinal cohort study of 5695 employees who purchased food with their employee identification card before and after implementation of a workplace cafeteria healthy eating program was conducted from December 1, 2009, to February 29, 2012, in a hospital in Boston, Massachusetts. Statistical analysis was conducted from April 6, 2018, to May 14, 2019. Exposure: After a 3-month baseline period, \"traffic light\" food labels (in which green indicates healthy, yellow indicates less healthy, and red indicates least healthy) and choice architecture (product placement) changes were implemented permanently. Main Outcome and Measures: Main outcomes were changes in calories of employees' purchases from baseline (December 1, 2009, to February 28, 2010) to the same quarter 1 year (December 1, 2010, to February 28, 2011) and 2 years (December 1, 2011, to February 29, 2012) later. Purchases were obtained from sales data linked to employee identification cards. The hypothesized association of estimated changes in daily calories consumed with employees' weight was calculated using a dynamic model of weight change. Analyses were adjusted for age, sex, race/ethnicity, and job type. Results: Among the 5695 employees in the study, 4057 were women and 1638 were men, and the mean (SD) age was 40 (12) years. Baseline purchases had a mean of 565 kcal per transaction (95% CI, 558-572 kcal) and decreased 19 kcal per transaction (95% CI, -23 to -15 kcal) at 1 year and 35 kcal per transaction (95% CI, -39 to -31 kcal) at 2 years (-6.2%; P\u2009<\u2009.001) relative to baseline. The largest reduction was from red-labeled items, decreasing 42 kcal per transaction at 2 years (95% CI, -45 to -39 kcal) from a mean of 183 kcal per transaction (95% CI, 177-188 kcal) at baseline (-23.0%; P\u2009<\u2009.001). Calories from green-labeled items increased 6 kcal per transaction (95% CI, 3-9 kcal) from a mean of 152 kcal per transaction (95% CI, 149-155 kcal) (4.0%; P\u2009<\u2009.001), and calories from yellow-labeled items did not change. Among frequent purchasers (\u226536 transactions per quarter; n\u2009=\u2009453), total kilocalories per quarter at baseline was 41\u202f784, which, averaged over the entire follow-up, decreased a mean of 4275 kcal/quarter (95% CI, -5325 to -3224 kcal) over 2 years. Assuming no compensatory changes in diet or activity, this equated to a reduction of 47 kcal per day and estimated a 2.0-kg weight loss over 3 years. Conclusions and Relevance: A workplace cafeteria traffic light-labeling and choice architecture program was associated with a sustained decrease in calories purchased, particularly from unhealthy foods. Point-of-purchase programs could help improve dietary intake and prevent obesity in employees. ",
        "Association of Preterm Birth and Low Birth Weight With Romantic Partnership, Sexual Intercourse, and Parenthood in Adulthood: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis. Importance: Social relationships are important determinants of well-being, health, and quality of life. There are conflicting findings regarding the association between preterm birth or low birth weight and experiences of social relationships in adulthood. Objective: To systematically investigate the association between preterm birth or low birth weight and social outcomes in adulthood. Data Sources: PubMed, PsycINFO, Web of Science, and Embase were searched for peer-reviewed articles published through August 5, 2018. Study Selection: Prospective longitudinal and registry studies reporting on selected social outcomes in adults who were born preterm or with low birth weight (mean sample age \u226518 years) compared with control individuals born at term. Data Extraction and Synthesis: The meta-analysis followed Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. The data were collected and extracted by 2 independent reviewers. Pooled analyses were based on odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals and Hedges g, which were meta-analyzed using random-effects models. Main Outcomes and Measures: Ever being in a romantic partnership, ever having experienced sexual intercourse, parenthood, quality of romantic relationship, and peer social support. Results: Twenty-one studies were included of the 1829 articles screened. Summary data describing a maximum of 4\u202f423\u202f798 adult participants (179\u202f724 preterm or low birth weight) were analyzed. Adults born preterm or with low birth weight were less likely to have ever experienced a romantic partnership (OR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.64-0.81), to have had sexual intercourse (OR, 0.43; 95% CI, 0.31-0.61), or to have become parents (OR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.65-0.91) than adults born full-term. A dose-response association according to degree of prematurity was found for romantic partnership and parenthood. Overall, effect sizes did not differ with age and sex. When adults born preterm or with low birth weight were in a romantic partnership or had friends, the quality of these relationships was not poorer compared with adults born full-term. Conclusions and Relevance: These findings suggest that adults born preterm or with low birth weight are less likely to experience a romantic partnership, sexual intercourse, or to become parents. However, preterm birth or low birth weight does not seem to impair the quality of relationships with partners and friends. Lack of sexual or partner relationships might increase the risk of decreased well-being and poorer physical and mental health. ",
        "mEAK-7 Forms an Alternative mTOR Complex with DNA-PKcs in Human Cancer. MTOR associated protein, eak-7 homolog (mEAK-7), activates mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling in human cells through an alternative mTOR complex to regulate S6K2 and 4E-BP1. However, the role of mEAK-7 in human cancer has not yet been identified. We demonstrate that mEAK-7 and mTOR signaling are strongly elevated in tumor and metastatic lymph nodes of patients with non-small-cell lung carcinoma compared with those of patients with normal lung or lymph tissue. Cancer stem cells, CD44+/CD90+ cells, yield elevated mEAK-7 and activated mTOR signaling. mEAK-7 is required for clonogenic potential and spheroid formation. mEAK-7 associates with DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit isoform 1 (DNA-PKcs), and this interaction is increased in response to X-ray irradiation to regulate S6K2 signaling. DNA-PKcs pharmacologic inhibition or genetic knockout reduced S6K2, mEAK-7, and mTOR binding with DNA-PKcs, resulting in loss of S6K2 activity and mTOR signaling. Therefore, mEAK-7 forms an alternative mTOR complex with DNA-PKcs to regulate S6K2 in human cancer cells. ",
        "Natural environments and craving: The mediating role of negative affect. This paper presents a novel investigation of a conceptual model, proposing that increased nature exposure may be associated with lower cravings, through reductions in negative affect. A cross-sectional online survey (N\u202f=\u202f149) provided an initial exploration of the relationships between various aspects of nature exposure, craving and negative affect. Access to gardens/allotments and residential views incorporating more than 25% greenspace were both associated with reductions in the strength and frequency of cravings. These associations were mediated, to varying degrees, by reductions in negative affect. This novel link could have implications for public health and environmental protection programmes. ",
        "The introduction of new hosts with human trade shapes the extant distribution of Toxoplasma gondii lineages. Toxoplasma gondii is a zoonotic protozoan with a worldwide occurrence, but the determinants of the current pattern in the geographical distribution of T. gondii lineages and strains remain poorly understood. To test the influence of human trade on T. gondii populations, we conducted a population genetic study of 72 T. gondii animal isolates from Senegal, a West African country in which the ongoing inland progress of invasive murine hosts (introduced in port cities of Senegal since the 16th century by European sailors) is well described. Isolates were mainly collected on free-range poultry, which are considered as relevant bioindicators of T. gondii strain diversity in the domestic environment. Sampling was conducted in two port cities of Senegal (Dakar and Saint-Louis) and in one inland region (Kedougou). Population genetic analyses using 15 microsatellite markers revealed different patterns between port cities where lineages non-virulent for mice (type II, type III, and Africa 4) were predominant, and Kedougou where the mouse-virulent Africa 1 lineage was the most common. By considering the current spatial pattern in the inland progress of invasive rodents in Senegal, our results suggest that the invasive house mouse Mus musculus domesticus counter-selects the Africa 1 lineage in the invaded areas. The comparison of the microsatellite alleles of type II strains from Senegal to type II strains from other areas in Africa and Western Europe, using discriminant analysis of principal components and Network analysis, point to a mainly Western European origin of the type II lineage in Senegal. Collectively, these findings suggest that human-mediated intercontinental migrations of murine hosts are important vectors of T. gondii strains. Differential susceptibility of endemic and introduced murine hosts to various T. gondii strains probably determines the persistence of these strains in the environment, and therefore their availability for human and animal infection.

        "Cell-free DNA in blood circulation is generated by DNase1L3 and caspase-activated DNase. Cell-free DNA (cfDNA) (e.g. fetal- or tumor-derived DNA) is DNA found in the blood circulation. It is now widely investigated as a biomarker for prenatal screening, tumor diagnosis, and tumor monitoring as \"liquid biopsies\". However, the biological and biochemical aspects of cfDNA remain unclear. Although cfDNA is considered to be mainly derived from dead cells, information is scarce as to whether it is apoptotic or necrotic and what kinds of endonucleases or DNases are involved. We induced in\u00a0vivo hepatocyte necrosis and apoptosis in mice deficient in DNase1L3 (also named DNase \u03b3) and/or caspase-activated DNase (CAD) genes with acetaminophen overdose and anti-Fas antibody treatments. We found that (i) DNase1L3 was the endonuclease responsible for generating cfDNA in acetaminophen-induced hepatocyte necrosis and (ii) CAD and DNase1L3 cooperated in producing cfDNA for anti-Fas mediated hepatocyte apoptosis.

        "Identifying determinants of persistent MRSA bacteremia using mathematical modeling. Persistent bacteremia caused by Staphylococcus aureus (SA), especially methicillin-resistant SA (MRSA), is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. Despite susceptibility phenotypes in vitro, persistent MRSA strains fail to clear with appropriate anti-MRSA therapy during bacteremia in vivo. Thus, identifying the factors that cause such MRSA persistence is of direct and urgent clinical relevance. To address the dynamics of MRSA persistence in the face of host immunity and typical antibiotic regimens, we developed a mathematical model based on the overarching assumption that phenotypic heterogeneity is a hallmark of MRSA persistence. First, we applied an ensemble modeling approach and obtained parameter sets that satisfied the condition of a minimum inoculum dose to establish infection. Second, by simulating with the selected parameter sets under vancomycin therapy which follows clinical practices, we distinguished the models resulting in resolving or persistent bacteremia, based on the total SA exceeding a detection limit after five days of treatment. Third, to find key determinants that discriminate resolving and persistent bacteremia, we applied a machine learning approach and found that the immune clearance rate of persister cells is a key feature. But, fourth, when relapsing bacteremia was considered, the growth rate of persister cells was also found to be a key feature. Finally, we explored pharmacological strategies for persistent and relapsing bacteremia and found that a persister killer, but not a persister formation inhibitor, could provide for an effective cure the persistent bacteremia. Thus, to develop better clinical solutions for MRSA persistence and relapse, our modeling results indicate that we need to better understand the pathogen-host interactions of persister MRSAs in vivo.

        "A role for the medial temporal lobe subsystem in guiding prosociality: the effect of episodic processes on willingness to help others. Why are we willing to help others? Recent behavioral work on episodic processes (i.e. the ability to represent an event that is specific in time and place) suggests that imagining and remembering scenes of helping a person in need increases intentions to help. Here, we provide insight into the cognitive and neural mechanisms that enhance prosocial intentions via episodic simulation and memory. In Experiment 1, we scanned participants using functional neuroimaging as they imagined and remembered helping episodes, and completed non-episodic control conditions accounting for exposure to the story of need and conceptual priming of helping. Analyses revealed that activity in the medial temporal lobe (MTL) subsystem, as well as the right temporoparietal junction (RTPJ) predicted the effect of conditions on the strength of prosocial intentions. In Experiment 2, we used transcranial magnetic stimulation to disrupt activity in the RTPJ, and better isolate the contribution of MTL subsystem to prosocial intentions. The effect of conditions on willingness to help remained even when activity in the RTPJ was disrupted, suggesting that activity in the MTL subsystem may primarily support this prosocial effect. It seems our willingness to help may be guided, in part, by how easily we can construct imagined and remembered helping episodes. ",
        "Modeling the daily rhythm of human pain processing in the dorsal horn. Experimental studies show that human pain sensitivity varies across the 24-hour day, with the lowest sensitivity usually occurring during the afternoon. Patients suffering from neuropathic pain, or nerve damage, experience an inversion in the daily modulation of pain sensitivity, with the highest sensitivity usually occurring during the early afternoon. Processing of painful stimulation occurs in the dorsal horn (DH), an area of the spinal cord that receives input from peripheral tissues via several types of primary afferent nerve fibers. The DH circuit is composed of different populations of neurons, including excitatory and inhibitory interneurons, and projection neurons, which constitute the majority of the output from the DH to the brain. In this work, we develop a mathematical model of the dorsal horn neural circuit to investigate mechanisms for the daily modulation of pain sensitivity. The model describes average firing rates of excitatory and inhibitory interneuron populations and projection neurons, whose activity is directly correlated with experienced pain. Response in afferent fibers to peripheral stimulation is simulated by a Poisson process generating nerve fiber spike trains at variable firing rates. Model parameters for fiber response to stimulation and the excitability properties of neuronal populations are constrained by experimental results found in the literature, leading to qualitative agreement between modeled responses to pain and experimental observations. We validate our model by reproducing the wind-up of pain response to repeated stimulation. We apply the model to investigate daily modulatory effects on pain inhibition, in which response to painful stimuli is reduced by subsequent non-painful stimuli. Finally, we use the model to propose a mechanism for the observed inversion of the daily rhythmicity of pain sensation under neuropathic pain conditions. Underlying mechanisms for the shift in rhythmicity have not been identified experimentally, but our model results predict that experimentally-observed dysregulation of inhibition within the DH neural circuit may be responsible. The model provides an accessible, biophysical framework that will be valuable for experimental and clinical investigations of diverse physiological processes modulating pain processing in humans. ",
        "Effects of microbiota-directed foods in gnotobiotic animals and undernourished children. To examine the contributions of impaired gut microbial community development to childhood undernutrition, we combined metabolomic and proteomic analyses of plasma samples with metagenomic analyses of fecal samples to characterize the biological state of Bangladeshi children with severe acute malnutrition (SAM) as they transitioned, after standard treatment, to moderate acute malnutrition (MAM) with persistent microbiota immaturity. Host and microbial effects of microbiota-directed complementary food (MDCF) prototypes targeting weaning-phase bacterial taxa underrepresented in SAM and MAM microbiota were characterized in gnotobiotic mice and gnotobiotic piglets colonized with age- and growth-discriminatory bacteria. A randomized, double-blind controlled feeding study identified a lead MDCF that changes the abundances of targeted bacteria and increases plasma biomarkers and mediators of growth, bone formation, neurodevelopment, and immune function in children with MAM.

        "Palmitoylation of NOD1 and NOD2 is required for bacterial sensing. The nucleotide oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptors 1 and 2 (NOD1/2) are intracellular pattern-recognition proteins that activate immune signaling pathways in response to peptidoglycans associated with microorganisms. Recruitment to bacteria-containing endosomes and other intracellular membranes is required for NOD1/2 signaling, and NOD1/2 mutations that disrupt membrane localization are associated with inflammatory bowel disease and other inflammatory conditions. However, little is known about this recruitment process. We found that NOD1/2 S-palmitoylation is required for membrane recruitment and immune signaling. ZDHHC5 was identified as the palmitoyltransferase responsible for this critical posttranslational modification, and several disease-associated mutations in NOD2 were found to be associated with defective S-palmitoylation. Thus, ZDHHC5-mediated S-palmitoylation of NOD1/2 is critical for their ability to respond to peptidoglycans and to mount an effective immune response. ",
        "Prevalence of and Risk Factors for Anal High-grade Squamous Intraepithelial Lesions in Women Living with Human Immunodeficiency Virus. BACKGROUND: Women living with human immunodeficiency virus (WLHIV) have disproportionately high rates of squamous cell carcinoma of the anus compared with the general population of women. Anal high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSILs) precede anal cancer, and accurate studies of HSIL prevalence among WLHIV in the United States are lacking. METHODS: The AIDS Malignancy Consortium 084 study was a multicenter national trial to evaluate the prevalence of and risk factors for anal HSIL in a US cohort. Eligible participants were WLHIV aged \u226518 years with no history of anal HSIL. Study participants had an examination including collection of cervical/vaginal and anal specimens, followed by high-resolution anoscopy with biopsy. RESULTS: We enrolled 256 women with evaluable anal pathology. The mean age was 49.4 years, 64% women were non-Hispanic black, 67% were former or current smokers, and 56% reported ever having anal sex with a man. The median CD4 T-cell count was 664 cells/\u03bcL. The prevalence of anal histologic HSIL (hHSIL) was 27% (95% confidence interval [CI], 22%-33%). There was a strong concordance (240/254) between local and consensus pathologists for hHSIL vs less than hHSIL (\u03ba = 0.86 [95% CI, .79-.93]). Current CD4 count of \u2264200 cells/\u03bcL was the strongest predictor of consensus anal hHSIL diagnosis (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 10.34 [95% CI, 3.47-30.87]). History of anoreceptive intercourse was also associated with hHSIL (aOR, 2.44 [95% CI, 1.22-4.76]). CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of anal hHSIL in WLHIV in the United States was 27% in this study where all participants received high-resolution anoscopy and biopsy. ",
        "Forward Genetic Screen for Caenorhabditis elegans Mutants with a Shortened Locomotor Healthspan. Two people with the same lifespan do not necessarily have the same healthspan. One person may retain locomotor and cognitive abilities until the end of life, while another person may lose them during adulthood. Unbiased searches for genes that are required to maintain locomotor ability during adulthood may uncover key regulators of locomotor healthspan. Here, we take advantage of the relatively short lifespan of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans and develop a novel screening procedure to collect mutants with locomotor deficits that become apparent in adulthood. After ethyl methanesulfonate mutagenesis, we isolated five C. elegans mutant strains that progressively lose adult locomotor ability. In one of the mutant strains, a nonsense mutation in elpc-2, which encodes Elongator Complex Protein Component 2, causes a progressive decline in locomotor ability during adulthood. Mutants and mutations identified in the present screen may provide insights into mechanisms of age-related locomotor impairment and the maintenance of locomotor healthspan. ",
        "Interleukin-17 and matrix metalloprotease-9 expression in the mycetoma granuloma. Mycetoma is a persistent, progressive granulomatous inflammatory disease caused either by fungi or by bacteria. Characteristic of this disease is that the causative agents organise themselves in macroscopic structures called grains. These grains are surrounded by a massive inflammatory reaction. The processes leading to this host tissue reaction and the immunophenotypic characteristics of the mycetoma granuloma are not known. Due to the massive immune reaction and the tissue remodeling involved, we hypothesised that the expression levels of interleukin-17 (IL-17) and matrix metalloprotease-9 (MMP-9) in the mycetoma granuloma formation were correlated to the severity of the disease and that this correlation was independent of the causative agent responsible for the granuloma reaction. To determine the expression of IL-17 and MMP-9 in mycetoma lesions, the present study was conducted at the Mycetoma Research Centre, Sudan. Surgical biopsies from 100 patients with confirmed mycetoma were obtained, and IL-17 and MMP-9 expression in the mycetoma granuloma were evaluated immunohistochemically. IL-17 was mainly expressed in Zones I and II, and far less in Zone III. MMP-9 was detected mainly in Zones II and III, and the least expression was in Zone I. MMP-9 was more highly expressed in Actinomadura pelletierii and Streptomyces somaliensis biopsies compared to Madurella mycetomatis biopsies. MMP-9 levels were directly proportional to the levels of IL-17 (p = 0.001). The only significant association between MMP9 and the patients' characteristics was the disease duration (p<0.001). There was an insignificant correlation between the IL-17 levels and the patients' demographic characteristics. ",
        "Association of Lifespan Cognitive Reserve Indicator With Dementia Risk in the Presence of Brain Pathologies. Importance: Evidence on the association of lifespan cognitive reserve (CR) with dementia is limited, and the strength of this association in the presence of brain pathologies is unknown. Objective: To examine the association of lifespan CR with dementia risk, taking brain pathologies into account. Design, Setting, and Participants: This study used data from 2022 participants in the Rush Memory and Aging Project, an ongoing community-based cohort study with annual follow-up from 1997 to 2018 (mean follow-up, 6 years; maximum follow-up, 20 years). After excluding 420 individuals who had prevalent dementia, missing data on CR, or dropped out, 1602 dementia-free adults were identified at baseline and evaluated to detect incident dementia. During follow-up, 611 died and underwent autopsies. Data were analyzed from May to September 2018. Exposures: Information on CR factors (education; early-life, midlife, and late-life cognitive activities; and social activities in late life) was obtained at baseline. Based on these factors, lifespan CR scores were captured using a latent variable from a structural equation model and was divided into tertiles (lowest, middle, and highest). Main Outcomes and Measures: Dementia was diagnosed following international criteria. Neuropathologic evaluations for Alzheimer disease and other brain pathologies were performed in autopsied participants. The association of lifespan CR with dementia or brain pathologies was estimated using Cox regression models or logistic regression. Results: Of the 1602 included participants, 1216 (75.9%) were women, and the mean (SD) age was 79.6 (7.5) years. During follow-up, 386 participants developed dementia (24.1%), including 357 participants with Alzheimer disease-related dementia (22.3%). The multiadjusted hazards ratios (HRs) of dementia were 0.77 (95% CI, 0.59-0.99) for participants in the middle CR score tertile and 0.61 (95% CI, 0.47-0.81) for those in the highest CR score tertile compared with those in the lowest CR score tertile. In autopsied participants, CR was not associated with most brain pathologies, and the association of CR with dementia remained significant after additional adjustment for brain pathologies (HR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.42-0.86). The highest CR score tertile was associated with a reduction in dementia risk, even among participants with high Alzheimer disease pathology (HR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.37-0.87) and any gross infarcts (HR, 0.34; 95% CI, 0.18-0.62). Conclusions and Relevance: High lifespan CR is associated with a reduction in dementia risk, even in the presence of high brain pathologies. Our findings highlight the importance of lifespan CR accumulation in dementia prevention. ",
        "Access to Primary Care Clinics for Patients With Chronic Pain Receiving Opioids. Importance: Opioid-prescribing policies and guidelines aimed at reducing inappropriate opioid prescribing may lead physicians to stop prescribing opioids. Patients may thus encounter difficulties finding primary care practitioners willing to care for them if they take opioids. Objectives: To assess practitioner willingness to accept and continue prescribing opioids to new patients with pain and whether this willingness differs across payer types. Design, Setting, and Participants: This survey study used a simulated patient call audit method. A brief telephone survey was administered to all clinics followed by a call using a patient script simulating an adult patient with chronic pain who was taking long-term opioids. The patient had Medicaid or private insurance. Calls were made between June 22 and October 30, 2018, to 667 primary care clinics that served a general adult population in Michigan. Clinics that accepted both Medicaid and private insurance, took new patient appointments, and were successfully recontacted for the simulated call were eligible for the study. Main Outcomes and Measures: Prevalence of clinics' acceptance of new patients receiving prescription opioids overall and by clinic characteristics and insurance type. Results: Of the 194 eligible clinics, 94 (48.4%) were randomized according to insurance type to receive calls from research assistants posing as children of patients with Medicaid and 100 (51.5%) to receive calls from those with private insurance. Overall, 79 (40.7%) stated that their practitioners would not prescribe opioids to the simulated patient. Thirty-three clinics (17.0%) requested more information before making a decision. Compared with single-practitioner clinics, clinics with more than 3 practitioners were more likely (odds ratio [OR], 2.99; 95% CI, 1.48-6.04) to accept new patients currently taking opioids. No difference was found in access based on insurance status (OR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.52-1.64) or whether the clinic offered medications for opioid use disorders (OR, 1.10; 95% CI, 0.45-2.69). Conclusions and Relevance: The findings suggest that access to primary care may be reduced for patients taking prescription opioids, which could lead to unintended consequences, such as conversion to illicit substances or reduced management of other medical comorbidities.

        "Association of Estimated Long-term Exposure to Air Pollution and Traffic Proximity With a Marker for Coronary Atherosclerosis in a Nationwide Study in China. Importance: Epidemiologic evidence of the mechanisms of the association between long-term exposure to air pollution and coronary heart disease (CHD) is limited and relies heavily on studies performed in Europe and the United States, where air pollution levels are relatively low. In particular, the association between air pollution and CHD in patients with underlying risks for CHD is understudied. Objective: To determine whether air pollution and proximity to traffic are associated with the coronary artery calcium (CAC) score, a key atherosclerotic marker. Design, Setting, and Participants: In this prospective, population-based cross-sectional study in a large-scale setting in China, 8867 consecutive patients aged 25 to 92 years with suspected CHD were recruited between November 17, 2015, and September 13, 2017. Participants were excluded if they had previous myocardial infarction, stenting, or coronary artery bypass grafting or incomplete risk factors and exposure data. Each participant underwent assessment of CAC and CHD risk factors at baseline. Data were analyzed from December 2017 to November 2018. Exposures: Annual means of fine particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter less than 2.5 \u03bcm (PM2.5), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and ozone (O3) were estimated at the participants' residences using a validated geostatistical prediction model. Exposure to a nearby roadway was also estimated. Main Outcomes and Measures: Computed tomography measurement of CAC score. Results: The mean (SD) age of the 8867 participants was 56.9 (10.4) years; 4378 (53.6%) were men. Annual mean (SD) PM2.5, NO2, and O3 measurements were 70.1 (20.0), 41.4 (14.7), and 93.9 (10.5) \u03bcg/m3, respectively. The mean (SD) CAC score was 91.4 (322.2) Agatston units. Exposure to PM2.5 and NO2, adjusting for CHD risk factors and multiple pollutants, were independently associated with increases in CAC scores of 27.2% (95% CI, 10.8% to 46.1%) per 30 \u03bcg/m3 PM2.5 and 24.5% (95% CI, 3.6% to 49.7%) per 20 \u03bcg/m3 NO2. For PM2.5, odds of both detectable CAC (Agatston score >0; odds ratio, 1.28; 95% CI, 1.13 to 1.45) and severe CAC (Agatston score >400; odds ratio, 1.59; 95% CI, 1.20 to 2.12) were increased. Associations of CAC with PM2.5 and NO2 were greater among male participants (PM2.5: 42.2%; 95% CI, 24.3% to 62.7%; NO2: 45.7%; 95% CI, 25.3% to 69.5%) and elderly participants (PM2.5: 50.1%; 95% CI, 28.8% to 75.0%; NO2: 55.5%; 95% CI, 31.8% to 83.6%) and those with diabetes (PM2.5: 62.2%; 95% CI, 30.9% to 101.0%; NO2: 31.2%; 95% CI, 13.9% to 51.0%). Independent association with CAC score was 9.0% (95% CI, -1.4% to 20.4%) for O3 per 15 \u03bcg/m3 and 2.4% (95% CI, -0.6% to 5.4%) for distance near roadway per 50% decrease. Conclusions and Relevance: In this large Chinese study, long-term exposures to PM2.5 and NO2 were independently associated with severity of CAC. This finding may provide support for the pathophysiological role of coronary atherosclerosis through which air pollution exposure may be associated with CHD. ",
        "Different Synchrony in Rhythmic Movement Caused by Morphological Difference between Five- and Six-armed Brittle Stars. Physiological experiments and mathematical models have supported that neuronal activity is crucial for coordinating rhythmic movements in animals. On the other hand, robotics studies have suggested the importance of physical properties made by body structure, i.e. morphology. However, it remains unclear how morphology affects movement coordination in animals, independent of neuronal activity. To begin to understand this issue, our study reports a rhythmic movement in the green brittle star Ophiarachna incrassata. We found this animal moved five radially symmetric parts in a well-ordered unsynchronized pattern. We built a phenomenological model where internal fluid flows between the five body parts to explain the coordinated pattern without considering neuronal activity. Changing the number of the body parts from five to six, we simulated a synchronized pattern, which was demonstrated also by an individual with six symmetric parts. Our model suggests a different number in morphology makes a different fluid flow, leading to a different synchronization pattern in the animal. ",
        "Longitudinal Changes in the Cerebral Cortex Functional Organization of Healthy Elderly. Healthy aging is accompanied by disruptions in the functional modular organization of the human brain. Cross-sectional studies have shown age-related reductions in the functional segregation and distinctiveness of brain networks. However, less is known about the longitudinal changes in brain functional modular organization and their associations with aging-related cognitive decline. We examined age- and aging-related changes in functional architecture of the cerebral cortex using a dataset comprising a cross-sectional healthy young cohort of 57 individuals (mean \u00b1 SD age, 23.71 \u00b1 3.61 years, 22 males) and a longitudinal healthy elderly cohort of 72 individuals (mean \u00b1 baseline age, 68.22 \u00b1 5.80 years, 39 males) with 2-3 time points (18-24 months apart) of task-free fMRI data. We found both cross-sectional (elderly vs young) and longitudinal (in elderly) global decreases in network segregation (decreased local efficiency), integration (decreased global efficiency), and module distinctiveness (increased participation coefficient and decreased system segregation). At the modular level, whereas cross-sectional analyses revealed higher participation coefficient across all modules in the elderly compared with young participants, longitudinal analyses revealed focal longitudinal participation coefficient increases in three higher-order cognitive modules: control network, default mode network, and salience/ventral attention network. Cross-sectionally, elderly participants also showed worse attention performance with lower local efficiency and higher mean participation coefficient, and worse global cognitive performance with higher participation coefficient in the dorsal attention/control network. These findings suggest that healthy aging is associated with whole-brain connectome-wide changes in the functional modular organization of the brain, accompanied by loss of functional segregation, particularly in higher-order cognitive networks.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Cross-sectional studies have demonstrated age-related reductions in the functional segregation and distinctiveness of brain networks. However, longitudinal aging-related changes in brain functional modular architecture and their links to cognitive decline remain relatively understudied. Using graph theoretical and community detection approaches to study task-free functional network changes in a cross-sectional young and longitudinal healthy elderly cohort, we showed that aging was associated with global declines in network segregation, integration, and module distinctiveness, and specific declines in distinctiveness of higher-order cognitive networks. Further, such functional network deterioration was associated with poorer cognitive performance cross-sectionally. Our findings suggest that healthy aging is associated with system-level changes in brain functional modular organization, accompanied by functional segregation loss particularly in higher-order networks specialized for cognition.

        "Association of Lifestyle and Genetic Risk With Incidence of Dementia. Importance: Genetic factors increase risk of dementia, but the extent to which this can be offset by lifestyle factors is unknown. Objective: To investigate whether a healthy lifestyle is associated with lower risk of dementia regardless of genetic risk. Design, Setting, and Participants: A retrospective cohort study that included adults of European ancestry aged at least 60 years without cognitive impairment or dementia at baseline. Participants joined the UK Biobank study from 2006 to 2010 and were followed up until 2016 or 2017. Exposures: A polygenic risk score for dementia with low (lowest quintile), intermediate (quintiles 2 to 4), and high (highest quintile) risk categories and a weighted healthy lifestyle score, including no current smoking, regular physical activity, healthy diet, and moderate alcohol consumption, categorized into favorable, intermediate, and unfavorable lifestyles. Main Outcomes and Measures: Incident all-cause dementia, ascertained through hospital inpatient and death records. Results: A total of 196\u202f383 individuals (mean [SD] age, 64.1 [2.9] years; 52.7% were women) were followed up for 1\u202f545\u202f433 person-years (median [interquartile range] follow-up, 8.0 [7.4-8.6] years). Overall, 68.1% of participants followed a favorable lifestyle, 23.6% followed an intermediate lifestyle, and 8.2% followed an unfavorable lifestyle. Twenty percent had high polygenic risk scores, 60% had intermediate risk scores, and 20% had low risk scores. Of the participants with high genetic risk, 1.23% (95% CI, 1.13%-1.35%) developed dementia compared with 0.63% (95% CI, 0.56%-0.71%) of the participants with low genetic risk (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.91 [95% CI, 1.64-2.23]). Of the participants with a high genetic risk and unfavorable lifestyle, 1.78% (95% CI, 1.38%-2.28%) developed dementia compared with 0.56% (95% CI, 0.48%-0.66%) of participants with low genetic risk and favorable lifestyle (hazard ratio, 2.83 [95% CI, 2.09-3.83]). There was no significant interaction between genetic risk and lifestyle factors (P\u2009=\u2009.99). Among participants with high genetic risk, 1.13% (95% CI, 1.01%-1.26%) of those with a favorable lifestyle developed dementia compared with 1.78% (95% CI, 1.38%-2.28%) with an unfavorable lifestyle (hazard ratio, 0.68 [95% CI, 0.51-0.90]). Conclusions and Relevance: Among older adults without cognitive impairment or dementia, both an unfavorable lifestyle and high genetic risk were significantly associated with higher dementia risk. A favorable lifestyle was associated with a lower dementia risk among participants with high genetic risk. ",
        "Maternal prepregnancy surgery and risk of neonatal abstinence syndrome in future newborns: a longitudinal cohort study. BACKGROUND: Neonatal abstinence syndrome is increasingly prevalent, and may be related to opioid use disorders caused by postoperative prescriptions for pain control. We assessed the association of maternal prepregnancy surgery with risk of neonatal abstinence syndrome from opioid use disorders in future pregnancies. METHODS: We conducted a longitudinal retrospective cohort study of 2 182 365 deliveries in Quebec, Canada, between 1989 and 2016. The main exposure was maternal prepregnancy surgery. The main outcome measure was neonatal abstinence syndrome in offspring. We adjusted associations for maternal comorbidity and pregnancy characteristics using log-binomial regression models. RESULTS: The prevalence of neonatal abstinence syndrome in the cohort was 10.7 per 10 000 births. Compared with no surgery, prepregnancy surgery was associated with a risk ratio (RR) of neonatal abstinence syndrome of 1.63 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.49-1.78). Risk was greater for 3 or more prepregnancy surgeries (RR 2.34, 95% CI 2.07-2.63) and age < 15 years at first surgery (1 surgery: RR 2.08, 95% CI 1.71-2.54; 2 or more surgeries: RR 2.79, 95% CI 2.32-3.37). Nearly all surgical specialties increased the risk of neonatal abstinence syndrome, but associations were strongest for cardiothoracic surgery (RR 4.45, 95% CI 2.87-6.91), neurosurgery (RR 3.00, 95% CI 1.56-5.77) and urologic surgery (RR 3.03, 95% CI 2.16-4.26). INTERPRETATION: Prepregnancy surgery is associated with the risk of neonatal abstinence syndrome in future pregnancies. Prescription opioids for postsurgical pain may result in opioid use disorders during future pregnancies, inadvertently increasing the risk of neonatal abstinence syndrome in offspring. ",
        "Inactivation of mTORC2 in macrophages is a signature of colorectal cancer that promotes tumorigenesis. The mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 2 (mTORC2) is a potentially novel and promising anticancer target due to its critical roles in proliferation, apoptosis, and metabolic reprogramming of cancer cells. However, the activity and function of mTORC2 in distinct cells within malignant tissue in vivo is insufficiently explored. Surprisingly, in primary human and mouse colorectal cancer (CRC) samples, mTORC2 signaling could not be detected in tumor cells. In contrast, only macrophages in tumor-adjacent areas showed mTORC2 activity, which was downregulated in stromal macrophages residing within human and mouse tumor tissues. Functionally, inhibition of mTORC2 by specific deletion of Rictor in macrophages stimulated tumorigenesis in a colitis-associated CRC mouse model. This phenotype was driven by a proinflammatory reprogramming of mTORC2-deficient macrophages that promoted colitis via the cytokine SPP1/osteopontin to stimulate tumor growth. In human CRC patients, high SPP1 levels and low mTORC2 activity in tumor-associated macrophages correlated with a worsened clinical prognosis. Treatment of mice with a second-generation mTOR inhibitor that inhibits mTORC2 and mTORC1 exacerbated experimental colorectal tumorigenesis in vivo. In conclusion, mTORC2 activity is confined to macrophages in CRC and limits tumorigenesis. These results suggest activation but not inhibition of mTORC2 as a therapeutic strategy for colitis-associated CRC. ",
        "Marrying chemistry with biology by combining on-chip solution-based combinatorial synthesis and cellular screening. Drug development often relies on high-throughput cell-based screening of large compound libraries. However, the lack of miniaturized and parallelized methodologies in chemistry as well as strict separation and incompatibility of the synthesis of bioactive compounds from their biological screenings makes this process expensive and inefficient. Here, we demonstrate an on-chip platform that combines solution-based synthesis of compound libraries with high-throughput biological screenings (chemBIOS). The chemBIOS platform is compatible with both organic solvents required for the synthesis and aqueous solutions necessary for biological screenings. We use the chemBIOS platform to perform 75 parallel, three-component reactions to synthesize a library of lipidoids, followed by characterization via MALDI-MS, on-chip formation of lipoplexes, and on-chip cell screening. The entire process from the library synthesis to cell screening takes only 3 days and about 1\u2009mL of total solutions, demonstrating the potential of the chemBIOS technology to increase efficiency and accelerate screenings and drug development.

        "Elemental signatures of Australopithecus africanus teeth reveal seasonal dietary stress. Reconstructing the detailed dietary behaviour of extinct hominins is challenging1-particularly for a species such as Australopithecus africanus, which has a highly variable dental morphology that suggests a broad diet2,3. The dietary responses of extinct hominins to seasonal fluctuations in food availability are poorly understood, and nursing behaviours even less so; most of the direct information currently available has been obtained from high-resolution trace-element geochemical analysis of Homo sapiens (both modern and fossil), Homo neanderthalensis4 and living apes5. Here we apply high-resolution trace-element analysis to two A.\u00a0africanus specimens from Sterkfontein Member 4 (South Africa), dated to 2.6-2.1\u00a0million years ago. Elemental signals indicate that A.\u00a0africanus infants predominantly consumed breast milk for the first year after birth. A cyclical elemental pattern observed following the nursing sequence-comparable to the seasonal dietary signal that is seen in contemporary wild primates and other mammals-indicates irregular food availability. These results are supported by isotopic evidence for a geographical range that was dominated by nutritionally depauperate areas. Cyclical accumulation of lithium in A.\u00a0africanus teeth also corroborates the idea that their range was characterized by fluctuating resources, and that they possessed physiological adaptations to this instability. This study provides insights into the dietary cycles and ecological behaviours of A.\u00a0africanus in response to food availability, including the potential cyclical resurgence of milk intake during times of nutritional challenge (as observed in modern wild orangutans5). The geochemical findings for these teeth reinforce the unique place of A.\u00a0africanus in the fossil record, and indicate dietary stress in specimens that date to shortly before the extinction of Australopithecus in South Africa about two million years ago.

        "Elevated levels of Secreted-Frizzled-Related-Protein 1 contribute to Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis. The deposition of aggregated amyloid-\u03b2 peptides derived from the pro-amyloidogenic processing of the amyloid precurson protein (APP) into characteristic amyloid plaques (APs) is distinctive to Alzheimer's disease (AD). Alternative APP processing via the metalloprotease ADAM10 prevents amyloid-\u03b2 formation. We tested whether downregulation of ADAM10 activity by its secreted endogenous inhibitor secreted-frizzled-related protein 1 (SFRP1) is a common trait of sporadic AD. We demonstrate that SFRP1 is significantly increased in the brain and cerebrospinal fluid of patients with AD, accumulates in APs and binds to amyloid-\u03b2, hindering amyloid-\u03b2 protofibril formation. Sfrp1 overexpression in an AD-like mouse model anticipates the appearance of APs and dystrophic neurites, whereas its genetic inactivation or the infusion of \u03b1-SFRP1-neutralizing antibodies favors non-amyloidogenic APP processing. Decreased Sfrp1 function lowers AP accumulation, improves AD-related histopathological traits and prevents long-term potentiation loss and cognitive deficits. Our study unveils SFRP1 as a crucial player in AD pathogenesis and a promising AD therapeutic target. ",
        "Protein interaction networks revealed by proteome coevolution. Residue-residue coevolution has been observed across a number of protein-protein interfaces, but the extent of residue coevolution between protein families on the whole-proteome scale has not been systematically studied. We investigate coevolution between 5.4 million pairs of proteins in Escherichia coli and between 3.9 millions pairs in Mycobacterium tuberculosis We find strong coevolution for binary complexes involved in metabolism and weaker coevolution for larger complexes playing roles in genetic information processing. We take advantage of this coevolution, in combination with structure modeling, to predict protein-protein interactions (PPIs) with an accuracy that benchmark studies suggest is considerably higher than that of proteome-wide two-hybrid and mass spectrometry screens. We identify hundreds of previously uncharacterized PPIs in E. coli and M. tuberculosis that both add components to known protein complexes and networks and establish the existence of new ones. ",
        "Antioxidant Activities in vitro of Water and Liposoluble Extracts Obtained by Different Species of Edible Insects and Invertebrates. A new global interest in entomophagy, the practice of eating insects, and invertebrates, arise from the impellent necessity of preserving agriculture resources and to obtain a drastic reduction of the ecological impact of animal food on the planet. The composite nutritional content, direct consequences of a plant-based feeding, associated with the undoubtedly ecological properties, suggest for insects a role as sustainable and functional foods. We aim to investigate the ability of water and liposoluble extracts, obtained by 12 commercially available edible insects and two invertebrates, to display an antioxidant effect in vitro. Results show that water-soluble extracts of grasshoppers, silkworm, and crickets display the highest values of antioxidant capacity (TEAC), 5-fold higher than fresh orange juice, while evening cicada, giant water bugs, Thai zebra tarantula, and black scorpions have negligible values. Grasshoppers, African caterpillars, and crickets have the highest levels of reducing power (FRAP), double than fresh orange juice. Grasshoppers, black ants, and mealworms contain the highest levels of total polyphenols, while Thai zebra tarantula, black scorpions, and giant water bugs are positioned at the bottom of the ranking. The liposoluble fraction of silkworm, evening cicada, and African caterpillars shows highest level of TEAC, twice than olive oil, while Thai zebra tarantula, palm worm, and black ants are placed at the bottom of the ranking. Edible insects and invertebrates represent a potential source of antioxidant ingredients with an efficiency related to their taxonomy and eating habits. More evidences are needed in order to understand if the practice of eating insects and invertebrates might contribute to modulate oxidative stress in humans. ",
        "Dietary Inflammatory Index, Dietary Non-Enzymatic Antioxidant Capacity, and Colorectal and Breast Cancer Risk (MCC-Spain Study). Inflammation and antioxidant capacity have been associated with colorectal and breast cancer. We computed the dietary inflammatory index (DII\u00ae), and the total dietary non-enzymatic antioxidant capacity (NEAC) and associated them with colorectal and breast cancer risk in the population-based multi case-control study in Spain (MCC-Spain). We included 1852 colorectal cancer and 1567 breast cancer cases, and 3447 and 1486 population controls, respectively. DII score and NEAC were derived using data from a semi-quantitative validated food frequency questionnaire. Unconditional logistic regression models were used to estimate odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) for energy-adjusted DII (E-DII), and a score combining E-DII and NEAC. E-DII was associated with colorectal cancer risk (OR = 1.93, highest quartile versus lowest, 95%CI:1.60-2.32; p-trend: <0.001); this increase was observed for both colon and rectal cancer. Less pronounced increased risks were observed for breast cancer (OR = 1.22, highest quartile versus lowest, 95%CI:0.99-1.52, p-trend: >0.10). The combined score of high E-DII scores and low antioxidant values were associated with colorectal cancer risk (OR = 1.48, highest quartile versus lowest, 95%CI: 1.26-1.74; p-trend: <0.001), but not breast cancer. This study provides evidence that a pro-inflammatory diet is associated with increased colorectal cancer risk while findings for breast cancer were less consistent. ",
        "Association of Feeding Evaluation With Frenotomy Rates in Infants With Breastfeeding Difficulties. Importance: Inpatient surgical release of lingual frenulums rose 10-fold between 1997 and 2012 despite insufficient evidence that frenotomy for ankyloglossia is associated with improvements in breastfeeding. Clear indications for surgical release remain murky, and best practice guidelines have yet to be developed. Objective: To determine whether infants referred for frenotomy to treat breastfeeding difficulties should undergo procedures after comprehensive feeding examination, during which the primary cause of feeding issues was identified, and targeted intervention was provided. Design, Setting, and Participants: This observational quality improvement study followed mother-infant dyads between March and December of 2018 who were referred to our tertiary care center for difficulty with breastfeeding. All infants underwent a comprehensive feeding evaluation by speech and language pathologists who examined the infants' ability to breastfeed prior to a surgical consultation for initial frenotomy. Data analysis was performed between January 2019 and May 2019. Interventions: A multidisciplinary feeding evaluation that examined infants' oral structure and function and their ability to breastfeed and that offered techniques for mothers to address any feeding difficulties prior to surgical intervention was developed. Infants either found success in feeding and weight gain through this program or underwent procedures. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was the percentage of frenotomy procedures following implementation of a multidisciplinary feeding team evaluation. The secondary outcome was the percentage of infants referred for lingual frenotomy who later had either combined lingual and labial frenotomy or labial frenotomy alone. Results: Included in the study were 115 patients (median age, 34 days [interquartile range, 19-56 days], 68 (59%) were male) referred for surgical division of the lingual frenum. Following the development of a program with feeding examination with a pediatric speech and language pathologist, 72 (62.6%) patients subsequently did not undergo surgical procedures. Although all of the referrals were for lingual frenotomy, 10 (8.7%) underwent labial frenotomy alone and 32 (27.8%) underwent both labial and lingual frenotomy. Conclusions and Relevance: The majority of patients referred for ankyloglossia may benefit from alternative intervention strategies following comprehensive feeding evaluation. Close collaboration and formation of multidisciplinary teams are imperative for treating these children. ",
        "Validation of a low-cost, carbon dioxide-based cryoablation system for percutaneous tumor ablation. Breast cancer rates are rising in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), yet there is a lack of accessible and cost-effective treatment. As a result, the cancer burden and death rates are highest in LMICs. In an effort to meet this need, our work presents the design and feasibility of a low-cost cryoablation system using widely-available carbon dioxide as the only consumable. This system uses an 8-gauge outer-diameter needle and Joule-Thomson expansion to percutaneously necrose tissue with cryoablation. Bench top experiments characterized temperature dynamics in ultrasound gel demonstrated that isotherms greater than 2 cm were formed. Further, this system was applied to mammary tumors in an in vivo rat model and necrosis was verified by histopathology. Finally, freezing capacity under a large heat load was assessed with an in vivo porcine study, where volumes of necrosis greater than 1.5 cm in diameter confirmed by histopathology were induced in a highly perfused liver after two 7-minute freeze cycles.

This study assessed the biological and clinical effects in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) of N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC), the prodrug to l-cysteine, a precursor to the natural biological antioxidant glutathione. Forty-two patients with PD were randomized to either weekly\u00a0intravenous infusions of NAC (50\u00a0mg/kg) plus oral doses (500\u00a0mg twice per day) for 3\u00a0months or standard of care only. Participants received prebrain and postbrain imaging with ioflupane (DaTscan) to measure dopamine transporter (DAT) binding. In the NAC group, significantly increased DAT binding was found in the caudate and putamen (mean increase from 3.4% to 8.3%) compared with controls (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05), along with significantly improved PD symptoms (P\u00a0<\u00a00.0001). The results suggest NAC may positively affect the dopaminergic system in patients with PD, with corresponding positive clinical effects. Larger scale studies are warranted. ",
        "PTPN21 and Hook3 relieve KIF1C autoinhibition and activate intracellular transport. The kinesin-3 KIF1C is a fast organelle transporter implicated in the transport of dense core vesicles in neurons and the delivery of integrins to cell adhesions. Here we report the mechanisms of autoinhibition and release that control the activity of KIF1C. We show that the microtubule binding surface of KIF1C motor domain interacts with its stalk and that these autoinhibitory interactions are released upon binding of protein tyrosine phosphatase PTPN21. The FERM domain of PTPN21 stimulates dense core vesicle transport in primary hippocampal neurons and rescues integrin trafficking in KIF1C-depleted cells. In vitro, human full-length KIF1C is a processive, plus-end directed motor. Its landing rate onto microtubules increases in the presence of either PTPN21 FERM domain or the cargo adapter Hook3 that binds the same region of KIF1C tail. This autoinhibition release mechanism allows cargo-activated transport and might enable motors to participate in bidirectional cargo transport without undertaking a tug-of-war. ",
        "Rapid visual categorization is not guided by early salience-based selection. The current dominant visual processing paradigm in both human and machine research is the feedforward, layered hierarchy of neural-like processing elements. Within this paradigm, visual saliency is seen by many to have a specific role, namely that of early selection. Early selection is thought to enable very fast visual performance by limiting processing to only the most salient candidate portions of an image. This strategy has led to a plethora of saliency algorithms that have indeed improved processing time efficiency in machine algorithms, which in turn have strengthened the suggestion that human vision also employs a similar early selection strategy. However, at least one set of critical tests of this idea has never been performed with respect to the role of early selection in human vision. How would the best of the current saliency models perform on the stimuli used by experimentalists who first provided evidence for this visual processing paradigm? Would the algorithms really provide correct candidate sub-images to enable fast categorization on those same images? Do humans really need this early selection for their impressive performance? Here, we report on a new series of tests of these questions whose results suggest that it is quite unlikely that such an early selection process has any role in human rapid visual categorization. ",
        "Highly rearranged chromosomes reveal uncoupling between genome topology and gene expression. Chromatin topology is intricately linked to gene expression, yet its functional requirement remains unclear. Here, we comprehensively assessed the interplay between genome topology and gene expression using highly rearranged chromosomes (balancers) spanning ~75% of the Drosophila genome. Using transheterozyte (balancer/wild-type) embryos, we measured allele-specific changes in topology and gene expression in cis, while minimizing trans effects. Through genome sequencing, we resolved eight large nested inversions, smaller inversions, duplications and thousands of deletions. These extensive rearrangements caused many changes to chromatin topology, disrupting long-range loops, topologically associating domains (TADs) and promoter interactions, yet these are not predictive of changes in expression. Gene expression is generally not altered around inversion breakpoints, indicating that mis-appropriate enhancer-promoter activation is a rare event. Similarly, shuffling or fusing TADs, changing intra-TAD connections and disrupting long-range inter-TAD loops does not alter expression for the majority of genes. Our results suggest that properties other than chromatin topology ensure productive enhancer-promoter interactions. ",
        "Investigation of Genetic Susceptibility to Blastomycosis Reveals Interleukin-6 as a Potential Susceptibility Locus. Genetic differences are hypothesized to underlie ethnic disparities in incidence rates of the endemic systemic mycoses, including blastomycosis. Individuals of Hmong ancestry display elevated risk for this serious fungal infection. Here, we interrogated the genomes of Wisconsin (WI) Hmong blastomycosis patients using homozygosity mapping to uncover regions of the genome that are likely shared among the greater Hmong population and filtered for variants with high potential to affect disease susceptibility. This approach uncovered 113 candidate susceptibility variants, and among the most promising are those in genes involved in the interleukin-17 (IL-17) response. In particular, we identified 25 linked variants near the gene encoding IL-6 (IL6). We validated differences in cytokine production between Hmong and European volunteers and formally demonstrated a critical role for IL-6 in the development of adaptive immunity to Blastomyces dermatitidis Our findings suggest that the dysregulation of IL-17 responses underlies a recently reported and poorly understood ethnic health disparity.IMPORTANCE Blastomycosis is a potentially life-threatening infection caused by the fungus Blastomyces dermatitidis As with related fungal diseases, blastomycosis is noted to affect some populations more than others. These patterns of illness are often not related to predisposing conditions or exposure risks; thus, genetic differences are thought to underlie these health disparities. People of Hmong ancestry in Wisconsin are at elevated risk of blastomycosis compared to the general population. We studied the genetic codes of Hmong blastomycosis patients and identified candidate sites in their genomes that may explain their susceptibility to this infection. We further studied one particular region of the genome that is involved with the immune processes that fight B. dermatitidis Our work revealed population differences in the response to fungi. A better understanding of the genetic underpinnings of susceptibility to infectious diseases has broader implications for community health, especially in the paradigm of personalized medicine. ",
        "The microbiota protects from viral-induced neurologic damage through microglia-intrinsic TLR signaling. Symbiotic microbes impact the function and development of the central nervous system (CNS); however, little is known about the contribution of the microbiota during viral-induced neurologic damage. We identify that commensals aid in host defense following infection with a neurotropic virus through enhancing microglia function. Germfree mice or animals that receive antibiotics are unable to control viral replication within the brain leading to increased paralysis. Microglia derived from germfree or antibiotic-treated animals cannot stimulate viral-specific immunity and microglia depletion leads to worsened demyelination. Oral administration of toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands to virally infected germfree mice limits neurologic damage. Homeostatic activation of microglia is dependent on intrinsic signaling through TLR4, as disruption of TLR4 within microglia, but not the entire CNS (excluding microglia), leads to increased viral-induced clinical disease. This work demonstrates that gut immune-stimulatory products can influence microglia function to prevent CNS damage following viral infection. ",
        "Cerebral Blood Flow during Interval and Continuous Exercise in Young and Old Men. PURPOSE: Aging is associated with impaired cerebral blood flow (CBF) and increased risk of cerebrovascular disease. Acute increases in CBF during exercise may initiate improvements in cerebrovascular health, but the CBF response is diminished during continuous exercise in older adults. The effect of interval exercise for promoting increases in CBF in young and old adults is unknown. METHODS: We compared middle cerebral artery blood velocity (MCAv), end-tidal CO2 (PETCO2) and blood pressure (mean arterial pressure [MAP]) during intensity- and work-matched bouts of continuous (10-min 60%Wmax, followed by 10-min rest) and interval cycling (10 \u00d7 1-min 60%Wmax, separated by 1-min rest) in 11 young (25 \u00b1 3 yr) and 10 old (69 \u00b1 3 yr) men. RESULTS: Middle cerebral artery velocity was higher during continuous compared with interval exercise in the young (P < 0.001), but not in the old. This trend was also seen for changes in PETCO2. Although absolute MAP was higher in the old, the relative rise (%[INCREMENT]) in MAP was similar between age groups and was greater during continuous exercise than interval. When we assessed the total accumulated change in MCAv (area under curve: exercise + recovery), it was higher with interval compared with continuous exercise in both groups (P = 0.018). CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that interval exercise may be an effective alternative for promoting acute increases in CBF velocity, particularly in those older adults who may have difficulty sustaining continuous exercise.

        "Provision and accessibility of primary healthcare services for people who are homeless: a qualitative study of patient perspectives in the UK. BACKGROUND: Anecdotal reports of people who are homeless being denied access and facing negative experiences of primary health care have often emerged. However, there is a dearth of research exploring this population's views and experiences of such services. AIM: To explore the perspectives of individuals who are homeless on the provision and accessibility of primary healthcare services. DESIGN AND SETTING: A qualitative study with individuals who are homeless recruited from three homeless shelters and a specialist primary healthcare centre for the homeless in the West Midlands, England. METHOD: Semi-structured interviews were audiorecorded, transcribed verbatim, and analysed using a thematic framework approach. The Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF) was used to map the identified barriers in framework analysis. RESULTS: A total of 22 people who were homeless were recruited. Although some participants described facing no barriers, accounts of being denied registration at general practices and being discharged from hospital onto the streets with no access or referral to primary care providers were described. Services offering support to those with substance misuse issues and mental health problems were deemed to be excluding those with the greatest need. A participant described committing crimes with the intention of going to prison to access health care. High satisfaction was expressed by participants about their experiences at the specialist primary healthcare centre for people who are homeless (SPHCPH). CONCLUSION: Participants perceived inequality in access, and mostly faced negative experiences, in their use of mainstream services. Changes are imperative to facilitate access to primary health care, improve patient experiences of mainstream services, and to share best practices identified by participants at the SPHCPH. ",
        "Regulation of tumor angiogenesis and mesenchymal-endothelial transition by p38\u03b1 through TGF-\u03b2 and JNK signaling. The formation of new blood vessels is essential for normal development, tissue repair and tumor growth. Here we show that inhibition of the kinase p38\u03b1 enhances angiogenesis in human and mouse colon tumors. Mesenchymal cells can contribute to tumor angiogenesis by regulating proliferation and migration of endothelial cells. We show that p38\u03b1 negatively regulates an angiogenic program in mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs), multipotent progenitors found in perivascular locations. This program includes the acquisition of an endothelial phenotype by MSCs mediated by both TGF-\u03b2 and JNK, and negatively regulated by p38\u03b1. Abrogation of p38\u03b1 in mesenchymal cells increases tumorigenesis, which correlates with enhanced angiogenesis. Using genetic models, we show that p38\u03b1 regulates the acquisition of an endothelial-like phenotype by mesenchymal cells in colon tumors and damage tissue. Taken together, our results indicate that p38\u03b1 in mesenchymal cells restrains a TGF-\u03b2-induced angiogenesis program including their ability to transdifferentiate into endothelial cells. ",
        "Noncoding dsRNA induces retinoic acid synthesis to stimulate hair follicle regeneration via TLR3. How developmental programs reactivate in regeneration is a fundamental question in biology. We addressed this question through the study of Wound Induced Hair follicle Neogenesis (WIHN), an adult organogenesis model where stem cells regenerate de novo hair follicles following deep wounding. The exact mechanism is uncertain. Here we show that self-noncoding dsRNA activates the anti-viral receptor toll like receptor 3 (TLR3) to induce intrinsic retinoic acid (RA) synthesis in a pattern that predicts new hair follicle formation after wounding in mice. Additionally, in humans, rejuvenation lasers induce gene expression signatures for dsRNA and RA, with measurable increases in intrinsic RA synthesis. These results demonstrate a potent stimulus for RA synthesis by non-coding dsRNA, relevant to their broad functions in development and immunity. ",
        "Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy-based Metabolomic Biomarkers for Typing, Staging, and Survival Estimation of Early-Stage Human Lung Cancer. Low-dose CT has shown promise in detecting early stage lung cancer. However, concerns about the adverse health effects of radiation and high cost prevent its use as a population-wide screening tool. Effective and feasible screening methods to triage suspicious patients to CT are needed. We investigated human lung cancer metabolomics from 93 paired tissue-serum samples with magnetic resonance spectroscopy and identified tissue and serum metabolomic markers that can differentiate cancer types and stages. Most interestingly, we identified serum metabolomic profiles that can predict patient overall survival for all cases (p\u2009=\u20090.0076), and more importantly for Stage I cases alone (n\u2009=\u200958, p\u2009=\u20090.0100), a prediction which is significant for treatment strategies but currently cannot be achieved by any clinical method. Prolonged survival is associated with relative overexpression of glutamine, valine, and glycine, and relative suppression of glutamate and lipids in serum. ",
        "High-throughput targeted long-read single cell sequencing reveals the clonal and transcriptional landscape of lymphocytes. High-throughput single-cell RNA sequencing is a powerful technique but only generates short reads from one end of a cDNA template, limiting the reconstruction of highly diverse sequences such as antigen receptors. To overcome this limitation, we combined targeted capture and long-read sequencing of T-cell-receptor (TCR) and B-cell-receptor (BCR) mRNA transcripts with short-read transcriptome profiling of barcoded single-cell libraries generated by droplet-based partitioning. We show that Repertoire and Gene Expression by Sequencing (RAGE-Seq) can generate accurate full-length antigen receptor sequences at nucleotide resolution, infer B-cell clonal evolution and identify alternatively spliced BCR transcripts. We apply RAGE-Seq to 7138 cells sampled from the primary tumor and draining lymph node of a breast cancer patient to track transcriptome profiles of expanded lymphocyte clones across tissues. Our results demonstrate that RAGE-Seq is a powerful method for tracking the clonal evolution from large numbers of lymphocytes applicable to the study of immunity, autoimmunity and cancer. ",
        "Next-Generation Metagenomics: Methodological Challenges and Opportunities. Metagenomics is not only one of the newest omics system science technologies but also one that has arguably the broadest set of applications and impacts globally. Metagenomics has found vast utility not only in environmental sciences, ecology, and public health but also in clinical medicine and looking into the future, in planetary health. In line with the One Health concept, metagenomics solicits collaboration between molecular biologists, geneticists, microbiologists, clinicians, computational biologists, plant biologists, veterinarians, and other health care professionals. Almost every ecological niche of our planet hosts an extremely diverse community of organisms that are still poorly characterized. Detailed characterization of the features of such communities is instrumental to our comprehension of ecological, biological, and clinical complexity. This expert review article evaluates how metagenomics is improving our knowledge of microbiota composition from environmental to human samples. Furthermore, we offer an analysis of the common technical and methodological challenges and potential pitfalls arising from metagenomics approaches, such as metagenomics study design, data processing, and interpretation. All in all, at this critical juncture of further growth of the metagenomics field, it is time to critically reflect on the lessons learned and the future prospects of next-generation metagenomics science, technology, and conceivable applications, particularly from the standpoint of a metagenomics methodology perspective.

        "GSK-3 modulates SHH-driven proliferation in postnatal cerebellar neurogenesis and medulloblastoma. Cerebellar development requires regulated proliferation of cerebellar granule neuron progenitors (CGNPs). Inadequate CGNP proliferation causes cerebellar hypoplasia whereas excessive CGNP proliferation can cause medulloblastoma, the most common malignant pediatric brain tumor. Although sonic hedgehog (SHH) signaling is known to activate CGNP proliferation, the mechanisms downregulating proliferation are less defined. We investigated CGNP regulation by GSK-3, which downregulates proliferation in the forebrain, gut and breast by suppressing mitogenic WNT signaling in mouse. In striking contrast to these systems, we found that co-deleting Gsk3a and Gsk3b blocked CGNP proliferation, causing severe cerebellar hypoplasia. The GSK-3 inhibitor CHIR-98014 similarly downregulated SHH-driven proliferation. Transcriptomic analysis showed activated WNT signaling and upregulated Cdkn1a in Gsk3a/b-deleted CGNPs. Ctnnb co-deletion increased CGNP proliferation and rescued cerebellar hypoproliferation in Gsk3a/b mutants, demonstrating physiological control of CGNPs by GSK-3, mediated through WNT. SHH-driven medulloblastomas similarly required GSK-3, as co-deleting Gsk3a/b blocked tumor growth in medulloblastoma-prone SmoM2 mice. These data show that a GSK-3/WNT axis modulates the developmental proliferation of CGNPs and the pathological growth of SHH-driven medulloblastoma. The requirement for GSK-3 in SHH-driven proliferation suggests that GSK-3 may be targeted for SHH-driven medulloblastoma therapy. ",
        "Genome-wide association study identifies eight risk loci and implicates metabo-psychiatric origins for anorexia nervosa. Characterized primarily by a low body-mass index, anorexia nervosa is a complex and serious illness1, affecting 0.9-4% of women and 0.3% of men2-4, with twin-based heritability estimates of 50-60%5. Mortality rates are higher than those in other psychiatric disorders6, and outcomes are unacceptably poor7. Here we combine data from the Anorexia Nervosa Genetics Initiative (ANGI)8,9 and the Eating Disorders Working Group of the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC-ED) and conduct a genome-wide association study of 16,992\u2009cases of anorexia nervosa and 55,525\u2009controls, identifying eight significant loci. The genetic architecture of anorexia nervosa mirrors its clinical presentation, showing significant genetic correlations with psychiatric disorders, physical activity, and metabolic (including glycemic), lipid and anthropometric traits, independent of the effects of common variants associated with body-mass index. These results further encourage a reconceptualization of anorexia nervosa as a metabo-psychiatric disorder. Elucidating the metabolic component is a critical direction for future research, and paying attention to both psychiatric and metabolic components may be key to improving outcomes. ",
        "Prevalence of antenatal suicidal ideation among racially and ethnically diverse WIC enrolled women receiving care in a Midwestern public health clinic. BACKGROUND: Suicidal ideation (SI) during pregnancy is a major maternal health concern, however few examinations report findings on the burden of SI among low-income women. The aim of this study is to estimate the prevalence and correlates of suicidal ideation among a sample of low-income women. METHODS: A cross-sectional analysis of 736 low-income pregnant women enrolled in a Women Infant and Children supplemental nutrition program and a perinatal depression registry between 2013 and 2015. All participants provided informed consent. SI was captured from Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) screens administered during standard clinic visits. RESULTS: The prevalence of suicidal ideation was 4.6%. After adjusting for smoking, women with depression were 13 times as likely to report SI. LIMITATIONS: SI was measured using a single item from the EPDS during pregnancy. CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates that most, but not all, women with SI reported elevated depressive symptoms. ",
        "Structure of S-layer protein Sap reveals a mechanism for therapeutic intervention in anthrax. Anthrax is an ancient and deadly disease caused by the spore-forming bacterial pathogen Bacillus anthracis. At present, anthrax mostly affects wildlife and livestock, although it remains a concern for human public health-primarily for people who handle contaminated animal products and as a bioterrorism threat due to the high resilience of spores, a high fatality rate of cases and the lack of a civilian vaccination programme1,2. The cell surface of B. anthracis is covered by a protective paracrystalline monolayer-known as surface layer or S-layer-that is composed of the S-layer proteins Sap or EA1. Here, we generate nanobodies to inhibit the self-assembly of Sap, determine the structure of the Sap S-layer assembly domain (SapAD) and show that the disintegration of the S-layer attenuates the growth of B. anthracis and the pathology of anthrax in vivo. SapAD comprises six \u03b2-sandwich domains that fold and support the formation of S-layers independently of calcium. Sap-inhibitory nanobodies prevented the assembly of Sap and depolymerized existing Sap S-layers in vitro. In vivo, nanobody-mediated disruption of the Sap S-layer resulted in severe morphological defects and attenuated bacterial growth. Subcutaneous delivery of Sap inhibitory nanobodies cleared B. anthracis infection and prevented lethality in a mouse model of anthrax disease. These findings highlight disruption of S-layer integrity as a mechanism that has therapeutic potential in S-layer-carrying pathogens. ",
        "A role for ABCB1 in prognosis, invasion and drug resistance in ependymoma. Three of the hallmarks of poor prognosis in paediatric ependymoma are drug resistance, local invasion and recurrence. We hypothesised that these hallmarks were due to the presence of a sub-population of cancer stem cells expressing the multi-drug efflux transporter ABCB1. ABCB1 gene expression was observed in 4 out of 5 paediatric ependymoma cell lines and increased in stem cell enriched neurospheres. Functional inhibition of ABCB1 using vardenafil or verapamil significantly (p\u2009\u2264\u20090.05-0.001) potentiated the response to three chemotherapeutic drugs (vincristine, etoposide and methotrexate). Both inhibitors were also able to significantly reduce migration (p\u2009\u2264\u20090.001) and invasion (p\u2009\u2264\u20090.001). We demonstrate that ABCB1 positive patients from an infant chemotherapy-led trial (CNS9204) had a shorter mean event free survival (EFS) (2.7 versus 8.6 years; p\u2009=\u20090.007 log-rank analysis) and overall survival (OS) (5.4 versus 12 years; p\u2009=\u20090.009 log-rank analysis). ABCB1 positivity also correlated with reduced event free survival in patients with incompletely resected tumours who received chemotherapy across CNS9204 and CNS9904 (a radiotherapy-led SIOP 1999-04 trial cohort; p\u2009=\u20090.03). ABCB1 is a predictive marker of chemotherapy response in ependymoma patients and vardenafil, currently used to treat paediatric pulmonary hypertension in children, could be repurposed to reduce chemoresistance, migration and invasion in paediatric ependymoma patients at non-toxic concentrations.

        "Assessment of menstrual health status and evolution through mobile apps for fertility awareness. For most women of reproductive age, assessing menstrual health and fertility typically involves regular visits to a gynecologist or another clinician. While these evaluations provide critical information on an individual's reproductive health status, they typically rely on memory-based self-reports, and the results are rarely, if ever, assessed at the population level. In recent years, mobile apps for menstrual tracking have become very popular, allowing us to evaluate the reliability and tracking frequency of millions of self-observations, thereby providing an unparalleled view, both in detail and scale, on menstrual health and its evolution for large populations. In particular, the primary aim of this study was to describe the tracking behavior of the app users and their overall observation patterns in an effort to understand if they were consistent with previous small-scale medical studies. The secondary aim was to investigate whether their precision allowed the detection and estimation of ovulation timing, which is critical for reproductive and menstrual health. Retrospective self-observation data were acquired from two mobile apps dedicated to the application of the sympto-thermal fertility awareness method, resulting in a dataset of more than 30 million days of observations from over 2.7 million cycles for two hundred thousand users. The analysis of the data showed that up to 40% of the cycles in which users were seeking pregnancy had recordings every single day. With a modeling approach using Hidden Markov Models to describe the collected data and estimate ovulation timing, it was found that follicular phases average duration and range were larger than previously reported, with only 24% of ovulations occurring at cycle days 14 to 15, while the luteal phase duration and range were in line with previous reports, although short luteal phases (10 days or less) were more frequently observed (in up to 20% of cycles). The digital epidemiology approach presented here can help to lead to a better understanding of menstrual health and its connection to women's health overall, which has historically been severely understudied.

        "Predicting disease specific spinal motor neurons and glia in sporadic ALS. Increasing evidence shows that neuroinflammation mediated by activated glia and infiltrated immune cells is involved in the pathogenesis of sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (sALS). However, the mechanisms of interaction between activated glia and motor neuron degeneration are unclear. To determine the relationship between motor neurons and glial activation in the central nervous system of sALS patients, we applied new cellular interactome bioinformatics tools to transcriptome profiles established from laser captured motor neurons in regions remote from site of onset. We found a disease specific subtype of motor neuron that inversely correlated with survival of sALS patients. Interestingly, two subtypes of motor neurons (motorneuron2 and 3) and two subtypes of microglia/macrophages (microglia/macrophage1 and 2) were unique to sALS patients compared to controls. Increased microglia/macrophage1 correlated with decreased motorneuron2 and increased microglia/macrophage2 correlated with decreased motor neuron3. Increased MHC class II genes correlated with microglia/macrophage1-2. Tissue staining using immunofluorescence confirmed a significant increase of microglia/macrophage expressing MHC class II, suggesting that they were activated. Identified gene pathways and biological changes included apoptosis and protein phosphorylation in motorneuron3 and antigen processing/presentation and immune cell activation in microglia/macrophages in sALS patients. Our findings support the hypothesis that neuro-glia physical interactions are important in pathogenesis, and targeting disease-specific motor neurons and/or glia could be a useful therapy to slow disease progression.

        "The sncRNA Zoo: a repository for circulating small noncoding RNAs in animals. The repertoire of small noncoding RNAs (sncRNAs), particularly miRNAs, in animals is considered to be evolutionarily conserved. Studies on sncRNAs are often largely based on homology-based information, relying on genomic sequence similarity and excluding actual expression data. To obtain information on sncRNA expression (including miRNAs, snoRNAs, YRNAs and tRNAs), we performed low-input-volume next-generation sequencing of 500\u00a0pg of RNA from 21 animals at two German zoological gardens. Notably, none of the species under investigation were previously annotated in any miRNA reference database. Sequencing was performed on blood cells as they are amongst the most accessible, stable and abundant sources of the different sncRNA classes. We evaluated and compared the composition and nature of sncRNAs across the different species by computational approaches. While the distribution of sncRNAs in the different RNA classes varied significantly, general evolutionary patterns were maintained. In particular, miRNA sequences and expression were found to be even more conserved than previously assumed. To make the results available for other researchers, all data, including expression profiles at the species and family levels, and different tools for viewing, filtering and searching the data are freely available in the online resource ASRA (Animal sncRNA Atlas) at https://www.ccb.uni-saarland.de/asra/.

        "Autistic traits in individuals self-defining as transgender or nonbinary. BACKGROUND: Autism spectrum traits are increasingly being reported in individuals who identify as transgender, and the presence of such traits have implications for clinical support. To-date little is known about autism traits in individuals who identify as nonbinary. AIMS: To empirically contribute to current research by examining autistic traits in a self-identifying transgender and nonbinary gender group. METHOD: One hundred and seventy-seven participants responded to a survey consisting of the Autism Spectrum Quotient (AQ), the Empathy Quotient (EQ), the Systematising Quotient (SQ) and the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Task (RME). Comparisons were made between cisgender, transgender and nonbinary groups. RESULTS: Individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) or meeting the AQ cut-off score for ASD were over-represented in both the transgender and nonbinary groups. The key variables differentiating the transgender and nonbinary groups from the cisgender group were systematising and empathy. Levels of autistic traits and cases of ASD were higher in individuals assigned female at birth than those assigned male at birth. CONCLUSIONS: A proportion of individuals seeking help and advice about gender identity will also present autistic traits and in some cases undiagnosed autism. Lower levels of empathy, diminished theory of mind ability and literalness may impede the delivery of effective support. Clinicians treating transgender and nonbinary individuals, should also consider whether clients, especially those assigned female at birth, have an undiagnosed ASD. ",
        "Tibial Tubercle-Trochlear Groove Distance Is a Reliable and Accurate Indicator of Patellofemoral Instability. BACKGROUND: Tibial tubercle-trochlear groove (TT-TG) distance is a measurement generally made on CT scans that is commonly used to quantify the risk of patellofemoral instability (PFI); however, its interrater reliability and accuracy as an indicator of PFI in patients is poorly characterized. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: The purposes of our study were (1) to primarily analyze interrater reliability of the TT-TG distance among orthopaedists with varied experience as measured by MRI, (2) to secondarily compare TT-TG distances between PFI and control groups, and (3) to determine an accurate TT-TG distance threshold indicative of PFI. METHODS: The electronic medical records of a senior fellowship-trained orthopaedic sports medicine surgeon were surveyed between 2012 and 2016 for patients who had experienced at least one episode of patellar subluxation or dislocation, who reported no other knee-related history, and who underwent MRI due to persistent PFI signs and symptoms. The records of 48 PFI patients (23 males, 25 females; 19 \u00b1 4 years of age) were compared with 83 controls (60 males, 23 females; 31 \u00b1 8 years of age) having no history of PFI, presenting with an isolated meniscal lesion as determined from MRI and treated by the same orthopaedist during this time. All records meeting study criteria were consecutively included to offset selection bias of the retrospective analysis. Two sports medicine fellows, one who had just completed orthopaedic residency training, and another with a year of experience after residency, and a sports medicine subspecialist with more than 15 years of experience in practice independently recorded TT-TG distance, indicative of tibial tubercle lateralization relative to the femoral trochlea, to the nearest millimeter (mm) in a blinded and randomized fashion. Intraclass correlation coefficient computed interrater reliability accompanied by standard error of measurement (SEM); a one-tailed, two-sample t-test analyzed group differences with accompanying effect size per Cohen's d; receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve determined accuracy and threshold for PFI risk. A p value < 0.05 denoted statistical significance. RESULTS: Interrater reliability was excellent, at 0.93 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.84-0.97; SEM = 0.6 mm) for PFI patients and 0.95 (95% CI, 0.91-0.97; SEM = 0.4 mm) for controls. Distance was greater (95% CI, 2-5; p < 0.001) in PFI patients (14 \u00b1 4 mm; range = 7-24 mm) than controls (10 \u00b1 3 mm; range = 3-19 mm) with an effect size of 1 (95% CI, 0.3-2). Area under the ROC curve was 0.75 (95% CI, 0.66-0.83) and threshold was 13 mm (sensitivity = 0.52, 1-specificity = 0.25), suggesting the measure is a fairly accurate indicator of risk and values of 13 mm or greater are better suited to rule in PFI. Respective positive and negative likelihood ratios of 2 and 0.6 at this threshold confirm that this distance yields a small increase in probability for PFI and a minimal decrease in probability for risk; specifically, a 13-mm TT-TG distance is two times more likely to be found in patients with PFI. Furthermore, this threshold is estimated to increase a correct PFI diagnosis by approximately 15%. CONCLUSIONS: The MRI-specific TT-TG distance, based on a single measurement using cartilaginous-tendon landmarks within a standardized trochlear range, is reliable as performed by orthopaedists of varied experience. Patients with PFI display a 4-mm greater distance than controls, which may represent a difference large enough for clinicians to discern in practice using MRI. A 13-mm TT-TG distance is two times more likely seen in patients with PFI. However, this threshold increases a correct PFI diagnosis by only about 15%; therefore, clinical decision-making should not be influenced by this criterion alone and instead used in conjunction with other relevant variables. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level IV, diagnostic study. ",
        "Brain-based Classification of Negative Social Bias in Adolescents With Nonsuicidal Self-injury: Findings From Simulated Online Social Interaction. Background: Interpersonal stress and perceived rejection have been clinically observed as common triggers of nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI), with self-injury behavior regulating both affective and social experiences. We investigated whether the subjective interpretation of social interaction in a simulated online environment might be biased in the NSSI group, and the brain mechanisms underlying the experience. Methods: Thirty female adolescent patients with NSSI and thirty female age-matched controls were investigated in this case-control study. In our novel task that simulates interaction on current social media platforms, participants indicated whether they liked or disliked pictures of other players during a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scan. Participants also viewed positive and negative feedback directed toward them by others. The task also assessed the subjective effects of the social interaction. Finally, subjects underwent a separate facial electromyography session, which measured facial expressions processing. Outcomes: Behaviorally, the NSSI group showed a negative bias in processing social feedback from others. A multi-voxel pattern analysis (MVPA) identified brain regions that robustly classified NSSI subjects and controls. Regions in which mutual activity contributed to the classification included dorsomedial prefrontal cortex and subgenual anterior cingulate cortex, a region implicated in mood control. In the NSSI group, multi-voxel classification scores correlated with behavioral sensitivity to negative feedback from others. Results remained significant after controlling for medication, symptoms of depression, and symptoms of borderline personality disorder. Interpretation: This study identified behavioral and neural signatures of adolescents with NSSI during social interaction in a simulated social media environment. These findings highlight the importance of understanding social information processing in this clinical population and can potentially advance treatment approaches. ",
        "Unemployment in multiple sclerosis across the ages: How factors of unemployment differ among the decades of life. Rates of unemployment in multiple sclerosis are high. Certain disease, psychological, and person-specific factors contribute to these high rates. The present study examined these factors and associated risk of unemployment by age. Participants (n\u2009=\u2009221) completed an online survey on employment. Participants were broken down by decade of life. Several factors predicted whether someone felt as if they needed to leave the workforce. However, the extent to which these factors contributed to unemployment risk varied by age. Interventions aimed at maintaining employment should address these factors and take into consideration one's stage of life, disease, and career. ",
        "Association of Opioid Overdose With Opioid Prescriptions to Family Members. Importance: Prescription opioid misuse is a public health problem that leads to overdose. Although existing interventions focus on limiting prescribing to patients at high risk, individuals may still access prescription opioids dispensed to family members. Objective: To determine whether opioid prescriptions to family members were associated with overdose for individuals who themselves did not have an opioid prescription. Design, Setting, and Participants: We conducted a 1:4 matched case-control study using health care utilization data from 2004 through 2015 from a large US commercial insurance company. Eligible individuals were required to have at least 12 months of continuous enrollment and 1 or more family members in the database. Individuals who experienced overdose were identified by their first opioid overdose after the baseline period and matched to control participants by time in the database, calendar time, age, sex, and number of individuals in the family unit. Both groups were restricted to individuals with no prior opioid dispensing of their own. Data analysis was conducted from January 2018 to August 2018. Exposures: Any prior opioid dispensing to a family member, total morphine milligram equivalents dispensed to family members, and the type of opioid product dispensed. Main Outcomes and Measures: Individual odds of opioid overdose resulting in an emergency department visit or hospitalization were the primary end point. The primary analysis evaluated the odds of overdose among individuals whose family members had been dispensed an opioid. Sensitivity analyses examined the odds stratified by age and timing relative to the dispensing of opioids to family members. Results: A total of 2303 individuals who experienced opioid overdose and 9212 matched control individuals were identified. The mean (SD) age was 23.2 (18.1) years; 1158 affected individuals and 4632 control individuals (50.3%) were female. The mean (SD) time in the database before an overdose case was 3.2 (3.3) years. Prior opioid dispensing to family members was associated with individual overdose (odds ratio [OR], 2.89 [95% CI, 2.59-3.23]). There was a significant dose-response association between increasing amounts of opioids dispensed to family members and odds of overdose (>0-<50 morphine milligram equivalents per day: OR, 2.71 [95% CI, 2.42-3.03]; 50-<90 morphine milligram equivalents per day: OR, 7.80 [95% CI, 3.63-16.78]; \u226590 morphine milligram equivalents per day: OR, 15.08 [95% CI, 8.66-26.27]). Conclusions and Relevance: In this analysis, opioid prescriptions to family members were associated with overdose among individuals who do not receive opioid prescriptions. Interventions may focus on expanding access to opioid antagonists, locking prescription opioids in the home, and providing greater patient education to limit fatal overdose among family members. ",
        "Association Between Insurance and the Transfer of Children With Mental Health Emergencies. OBJECTIVES: This study sought to investigate the association between a patient's insurance coverage and a hospital's decision to admit or transfer pediatric patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) with a mental health disorder. METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study of pediatric mental health ED admission and transfer events using the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project 2014 Nationwide Emergency Department Sample. Children presenting to an ED with a primary mental health disorder who were either admitted locally or transferred to another hospital were included. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to adjust for confounders. RESULTS: Nine thousand eighty-one acute mental health ED events among children were included in the analyses. The odds of transfer relative to admission were higher for children without insurance (odds ratio, 3.30; 95% confidence interval, 1.73-6.31) compared with patients with private insurance. The odds of transfer were similar for children with Medicaid compared with children with private insurance (odds ratio, 1.23; 95% confidence interval, 0.80-1.88). Transfer rates also varied across mental health diagnostic categories. Patients without insurance had higher odds of transfer compared with those with private insurance when they presented with depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, attention-deficit/conduct disorders, and schizophrenia. CONCLUSIONS: Children presenting to an ED with a mental health emergency who do not have insurance are more likely to be transferred to another hospital than to be admitted and treated locally compared with those with private insurance. Future studies are needed to determine factors that may protect patients without insurance from disparities in access to care. ",
        "Alternate-day feeding leads to improved glucose regulation on fasting days without significant weight loss in genetically obese mice. Alternate-day fasting (ADF) is effective for weight loss and increases insulin sensitivity in diet-induced obese rodents. However, the efficacy of ADF in genetic models of obesity has not been comprehensively studied. Mice that are deficient in leptin (ob/ob mice) are obese, diabetic, and prone to deep bouts of torpor when fasted. We tested the hypotheses that an ADF protocol in ob/ob mice would result in 1) induction of torpor on fasted days, 2) minimal body weight loss if the mice experienced torpor, and 3) no improvement in glucose control in the absence of weight loss. Female ob/ob mice and littermate controls were assigned to 1) an ad libitum regimen or 2) an ADF regimen, consisting of fasting every other day with ad libitum feeding between fasts. Over a 19-day period, littermate control mice on the ADF regimen consumed the same amount of food as littermate control mice on the ad libitum regimen, whereas the ADF ob/ob mice consumed 37% less food than ad libitum ob/ob mice. Fasting days, but not fed days, led to torpor in both genotypes. Fasting days, but not fed days, led to weight loss in both genotypes relative to ad libitum controls. Fasting days, but not fed days, produced enhanced insulin sensitivity in both genotypes and normalized circulating glucose in ob/ob mice. These data demonstrate improved glucose control on fasting days with the use of ADF in a genetic model of obesity in the face of minimal weight loss. ",
        "Types of Substance Use and Punitive Parenting: A Preliminary Exploration. Very little is known about how type of substance use is comparatively related to a range of parenting behaviors. We conduct a preliminary examination to ascertain effects of substance type on physical abuse compared with other child discipline tactics with data from a telephone survey in 2009 of 3,023 parents in 50 cities in California. Kruskal-Wallis tests and hierarchical generalized linear models are conducted to determine the relationship between substance type and frequency of nonviolent discipline, corporal punishment, and child physical abuse. Type of drug used is differentially related to use of discipline strategies in multivariate models. Nonviolent discipline and corporal punishment show a dose-response relationship when a parent who reported using more substances also reported using both types of discipline more frequently. We suggest that addiction professionals should consider partnering with a specialist in child development or child welfare to conduct in-depth assessments of parenting strategies among the highest-risk groups, such as those with past-year alcohol use or a history of polysubstance use or methamphetamine use.

        "The longevity-promoting factor, TCER-1, widely represses stress resistance and innate immunity. Stress resistance and longevity are positively correlated but emerging evidence indicates that they are physiologically distinct. Identifying factors with distinctive roles in these processes is challenging because pro-longevity genes often enhance stress resistance. We demonstrate that TCER-1, the Caenorhabditis elegans homolog of human transcription elongation and splicing factor, TCERG1, has opposite effects on lifespan and stress resistance. We previously showed that tcer-1 promotes longevity in germline-less C. elegans and reproductive fitness in wild-type animals. Surprisingly, tcer-1 mutants exhibit exceptional resistance against multiple stressors, including infection by human opportunistic pathogens, whereas, TCER-1 overexpression confers immuno-susceptibility. TCER-1 inhibits immunity only during fertile stages of life. Elevating its levels ameliorates the fertility loss caused by infection, suggesting that TCER-1 represses immunity to augment fecundity. TCER-1 acts through repression of PMK-1 as well as PMK-1-independent factors critical for innate immunity. Our data establish key roles for TCER-1 in coordinating immunity, longevity and fertility, and reveal mechanisms that distinguish length of life from functional aspects of aging. ",
        "Bacterial septic arthritis infections associated with intra-articular injection practices for osteoarthritis knee pain-New Jersey, 2017. BACKGROUND: In March 2017, the New Jersey Department of Health received reports of 3 patients who developed septic arthritis after receiving intra-articular injections for osteoarthritis knee pain at the same private outpatient facility in New Jersey. The risk of septic arthritis resulting from intra-articular injection is low. However, outbreaks of septic arthritis associated with unsafe injection practices in outpatient settings have been reported. METHODS: An infection prevention assessment of the implicated facility's practices was conducted because of the ongoing risk to public health. The assessment included an environmental inspection of the facility, staff interviews, infection prevention practice observations, and a medical record and office document review. A call for cases was disseminated to healthcare providers in New Jersey to identify patients treated at the facility who developed septic arthritis after receiving intra-articular injections. RESULTS: We identified 41 patients with septic arthritis associated with intra-articular injections. Cultures of synovial fluid or tissue from 15 of these 41 case patients (37%) recovered bacteria consistent with oral flora. The infection prevention assessment of facility practices identified multiple breaches of recommended infection prevention practices, including inadequate hand hygiene, unsafe injection practices, and poor cleaning and disinfection practices. No additional cases were identified after infection prevention recommendations were implemented by the facility. DISCUSSION: Aseptic technique is imperative when handling, preparing, and administering injectable medications to prevent microbial contamination. CONCLUSIONS: This investigation highlights the importance of adhering to infection prevention recommendations. All healthcare personnel who prepare, handle, and administer injectable medications should be trained in infection prevention and safe injection practices. ",
        "Oxidative stress in vagal neurons promotes parkinsonian pathology and intercellular \u03b1-synuclein transfer. Specific neuronal populations display high vulnerability to pathological processes in Parkinson's disease (PD). The dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus nerve (DMnX) is a primary site of pathological \u03b1-synuclein deposition and may play a key role in the spreading of \u03b1-synuclein lesions within and outside the CNS. Using in vivo models, we show that cholinergic neurons forming this nucleus are particularly susceptible to oxidative challenges and accumulation of reactive oxidative species (ROS). Targeted \u03b1-synuclein overexpression within these neurons triggered an oxidative stress that became significantly more pronounced after exposure to the ROS-generating agent paraquat. A more severe oxidative stress resulted in enhanced production of oxidatively modified forms of \u03b1-synuclein, increased \u03b1-synuclein aggregation into oligomeric species and marked degeneration of DMnX neurons. Enhanced oxidative stress also affected neuron-to-neuron protein transfer, causing an increased spreading of \u03b1-synuclein from the DMnX toward more rostral brain regions. In vitro experiments confirmed a greater propensity of \u03b1-synuclein to pass from cell to cell under pro-oxidant conditions, and identified nitrated \u03b1-synuclein forms as highly transferable protein species. These findings substantiate the relevance of oxidative injury in PD pathogenetic processes, establish a relationship between oxidative stress and vulnerability to \u03b1-synuclein pathology and define a new mechanism, enhanced cell-to-cell \u03b1-synuclein transmission, by which oxidative stress could promote PD development and progression.

        "Radiation maps of ocean sediment from the Castle Bravo crater. On March 1, 1954, the United States conducted its largest thermonuclear weapon test in Bikini Atoll in the Marshall Islands; the detonation was code-named \"Castle Bravo.\" Radioactive deposits in the ocean sediment at the bomb crater are widespread and high levels of contamination remain today. One hundred thirty cores were collected from the top 25 cm of surface sediment at ocean depths approaching 60 m over a \u223c2-km2 area, allowing for a presentation of radiation maps of the Bravo crater site. Radiochemical analyses were performed on the following radionuclides: plutonium-(239,240), plutonium-238, americium-241, bismuth-207, and cesium-137. Large values of plutonium-(239,240), americium-241, and bismuth-207 are found. Comparisons are made to core sample results from other areas in the northern Marshall Islands. ",
        "Reproducibility of Brain Responses: High for Speech Perception, Low for Reading Difficulties. Neuroscience findings have recently received critique on the lack of replications. To examine the reproducibility of brain indices of speech sound discrimination and their role in dyslexia, a specific reading difficulty, brain event-related potentials using EEG were measured using the same cross-linguistic passive oddball paradigm in about 200 dyslexics and 200 typically reading 8-12-year-old children from four countries with different native languages. Brain responses indexing speech and non-speech sound discrimination were extremely reproducible, supporting the validity and reliability of cognitive neuroscience methods. Significant differences between typical and dyslexic readers were found when examined separately in different country and language samples. However, reading group differences occurred at different time windows and for different stimulus types between the four countries. This finding draws attention to the limited generalizability of atypical brain response findings in children with dyslexia across language environments and raises questions about a common neurobiological factor for dyslexia. Our results thus show the robustness of neuroscience methods in general while highlighting the need for multi-sample studies in the brain research of language disorders. ",
        "Toward point-of-care assessment of patient response: a portable tool for rapidly assessing cancer drug efficacy using multifrequency impedance cytometry and supervised machine learning. We present a novel method to rapidly assess drug efficacy in targeted cancer therapy, where antineoplastic agents are conjugated to antibodies targeting surface markers on tumor cells. We have fabricated and characterized a device capable of rapidly assessing tumor cell sensitivity to drugs using multifrequency impedance spectroscopy in combination with supervised machine learning for enhanced classification accuracy. Currently commercially available devices for the automated analysis of cell viability are based on staining, which fundamentally limits the subsequent characterization of these cells as well as downstream molecular analysis. Our approach requires as little as 20\u2009\u03bcL of volume and avoids staining allowing for further downstream molecular analysis. To the best of our knowledge, this manuscript presents the first comprehensive attempt to using high-dimensional data and supervised machine learning, particularly phase change spectra obtained from multi-frequency impedance cytometry as features for the support vector machine classifier, to assess viability of cells without staining or labelling.

        "School-based programs for Supporting the mental health and psychosocial wellbeing of adolescent forced migrants in high-income countries: A scoping review. As communities around the world continue to receive record-setting numbers of newcomers fleeing armed conflict, schools play a central role in supporting these families through the challenges of adjustment. Policymakers and educators in several high-income countries have begun to invest in efforts to support these young forced migrants not only academically, but also socially and emotionally. This study reviews the published and grey literature on 20 school-based programs aimed at improving the mental health and psychosocial wellbeing of adolescent forced migrants in high-income countries from 2000 to 2019. This review seeks to inform a more comprehensive and detailed understanding of the types of program options available to schools, while also identifying gaps in the current literature related to factors influencing program implementation. We find several common approaches and challenges to supporting adolescent forced migrants, as well as their families, communities, schools, and service providers. The reviewed programs faced recurring challenges related to intercultural exchange, gaining access to communities, promoting care-seeking, school capacity limitations, and sustainability. The lessons learned from these programs indicate that several steps can be taken to mitigate these challenges, including adapting services to individuals and their contexts, taking a multi-layered approach that addresses multiple levels of young people's social ecologies, and building trusting, collaborative partnerships with schools, communities, and students.

        "Loss of Slug Compromises DNA Damage Repair and Accelerates Stem Cell Aging in Mammary Epithelium. DNA damage activates checkpoints that limit the replicative potential of stem cells, including differentiation. These checkpoints protect against cancer development but also promote tissue aging. Because mice lacking Slug/Snai2 exhibit limited stem cell activity, including luminobasal differentiation, and are protected from mammary cancer, we reasoned that Slug might regulate DNA damage checkpoints in mammary epithelial cells. Here, we show that Slug facilitates efficient execution of RPA32-mediated DNA damage response (DDR) signaling. Slug deficiency leads to delayed phosphorylation of ataxia telangiectasia mutated and Rad3-related protein (ATR) and its effectors RPA32 and CHK1. This leads to impaired RAD51 recruitment to DNA damage sites and persistence of unresolved DNA damage. In\u00a0vivo, Slug/Snai2 loss leads to increased DNA damage and premature aging of mammary epithelium. Collectively, our work demonstrates that the mammary stem cell regulator Slug controls DDR checkpoints by dually inhibiting differentiation and facilitating DDR repair, and its loss causes unresolved DNA damage and accelerated aging.

        "Genome-wide association study identifies eight risk loci and implicates metabo-psychiatric origins for anorexia nervosa. Characterized primarily by a low body-mass index, anorexia nervosa is a complex and serious illness1, affecting 0.9-4% of women and 0.3% of men2-4, with twin-based heritability estimates of 50-60%5. Mortality rates are higher than those in other psychiatric disorders6, and outcomes are unacceptably poor7. Here we combine data from the Anorexia Nervosa Genetics Initiative (ANGI)8,9 and the Eating Disorders Working Group of the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC-ED) and conduct a genome-wide association study of 16,992\u2009cases of anorexia nervosa and 55,525\u2009controls, identifying eight significant loci. The genetic architecture of anorexia nervosa mirrors its clinical presentation, showing significant genetic correlations with psychiatric disorders, physical activity, and metabolic (including glycemic), lipid and anthropometric traits, independent of the effects of common variants associated with body-mass index. These results further encourage a reconceptualization of anorexia nervosa as a metabo-psychiatric disorder. Elucidating the metabolic component is a critical direction for future research, and paying attention to both psychiatric and metabolic components may be key to improving outcomes. ",
        "Current infection prevention and antibiotic stewardship program practices: A survey of the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America (SHEA) Research Network (SRN). We used a survey to characterize contemporary infection prevention and antibiotic stewardship program practices across 64 healthcare facilities, and we compared these findings to those of a similar 2013 survey. Notable findings include decreased frequency of active surveillance for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, frequent active surveillance for carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae, and increased support for antibiotic stewardship programs.

        "US Food and Drug Administration Reports of Pregnancy and Pregnancy-Related Adverse Events Associated With Isotretinoin. Importance: iPLEDGE is a rigorous program initiated in 2006 to reduce fetal exposure to isotretinoin, a disease-modifying medication for acne that carries a risk of teratogenesis. Despite the imposition of iPLEDGE requirements on patients and clinicians, the scope of isotretinoin-related adverse events is unknown. Objective: To determine the frequency and rate of pregnancy and pregnancy-related adverse events among women taking isotretinoin reported to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Design, Setting, and Participants: Pregnancy reports from the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System, a public database of medication adverse event reports filed by prescribers, consumers, and manufacturers, were used to perform a retrospective analysis of pregnancy-related adverse events associated with isotretinoin from January 1, 1997, to December 31, 2017. Each individual reporting any pregnancy-related adverse event signified 1 pregnancy. Abortions, pregnancies that occurred while contraception was used, and fetal defects were counted as subgroups of total pregnancy events. Main Outcomes and Measures: The frequency of pregnancy and of pregnancy-related events (abortions, pregnancies that occurred while using contraception, and fetal defects) were stratified by year that the FDA was notified of the event and by age. The rates of adverse events were calculated using isotretinoin prescribing data. Results: There was a total of 6740 pregnancies among women taking isotretinoin reported to the FDA from 1997 to 2017, peaking in 2006 (768 pregnancies) before settling into a range of 218 to 310 annual reports of pregnancy after 2011. The mean (SD) age of the women was 24.6 (7.1) years. The rate of pregnancy for females of childbearing potential was between 0.33% (388 of 115 925) and 0.65% (768 of 117 784), with a peak in 2006. Although pregnancies, abortions, and fetal defects among women taking isotretinoin have decreased since the initiation of iPLEDGE in 2006, all 3 persist. Conclusions and Relevance: The number of reports of pregnancies, abortions, and fetal defects among women taking isotretinoin has decreased since peaking around the initiation of iPLEDGE in 2006. Explanations for this trend include a broader national decrease in teenage pregnancies and abortion rates, improvements in access to effective long-term and emergency contraception, stringent iPLEDGE requirements, and reporting fatigue over time. Despite the decrease, persistent reporting of pregnancy-related events in the last decade warrants investigation into the efficacy of iPLEDGE and exploration of new approaches for lowering fetal exposure to isotretinoin.

        "Effects of Genetically Determined Iron Status on Risk of Venous Thromboembolism and Carotid Atherosclerotic Disease: A Mendelian Randomization Study. Background Systemic iron status has been implicated in atherosclerosis and thrombosis. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of genetically determined iron status on carotid intima-media thickness, carotid plaque, and venous thromboembolism using Mendelian randomization. Methods and Results Genetic instrumental variables for iron status were selected from a genome-wide meta-analysis of 48\u00a0972 subjects. Genetic association estimates for carotid intima-media thickness and carotid plaque were obtained using data from 71\u00a0128 and 48\u00a0434 participants, respectively, and estimates for venous thromboembolism were obtained using data from a study incorporating 7507 cases and 52\u00a0632 controls. Conventional 2-sample summary data Mendelian randomization was performed for the main analysis. Higher genetically determined iron status was associated with increased risk of venous thromboembolism. Odds ratios per SD increase in biomarker levels were 1.37 (95% CI 1.14-1.66) for serum iron, 1.25 (1.09-1.43) for transferrin saturation, 1.92 (1.28-2.88) for ferritin, and 0.76 (0.63-0.92) for serum transferrin (with higher transferrin levels representing lower iron status). In contrast, higher iron status was associated with lower risk of carotid plaque. Corresponding odds ratios were 0.85 (0.73-0.99) for serum iron and 0.89 (0.80-1.00) for transferrin saturation, with concordant trends for serum transferrin and ferritin that did not reach statistical significance. There was no Mendelian randomization evidence of an effect of iron status on carotid intima-media thickness. Conclusions These findings support previous work to suggest that higher genetically determined iron status is protective against some forms of atherosclerotic disease but increases the risk of thrombosis related to stasis of blood.

        "Endovascular Fenestration/Stenting First Followed by Delayed Open Aortic Repair for Acute Type A Aortic Dissection With Malperfusion Syndrome. BACKGROUND: Immediate open repair of acute type A aortic dissection is traditionally recommended to prevent death from aortic rupture. However, organ failure because of malperfusion syndrome (MPS) might be the most imminent life-threatening problem for a subset of patients. METHODS: From 1996 to 2017, among 597 patients with acute type A aortic dissection, 135 patients with MPS were treated with upfront endovascular reperfusion (fenestration/stenting) followed by delayed open repair (OR). We compared outcomes between the first and second decades and observed mortalities with those expected with an \"upfront OR for every patient\" approach, determined using prognostic models from the literature (Verona, Leipzig-Halifax, Stockholm, Penn, and GERAADA [German Registry for Acute Aortic Dissection Type A] models). RESULTS: Overall, in-hospital mortality improved between the 2 decades (21.0% versus 10.7%, P<0.001). In the second decade, for patients with MPS initially treated with fenestration/stenting, mortality from aortic rupture decreased from 16% to 4% ( P=0.05), the risk of dying from organ failure was 6.6 times higher than dying from aortic rupture (hazard ratio=6.63; 95% CI, 1.5-29; P=0.01), and 30-day mortality after OR for MPS patients was 3.7%. Compared to the expected mortalities with the upfront OR for every patient models, our observed 30-day and in-hospital mortalities (9% and 11%, respectively) of all patients with acute type A aortic dissection were significantly lower ( P\u22640.03). CONCLUSIONS: Immediate OR is the strategy to prevent death from aortic rupture for the majority of patients with acute type A aortic dissection. However, relatively stable (no rupture, no tamponade) patients with MPS benefit from a staged approach: upfront endovascular reperfusion followed by aortic OR at resolution of organ failure. ",
        "PPAR-gamma agonist pioglitazone modifies craving intensity and brain white matter integrity in patients with primary cocaine use disorder: a double-blind randomized controlled pilot trial. BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Pioglitazone (PIO), a potent agonist of PPAR-gamma, is a promising candidate treatment for cocaine use disorder (CUD). We tested the effects of PIO on targeted mechanisms relevant to CUD: cocaine craving and brain white matter (WM) integrity. Feasibility, medication compliance and tolerability were evaluated. DESIGN: Two-arm double-blind randomized controlled proof-of-concept pilot trial of PIO or placebo (PLC). SETTING: Single-site out-patient treatment research clinic in Houston, TX, USA. PARTICIPANTS: Thirty treatment-seeking adults, 18 to 60 years old, with CUD. Eighteen participants (8\u00a0=\u00a0PIO; 10\u00a0=\u00a0PLC) completed diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) of WM integrity at pre-/post-treatment. INTERVENTION: Study medication was dispensed at thrice weekly visits along with once-weekly cognitive behavioral therapy for 12\u00a0weeks. MEASUREMENTS: Measures of target engagement mechanisms of interest included cocaine craving assessed by the Brief Substance Craving Scale (BSCS), the Obsessive Compulsive Drug Use Scale (OCDUS), a visual analog scale (VAS) and change in WM integrity. Feasibility measures included number completing treatment, medication compliance (riboflavin detection) and tolerability (side effects, serious adverse events). FINDINGS: Target engagement change in mechanisms of interest, defined as a \u2265\u00a00.75 Bayesian posterior probability of an interaction existing favoring PIO over PLC, was demonstrated on measures of craving (BSCS, VAS) and WM integrity indexed by fractional anisotropy (FA) values. Outcomes indicated greater decrease in craving and greater increase in FA values in the PIO group. Feasibility was demonstrated by high completion rates among those starting treatment (21/26\u00a0=\u00a080%) and medication compliance (\u2265 80%). There were no reported serious adverse events for PIO. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with placebo, patients receiving pioglitazone show a higher likelihood of reduced cocaine craving and improved brain white matter integrity as a function of time in treatment. Pioglitazone shows good feasibility as a treatment for cocaine use disorder. ",
        "AEBP1 expression increases with severity of fibrosis in NASH and is regulated by glucose, palmitate, and miR-372-3p. Factors governing the development of liver fibrosis in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) are only partially understood. We recently identified adipocyte enhancer binding protein 1 (AEBP1) as a member of a core set of dysregulated fibrosis-specific genes in human NASH. Here we sought to investigate the relationship between AEBP1 and hepatic fibrosis. We confirmed that hepatic AEBP1 expression is elevated in fibrosis compared to lobular inflammation, steatosis, and normal liver, and increases with worsening fibrosis in NASH patients. AEBP1 expression was upregulated 5.8-fold in activated hepatic stellate cells and downregulated during chemical and contact induction of biological quiescence. In LX-2 and HepG2 cells treated with high glucose (25 mM), AEBP1 expression increased over 7-fold compared to normal glucose conditions. In response to treatment with either fructose or palmitate, AEBP1 expression in primary human hepatocytes increased 2.4-fold or 9.6-fold, but was upregulated 55.8-fold in the presence of fructose and palmitate together. AEBP1 knockdown resulted in decreased expression of nine genes previously identified to be part of a predicted AEBP1-associated NASH co-regulatory network and confirmed to be upregulated in fibrotic tissue. We identified binding sites for two miRNAs known to be downregulated in NASH fibrosis, miR-372-3p and miR-373-3p in the AEBP1 3' untranslated region. Both miRNAs functionally interacted with AEBP1 to regulate its expression. These findings indicate a novel AEBP1-mediated pathway in the pathogenesis of hepatic fibrosis in NASH. ",
        "Absence of NKG2D ligands defines leukaemia stem cells and mediates their immune evasion. Patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) often achieve remission after therapy, but subsequently die of relapse1 that is driven by chemotherapy-resistant leukaemic stem cells (LSCs)2,3. LSCs are defined by their capacity to initiate leukaemia in immunocompromised mice4. However, this precludes analyses of their interaction with lymphocytes as components of anti-tumour immunity5, which LSCs must escape to induce cancer. Here we demonstrate that stemness and immune evasion are closely intertwined in AML. Using xenografts of human AML as well as syngeneic mouse models of leukaemia, we show that ligands of the danger detector NKG2D-a critical mediator of anti-tumour immunity by cytotoxic lymphocytes, such as NK cells6-9-are generally expressed on bulk AML cells but not on LSCs. AML cells with LSC properties can be isolated by their lack of expression of NKG2D ligands (NKG2DLs) in both CD34-expressing and non-CD34-expressing cases of AML. AML cells that express NKG2DLs are cleared by NK cells, whereas NKG2DL-negative leukaemic cells isolated from the same individual escape cell killing by NK cells. These NKG2DL-negative AML cells show an immature morphology, display molecular and functional stemness characteristics, and can initiate serially re-transplantable leukaemia and survive chemotherapy in patient-derived xenotransplant models. Mechanistically, poly-ADP-ribose polymerase 1 (PARP1) represses expression of NKG2DLs. Genetic or pharmacologic inhibition of PARP1 induces NKG2DLs on the LSC surface but not on healthy or pre-leukaemic cells. Treatment with PARP1 inhibitors, followed by transfer of polyclonal NK cells, suppresses leukaemogenesis in patient-derived xenotransplant models. In summary, our data link the LSC concept to immune escape and provide a strong rationale for targeting therapy-resistant LSCs by PARP1 inhibition, which renders them amenable to control by NK\u00a0cells in vivo.

        "HokB Monomerization and Membrane Repolarization Control Persister Awakening. Every bacterial population harbors a small subpopulation of so-called persisters that are transiently antibiotic tolerant. These persisters are associated with the recalcitrance of chronic infections because they can recolonize the host after antibiotic removal. Although several effectors have been described to induce persistence, persister cell awakening is poorly understood. We previously reported that the toxin HokB induces persistence via pore formation, resulting in membrane depolarization and ATP leakage. We now delineate mechanisms responsible for the awakening of HokB-induced persisters. We show that HokB dimerization by the oxidoreductase DsbA is essential for pore formation and peptide stability. Pores are disassembled via DsbC-mediated monomerization, which targets HokB for DegQ-mediated degradation. Finally, pore disassembly allows membrane repolarization by the electron transport chain, supporting cells to resume growth. These results provide a detailed view of both the formation and awakening of HokB-induced persister cells. ",
        "Adenoviral Infections in Singapore: Should New Antiviral Therapies and Vaccines Be Adopted?. BACKGROUND: A number of serious human adenovirus (HAdV) outbreaks have been recently reported: HAdV-B7 (Israel, Singapore, and USA), HAdV-B7d (USA and China), HAdV-D8, -D54, and -C2 (Japan), HAdV-B14p1 (USA, Europe, and China), and HAdV-B55 (China, Singapore, and France). METHODS: To understand the epidemiology of HAdV infections in Singapore, we studied 533 HAdV-positive clinical samples collected from 396 pediatric and 137 adult patients in Singapore from 2012 to 2018. Genome sequencing and phylogenetic analyses were performed to identify HAdV genotypes, clonal clusters, and recombinant or novel HAdVs. RESULTS: The most prevalent genotypes identified were HAdV-B3 (35.6%), HAdV-B7 (15.4%), and HAdV-E4 (15.2%). We detected 4 new HAdV-C strains and detected incursions with HAdV-B7 (odds ratio [OR], 14.6; 95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1-52.0) and HAdV-E4 (OR, 13.6; 95% CI, 3.9-46.7) among pediatric patients over time. In addition, immunocompromised patients (adjusted OR [aOR], 11.4; 95% CI, 3.8-34.8) and patients infected with HAdV-C2 (aOR, 8.5; 95% CI, 1.5-48.0), HAdV-B7 (aOR, 3.7; 95% CI, 1.2-10.9), or HAdV-E4 (aOR, 3.2; 95% CI, 1.1-8.9) were at increased risk for severe disease. CONCLUSIONS: Singapore would benefit from more frequent studies of clinical HAdV genotypes to identify patients at risk for severe disease and help guide the use of new antiviral therapies, such as brincidofovir, and potential administration of HAdV 4 and 7 vaccine.

        "Changes in nuclear and cytoplasmic microRNA distribution in response to hypoxic stress. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that have well-characterized roles in cytoplasmic gene regulation, where they act by binding to mRNA transcripts and inhibiting their translation (i.e. post-transcriptional gene silencing, PTGS). However, miRNAs have also been implicated in transcriptional gene regulation and alternative splicing, events that are restricted to the cell nucleus. Here we performed nuclear-cytoplasmic fractionation in a mouse endothelial cell line and characterized the localization of miRNAs in response to hypoxia using small RNA sequencing. A highly diverse population of abundant miRNA species was detected in the nucleus, of which the majority (56%) was found to be preferentially localized in one compartment or the other. Induction of hypoxia resulted in changes in miRNA levels in both nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments, with the majority of changes being restricted to one location and not the other. Notably, the classical hypoxamiR (miR-210-3p) was highly up-regulated in the nuclear compartment after hypoxic stimulus. These findings reveal a previously unappreciated level of molecular complexity in the physiological response occurring in ischemic tissue. Furthermore, widespread differential miRNA expression in the nucleus strongly suggests that these small RNAs are likely to perform extensive nuclear regulatory functions in the general case. ",
        "A frequent variant in the Japanese population determines quasi-Mendelian inheritance of rare retinal ciliopathy. Hereditary retinal degenerations (HRDs) are Mendelian diseases characterized by progressive blindness and caused by ultra-rare mutations. In a genomic screen of 331 unrelated Japanese patients, we identify a disruptive Alu insertion and a nonsense variant (p.Arg1933*) in the ciliary gene RP1, neither of which are rare alleles in Japan. p.Arg1933* is almost polymorphic (frequency\u2009=\u20090.6%, amongst 12,000 individuals), does not cause disease in homozygosis or heterozygosis, and yet is significantly enriched in HRD patients (frequency\u2009=\u20092.1%, i.e., a 3.5-fold enrichment; p-value\u2009=\u20099.2\u2009\u00d7\u200910-5). Familial co-segregation and association analyses show that p.Arg1933* can act as a Mendelian mutation in trans with the Alu insertion, but might also associate with disease in combination with two alleles in the EYS gene in a non-Mendelian pattern of heredity. Our results suggest that rare conditions such as HRDs can be paradoxically determined by relatively common variants, following a quasi-Mendelian model linking monogenic and complex inheritance. ",
        "Allele-specific gene editing prevents deafness in a model of dominant progressive hearing loss. Since most dominant human mutations are single nucleotide substitutions1,2, we explored gene editing strategies to disrupt dominant mutations efficiently and selectively without affecting wild-type alleles. However, single nucleotide discrimination can be difficult to achieve3 because commonly used endonucleases, such as Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 (SpCas9), can tolerate up to seven mismatches between guide RNA (gRNA) and target DNA. Furthermore, the protospacer-adjacent motif (PAM) in some Cas9 enzymes can tolerate mismatches with the target DNA3,4. To circumvent these limitations, we screened 14 Cas9/gRNA combinations for specific and efficient disruption of a nucleotide substitution that causes the dominant progressive hearing loss, DFNA36. As a model for DFNA36, we used Beethoven mice5, which harbor a point mutation in Tmc1, a gene required for hearing that encodes a pore-forming subunit of mechanosensory transduction channels in inner-ear hair cells6. We identified a PAM variant of Staphylococcus aureus Cas9 (SaCas9-KKH) that selectively and efficiently disrupted the mutant allele, but not the wild-type Tmc1/TMC1 allele, in Beethoven mice and in a DFNA36 human cell line. Adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated SaCas9-KKH delivery prevented deafness in Beethoven mice up to one year post injection. Analysis of current ClinVar entries revealed that ~21% of dominant human mutations could be targeted using a similar approach. ",
        "Numerous Fasciola plasminogen-binding proteins may underlie blood-brain barrier leakage and explain neurological disorder complexity and heterogeneity in the acute and chronic phases of human fascioliasis. Human fascioliasis is a worldwide, pathogenic food-borne trematodiasis. Impressive clinical pictures comprising puzzling polymorphisms, manifestation multifocality, disease evolution changes, sequelae and mortality, have been reported in patients presenting with neurological, meningeal, neuropsychic and ocular disorders caused at distance by flukes infecting the liver. Proteomic and mass spectrometry analyses of the Fasciola hepatica excretome/secretome identified numerous, several new, plasminogen-binding proteins enhancing plasmin generation. This may underlie blood-brain barrier leakage whether by many simultaneously migrating, small-sized juvenile flukes in the acute phase, or by breakage of encapsulating formations triggered by single worm tracks in the chronic phase. Blood-brain barrier leakages may subsequently occur due to a fibrinolytic system-dependent mechanism involving plasmin-dependent generation of the proinflammatory peptide bradykinin and activation of bradykinin B2 receptors, after different plasminogen-binding protein agglomeration waves. Interactions between diverse parasitic situations and non-imbalancing fibrinolysis system alterations are for the first time proposed that explain the complexity, heterogeneity and timely variations of neurological disorders. Additionally, inflammation and dilation of blood vessels may be due to contact system-dependent generation bradykinin. This baseline allows for search of indicators to detect neurological risk in fascioliasis patients and experimental work on antifibrinolytic treatments or B2 receptor antagonists for preventing blood-brain barrier leakage.

        "Brain somatic mutations observed in Alzheimer's disease associated with aging and dysregulation of tau phosphorylation. The role of brain somatic mutations in Alzheimer's disease (AD) is not well understood. Here, we perform deep whole-exome sequencing (average read depth 584\u00d7) in 111 postmortem hippocampal formation and matched blood samples from 52 patients with AD and 11 individuals\u00a0not affected by AD. The number of somatic single nucleotide variations (SNVs) in AD brain specimens increases significantly with aging, and the rate of mutation accumulation in the brain is 4.8-fold slower than that in AD blood. The putatively pathogenic brain somatic mutations identified in 26.9% (14 of 52) of AD individuals are enriched in PI3K-AKT, MAPK, and AMPK pathway genes known to contribute to hyperphosphorylation of tau. We show that a pathogenic brain somatic mutation in PIN1 leads to a loss-of-function mutation. In vitro mimicking of haploinsufficiency of PIN1 aberrantly increases tau phosphorylation and aggregation. This study provides new insights into the genetic architecture underlying the pathogenesis of AD. ",
        "The Liberfarb syndrome, a multisystem disorder affecting eye, ear, bone, and brain development, is caused by a founder pathogenic variant in thePISD gene. PURPOSE: We observed four individuals in two unrelated but consanguineous families from Portugal and Brazil affected by early-onset retinal degeneration, sensorineural hearing loss, microcephaly, intellectual disability, and skeletal dysplasia with scoliosis and short stature. The phenotype precisely matched that of an individual of Azorean descent published in 1986 by Liberfarb and coworkers. METHODS: Patients underwent specialized clinical examinations (including ophthalmological, audiological, orthopedic, radiological, and developmental assessment). Exome and targeted sequencing was performed on selected individuals. Minigene constructs were assessed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and Sanger sequencing. RESULTS: Affected individuals shared a 3.36-Mb region of autozygosity on chromosome 22q12.2, including a 10-bp deletion (NM_014338.3:c.904-12_904-3delCTATCACCAC), immediately upstream of the last exon of the PISD (phosphatidylserine decarboxylase) gene. Sequencing of PISD from paraffin-embedded tissue from the 1986 case revealed the identical homozygous variant. In HEK293T cells, this variant led to aberrant splicing of PISD transcripts. CONCLUSION: We have identified the genetic etiology of the Liberfarb syndrome, affecting brain, eye, ear, bone, and connective tissue. Our work documents the migration of a rare Portuguese founder variant to two continents and highlights the link between phospholipid metabolism and bone formation, sensory defects, and cerebral development, while raising the possibility of therapeutic phospholipid replacement.

        "How the Brain Transitions from Conscious to Subliminal Perception. We study the transition in the functional networks that characterize the human brains' conscious-state to an unconscious subliminal state of perception by using k-core percolation. We find that the most inner core (i.e., the most connected kernel) of the conscious-state functional network corresponds to areas which remain functionally active when the brain transitions from the conscious-state to the subliminal-state. That is, the inner core of the conscious network coincides with the subliminal-state. Mathematical modeling allows to interpret the conscious to subliminal transition as driven by k-core percolation, through which the conscious state is lost by the inactivation of the peripheral k-shells of the conscious functional network. Thus, the inner core and most robust component of the conscious brain corresponds to the unconscious subliminal state. This finding imposes constraints to theoretical models of consciousness, in that the location of the core of the functional brain network is in the unconscious part of the brain rather than in the conscious state as previously thought.

        "TRESK K+ Channel Activity Regulates Trigeminal Nociception and Headache. Although TWIK-related spinal cord K+ (TRESK) channel is expressed in all primary afferent neurons in trigeminal ganglia (TG) and dorsal root ganglia (DRG), whether TRESK activity regulates trigeminal pain processing is still not established. Dominant-negative TRESK mutations are associated with migraine but not with other types of pain in humans, suggesting that genetic TRESK dysfunction preferentially affects the generation of trigeminal pain, especially headache. Using TRESK global knock-out mice as a model system, we found that loss of TRESK in all TG neurons selectively increased the intrinsic excitability of small-diameter nociceptors, especially those that do not bind to isolectin B4 (IB4-). Similarly, loss of TRESK resulted in hyper-excitation of the small IB4- dural afferent neurons but not those that bind to IB4 (IB4+). Compared with wild-type littermates, both male and female TRESK knock-out mice exhibited more robust trigeminal nociceptive behaviors, including headache-related behaviors, whereas their body and visceral pain responses were normal. Interestingly, neither the total persistent outward current nor the intrinsic excitability was altered in adult TRESK knock-out DRG neurons, which may explain why genetic TRESK dysfunction is not associated with body and/or visceral pain in humans. We reveal for the first time that, among all primary afferent neurons, TG nociceptors are the most vulnerable to the genetic loss of TRESK. Our findings indicate that endogenous TRESK activity regulates trigeminal nociception, likely through controlling the intrinsic excitability of TG nociceptors. Importantly, we provide evidence that genetic loss of TRESK significantly increases the likelihood of developing headache. ",
        "The Cardiac Microenvironment Instructs Divergent Monocyte Fates and Functions in Myocarditis. Two types of monocytes, Ly6Chi and Ly6Clo, infiltrate the heart in murine experimental autoimmune myocarditis (EAM). We discovered a role for cardiac fibroblasts in facilitating monocyte-to-macrophage differentiation of both Ly6Chi and Ly6Clo cells, allowing these macrophages to perform divergent functions in myocarditis progression. During the acute phase of EAM, IL-17A is highly abundant. It signals through cardiac fibroblasts to attenuate efferocytosis of Ly6Chi monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) and simultaneously prevents Ly6Clo monocyte-to-macrophage differentiation. We demonstrated an inverse clinical correlation between heart IL-17A levels and efferocytic receptor expressions in humans with heart failure (HF). In the absence of IL-17A signaling, Ly6Chi MDMs act as robust phagocytes and are less pro-inflammatory, whereas Ly6Clo monocytes resume their differentiation into MHCII+ macrophages. We propose that MHCII+Ly6Clo MDMs are associated with the reduction of cardiac fibrosis and prevention of the myocarditis sequalae. ",
        "Increased association between Epstein-Barr virus EBNA2 from type 2 strains and the transcriptional repressor BS69 restricts EBNA2 activity. Natural variation separates Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) into type 1 and type 2 strains. Type 2 EBV is less transforming in vitro due to sequence differences in the EBV transcription factor EBNA2. This correlates with reduced activation of the EBV oncogene LMP1 and some cell genes. Transcriptional activation by type 1 EBNA2 can be suppressed through the binding of two PXLXP motifs in its transactivation domain (TAD) to the dimeric coiled-coil MYND domain (CC-MYND) of the BS69 repressor protein (ZMYND11). We identified a third conserved PXLXP motif in type 2 EBNA2. We found that type 2 EBNA2 peptides containing this motif bound BS69CC-MYND efficiently and that the type 2 EBNA2TAD bound an additional BS69CC-MYND molecule. Full-length type 2 EBNA2 also bound BS69 more efficiently in pull-down assays. Molecular weight analysis and low-resolution structures obtained using small-angle X-ray scattering showed that three BS69CC-MYND dimers bound two molecules of type 2 EBNA2TAD, in line with the dimeric state of full-length EBNA2 in vivo. Importantly, mutation of the third BS69 binding motif in type 2 EBNA2 improved B-cell growth maintenance and the transcriptional activation of the LMP1 and CXCR7 genes. Our data indicate that increased association with BS69 restricts the function of type 2 EBNA2 as a transcriptional activator and driver of B cell growth and may contribute to reduced B-cell transformation by type 2 EBV.

        "Vaccine against gastrin, a polyclonal antibody stimulator, decreases pancreatic cancer metastases. Growth of pancreatic cancer is stimulated by gastrin in both a paracrine and an autocrine fashion. Traditional therapies have not significantly improved survival, and recently pancreatic cancer has been deemed a \"cold\" tumor due to its poor response to immunotherapy. Strategies to improve survival of pancreatic cancer are desperately needed. In the current investigation, we studied the effects of an anti-gastrin cancer vaccine, polyclonal antibody stimulator (PAS; formerly called G17DT and Gastrimmune), used alone or in combination with a programmed cell death receptor (PD)-1 immune checkpoint antibody on pancreatic cancer growth, metastases, and the tumor microenvironment (TME). Immune-competent female C57BL/6 mice bearing syngeneic orthotopic murine pancreatic cancer treated with PAS had significantly smaller tumors and fewer metastases. Examination of the TME demonstrated decreased fibrosis with fewer M2 and more M1 tumor-associated macrophages. Expression of the E-cadherin gene was significantly increased and expression of the TGF\u03b2R2 gene was decreased compared with controls. Mice treated with PAS or the combination of PAS and PD-1 antibody exhibited significantly less tumor expression of phospho-paxillin, the focal adhesion protein \u03b2-catenin, and matrix metalloproteinase-7. This study suggests that inhibition of the cancer-promoting effects of gastrin in pancreatic cancer can decrease metastases by altering the TME and decreasing pathways that activate the epithelial mesenchymal transition. The PAS vaccine appears to change the TME, making it more susceptible to therapy with an immune checkpoint antibody. This novel combination of two immunotherapies may improve survival of pancreatic cancer by decreasing both tumor growth and metastasis formation.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Survival from advanced pancreatic cancer is poor, in part due to dense fibrosis of the tumor microenvironment, increased number of M2-polarized macrophages that promote angiogenesis and invasion, and lack of \"target-specific\" therapy. Herein, we report that a tumor vaccine that selectively targets gastrin decreases pancreatic cancer growth and metastases. Furthermore, the gastrin vaccine polyclonal antibody stimulator alters the tumor microenvironment rendering it more responsive to immunotherapy with a programmed cell death receptor-1 immune checkpoint antibody.

        "Motor learning requires myelination to reduce asynchrony and spontaneity in neural activity. Myelination increases the conduction velocity in long-range axons and is prerequisite for many brain functions. Impaired myelin regulation or impairment of myelin itself is frequently associated with deficits in learning and cognition in neurological and psychiatric disorders. However, it has not been revealed what perturbation of neural activity induced by myelin impairment causes learning deficits. Here, we measured neural activity in the motor cortex during motor learning in transgenic mice with a subtle impairment of their myelin. This deficit in myelin impaired motor learning, and was accompanied by a decrease in the amplitude of movement-related activity and an increase in the frequency of spontaneous activity. Thalamocortical axons showed variability in axonal conduction with a large spread in the timing of postsynaptic cortical responses. Repetitive pairing of forelimb movements with optogenetic stimulation of thalamocortical axon terminals restored motor learning. Thus, myelin regulation helps to maintain the synchrony of cortical spike-time arrivals through long-range axons, facilitating the propagation of the information required for learning. Our results revealed the pathological neuronal circuit activity with impaired myelin and suggest the possibility that pairing of noninvasive brain stimulation with relevant behaviors may ameliorate cognitive and behavioral abnormalities in diseases with impaired myelination.

        "Population-Specific Patterns of Epigenetic Defects in the B Cell Lineage in Patients With Systemic Lupus Erythematosus. OBJECTIVE: To determine the stage of B cell development at which a systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)-associated DNA methylation signature originates in African American (AA) and European American (EA) subjects, and to assess whether epigenetic defects in B cell development patterns could be predictive of SLE status in individual and mixed immune cell populations. METHODS: B cells from AA patients (n = 31) and EA patients (n = 49) with or without SLE were sorted using fluorescence-activated cell sorting into 5 B cell subsets. DNA methylation, measured at ~460,000 CpG sites, was interrogated in each subset. Enrichment analysis of transcription factor interaction at SLE-associated methylation sites was performed. A random forests algorithm was used to identify an epigenetic signature of SLE in the B cell subsets, which was then validated in an independent cohort of AA and EA patients and healthy controls. RESULTS: Regression analysis across all B cell stages resulted in identification of 60 CpGs that reached genome-wide significance for SLE-associated methylation differences (P \u2264 1.07 \u00d7 10-7 ). Interrogation of ethnicity-specific CpGs associated with SLE revealed a hypomethylated pattern that was enriched for interferon (IFN)-regulated genes and binding of EBF1 in AA patients (each P < 0.001). AA patients with SLE could be distinguished from healthy controls when the predictive model developed with the transitional B cell subset was applied to other B cell subsets (mean receiver operating characteristic [ROC] area under the curve [AUC] 0.98), and when applied to CD19+ pan-B cells (mean ROC AUC 0.95) and CD4+ pan-T cells (mean ROC AUC 0.97) from the independent validation cohort. CONCLUSION: These results indicate that SLE-specific methylation patterns are ethnicity dependent. A pattern of epigenetic changes near IFN-regulated genes early in B cell development is a hallmark of SLE in AA female subjects. EBF1 binding sites are highly enriched for significant methylation changes, implying that this may be a potential regulator of SLE-associated epigenetic changes. ",
        "Higher eGFR at Dialysis Initiation Is Not Associated with a Survival Benefit in Children. BACKGROUND: Study findings suggest that initiating dialysis at a higher eGFR level in adults with ESRD does not improve survival. It is less clear whether starting dialysis at a higher eGFR is associated with a survival benefit in children with CKD. METHODS: To investigate this issue, we performed a retrospective cohort study of pediatric patients aged 1-18 years who, according to the US Renal Data System, started dialysis between 1995 and 2015. The primary predictor was eGFR at the time of dialysis initiation, categorized as higher (eGFR>10 ml/min per 1.73 m2) versus lower eGFR (eGFR\u226410 ml/min per 1.73 m2). RESULTS: Of 15,170 children, 4327 (29%) had a higher eGFR (median eGFR, 12.8 ml/min per 1.73 m2) at dialysis initiation. Compared with children with a lower eGFR (median eGFR, 6.5 ml/min per 1.73 m2), those with a higher eGFR at dialysis initiation were more often white, girls, underweight or obese, and more likely to have GN as the cause of ESRD. The risk of death was 1.36 times higher (95% confidence interval, 1.24 to 1.50) among children with a higher (versus lower) eGFR at dialysis initiation. The association between timing of dialysis and survival differed by treatment modality-hemodialysis versus peritoneal dialysis (P<0.001 for interaction)-and was stronger among children initially treated with hemodialysis (hazard ratio, 1.56, 95% confidence interval, 1.39 to 1.75; versus hazard ratio, 1.07, 95% confidence interval, 0.91 to 1.25; respectively). CONCLUSIONS: In children with ESRD, a higher eGFR at dialysis initiation is associated with lower survival, particularly among children whose initial treatment modality is hemodialysis. ",
        "Targeting Seizure-Induced Neurogenesis in a Clinically Relevant Time Period Leads to Transient But Not Persistent Seizure Reduction. Mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (mTLE), the most common form of medically refractory epilepsy in adults, is usually associated with hippocampal pathophysiology. Using rodent models of mTLE, many studies including work from our laboratory have shown that new neurons born around the onset of severe acute seizures known as status epilepticus (SE) are crucial for the process of epileptogenesis and targeting seizure-induced neurogenesis either genetically or pharmacologically can impact the frequency of chronic seizures. However, these studies are limited in their clinical relevance as none of them determines the potential of blocking new neurons generated after the epileptogenic insult to alleviate the development of chronic seizures. Therefore, using a pilocarpine-induced SE model of mTLE in mice of either sex, we show that >4 weeks of continuous and concurrent ablation of seizure-induced neurogenesis after SE can reduce the formation of spontaneous recurrent seizures by 65%. We also found that blocking post-SE neurogenesis does not lead to long-term seizure reduction as the effect was observed only transiently for 10 d with >4 weeks of continuous and concurrent ablation of seizure-induced neurogenesis. Thus, these findings provide evidence that seizure-induced neurogenesis when adequately reduced in a clinically relevant time period has the potential to transiently suppress recurrent seizures, but additional mechanisms need to be targeted to permanently prevent epilepsy development.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Consistent with morphological and electrophysiological studies suggesting aberrant adult-generated neurons contribute to epilepsy development, ablation of seizure-induced new neurons at the time of the initial insult reduces the frequency of recurrent seizures. In this study, we show that continuous targeting of post-insult new neurons in a therapeutically relevant time period reduces chronic seizures; however, this effect does not persist suggesting possible additional mechanisms.

        "Visual responsiveness in sensorimotor cortex is increased following amputation and reduced after mirror therapy. Phantom limb pain (PLP) following amputation, which is experienced by the vast majority of amputees, has been reported to be relieved with daily sessions of mirror therapy. During each session, a mirror is used to view the reflected image of the intact limb moving, providing visual feedback consistent with the movement of the missing/phantom limb. To investigate potential neural correlates of the treatment effect, we measured brain responses in volunteers with unilateral leg amputation using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during a four-week course of mirror therapy. Mirror therapy commenced immediately following baseline scans, which were repeated after approximately two and four week intervals. We focused on responses in the region of sensorimotor cortex corresponding to primary somatosensory and motor representations of the missing leg. At baseline, prior to starting therapy, we found a strong and unexpected response in sensorimotor cortex of amputees to visually presented images of limbs. This response was stronger for images of feet compared to hands and there was no such response in matched controls. Further, this response to visually presented limbs was no longer present at the end of the four week mirror therapy treatment, when perceived phantom limb pain was also reduced. A similar pattern of results was also observed in extrastriate and parietal regions typically responsive to viewing hand actions, but not in regions corresponding to secondary somatosensory cortex. Finally, there was a significant correlation between initial visual responsiveness in sensorimotor cortex and reduction in PLP suggesting a potential marker for predicting efficacy of mirror therapy. Thus, enhanced visual responsiveness in sensorimotor cortex is associated with PLP and modulated over the course of mirror therapy. ",
        "Pharmacist Compliance With Therapeutic Guidelines on Diagnosis and Treatment Provision. Importance: Misuse and overselling of over-the-counter pharmaceuticals poses a major burden on both private and public health expenditures. Objective: To seek evidence on whether over-the-counter medication dispensing behavior complies or conflicts with the protocols indicated in practice standards and guidelines of a national professional pharmacy organization. Design, Setting, and Participants: This quality improvement study was undertaken in 205 pharmacies in the wider Brisbane, Australia, area. Two standardized patient (SP) scenarios were developed to evaluate noncompliant behavior. Data collection for scenario 1 was conducted between November 23 and December 9, 2016. Data collection for scenario 2 was conducted between September 1 and 28, 2017. A 2-sample test of proportions and a probit regression model were used to evaluate the likelihood of noncompliant treatments and overtreatments in each case scenario. Statistical analysis was performed from January 30 to June 21, 2018, and revised in May 2019. Main Outcomes and Measures: Outcomes were the observed likelihood of noncompliant treatments and overtreatments. Noncompliance is defined as treatments not complying with practice standards and guidelines set by the professional pharmacy society. Noncompliant treatments include undertreatment (patient did not receive necessary treatment) and overtreatments (patient was supplied with more than sufficient treatments) in both scenarios. Results: In scenario 1, 9 trained female SPs visited 89 pharmacies to request emergency hormonal contraception from pharmacy staff. In 45 cases, SPs reported having unprotected intercourse within the last 24 hours (case 1A), and in 44 cases, SPs reported having unprotected intercourse more than 72 hours ago (case 1B), which is past the efficacy threshold of over-the-counter emergency hormonal contraception. In scenario 2, 11 SPs (5 male and 6 female) visited 150 pharmacies (154 visits in total) to request treatment for family members or a partner with symptoms indicating bacterial conjunctivitis (case 2A; n\u2009=\u200973) or viral conjunctivitis (case 2B; n\u2009=\u200981). In scenario 1-dispensing emergency hormonal contraception when physician referral is recommended-21 of 44 pharmacists (47.7%) in case 1B violated the recommendation by selling the over-the-counter medication. With the inclusion of both no physician referral and emergency hormonal contraception sold, this rate increased to 79.5% (35 of 44 pharmacists). In scenario 2-1 case each of bacterial and viral conjunctivitis-overtreatment occurred in 55 of 154 cases (35.7%). In both scenarios, 140 of 243 pharmacies (57.6%) followed dispensing behavior compliant with the protocol, while 76 of 243 pharmacies (31.3%) involved some form of overtreatment or overselling of medication. Some evidence of an association between sex of SP and pharmacist was also found. Conclusions and Relevance: Although the market for dispensing over-the-counter medication in Australia is regulated, relatively high rates of overtreatment and some cases of undertreatment were observed in this study. Given the unintended adverse effects, including overuse of antibiotics and corticosteroids, these observations suggest the advisability of regulatory intervention ensuring compliance with professional protocols.

In scenario 2, 11 SPs (5 male and 6 female) visited 150 pharmacies (154 visits in total) to request treatment for family members or a partner with symptoms indicating bacterial conjunctivitis (case 2A; n\u2009=\u200973) or viral conjunctivitis (case 2B; n\u2009=\u200981). In scenario 1-dispensing emergency hormonal contraception when physician referral is recommended-21 of 44 pharmacists (47.7%) in case 1B violated the recommendation by selling the over-the-counter medication. With the inclusion of both no physician referral and emergency hormonal contraception sold, this rate increased to 79.5% (35 of 44 pharmacists). In scenario 2-1 case each of bacterial and viral conjunctivitis-overtreatment occurred in 55 of 154 cases (35.7%). In both scenarios, 140 of 243 pharmacies (57.6%) followed dispensing behavior compliant with the protocol, while 76 of 243 pharmacies (31.3%) involved some form of overtreatment or overselling of medication. Some evidence of an association between sex of SP and pharmacist was also found. Conclusions and Relevance: Although the market for dispensing over-the-counter medication in Australia is regulated, relatively high rates of overtreatment and some cases of undertreatment were observed in this study. Given the unintended adverse effects, including overuse of antibiotics and corticosteroids, these observations suggest the advisability of regulatory intervention ensuring compliance with professional protocols.

        "Activation of neuronal genes via LINE-1 elements upon global DNA demethylation in human neural progenitors. DNA methylation contributes to the maintenance of genomic integrity in somatic cells, in part through the silencing of transposable elements. In this study, we use CRISPR-Cas9 technology to delete DNMT1, the DNA methyltransferase key for DNA methylation maintenance, in human neural progenitor cells (hNPCs). We observe that inactivation of DNMT1 in hNPCs results in viable, proliferating cells despite a global loss of DNA CpG-methylation. DNA demethylation leads to specific transcriptional activation and chromatin remodeling of evolutionarily young, hominoid-specific LINE-1 elements (L1s), while older L1s and other classes of transposable elements remain silent. The activated L1s act as alternative promoters for many protein-coding genes involved in neuronal functions, revealing a hominoid-specific L1-based transcriptional network controlled by DNA methylation that influences neuronal protein-coding genes. Our results provide mechanistic insight into the role of DNA methylation in silencing transposable elements in somatic human cells, as well as further implicating L1s in human brain development and disease.

        "Canine osteosarcoma genome sequencing identifies recurrent mutations in DMD and the histone methyltransferase gene SETD2. Osteosarcoma (OS) is a rare, metastatic, human adolescent cancer that also occurs in pet dogs. To define the genomic underpinnings of canine OS, we performed multi-platform analysis of OS tumors from 59 dogs, including whole genome sequencing (n\u2009=\u200924) and whole exome sequencing (WES; n\u2009=\u200913) of primary tumors and matched normal tissue, WES (n\u2009=\u200910) of matched primary/metastatic/normal samples and RNA sequencing (n\u2009=\u200954) of primary tumors. We found that canine OS recapitulates features of human OS including low point mutation burden (median 1.98 per Mb) with a trend towards higher burden in metastases, high structural complexity, frequent TP53 (71%), PI3K pathway (37%), and MAPK pathway mutations (17%), and low expression of immune-associated genes. We also identified novel features of canine OS including putatively inactivating somatic SETD2 (42%) and DMD (50%) aberrations. These findings set the stage for understanding OS development in dogs and humans, and establish genomic contexts for future comparative analyses. ",
        "Associations between self-reported hearing loss and outdoor activity limitations, psychological distress and self-reported memory loss among older people: Analysis of the 2016 Comprehensive Survey of Living Conditions in Japan. AIM: To investigate the associations between self-reported hearing loss and outdoor activity limitations, psychological distress and self-reported memory loss among older people. METHODS: We carried out a cross-sectional study using the data from the 2016 Comprehensive Survey of Living Conditions in Japan. The study population included people aged \u226565\u2009years living at home, without a clinical diagnosis of dementia. The exposure of interest was self-reported hearing loss, whereas outcomes included outdoor activity limitations (Yes/No), psychological distress (Kessler Psychological Distress Scale score of \u22655) and self-reported memory loss (Yes/No). We carried out logistic regression analyses, adjusted for age, sex, smoking, alcohol, educational status, number of household members, household expenditure and number of clinical diagnoses requiring outpatient visits. RESULTS: Among 137\u2009723 older people (mean age 74.5\u2009years [standard deviation 7.4\u2009years], 45.1% men), 12\u2009389 (9.0%) reported hearing loss. People with hearing loss showed a higher prevalence of outdoor activity limitations (28.9% vs 9.5%, P\u2009<\u20090.001), psychological distress (39.7% vs 19.3%, P\u2009<\u20090.001) and memory loss (37.7% vs 5.2%, P\u2009<\u20090.001) than those without. The adjusted odds ratios comparing people with and without hearing loss were 2.0 (95% confidence interval 1.9-2.1), 2.1 (95% confidence interval 2.0-2.1) and 7.1 (95% confidence interval 6.8-7.4) for outdoor activity limitations, psychological distress and self-reported memory loss. CONCLUSIONS: This nationwide study suggested that older people with hearing loss were more likely to experience outdoor activity limitations, psychological distress and memory loss than those without. Early identification of and intervention in hearing loss might potentially reduce the risk of these poor health outcomes. Geriatr Gerontol Int 2019; 19: 747-754. ",
        "Type of Delivery, Neuropsychological Development and Intelligence in Twin Births. Based on a retrospective cohort design with 6-year-old children born in twin births, the relationship between verbal, non-verbal, global neuropsychological development, general intelligence and type of delivery has been studied. To this end, the possible effect of third gestational, obstetric and neonatal variables, such as maternal age at delivery, fetal presentation, gestational age, newborn weight and Apgar at minute one, was controlled. The exposed cohort includes children born by cesarean section, and the unexposed cohort is composed of children born vaginally with or without induction. A total of 124 children were evaluated in their 1st year of primary school using the Child Neuropsychological Maturity Questionnaire, Kaufman's Intelligence Test and the medical histories of the children collected after birth. By means of binary logistic regression analysis, it has been found that the type of delivery is presented as an independent risk factor for disorders in verbal, non-verbal and global development and for the general intellectual difficulties of children born of multiple births. These results suggest the need to analyze in future prospective studies with broader samples the relationship between different types of obstetric and perinatal variables of birth type and infant neuropsychological development and general intelligence, in order to prevent possible psychological alterations from birth.

        "Association of Preterm Births Among US Latina Women With the 2016 Presidential Election. Importance: The circumstances surrounding the 2016 US presidential election have been proposed as a significant stressor in the lives of the US Latino population. Few studies to date, however, have evaluated the population health implications of the election for Latina mothers and their children. Objective: To determine whether preterm births (gestational age, <37 weeks) among US Latina women increased above expected levels after the 2016 US presidential election. Design, Setting, and Participants: In this national population-based study, an interrupted time series design, used to evaluate whether policies or other population-level changes interrupt a trend in an outcome, compared monthly counts of preterm births to Latina women after the 2016 presidential election with the number expected had the election not taken place. Women residing in the United States who had singleton births during the study period were included. Counts of singleton term and preterm births by month and race/ethnicity from January 1, 2009, through July 30, 2017 (32\u202f860\u202f727 live births), were obtained from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Wonder online database. These methods were applied separately to male and female births. Data were analyzed from November 8, 2018, through May 7, 2019. Exposures: Pregnancy in the 2016 US presidential election. Main Outcomes and Measures: The number of male and female preterm births based on the last menstrual period. Results: Among the 32\u202f860\u202f727 live births recorded during the study period, 11.0% of male and 9.6% of female births to Latina women were preterm compared with 10.2% and 9.3%, respectively, to other women. In the 9-month period beginning with November 2016, an additional 1342 male (95% CI, 795-1889) and 995 female (95% CI, 554-1436) preterm births to Latina women were found above the expected number of preterm births had the election not occurred. Conclusions and Relevance: The 2016 US presidential election appears to have been associated with an increase in preterm births among US Latina women. Anti-immigration policies have been proposed and enforced in the aftermath of the 2016 presidential election; future research should evaluate the association of these actions with population health.

        "Estimating cumulative point prevalence of rare diseases: analysis of the Orphanet database. Rare diseases, an emerging global public health priority, require an evidence-based estimate of the global point prevalence to inform public policy. We used the publicly available epidemiological data in the Orphanet database to calculate such a prevalence estimate. Overall, Orphanet contains information on 6172 unique rare diseases; 71.9% of which are genetic and 69.9% which are exclusively pediatric onset. Global point prevalence was calculated using rare disease prevalence data for predefined geographic regions from the 'Orphanet Epidemiological file' (http://www.orphadata.org/cgi-bin/epidemio.html). Of the 5304 diseases defined by point prevalence, 84.5% of those analysed have a point prevalence of <1/1 000 000. However 77.3-80.7% of the population burden of rare diseases is attributable to the 4.2% (n\u2009=\u2009149) diseases in the most common prevalence range (1-5 per 10 000). Consequently national definitions of 'Rare Diseases' (ranging from prevalence of 5 to 80 per 100 000) represent a variable number of rare disease patients despite sharing the majority of rare disease in their scope. Our analysis yields a conservative, evidence-based estimate for the population prevalence of rare diseases of 3.5-5.9%, which equates to 263-446 million persons affected globally at any point in time. This figure is derived from data from 67.6% of the prevalent rare diseases; using the European definition of 5 per 10 000; and excluding rare cancers, infectious diseases, and poisonings. Future registry research and the implementation of rare disease codification in healthcare systems will further refine the estimates. ",
        "Deep Learning to Assess Long-term Mortality From Chest Radiographs. Importance: Chest radiography is the most common diagnostic imaging test in medicine and may also provide information about longevity and prognosis. Objective: To develop and test a convolutional neural network (CNN) (named CXR-risk) to predict long-term mortality, including noncancer death, from chest radiographs. Design, Setting, and Participants: In this prognostic study, CXR-risk CNN development (n\u2009=\u200941\u202f856) and testing (n\u2009=\u200910\u202f464) used data from the screening radiography arm of the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial (PLCO) (n\u2009=\u200952\u202f320), a community cohort of asymptomatic nonsmokers and smokers (aged 55-74 years) enrolled at 10 US sites from November 8, 1993, through July 2, 2001. External testing used data from the screening radiography arm of the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) (n\u2009=\u20095493), a community cohort of heavy smokers (aged 55-74 years) enrolled at 21 US sites from August 2002, through April 2004. Data analysis was performed from January 1, 2018, to May 23, 2019. Exposure: Deep learning CXR-risk score (very low, low, moderate, high, and very high) based on CNN analysis of the enrollment radiograph. Main Outcomes and Measures: All-cause mortality. Prognostic value was assessed in the context of radiologists' diagnostic findings (eg, lung nodule) and standard risk factors (eg, age, sex, and diabetes) and for cause-specific mortality. Results: Among 10\u202f464 PLCO participants (mean [SD] age, 62.4 [5.4] years; 5405 men [51.6%]; median follow-up, 12.2 years [interquartile range, 10.5-12.9 years]) and 5493 NLST test participants (mean [SD] age, 61.7 [5.0] years; 3037 men [55.3%]; median follow-up, 6.3 years [interquartile range, 6.0-6.7 years]), there was a graded association between CXR-risk score and mortality. The very high-risk group had mortality of 53.0% (PLCO) and 33.9% (NLST), which was higher compared with the very low-risk group (PLCO: unadjusted hazard ratio [HR], 18.3 [95% CI, 14.5-23.2]; NLST: unadjusted HR, 15.2 [95% CI, 9.2-25.3]; both P\u2009<\u2009.001). This association was robust to adjustment for radiologists' findings and risk factors (PLCO: adjusted HR [aHR], 4.8 [95% CI, 3.6-6.4]; NLST: aHR, 7.0 [95% CI, 4.0-12.1]; both P\u2009<\u2009.001). Comparable results were seen for lung cancer death (PLCO: aHR, 11.1 [95% CI, 4.4-27.8]; NLST: aHR, 8.4 [95% CI, 2.5-28.0]; both P\u2009\u2264\u2009.001) and for noncancer cardiovascular death (PLCO: aHR, 3.6 [95% CI, 2.1-6.2]; NLST: aHR, 47.8 [95% CI, 6.1-374.9]; both P\u2009<\u2009.001) and respiratory death (PLCO: aHR, 27.5 [95% CI, 7.7-97.8]; NLST: aHR, 31.9 [95% CI, 3.9-263.5]; both P\u2009\u2264\u2009.001). Conclusions and Relevance: In this study, the deep learning CXR-risk score stratified the risk of long-term mortality based on a single chest radiograph. Individuals at high risk of mortality may benefit from prevention, screening, and lifestyle interventions. ",
        "Self-reported Daily, Weekly, and Monthly Cannabis Use Among Women Before and During Pregnancy. Importance: As the overall prevalence of prenatal cannabis use rises, it is vital to also monitor trends in the frequency of cannabis use in the period leading up to and during pregnancy because more frequent use may confer greater health risks for mothers and their children. Objective: To examine trends in the frequency of self-reported cannabis use among pregnant women in the year before and during pregnancy. Design, Setting, and Participants: Cross-sectional study using data from 367\u202f403 pregnancies among 276\u202f991 women 11 years or older who completed a self-administered questionnaire on cannabis use during standard prenatal care in Kaiser Permanente Northern California from January 1, 2009, to December 31, 2017. The annual prevalence of self-reported daily, weekly, and monthly cannabis use among women before and during pregnancy was estimated using Poisson regression with a log link function, adjusting for sociodemographics. Data analyses were conducted from February to May 2019. Exposures: Calendar year. Main Outcomes and Measures: Self-reported frequency of cannabis use in the year before pregnancy and during pregnancy assessed as part of standard prenatal care (at approximately 8 weeks' gestation). Results: Among the overall sample of 367\u202f403 pregnancies among 276\u202f991 women, 35.9% of the women self-reported white race/ethnicity; 28.0%, Hispanic; 16.6%, Asian; 6.0%, African American; and 13.5%, other. In the sample, 1.2% of the women were aged 11 to 17 years; 15.3%, 18 to 24 years; 61.4%, 25 to 34 years; and 22.0%, older than 34 years. Median (interquartile range) neighborhood household income was $70\u202f472 ($51\u202f583-$92\u202f643). From 2009 to 2017, the adjusted prevalence of cannabis use in the year before pregnancy increased from 6.80% (95% CI, 6.42%-7.18%) to 12.50% (95% CI, 12.01%-12.99%), and the adjusted prevalence of cannabis use during pregnancy increased from 1.95% (95% CI, 1.78%-2.13%) to 3.38% (95% CI, 3.15%-3.60%). Annual relative rates of change in self-reported daily cannabis use (1.115; 95% CI, 1.103-1.128), weekly cannabis use (1.083; 95% CI, 1.071-1.095), and monthly or less cannabis use (1.050; 95% CI, 1.043-1.057) in the year before pregnancy increased significantly, with daily use increasing most rapidly (from 1.17% to 3.05%). Similarly, annual relative rates of change in self-reported daily cannabis use (1.110; 95% CI, 1.089-1.132), weekly cannabis use (1.075; 95% CI, 1.059-1.092) and monthly or less cannabis use (1.044; 95% CI, 1.032-1.057) during pregnancy increased significantly from 2009 to 2017, with daily use increasing most rapidly (from 0.28% to 0.69%). Conclusions and Relevance: Results of this study demonstrate that frequency of cannabis use in the year before pregnancy and during pregnancy has increased in recent years among pregnant women in Northern California, potentially associated with increasing acceptance of cannabis use and decreasing perceptions of cannabis-associated harms.

        "Effect of Medicaid Disenrollment on Health Care Utilization Among Adults With Mental Health Disorders. BACKGROUND: Medicaid is an important source of insurance coverage for those with mental health (MH) disorders in the United States. Although disruptions in Medicaid coverage are common, little is known about the dynamic relationship between Medicaid disenrollment and MH care utilization. OBJECTIVE: We estimated changes in all-cause and MH-related health care use post Medicaid disenrollment among a nationwide cohort of adults with MH disorders. SUBJECTS: We identified 8841 persons (197,630 person-months) ages 18-64 with MH disorders and Medicaid coverage from Panels 4 to 19 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey. METHODS: Using a quasi-experimental design and propensity weighting, we estimated logit models examining changes in service utilization per-person-per-month. We used a \"post\" indicator to estimate average differences in service use postdisenrollment (vs. those with continuous Medicaid coverage) and a count variable measuring total months since coverage loss to estimate changes over time. OUTCOME MEASURES: All-cause outpatient visits, MH-related outpatient visits, and acute care visits. RESULTS: Becoming uninsured after Medicaid disenrollment was associated with average reductions of 52% [-14.75 percentage-points, 95% confidence interval (CI): -17.59, -11.91] in the likelihood of receiving any outpatient service, 35% (-2.23 percentage-points, 95% CI: -3.71, -0.75) in the likelihood of receiving any MH-related outpatient service, and 52% (-2.44 percentage-points; 95% CI: -3.35, -1.52) in the likelihood of receiving any acute service in a month. Health care use declined the most in the month immediately postdisenrollment, and declines continued over the next half-year (while uninsured). CONCLUSIONS: Insurance loss after disenrollment from Medicaid led to a persistent disruption in the receipt of health care services for beneficiaries with MH disorders. ",
        "Random plasma glucose predicts the diagnosis of diabetes. AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Early recognition of those at high risk for diabetes as well as diabetes itself can permit preventive management, but many Americans with diabetes are undiagnosed. We sought to determine whether routinely available outpatient random plasma glucose (RPG) would be useful to facilitate the diagnosis of diabetes. METHODS: Retrospective cohort study of 942,446 U.S. Veterans without diagnosed diabetes, \u22653 RPG in a baseline year, and \u22651 primary care visit/year during 5-year follow-up. The primary outcome was incident diabetes (defined by diagnostic codes and outpatient prescription of a diabetes drug). RESULTS: Over 5 years, 94,599 were diagnosed with diabetes [DIAB] while 847,847 were not [NONDIAB]. Baseline demographics of DIAB and NONDIAB were clinically similar, except DIAB had higher BMI (32 vs. 28 kg/m2) and RPG (150 vs. 107 mg/dl), and were more likely to have Black race (18% vs. 15%), all p<0.001. ROC area for prediction of DIAB diagnosis within 1 year by demographic factors was 0.701, and 0.708 with addition of SBP, non-HDL cholesterol, and smoking. These were significantly less than that for prediction by baseline RPG alone (\u22652 RPGs at/above a given level, ROC 0.878, p<0.001), which improved slightly when other factors were added (ROC 0.900, p<0.001). Having \u22652 RPGs \u2265115 mg/dl had specificity 77% and sensitivity 87%, and \u22652 RPGs \u2265130 mg/dl had specificity 93% and sensitivity 59%. For predicting diagnosis within 3 and 5 years by RPG alone, ROC was reduced but remained substantial (ROC 0.839 and 0.803, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: RPG levels below the diabetes \"diagnostic\" range (\u2265200 mg/dl) provide good discrimination for follow-up diagnosis. Use of such levels-obtained opportunistically, during outpatient visits-could signal the need for further testing, allow preventive intervention in high risk individuals before onset of disease, and lead to earlier identification of diabetes.

        "Control of heart rate through guided high-rate breathing. Understanding the complex dynamics of cardio-respiratory coupling sheds light on the underlying mechanisms governing the communication between these two physiological systems. Previous research has predominantly considered the coupling at respiratory rates slower than the heart rate and shown that respiratory oscillations lead to modulation and/or synchronization of the heart rate. Whereas the mechanisms of cardio-respiratory communication are still under discussion, peripheral nervous regulation is considered to be the predominant factor. This work offers a novel experimental design and applies the concept of instantaneous phase to detect cardio-respiratory entrainment at elevated respiration rates, close to the resting heart rate. If such 1:1 entrainment exists, it would suggest direct neuronal communication between the respiration and heart centres in the brain. We have observed 1:1 entrainment in all volunteers, with consistently longer synchronization episodes seen in physically fitter people, and demonstrated that cardio-respiratory synchronization at both low and high respiration rates is associated with a common underlying communication mechanism.

        "Inhibition of bacterial ubiquitin ligases by SidJ-calmodulin catalysed glutamylation. The family of bacterial SidE enzymes catalyses phosphoribosyl-linked serine ubiquitination and promotes infectivity of Legionella pneumophila, a pathogenic bacteria that causes Legionnaires' disease1-3. SidE enzymes share the genetic locus with the Legionella effector SidJ that spatiotemporally opposes the toxicity of these enzymes in yeast and mammalian cells, through a mechanism that is currently unknown4-6. Deletion of SidJ leads to a substantial defect in the growth of Legionella in both its natural hosts (amoebae) and in mouse macrophages4,5. Here we demonstrate that SidJ is a glutamylase that modifies the catalytic glutamate in the mono-ADP ribosyl transferase domain of the SdeA, thus blocking the ubiquitin ligase activity of SdeA. The glutamylation activity of SidJ requires interaction with the eukaryotic-specific co-factor calmodulin, and can be regulated by intracellular changes in Ca2+ concentrations. The cryo-electron microscopy structure of SidJ in complex with human apo-calmodulin revealed the architecture of this heterodimeric glutamylase. We show that, in cells infected with L.\u00a0pneumophila, SidJ mediates the glutamylation of SidE enzymes on the surface of vacuoles that contain Legionella. We used quantitative proteomics to uncover multiple host proteins as putative targets of SidJ-mediated glutamylation. Our study reveals the mechanism by which SidE ligases are inhibited by a SidJ-calmodulin glutamylase, and opens avenues for exploring an understudied protein modification (glutamylation) in eukaryotes.

        "Child and adult snack food intake in response to manipulated pre-packaged snack item quantity/variety and snack box size: a population-based randomized trial. OBJECTIVES: Snacks contribute to overconsumption of energy-dense foods and thence obesity. Previous studies in this area are limited by self-reported data and small samples. In a large population-based cohort of parent-child dyads, we investigated how modification of pre-packaged snack food, i.e. (a) item quantity and variety, and (b) dishware (boxed container) size affected intake. METHODS: Design: Randomized trial nested within the cross-sectional Child Health CheckPoint of the Longitudinal Study of Australian Children, clustered by day of visit. SAMPLE: 1299 11-12 year olds, 1274 parents. EXPOSURE: 2\u2009\u00d7\u20092 manipulation of snack box container size and item quantity/variety: (1) small box, few items, (2) large box, few items, (3) small box, more items, (4) large box, more items. PROCEDURE: Participants received a snack box during a 15\u2009min break within their 3.5\u2009h visit; any snacks remaining were weighed. OUTCOMES: Consumed quantity (grams) and energy intake (kilojoules). ANALYSES: Unadjusted linear regression. RESULTS: Children who were offered a greater quantity and variety of snack items consumed considerably more energy and a slightly higher food mass (main effect for energy intake: 349\u2009kJ, 95% CI 282-416, standardized mean difference (effect size) 0.66; main effect for mass: 10\u2009g, 95% CI 3-17, effect size 0.17). In contrast, manipulating box size had little effect on child consumption, and neither box size nor quantity/variety of items consistently affected adults' consumption. CONCLUSION: In children, reducing the number and variety of snack food items available may be a more fruitful intervention than focusing on container or dishware size. Effects observed among adults were small, although we could not exclude social desirability bias in adults aware of observation. ",
        "Recent trends in the age at diagnosis of colorectal cancer in the US National Cancer Data Base, 2004-2015. BACKGROUND: The incidence of colorectal cancer (CRC) in adults younger than 50\u00a0years has increased in the United States over the past decades according to Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results data. National guidelines conflict over beginning screening at the age of 45 or 50\u00a0years. METHODS: This was a retrospective study of National Cancer Data Base data from 2004 to 2015. The Cochran-Armitage test for trend was used to assess changes in the proportion of cases diagnosed at an age younger than 50\u00a0years. RESULTS: This study identified 130,165 patients diagnosed at an age younger than 50\u00a0years and 1,055,598 patients diagnosed at the age of 50\u00a0years or older. The proportion of the total number of patients diagnosed with CRC at an age younger than 50\u00a0years rose (12.2% in 2015 vs 10.0% in 2004; P\u00a0<\u00a0.0001). Younger adults presented with more advanced disease (stage III/IV; 51.6% vs 40.0% of those 50\u00a0years old or older). Among men, diagnosis at ages younger than 50\u00a0years rose only in non-Hispanic whites (P\u00a0<\u00a0.0001), whereas among women, Hispanic and non-Hispanic whites had increases in younger diagnoses over time (P\u00a0<\u00a0.05). All income quartiles had a proportional increase in younger adults over time (P\u00a0<\u00a0.001), with the highest income quartile having the highest proportion of younger cases. The proportion of younger onset CRC cases rose in urban areas (P\u00a0<\u00a0.001) but did not rise in rural areas. CONCLUSIONS: The proportion of persons diagnosed with CRC at an age younger than 50\u00a0years in the United States has continued to increase over the past decade, and younger adults present with more advanced disease. These data should be considered in the ongoing discussion of screening guidelines. ",
        "Targeting Seizure-Induced Neurogenesis in a Clinically Relevant Time Period Leads to Transient But Not Persistent Seizure Reduction. Mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (mTLE), the most common form of medically refractory epilepsy in adults, is usually associated with hippocampal pathophysiology. Using rodent models of mTLE, many studies including work from our laboratory have shown that new neurons born around the onset of severe acute seizures known as status epilepticus (SE) are crucial for the process of epileptogenesis and targeting seizure-induced neurogenesis either genetically or pharmacologically can impact the frequency of chronic seizures. However, these studies are limited in their clinical relevance as none of them determines the potential of blocking new neurons generated after the epileptogenic insult to alleviate the development of chronic seizures. Therefore, using a pilocarpine-induced SE model of mTLE in mice of either sex, we show that >4 weeks of continuous and concurrent ablation of seizure-induced neurogenesis after SE can reduce the formation of spontaneous recurrent seizures by 65%. We also found that blocking post-SE neurogenesis does not lead to long-term seizure reduction as the effect was observed only transiently for 10 d with >4 weeks of continuous and concurrent ablation of seizure-induced neurogenesis. Thus, these findings provide evidence that seizure-induced neurogenesis when adequately reduced in a clinically relevant time period has the potential to transiently suppress recurrent seizures, but additional mechanisms need to be targeted to permanently prevent epilepsy development.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Consistent with morphological and electrophysiological studies suggesting aberrant adult-generated neurons contribute to epilepsy development, ablation of seizure-induced new neurons at the time of the initial insult reduces the frequency of recurrent seizures. In this study, we show that continuous targeting of post-insult new neurons in a therapeutically relevant time period reduces chronic seizures; however, this effect does not persist suggesting possible additional mechanisms.

        "Antimalarial activity of primaquine operates via a two-step biochemical relay. Primaquine (PQ) is an essential antimalarial drug but despite being developed over 70 years ago, its mode of action is unclear. Here, we demonstrate that hydroxylated-PQ metabolites (OH-PQm) are responsible for efficacy against liver and sexual transmission stages of Plasmodium falciparum. The antimalarial activity of PQ against liver stages depends on host CYP2D6 status, whilst OH-PQm display direct, CYP2D6-independent, activity. PQ requires hepatic metabolism to exert activity against gametocyte stages. OH-PQm exert modest antimalarial efficacy against parasite gametocytes; however, potency is enhanced ca.1000 fold in the presence of cytochrome P450 NADPH:oxidoreductase (CPR) from the liver and bone marrow. Enhancement of OH-PQm efficacy is due to the direct reduction of quinoneimine metabolites by CPR with the concomitant and excessive generation of H2O2, leading to parasite killing. This detailed understanding of the mechanism paves the way to rationally re-designed 8-aminoquinolines with improved pharmacological profiles. ",
        "Interlimb differences in parameters of aerobic function and local profiles of deoxygenation during double-leg and counterweighted single-leg cycling. It is typically assumed that in the context of double-leg cycling, dominant (DOMLEG) and nondominant legs (NDOMLEG) have similar aerobic capacity and both contribute equally to the whole body physiological responses. However, there is a paucity of studies that have systematically investigated maximal and submaximal aerobic performance and characterized the profiles of local muscle deoxygenation in relation to leg dominance. Using counterweighted single-leg cycling, this study explored whether peak O2 consumption (V\u0307o2peak), maximal lactate steady-state (MLSSp), and profiles of local deoxygenation [HHb] would be different in the DOMLEG compared with the NDOMLEG. Twelve participants performed a series of double-leg and counterweighted single-leg DOMLEG and NDOMLEG ramp-exercise tests and 30-min constant-load trials. V\u0307o2peak was greater in the DOMLEG than in the NDOMLEG (2.87\u2009\u00b1\u20090.42 vs. 2.70\u2009\u00b1\u20090.39 L/min, P < 0.05). The difference in V\u0307o2peak persisted even after accounting for lean mass (P < 0.05). Similarly, MLSSp was greater in the DOMLEG than in the NDOMLEG (118\u2009\u00b1\u200931 vs. 109\u2009\u00b1\u200931 W; P < 0.05). Furthermore, the amplitude of the [HHb] signal during ramp exercise was larger in the DOMLEG than in the NDOMLEG during both double-leg (26.0\u2009\u00b1\u20098.4 vs. 20.2\u2009\u00b1\u20098.8 \u00b5M, P < 0.05) and counterweighted single-leg cycling (18.5\u2009\u00b1\u20097.9 vs. 14.9\u2009\u00b1\u20097.5 \u00b5M, P < 0.05). Additionally, the amplitudes of the [HHb] signal were highly to moderately correlated with the mode-specific V\u0307o2peak values (ranging from 0.91 to 0.54). These findings showed in a group of young men that maximal and submaximal aerobic capacities were greater in the DOMLEG than in the NDOMLEG and that superior peripheral adaptations of the DOMLEG may underpin these differences.NEW & NOTEWORTHY It is typically assumed that the dominant and nondominant legs contribute equally to the whole physiological responses. In this study, we found that the dominant leg achieved greater peak O2 uptake values, sustained greater power output while preserving whole body metabolic stability, and showed larger amplitudes of deoxygenation responses. These findings highlight heterogeneous aerobic capacities of the lower limbs, which have important implications when whole body physiological responses are examined. ",
        "A zebrafish drug screening platform boosts the discovery of novel therapeutics for spinal cord injury in mammals. Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a complex condition, with limited therapeutic options, that results in sensory and motor disabilities. To boost discovery of novel therapeutics, we designed a simple and efficient drug screening platform. This innovative approach allows to determine locomotor rescue properties of small molecules in a zebrafish (Danio rerio) larval spinal cord transection model. We validated our screening platform by showing that Riluzole and Minocycline, two molecules that are in clinical trials for SCI, promote rescue of the locomotor function of the transected larvae. Further validation of the platform was obtained through the blind identification of D-Cycloserine, a molecule scheduled to enter phase IV clinical trials for SCI. Importantly, we identified Tranexamic acid and further showed that this molecule maintains its locomotor recovery properties in a rodent female contusion model. Our screening platform, combined with drug repurposing, promises to propel the rapid translation of novel therapeutics to improve SCI recovery in humans. ",
        "Hypo-osmotic-like stress underlies general cellular defects of aneuploidy. Aneuploidy, which refers to unbalanced chromosome numbers, represents a class of genetic variation that is associated with cancer, birth defects and eukaryotic micro-organisms1-4. Whereas it is known that each aneuploid chromosome stoichiometry can give rise to a distinct pattern of gene expression and phenotypic profile4,5, it remains a fundamental question as to whether there are common cellular defects that are associated with aneuploidy. Here we show the existence in budding yeast of a common aneuploidy gene-expression signature that is suggestive of hypo-osmotic stress, using a strategy that enables the observation of common transcriptome changes of aneuploidy by averaging out karyotype-specific dosage effects in aneuploid yeast-cell populations with random and diverse chromosome stoichiometry. Consistently,\u00a0aneuploid yeast exhibited increased plasma-membrane stress that led to impaired endocytosis, and this defect was also observed in aneuploid human cells. Thermodynamic modelling showed that hypo-osmotic-like stress is a general outcome of the proteome imbalance that is caused by aneuploidy, and also predicted a relationship between ploidy and cell size that was observed in yeast and aneuploid cancer cells. A genome-wide screen uncovered a general dependency of aneuploid cells on a pathway of ubiquitin-mediated endocytic recycling of nutrient transporters. Loss of this pathway, coupled with the endocytic defect inherent to aneuploidy, leads to a marked alteration of intracellular nutrient homeostasis. ",
        "Amish (Rural) vs. non-Amish (Urban) Infant Fecal Microbiotas Are Highly Diverse and Their Transplantation Lead to Differences in Mucosal Immune Maturation in a Humanized Germfree Piglet Model. The gut microbiome plays an important role in the immune system development, maintenance of normal health status, and in disease progression. In this study, we comparatively examined the fecal microbiomes of Amish (rural) and non-Amish (urban) infants and investigated how they could affect the mucosal immune maturation in germ-free piglets that were inoculated with the two types of infant fecal microbiota (IFM). Differences in microbiome diversity and structure were noted between the two types of fecal microbiotas. The fecal microbiota of the non-Amish (urban) infants had a greater relative abundance of Actinobacteria and Bacteroidetes phyla, while that of the Amish (rural) counterparts was dominated by Firmicutes. Amish infants had greater species richness compared with the non-Amish infants' microbiota. The fecal microbiotas of the Amish and the non-Amish infants were successfully transplanted into germ-free piglets, and the diversity and structure of the microbiota in the transplanted piglets remained similar at phylum level but not at the genus level. Principal coordinates analysis (PCoA) based on Weighted-UniFrac distance revealed distinct microbiota structure in the intestines of the transplanted piglets. Shotgun metagenomic analysis also revealed clear differences in functional diversity of fecal microbiome between Amish and non-Amish donors as well as microbiota transplanted piglets. Specific functional features were enriched in either of the microbiota transplanted piglet groups directly corresponding to the predominance of certain bacterial populations in their gut environment. Some of the colonized bacterial genera were correlated with the frequency of important lymphoid and myeloid immune cells in the ileal submucosa and mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN), both important for mucosal immune maturation. Overall, this study demonstrated that transplantation of diverse IFM into germ-free piglets largely recapitulates the differences in gut microbiota structure between rural (Amish) and urban (non-Amish) infants. Thus, fecal microbiota transplantation to germ-free piglets could be a useful large animal model system for elucidating the impact of gut microbiota on the mucosal immune system development. Future studies can focus on determining the additional advantages of the pig model over the rodent model. ",
        "Exosomes regulate neurogenesis and circuit assembly. Exosomes are thought to be released by all cells in the body and to be involved in intercellular communication. We tested whether neural exosomes can regulate the development of neural circuits. We show that exosome treatment increases proliferation in developing neural cultures and in vivo in dentate gyrus of P4 mouse brain. We compared the protein cargo and signaling bioactivity of exosomes released by hiPSC-derived neural cultures lacking MECP2, a model of the neurodevelopmental disorder Rett syndrome, with exosomes released by isogenic rescue control neural cultures. Quantitative proteomic analysis indicates that control exosomes contain multiple functional signaling networks known to be important for neuronal circuit development. Treating MECP2-knockdown human primary neural cultures with control exosomes rescues deficits in neuronal proliferation, differentiation, synaptogenesis, and synchronized firing, whereas exosomes from MECP2-deficient hiPSC neural cultures lack this capability. These data indicate that exosomes carry signaling information required to regulate neural circuit development. ",
        "The Relative Caloric Prices of Healthy and Unhealthy Foods Differ Systematically across Income Levels and Continents. BACKGROUND: Relative prices of healthy/unhealthy foods have been implicated in the obesity epidemic, but never extensively quantified across countries or empirically linked to undernutrition. OBJECTIVES: This study compared relative caloric prices (RCPs) for different food categories across 176 countries and ascertained their associations with dietary indicators and nutrition outcomes. METHODS: We converted prices for 657 standardized food products from the 2011 International Comparison Program into caloric prices using USDA Food Composition tables. We classified products into 21 specific food groups. We constructed RCPs as the ratio of the 3 cheapest products in each food group, relative to the weighted cost of a basket of starchy staples. We analyzed RCP differences across World Bank income levels and regions and used cross-country regressions to explore associations with Demographic Health Survey dietary indicators for women 15-49 y old and children 12-23 mo old and with WHO indicators of the under-5 stunting prevalence and adult overweight prevalence. RESULTS: Most noncereal foods were relatively cheap in high-income countries, including sugar- and fat-rich foods. In lower-income countries, healthy foods were generally expensive, especially most animal-sourced foods and fortified infant cereals (FICs). Higher RCPs for a food predict lower consumption among children for 7 of 9 food groups. Higher milk and FIC prices were positively associated with international child stunting patterns: a 1-SD increase in milk prices was associated with a 2.8 percentage point increase in the stunting prevalence. Similarly, a 1-SD increase in soft drink prices was associated with a reduction in the overweight prevalence of \u223c3.6 percentage points. CONCLUSIONS: Relative food prices vary systematically across countries and partially explain international differences in the prevalences of undernutrition and overweight adults. Future research should focus on how to alter relative prices to achieve better dietary and nutrition outcomes. ",
        "Molecular mechanism of setron-mediated inhibition of full-length 5-HT3A receptor. Serotonin receptor (5-HT3AR) is the most common therapeutic target to manage the nausea and vomiting during cancer therapies and in the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome. Setrons, a class of competitive antagonists, cause functional inhibition of 5-HT3AR in the gastrointestinal tract and brainstem, acting as effective anti-emetic agents. Despite their prevalent use, the molecular mechanisms underlying setron binding and inhibition of 5-HT3AR are not fully understood. Here, we present the structure of granisetron-bound full-length 5-HT3AR solved by single-particle cryo-electron microscopy to 2.92\u2009\u00c5 resolution. The reconstruction reveals the orientation of granisetron in the orthosteric site with unambiguous density for interacting sidechains. Molecular dynamics simulations and electrophysiology confirm the granisetron binding orientation and the residues central for ligand recognition. Comparison of granisetron-bound 5-HT3AR with the apo and serotonin-bound structures, reveals key insights into the mechanism underlying 5-HT3AR inhibition. ",
        "Mediterranean-style diet in pregnant women with metabolic risk factors (ESTEEM): A pragmatic multicentre randomised trial. BACKGROUND: Pregnant women with metabolic risk factors are at high risk of complications. We aimed to assess whether a Mediterranean-style diet reduces adverse pregnancy outcomes in high-risk women. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We conducted a multicentre randomised trial in 5 maternity units (4 in London and 1 in Birmingham) between 12 September 2014 and 29 February 2016. We randomised inner-city pregnant women with metabolic risk factors (obesity, chronic hypertension, or hypertriglyceridaemia) to a Mediterranean-style diet with high intake of nuts, extra virgin olive oil, fruits, vegetables, nonrefined grains, and legumes; moderate to high consumption of fish; low to moderate intake of poultry and dairy products; low intake of red and processed meat; and avoidance of sugary drinks, fast food, and food rich in animal fat versus usual care. Participants received individualised dietary advice at 18, 20, and 28 weeks' gestation. The primary endpoints were composite maternal (gestational diabetes or preeclampsia) and composite offspring (stillbirth, small for gestational age, or admission to neonatal care unit) outcomes prioritised by a Delphi survey. We used an intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis with multivariable models and identified the stratification variables and prognostic factors a priori. We screened 7,950 and randomised 1,252 women. Baseline data were available for 593 women in the intervention (93.3% follow-up, 553/593) and 612 in the control (95.6% follow-up, 585/612) groups. Over a quarter of randomised women were primigravida (330/1,205; 27%), 60% (729/1,205) were of Black or Asian ethnicity, and 69% (836/1,205) were obese. Women in the intervention arm consumed more nuts (70.1% versus 22.9%; adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 6.8, 95% confidence interval [CI] 4.3-10.6, p \u2264 0.001) and extra virgin olive oil (93.2% versus 49.0%; aOR 32.2, 95% CI 16.0-64.6, p \u2264 0.001) than controls; increased their intake of fish (p < 0.001), white meat (p < 0.001), and pulses (p = 0.05); and reduced their intake of red meat (p < 0.001), butter, margarine, and cream (p < 0.001). There was no significant reduction in the composite maternal (22.8% versus 28.6%; aOR 0.76, 95% CI 0.56-1.03, p = 0.08) or composite offspring (17.3% versus 20.9%; aOR 0.79, 95% CI 0.58-1.08, p = 0.14) outcomes. There was an apparent reduction in the odds of gestational diabetes by 35% (aOR 0.65, 95% CI 0.47-0.91, p = 0.01) but not in other individual components of the composite outcomes. Mothers gained less gestational weight (mean 6.8 versus 8.3 kg; adjusted difference -1.2 Kg, 95% CI -2.2 to -0.2, p = 0.03) with intervention versus control. There was no difference in any of the other maternal and offspring complications between both groups. When we pooled findings from the Effect of Simple, Targeted Diet in Pregnant Women With Metabolic Risk Factors on Pregnancy Outcomes (ESTEEM) trial with similar trials using random effects meta-analysis, we observed a significant reduction in gestational diabetes (odds ratio [OR] 0.67, 95% CI 0.53-0.84, I2 = 0%), with no heterogeneity (2 trials, 2,397 women). The study's limitations include the use of participant reported tools for adherence to the intervention instead of objective biomarkers. CONCLUSIONS: A simple, individualised, Mediterranean-style diet in pregnancy did not reduce the overall risk of adverse maternal and offspring complications but has the potential to reduce gestational weight gain and the risk of gestational diabetes.

        "Quantifying the Protective Effects of Stimulants on Functional Outcomes in Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder: A Focus on Number Needed to Treat Statistic and Sex Effects. PURPOSE: The aim of the study was to help quantify the protective effects of stimulant treatment on important functional outcomes in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) using the number needed to treat (NNT) statistic and examine whether these effects are moderated by sex. METHODS: Subjects were derived from three independent samples, two similarly designed case-control, 10-year prospective follow-up studies of boys and girls with and without ADHD grown up and a cross-sectional randomized clinical trial of lisdexamfetamine on driving performance and behavior. For all studies, subjects were evaluated with structured diagnostic interviews. To measure psychopharmacologic treatment in the follow-up studies, we collected information about each subject's stimulant medication use, age at onset, and age at termination of treatment. Subjects in the driving study underwent two driving simulation assessments (premedication and after 6 weeks of treatment on lisdexamfetamine or placebo). For each outcome, we ran a logistic regression model that included an interaction between sex and treatment status. Lifetime rates were used to calculate the NNT statistic. We also calculated adjusted NNT statistics that accounted for sex, age, socioeconomic status, and family intactness. RESULTS: The NNTs were very low, ranging from 3 to 10. No interaction effects with sex were detected (all p > .05). The adjusted NNTs mostly remained the same with the exception of any substance use disorder, which increased after controlling for age. CONCLUSIONS: Stimulants have strong protective effects on functional outcomes in youth with ADHD that are not moderated by sex. These results support the critical importance of early identification and treatment of children with ADHD of both sexes. ",
        "A physical biomarker of the quality of cultured corneal endothelial cells and of the long-term prognosis of corneal restoration in patients. Dysfunction of the corneal endothelium reduces the transparency of the cornea and can cause blindness. Because corneal endothelial cells have an extremely limited proliferative ability in vivo, treatment for corneal endothelial dysfunction involves the transplantation of donor corneal tissue. Corneal endothelium can also be restored via intraocular injection of endothelial cells in suspension after their expansion in vitro. Yet, because quality assessment during the expansion of the cells is a destructive process, a substantial number of the cultured cells are lost. Here, we show that the 'spring constant' of the effective interaction potential between endothelial cells in a confluent monolayer serves as a biomarker of the quality of corneal endothelial cells in vitro and of the long-term prognosis of corneal restoration in patients treated with culture-expanded endothelial cells or with transplanted corneas. The biomarker can be measured from phase contrast imaging in vitro and from specular microscopy in vivo, and may enable a shift from passive monitoring to pre-emptive intervention in patients with severe corneal disorders.

        "Mapping exclusive breastfeeding in Africa between 2000 and 2017. Exclusive breastfeeding (EBF)-giving infants only breast-milk (and medications, oral rehydration salts and vitamins as needed) with no additional food or drink for their first six months of life-is one of the most effective strategies for preventing child mortality1-4. Despite these advantages, only 37% of infants under 6\u2009months of age in Africa were exclusively breastfed in 20175, and the practice of EBF varies by population. Here, we present a fine-scale geospatial analysis of EBF prevalence and trends in 49 African countries from 2000-2017, providing policy-relevant administrative- and national-level estimates. Previous national-level analyses found that most countries will not meet the World Health Organization's Global Nutrition Target of 50% EBF prevalence by 20256. Our analyses show that even fewer will achieve this ambition in all subnational areas. Our estimates provide the ability to visualize subnational EBF variability and identify populations in need of additional breastfeeding support. ",
        "Amino Acids License Kinase mTORC1 Activity and Treg Cell Function via Small G Proteins Rag and Rheb. Regulatory T (Treg) cells are critical mediators of immune tolerance whose activity depends upon T\u00a0cell receptor (TCR) and mTORC1 kinase signaling, but the mechanisms that dictate functional activation of these pathways are incompletely understood. Here, we showed that amino acids license Treg cell function by priming and sustaining TCR-induced mTORC1 activity. mTORC1 activation was induced by amino acids, especially arginine and leucine, accompanied by the dynamic lysosomal localization of the mTOR and Tsc complexes. Rag and Rheb GTPases were central regulators of amino acid-dependent mTORC1 activation in effector Treg (eTreg) cells. Mice bearing RagA-RagB- or Rheb1-Rheb2-deficient Treg cells developed a fatal autoimmune disease and had reduced eTreg cell accumulation and function. RagA-RagB regulated mitochondrial and lysosomal fitness, while Rheb1-Rheb2 enforced eTreg cell suppressive gene signature. Together, these findings reveal a crucial requirement of amino acid signaling for licensing and sustaining mTORC1 activation and functional programming of Treg cells. ",
        "Poverty and Excess Length of Hospital Stay in Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome. OBJECTIVES: To study the impact of sociodemographic factors on length of stay (LOS) for infants with neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome (NOWS) secondary to fetal opioid exposure. METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, we included term infants with NOWS, excluding those with other significant medical issues. Comprehensive clinical and sociodemographic data were collected. Multivariate regression modeling was used to identify factors which contributed to excess LOS, which was defined as the number of days beyond the standard monitoring and/or treatment protocol. RESULTS: In all, 129 infants were identified; mean gestational age of 37.9\u200a\u00b1\u200a1.3 weeks and mean body weight of 2880\u200a\u00b1\u200a496\u200ag. Among them, 68% of infants were exposed to opioids; 27% were exposed to methadone; and 67% required pharmacologic treatment. The degree of poverty was assessed using the Area Deprivation Index (ADI) based on the mother's address at the time of birth. Median LOS for treated infants was 23 days versus 8 days for those who did not need pharmacologic treatment. The median excess LOS was 4 days (range 0-24).Excess hospital days were strongly correlated with degree of deprivation in the mother's community (r\u200a=\u200a0.55, P\u200a<\u200a0.01). ADI remained a strong predictor of excess LOS, even when controlling for pharmacologic treatment, placement in state's custody, race, and gestational age at birth. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest poverty is associated with excess LOS and that early allocation of resources for at-risk families may help to reduce overall length of hospital stay. ",
        "Smelling Nano Aerial Vehicle for Gas Source Localization and Mapping. This paper describes the development and validation of the currently smallest aerial platform with olfaction capabilities. The developed Smelling Nano Aerial Vehicle (SNAV) is based on a lightweight commercial nano-quadcopter (27 g) equipped with a custom gas sensing board that can host up to two in situ metal oxide semiconductor (MOX) gas sensors. Due to its small form-factor, the SNAV is not a hazard for humans, enabling its use in public areas or inside buildings. It can autonomously carry out gas sensing missions of hazardous environments inaccessible to terrestrial robots and bigger drones, for example searching for victims and hazardous gas leaks inside pockets that form within the wreckage of collapsed buildings in the aftermath of an earthquake or explosion. The first contribution of this work is assessing the impact of the nano-propellers on the MOX sensor signals at different distances to a gas source. A second contribution is adapting the 'bout' detection algorithm, proposed by Schmuker et al. (2016) to extract specific features from the derivative of the MOX sensor response, for real-time operation. The third and main contribution is the experimental validation of the SNAV for gas source localization (GSL) and mapping in a large indoor environment (160 m\u00b2) with a gas source placed in challenging positions for the drone, for example hidden in the ceiling of the room or inside a power outlet box. Two GSL strategies are compared, one based on the instantaneous gas sensor response and the other one based on the bout frequency. From the measurements collected (in motion) along a predefined sweeping path we built (in less than 3 min) a 3D map of the gas distribution and identified the most likely source location. Using the bout frequency yielded on average a higher localization accuracy than using the instantaneous gas sensor response (1.38 m versus 2.05 m error), however accurate tuning of an additional parameter (the noise threshold) is required in the former case. The main conclusion of this paper is that a nano-drone has the potential to perform gas sensing tasks in complex environments. ",
        "Second type of criticality in the brain uncovers rich multiple-neuron dynamics. Cortical networks that have been found to operate close to a critical point exhibit joint activations of large numbers of neurons. However, in motor cortex of the awake macaque monkey, we observe very different dynamics: massively parallel recordings of 155 single-neuron spiking activities show weak fluctuations on the population level. This a priori suggests that motor cortex operates in a noncritical regime, which in models, has been found to be suboptimal for computational performance. However, here, we show the opposite: The large dispersion of correlations across neurons is the signature of a second critical regime. This regime exhibits a rich dynamical repertoire hidden from macroscopic brain signals but essential for high performance in such concepts as reservoir computing. An analytical link between the eigenvalue spectrum of the dynamics, the heterogeneity of connectivity, and the dispersion of correlations allows us to assess the closeness to the critical point. ",
        "Electronic Cigarette Use and Cigarette Abstinence Over 2 Years Among U.S. Smokers in the Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health Study. INTRODUCTION: Electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) could benefit public health if they help current smokers to stop smoking long term, but evidence that they do so is limited. We aimed to determine the association between e-cigarette use and subsequent smoking cessation in a nationally representative cohort of US smokers followed for 2 years. METHODS: We analyzed data from adult cigarette smokers in Waves 1 through 3 of the Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health study. The primary exposure was e-cigarette use at Wave 1. The primary outcome was prolonged cigarette abstinence, defined as past 30-day cigarette abstinence at Waves 2 and 3 (1- and 2-year follow-up). RESULTS: Among Wave 1 cigarette smokers, 3.6% were current daily e-cigarette users, 18% were current non-daily e-cigarette users, and 78% reported no current e-cigarette use. In multivariable-adjusted analyses, daily e-cigarette use at Wave 1 was associated with higher odds of prolonged cigarette smoking abstinence at Waves 2 and 3 compared to nonuse of e-cigarettes (11% vs. 6%, adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 1.77, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.08 to 2.89). Non-daily e-cigarette use was not associated with prolonged cigarette smoking abstinence. Among Wave 1 daily e-cigarette users who were abstinent from cigarette smoking at Wave 3, 63% were using e-cigarettes at Wave 3. CONCLUSIONS: In this longitudinal cohort study of US adult cigarette smokers, daily but not non-daily e-cigarette use was associated with higher odds of prolonged cigarette smoking abstinence over 2 years, compared to no e-cigarette use. Daily use of e-cigarettes may help some smokers to stop smoking combustible cigarettes. IMPLICATIONS: In this nationally representative longitudinal cohort study of US adult cigarette smokers, daily e-cigarette use, compared to no e-cigarette use, was associated with a 77% increased odds of prolonged cigarette smoking abstinence over the subsequent 2 years. Regular use of e-cigarettes may help some smokers to stop smoking combustible cigarettes. ",
        "Sex disparities in the management of coronary heart disease in general practices in Australia. OBJECTIVES: To determine whether sex differences exist in the management of patients with a history of coronary heart disease (CHD) in primary care. METHODS: General practice records of patients aged \u226518 years with a history of CHD in a large general practice dataset in Australia, MedicineInsight, were analysed. Sex-specific, age-standardised proportions of patients prescribed with recommended medications; assessed for cardiovascular risk factors; and achieved treatment targets according to the General Practice Management Plan were reported. RESULTS: Records of 130\u2009926 patients (47% women) from 438 sites were available from 2014 to 2018. Women were less likely to be prescribed with recommended medications (prescribed \u22653 medications: women 44%, men 61%; p<0.001). Younger patients, especially women aged <45 years, were substantially underprescribed (aged <45 years prescribed \u22653 medications: women 2%, men 8%; p<0.001). Lower proportions of women were assessed for cardiovascular risk factors (blood test for lipids: women 70%-76%, men 77%-81%; p<0.001). Body size was not commonly assessed (body mass index: women 59%, men 62%; p<0.001; waist: women 23%, men 25%; p<0.001). Higher proportions of women than men achieved targets for most risk factors (achieved \u22654 targets in patients assessed for all risk factors: women 82%, men 76%). CONCLUSION: Gaps in preventative management including prescription of indicated medications and risk factor monitoring have been reported from the late 1990s and this large-scale general practice data analysis indicate they still persist. Moreover, the gap is larger in women compared to men. We need new ways to address these gaps and the sex inequity. ",
        "Hair cortisol and depressive symptoms in youth: An investigation of curvilinear relationships. BACKGROUND: As the prevalence of depression is increasing among youth in the U.S., research on the utility of biomarkers in predicting depressive symptomatology is burgeoning. Hair cortisol may be a useful biomarker as it is a retrospective and longer-term measure of the mean cortisol level. However, studies have yet to examine the relationships between hair cortisol and depressive symptoms in samples of youth, and findings with adult samples are mixed. This study examined hair cortisol as a predictor of depressive symptoms, including the potential for nonlinear relationships. METHODS: A representative community sample of 432 adolescents aged 11 to 17 years was examined. Depressive symptoms were measured using a 9-item short-form of the Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression scale. Hair was cut from the posterior vertex region of the scalp using thinning shears. Hair was washed, minced, ground and assayed with Salimetrics\u00ae Cortisol Enzyme Immunoassay Kit. Hair cortisol levels were logged for statistical analysis. RESULTS: In multivariable regression analysis, no significant linear relationship was found in model 1 between hair cortisol and depressive symptoms (b= -0.036, se\u202f=\u202f0.02, p\u202f=\u202f0.13). In model 2, a marginally significant linear association (b= -0.044, se\u202f=\u202f0.02, p-value\u202f=\u202f0.06) and a significant curvilinear relationship (b\u202f=\u202f0.039, se\u202f=\u202f0.01, p-value\u202f=\u202f0.005) were found between hair cortisol and depressive symptoms. The results were graphed depicting a u-shaped curve such that hair cortisol levels on the lower and higher end of the distribution predicted depressive symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: The findings highlight the need to consider investigation of nonlinear associations between cortisol and depressive symptoms. Longitudinal mechanistic research is needed to elucidate the causal relationships between hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis dysregulation and depressive symptoms as well as a better understanding of the biological mechanisms through which cortisol may contribute to depressive symptoms and psychopathology.

        "Predicting bacterial infection outcomes using single cell RNA-sequencing analysis of human immune cells. Complex interactions between different host immune cell types can determine the outcome of pathogen infections. Advances in single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) allow probing of these immune interactions, such as cell-type compositions, which are then interpreted by deconvolution algorithms using bulk RNA-seq measurements. However, not all aspects of immune surveillance are represented by current algorithms. Here, using scRNA-seq of human peripheral blood cells infected with Salmonella, we develop a deconvolution algorithm for inferring cell-type specific infection responses from bulk measurements. We apply our dynamic deconvolution algorithm to a cohort of healthy individuals challenged ex vivo with Salmonella, and to three cohorts of tuberculosis patients during different stages of disease. We reveal cell-type specific immune responses associated not only with ex vivo infection phenotype but also with clinical disease stage. We propose that our approach provides a predictive power to identify risk for disease, and human infection outcomes. ",
        "Autism-linked dopamine transporter mutation alters striatal dopamine neurotransmission and dopamine-dependent behaviors. The precise regulation of synaptic dopamine (DA) content by the dopamine transporter (DAT) ensures the phasic nature of the DA signal, which underlies the ability of DA to encode reward prediction error, thereby driving motivation, attention, and behavioral learning. Disruptions to the DA system are implicated in a number of neuropsychiatric disorders, including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and, more recently, Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). An ASD-associated de novo mutation in the SLC6A3 gene resulting in a threonine to methionine substitution at site 356 (DAT T356M) was recently identified and has been shown to drive persistent reverse transport of DA (i.e. anomalous DA efflux) in transfected cells and to drive hyperlocomotion in Drosophila melanogaster. A corresponding mutation in the leucine transporter, a DAT-homologous transporter, promotes an outward-facing transporter conformation upon substrate binding, a conformation possibly underlying anomalous dopamine efflux. Here we investigated in vivo the impact of this ASD-associated mutation on DA signaling and ASD-associated behaviors. We found that mice homozygous for this mutation display impaired striatal DA neurotransmission and altered DA-dependent behaviors that correspond with some of the behavioral phenotypes observed in ASD.

        "Caloric vestibular stimulation for the management of motor and non-motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease. INTRODUCTION: A recent case study showed that repeated sessions of caloric vestibular stimulation (CVS) relieved motor and non-motor symptoms associated with Parkinson's disease (PD). Here we sought to confirm these results in a prospective, double-blind, randomized, placebo treatment-controlled study. METHODS: 33 PD subjects receiving stable anti-Parkinsonian therapy completed an active (n\u202f=\u202f16) or placebo (n\u202f=\u202f17) treatment period. Subjects self-administered CVS at home twice-daily via a portable, pre-programmed, solid-state ThermoNeuroModulation (TNM\u2122) device, which delivered continually-varying thermal waveforms through aluminum ear-probes mounted on a wearable headset. Subjects were followed over a 4-week baseline period, 8 weeks of treatment and then at 5- and 24-weeks post-treatment. At each study visit, standardized clinical assessments were conducted during ON-medication states to evaluate changes in motor and non-motor symptoms, activities of daily living, and quality of life ratings. RESULTS: Change scores between baseline and the end of treatment showed that active-arm subjects demonstrated clinically-relevant reductions in motor and non-motor symptoms that were significantly greater than placebo-arm subjects. Active treatment was also associated with improved scores on activities of daily living assessments. Therapeutic gains were still evident 5 weeks after the end of active treatment but had started to recede at 24 weeks follow-up. No serious adverse events were associated with device use, and there was high participant satisfaction and tolerability of treatment. CONCLUSION: The results provide evidence that repeated CVS can provide safe and enduring adjuvant relief for motor and non-motor symptoms associated with PD. ",
        "Cholesterol efflux alterations in adolescent obesity: role of adipose-derived extracellular vesical microRNAs. BACKGROUND: Macrophage cholesterol efflux capacity has been identified as a predictor for cardiovascular disease. We assessed the relationship between adipocyte-derived extracellular vesicle microRNAs and macrophage cholesterol efflux capacity. METHODS: We assessed an adolescent cohort (n\u2009=\u200993, Age, median (IQR)\u2009=\u200917 (3)\u00a0year, Female\u2009=\u200971, Male\u2009=\u200922) throughout the BMI continuum (BMI\u2009=\u200945.2 (13.2) kg/m2) for: (1) cholesterol efflux capacity and lipoprotein profiles; (2) adipocyte-derived extracellular vesicle microRNAs in serum; (3) the role of visceral adipose tissue extracellular vesicle in regulation of cholesterol efflux and cholesterol efflux gene expression in THP-1 macrophages in vitro. RESULTS: Efflux capacity was significantly associated with HDL (r\u2009=\u20090.30, p\u2009=\u20090.01) and LDL (r\u2009=\u20090.33, p\u2009=\u20090.005) particle size. Multivariate-analysis identified six microRNAs associated (p\u2009<\u20090.05) with cholesterol efflux capacity: miR-3129-5p (Beta\u2009=\u20090.695), miR-20b (0.430), miR9-5p (0.111), miR-320d (-\u20090.190), miR301a-5p (0.042), miR-155-5p (0.004). In response to increasing concentrations (1\u00a0\u03bcg/mL vs. 3\u00a0\u03bcg/mL) of VAT extracellular vesicle, cholesterol efflux (66%\u2009\u00b1\u200910% vs. 49%\u2009\u00b1\u20092%; p\u2009<\u20090.01) and expression of ABCA1 (FC\u2009=\u20091.9\u2009\u00b1\u20090.8 vs 0.5\u2009\u00b1\u20090.2; p\u2009<\u20090.001), CD36 (0.7\u2009\u00b1\u20090.4 vs. 2.1\u2009\u00b1\u20090.8, p\u2009=\u20090.02), CYP27A1 (1.4\u2009\u00b1\u20090.4 vs. 0.9\u2009\u00b1\u20090.5; p\u2009<\u20090.05), and LXRA (1.8\u2009\u00b1\u20091.1 vs. 0.5\u2009\u00b1\u20090.2; p\u2009<\u20090.05) was altered in THP-1 cells in vitro. CONCLUSION: Adipocyte-derived extracellular vesicle microRNAs may, in part, be involved macrophage cholesterol efflux regulation. ",
        "Mutational inactivation of mTORC1 repressor gene DEPDC5 in human gastrointestinal stromal tumors. Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) are the most common human sarcoma and are initiated by activating mutations in the KIT or PDGFRA receptor tyrosine kinases. Chromosome 22q deletions are well-recognized frequent abnormalities in GISTs, occurring in \u223c50% of GISTs. These deletions are thought to contribute to the pathogenesis of this disease via currently unidentified tumor suppressor mechanisms. Using whole exome sequencing, we report recurrent genomic inactivated DEPDC5 gene mutations in GISTs (16.4%, 9 of 55 patients). The demonstration of clonal DEPDC5 inactivation mutations in longitudinal specimens and in multiple metastases from individual patients suggests that these mutations have tumorigenic roles in GIST progression. DEPDC5 inactivation promotes GIST tumor growth in vitro and in nude mice. DEPDC5 reduces cell proliferation through the mTORC1-signaling pathway and subsequently induces cell-cycle arrest. Furthermore, DEPDC5 modulates the sensitivity of GIST to KIT inhibitors, and the combination therapy with mTOR inhibitor and KIT inhibitor may work better in GIST patients with DEPDC5 inactivation. These findings of recurrent genomic alterations, together with functional data, validate the DEPDC5 as a bona fide tumor suppressor contributing to GIST progression and a biologically relevant target of the frequent chromosome 22q deletions.

        "The antagonism of folate receptor by dolutegravir: developmental toxicity reduction by supplemental folic acid. OBJECTIVE: Maternal folate (vitamin B9) status is the largest known modifier of neural tube defect risk, so we evaluated folate-related mechanisms of action for dolutegravir (DTG) developmental toxicity. DESIGN: Folate receptor 1 (FOLR1) was examined as a target for DTG developmental toxicity using protein and cellular interaction studies and an animal model. METHODS: FOLR1 competitive binding studies were used to test DTG for FOLR1 antagonism. Human placenta cell line studies were used to test interactions with DTG, folate, and cations. Zebrafish were selected as an animal model to examine DTG-induced developmental toxicity and rescue strategies. RESULTS: FOLR1 binding studies indicate DTG is a noncompetitive FOLR1 antagonist at therapeutic concentrations. In-vitro testing indicates calcium (2\u200ammol/l) increases FOLR1-folate interactions and alters DTG-FOLR1-folate interactions and cytotoxicity. DTG does not inhibit downstream folate metabolism by dihydrofolate reductase. Early embryonic exposure to DTG is developmentally toxic in zebrafish, and supplemental folic acid can mitigate DTG developmental toxicity. CONCLUSION: Folates and FOLR1 are established modifiers of risk for neural tube defects, and binding data indicates DTG is a partial antagonist of FOLR1. Supplemental folate can ameliorate increased developmental toxicity due to DTG in zebrafish. The results from these studies are expected to inform and guide future animal models and clinical studies of DTG-based antiretroviral therapy in women of childbearing age. ",
        "Arrhythmias and Adaptations of the Cardiac Conduction System in Former National Football League Players. Background Habitual high-intensity endurance exercise is associated with increased atrial fibrillation (AF) risk and impaired cardiac conduction. It is unknown whether these observations extend to prior strength-type sports exposure. The primary aim of this study was to compare AF prevalence in former National Football League (NFL) athletes to population-based controls. The secondary aim was to characterize other conduction system parameters. Methods and Results This cross-sectional study compared former NFL athletes (n=460, age 56\u00b112\u00a0years, black 47%) with population-based controls of similar age and racial composition from the cardiovascular cohort Dallas Heart Study-2 (n=925, age 54\u00b19\u00a0years, black 53%). AF was present in 28 individuals (n=23 [5%] in the NFL group; n=5 [0.5%] in the control group). After controlling for other cardiovascular risk factors in multivariable regression analysis, former NFL participation remained associated with a 5.7 (95% CI: 2.1-15.9, P<0.001) higher odds ratio of AF. Older age, higher body mass index, and nonblack race were also independently associated with higher odds ratio of AF, while hypertension and diabetes mellitus were not. AF was previously undiagnosed in 15/23 of the former NFL players. Previously undiagnosed NFL players were rate controlled and asymptomatic, but 80% had a CHA2DS2-VASc score \u22651. Former NFL players also had an 8-fold higher prevalence of paced cardiac rhythms (2.0% versus 0.25%, P<0.01), compared with controls. Furthermore, former athletes had lower resting heart rates (62\u00b111 versus 66\u00b111\u00a0beats per minute, P<0.001), and a higher prevalence of first-degree atrioventricular block (18% versus 9%, P<0.001). Conclusions Former NFL participation was associated with an increased AF prevalence and slowed cardiac conduction when compared with a population-based control group. Former NFL athletes who screened positive for AF were generally rate controlled and asymptomatic, but 80% should have been considered for anticoagulation based on their stroke risk. ",
        "Intensive vs Standard Treatment of Hyperglycemia and Functional Outcome in Patients With Acute Ischemic Stroke: The SHINE Randomized Clinical Trial. Importance: Hyperglycemia during acute ischemic stroke is common and is associated with worse outcomes. The efficacy of intensive treatment of hyperglycemia in this setting remains unknown. Objectives: To determine the efficacy of intensive treatment of hyperglycemia during acute ischemic stroke. Design, Setting, and Participants: The Stroke Hyperglycemia Insulin Network Effort (SHINE) randomized clinical trial included adult patients with hyperglycemia (glucose concentration of >110 mg/dL if had diabetes or \u2265150 mg/dL if did not have diabetes) and acute ischemic stroke who were enrolled within 12 hours from stroke onset at 63 US sites between April 2012 and August 2018; follow-up ended in November 2018. The trial included 1151 patients who met eligibility criteria. Interventions: Patients were randomized to receive continuous intravenous insulin using a computerized decision support tool (target blood glucose concentration of 80-130 mg/dL [4.4-7.2 mmol/L]; intensive treatment group: n\u2009=\u2009581) or insulin on a sliding scale that was administered subcutaneously (target blood glucose concentration of 80-179 mg/dL [4.4-9.9 mmol/L]; standard treatment group: n\u2009=\u2009570) for up to 72 hours. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary efficacy outcome was the proportion of patients with a favorable outcome based on the 90-day modified Rankin Scale score (a global stroke disability scale ranging from 0 [no symptoms or completely recovered] to 6 [death]) that was adjusted for baseline stroke severity. Results: Among 1151 patients who were randomized (mean age, 66 years [SD, 13.1 years]; 529 [46%] women, 920 [80%] with diabetes), 1118 (97%) completed the trial. Enrollment was stopped for futility based on prespecified interim analysis criteria. During treatment, the mean blood glucose level was 118 mg/dL (6.6 mmol/L) in the intensive treatment group and 179 mg/dL (9.9 mmol/L) in the standard treatment group. A favorable outcome occurred in 119 of 581 patients (20.5%) in the intensive treatment group and in 123 of 570 patients (21.6%) in the standard treatment group (adjusted relative risk, 0.97 [95% CI, 0.87 to 1.08], P\u2009=\u2009.55; unadjusted risk difference, -0.83% [95% CI, -5.72% to 4.06%]). Treatment was stopped early for hypoglycemia or other adverse events in 65 of 581 patients (11.2%) in the intensive treatment group and in 18 of 570 patients (3.2%) in the standard treatment group. Severe hypoglycemia occurred only among patients in the intensive treatment group (15/581 [2.6%]; risk difference, 2.58% [95% CI, 1.29% to 3.87%]). Conclusions and Relevance: Among patients with acute ischemic stroke and hyperglycemia, treatment with intensive vs standard glucose control for up to 72 hours did not result in a significant difference in favorable functional outcome at 90 days. These findings do not support using intensive glucose control in this setting. Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01369069. ",
        "Synaptic and brain-expressed gene sets relate to the shared genetic risk across five psychiatric disorders. BACKGROUND: Mounting evidence shows genetic overlap between multiple psychiatric disorders. However, the biological underpinnings of shared risk for psychiatric disorders are not yet fully uncovered. The identification of underlying biological mechanisms is crucial for the progress in the treatment of these disorders. METHODS: We applied gene-set analysis including 7372 gene sets, and 53 tissue-type specific gene-expression profiles to identify sets of genes that are involved in the etiology of multiple psychiatric disorders. We included genome-wide meta-association data of the five psychiatric disorders schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, autism spectrum disorder, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. The total dataset contained 159 219 cases and 262 481 controls. RESULTS: We identified 19 gene sets that were significantly associated with the five psychiatric disorders combined, of which we excluded five sets because their associations were likely driven by schizophrenia only. Conditional analyses showed independent effects of several gene sets that in particular relate to the synapse. In addition, we found independent effects of gene expression levels in the cerebellum and frontal cortex. CONCLUSIONS: We obtained novel evidence for shared biological mechanisms that act across psychiatric disorders and we showed that several gene sets that have been related to individual disorders play a role in a broader range of psychiatric disorders.

        "Deep learning of spontaneous arousal fluctuations detects early cholinergic defects across neurodevelopmental mouse models and patients. Neurodevelopmental spectrum disorders like autism (ASD) are diagnosed, on average, beyond age 4 y, after multiple critical periods of brain development close and behavioral intervention becomes less effective. This raises the urgent need for quantitative, noninvasive, and translational biomarkers for their early detection and tracking. We found that both idiopathic (BTBR) and genetic (CDKL5- and MeCP2-deficient) mouse models of ASD display an early, impaired cholinergic neuromodulation as reflected in altered spontaneous pupil fluctuations. Abnormalities were already present before the onset of symptoms and were rescued by the selective expression of MeCP2 in cholinergic circuits. Hence, we trained a neural network (ConvNetACh) to recognize, with 97% accuracy, patterns of these arousal fluctuations in mice with enhanced cholinergic sensitivity (LYNX1-deficient). ConvNetACh then successfully detected impairments in all ASD mouse models tested except in MeCP2-rescued mice. By retraining only the last layers of ConvNetACh with heart rate variation data (a similar proxy of arousal) directly from Rett syndrome patients, we generated ConvNetPatients, a neural network capable of distinguishing them from typically developing subjects. Even with small cohorts of rare patients, our approach exhibited significant accuracy before (80% in the first and second year of life) and into regression (88% in stage III patients). Thus, transfer learning across species and modalities establishes spontaneous arousal fluctuations combined with deep learning as a robust noninvasive, quantitative, and sensitive translational biomarker for the rapid and early detection of neurodevelopmental disorders before major symptom onset.

        "Is one dose of human papillomavirus vaccine as effective as three?: A national cohort analysis. AIM: Prophylactic human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines are highly effective at preventing pre-cancerous cervical lesions when given in a three-dose schedule. Some post-hoc trial data suggest that one dose prevents HPV infection. If one dose could prevent pre-cancerous cervical lesions, then global cervical cancer prevention would be greatly facilitated. We assessed the effectiveness of quadrivalent HPV vaccine by number of doses against cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 2 or 3/adenocarcinoma-in-situ (AIS)/cancer in Australia up to seven years post vaccination. METHODS: We linked registry data from all 8 jurisdictional cervical screening registers, with the national HPV vaccination register, death index and cancer registers for all Australian women aged 15 or under when eligible for vaccine who screened between April 2007 (when vaccination commenced) and 31 December 2014. We performed Cox proportional hazard regression, adjusted a priori for age, socioeconomic status, and area of residence, to estimate hazard ratios of histologically confirmed CIN2/CIN3/AIS/cancer. RESULTS: We included 250,648 women: 48,845 (19\u00b75%) unvaccinated, 174,995 (69\u00b78%) had received three doses, 18,190 (7\u00b73%) two doses and 8,618 (3\u00b74%) one dose. The adjusted hazard ratio was significantly lower for all dose groups compared to unvaccinated women (1 dose 0\u00b765 (95%CI 0\u00b752-0\u00b781), 2 doses 0\u00b761 (0\u00b752-0\u00b772) and 3 doses 0\u00b759 (0\u00b754-0\u00b765).) With adjustment for age at vaccination amongst the vaccinated group, the adjusted hazard ratios for one dose and two dose recipients were comparable to three dose recipients (one dose 1.01 (95%CI 0.81-1.26), two doses 1.00 (0.85-1.17).) Multiple sensitivity analyses, including use of different dose assignment methods, produced consistent findings. Comparison with a historical cohort of age matched women showed that the result was not due to herd protection alone. CONCLUSIONS: One dose had comparable effectiveness as two or three doses in preventing high-grade disease in a high coverage setting. These findings support the hypothesis that one dose vaccination may be a viable strategy when working towards the global elimination of cervical cancer. ",
        "Effect of Access to Prescribed PCSK9 Inhibitors on Cardiovascular Outcomes. BACKGROUND: Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease remains a major cause of death and disability, especially for high-risk familial hypercholesterolemia individuals. PCSK9i (proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin type 9 inhibitors) reduce low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels and cardiovascular event rates. However, PCSK9i prescriptions are rejected at high rates by payers, and use is often delayed or eventually abandoned as a treatment option. We tested the hypothesis that acute coronary syndromes, coronary interventions, stroke, and cardiac arrest are more prevalent in patients with rejected or abandoned PCSK9i prescriptions than for those with paid PCSK9i prescriptions. METHODS AND RESULTS: We identified 139 036 individuals aged \u226518 years who met the following 3 criteria: prescribed PCSK9i between August 2015 and December 2017, had claims history, and had an established date of exposure for paid, rejected, or abandoned status. To compare the effects of rejected versus paid and abandoned versus paid status, propensity score matching was performed to minimize confounding because of baseline differences in patient groups. Cox regression analyses and incidence density rates for cardiovascular events were estimated on the propensity score-matched cohorts. Patients who received 168 or more days of paid PCSK9i medication within a 12-month period were defined as paid. The hazard ratios for composite cardiovascular events outcome in propensity score-matched analyses were 1.10 (95% CI, 1.01-1.19; P=0.02) for rejected versus paid and 1.12 (95% CI, 1.01-1.24; P=0.03) for abandoned versus paid. In a stricter analysis where paid patients were defined by receiving 338 or more days of therapy within 12-months, hazard ratio was 1.16 (95% CI, 1.02-1.30; P=0.04) for rejected versus paid and 1.21 (95% CI, 1.04-1.38; P=0.03) for the abandoned versus paid status. Higher PCSK9i rejection rates were observed with women, racial minorities, and lower-income groups. CONCLUSIONS: Individuals in the rejected and abandoned cohorts had significantly increased risk of cardiovascular events compared with those in the paid cohort. Rejection, abandonment, and disparities related to PCSK9i prescriptions are related to higher cardiovascular outcome rates. ",
        "Effect of Nut Consumption on Erectile and Sexual Function in Healthy Males: A Secondary Outcome Analysis of the FERTINUTS Randomized Controlled Trial. Lifestyle risk factors for erectile and sexual function include smoking, excessive alcohol consumption, lack of physical activity, psychological stress, and adherence to unhealthy diets. In the present study, we evaluated the effects of mixed nuts supplementation on erectile and sexual function. Eighty-three healthy male aged 18-35 with erectile function assessment were included in this FERTINUTS study sub-analysis; a 14-week randomized, controlled, parallel feeding trial. Participants were allocated to (1) the usual Western-style diet enriched with 60 g/day of a mixture of nuts (nut group; n = 43), or (2) the usual Western-style diet avoiding nuts (control group; n = 40). At baseline and the end of the intervention, participants answered 15 questions contained in the validated International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF), and peripheral levels of nitric oxide (NO) and E-selectin were measured, as surrogated markers of erectile endothelial function. Anthropometrical characteristics, and seminogram and blood biochemical parameters did not differ between intervention groups at baseline. Compared to the control group, a significant increase in the orgasmic function (p-value = 0.037) and sexual desire (p-value = 0.040) was observed during the nut intervention. No significant differences in changes between groups were shown in peripheral concentrations of NO and E-selectin. Including nuts in a regular diet significantly improved auto-reported orgasmic function and sexual desire. ",
        "An Anterior Cruciate Ligament Failure Mechanism. BACKGROUND: Nearly three-quarters of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries occur as \"noncontact\" failures from routine athletic maneuvers. Recent in vitro studies revealed that repetitive strenuous submaximal knee loading known to especially strain the ACL can lead to its fatigue failure, often at the ACL femoral enthesis. HYPOTHESIS: ACL failure can be caused by accumulated tissue fatigue damage: specifically, chemical and structural evidence of this fatigue process will be found at the femoral enthesis of ACLs from tested cadaveric knees, as well as in ACL explants removed from patients undergoing ACL reconstruction. STUDY DESIGN: Controlled laboratory study. METHODS: One knee from each of 7 pairs of adult cadaveric knees were repetitively loaded under 4 times-body weight simulated pivot landings known to strain the ACL submaximally while the contralateral, unloaded knee was used as a comparison. The chemical and structural changes associated with this repetitive loading were characterized at the ACL femoral enthesis at multiple hierarchical collagen levels by employing atomic force microscopy (AFM), AFM-infrared spectroscopy, molecular targeting with a fluorescently labeled collagen hybridizing peptide, and second harmonic imaging microscopy. Explants from ACL femoral entheses from the injured knee of 5 patients with noncontact ACL failure were also characterized via similar methods. RESULTS: AFM-infrared spectroscopy and collagen hybridizing peptide binding indicate that the characteristic molecular damage was an unraveling of the collagen molecular triple helix. AFM detected disruption of collagen fibrils in the forms of reduced topographical surface thickness and the induction of ~30- to 100-nm voids in the collagen fibril matrix for mechanically tested samples. Second harmonic imaging microscopy detected the induction of ~10- to 100-\u00b5m regions where the noncentrosymmetric structure of collagen had been disrupted. These mechanically induced changes, ranging from molecular to microscale disruption of normal collagen structure, represent a previously unreported aspect of tissue fatigue damage in noncontact ACL failure. Confirmatory evidence came from the explants of 5 patients undergoing ACL reconstruction, which exhibited the same pattern of molecular, nanoscale, and microscale structural damage detected in the mechanically tested cadaveric samples. CONCLUSION: The authors found evidence of accumulated damage to collagen fibrils and fibers at the ACL femoral enthesis at the time of surgery for noncontact ACL failure. This tissue damage was similar to that found in donor knees subjected in vitro to repetitive 4 times-body weight impulsive 3-dimensional loading known to cause a fatigue failure of the ACL. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: These findings suggest that some ACL injuries may be due to an exacerbation of preexisting hierarchical tissue damage from activities known to place larger-than-normal loads on the ACL. Too rapid an increase in these activities could cause ACL tissue damage to accumulate across length scales, thereby affecting ACL structural integrity before it has time to repair. Prevention necessitates an understanding of how ACL loading magnitude and frequency are anabolic, neutral, or catabolic to the ligament. ",
        "Myosin binding protein H-like (MYBPHL): a promising biomarker to predict atrial damage. Myosin binding protein H-like (MYBPHL) is a protein associated with myofilament structures in atrial tissue. The protein exists in two isoforms that share an identical amino acid sequence except for a deletion of 23 amino acids in isoform 2. In this study, MYBPHL was found to be expressed preferentially in atrial tissue. The expression of isoform 2 was almost exclusively restricted to the atria and barely detectable in the ventricle, arteria mammaria interna, and skeletal muscle. After atrial damage induced by cryo- or radiofrequency ablation, MYBPHL was rapidly and specifically released into the peripheral circulation in a time-dependent manner. The plasma MYBPHL concentration remained substantially elevated up to 24 hours after the arrival of patients at the intensive care unit. In addition, the recorded MYBPHL values were strongly correlated with those of the established biomarker CK-MB. In contrast, an increase in MYBPHL levels was not evident in patients undergoing aortic valve replacement or transcatheter aortic valve implantation. In these patients, the values remained virtually constant and never exceeded the concentration in the plasma of healthy controls. Our findings suggest that MYBPHL can be used as a precise and reliable biomarker to specifically predict atrial myocardial damage. ",
        "Vaccines inducing immunity to Lassa virus glycoprotein and nucleoprotein protect macaques after a single shot. Lassa fever is a major threat in Western Africa. The large number of people living at risk for this disease calls for the development of a vaccine against Lassa virus (LASV). We generated live-attenuated LASV vaccines based on measles virus and Mopeia virus platforms and expressing different LASV antigens, with the aim to develop a vaccine able to protect after a single shot. We compared the efficacy of these vaccines against LASV in cynomolgus monkeys. The vaccines were well tolerated and protected the animals from LASV infection and disease after a single immunization but with varying efficacy. Analysis of the immune responses showed that complete protection was associated with robust secondary T cell and antibody responses against LASV. Transcriptomic and proteomic analyses showed an early activation of innate immunity and T cell priming after immunization with the most effective vaccines, with changes detectable as early as 2 days after immunization. The most efficacious vaccine candidate, a measles vector simultaneously expressing LASV glycoprotein and nucleoprotein, has been selected for further clinical evaluation. ",
        "Single-cell sequencing of neonatal uterus reveals an Misr2+ endometrial progenitor indispensable for fertility. The Mullerian ducts are the anlagen of the female reproductive tract, which regress in the male fetus in response to MIS. This process is driven by subluminal mesenchymal cells expressing Misr2, which trigger the regression of the adjacent Mullerian ductal epithelium. In females, these Misr2+ cells are retained, yet their contribution to the development of the uterus remains unknown. Here, we report that subluminal Misr2+ cells persist postnatally in the uterus of rodents, but recede by week 37 of gestation in humans. Using single-cell RNA sequencing, we demonstrate that ectopic postnatal MIS administration inhibits these cells and prevents the formation of endometrial stroma in rodents, suggesting a progenitor function. Exposure to MIS during the first six days of life, by inhibiting specification of the stroma, dysregulates paracrine signals necessary for uterine development, eventually resulting in apoptosis of the Misr2+ cells, uterine hypoplasia, and complete infertility in the adult female.

The family of bacterial SidE enzymes catalyses phosphoribosyl-linked serine ubiquitination and promotes infectivity of Legionella pneumophila, a pathogenic bacteria that causes Legionnaires' disease1-3. SidE enzymes share the genetic locus with the Legionella effector SidJ that spatiotemporally opposes the toxicity of these enzymes in yeast and mammalian cells, through a mechanism that is currently unknown4-6. Deletion of SidJ leads to a substantial defect in the growth of Legionella in both its natural hosts (amoebae) and in mouse macrophages4,5. Here we demonstrate that SidJ is a glutamylase that modifies the catalytic glutamate in the mono-ADP ribosyl transferase domain of the SdeA, thus blocking the ubiquitin ligase activity of SdeA. The glutamylation activity of SidJ requires interaction with the eukaryotic-specific co-factor calmodulin, and can be regulated by intracellular changes in Ca2+ concentrations. The cryo-electron microscopy structure of SidJ in complex with human apo-calmodulin revealed the architecture of this heterodimeric glutamylase. We show that, in cells infected with L.\u00a0pneumophila, SidJ mediates the glutamylation of SidE enzymes on the surface of vacuoles that contain Legionella. We used quantitative proteomics to uncover multiple host proteins as putative targets of SidJ-mediated glutamylation. Our study reveals the mechanism by which SidE ligases are inhibited by a SidJ-calmodulin glutamylase, and opens avenues for exploring an understudied protein modification (glutamylation) in eukaryotes.

        "Unconventional natural gas development and adverse birth outcomes in Pennsylvania: The potential mediating role of antenatal anxiety and depression. BACKGROUND: Studies have reported associations between unconventional natural gas development (UNGD) and adverse birth outcomes. None have evaluated potential mediating mechanisms. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate associations between (1) UNGD and antenatal anxiety and depression and (2) antenatal anxiety and depression and preterm birth (<37 weeks gestation) and reduced term birth weight, (3) stochastic direct and indirect effects of UNGD on preterm birth and term birth weight operating through antenatal anxiety and depression, and (4) effect modification by family-level socioeconomic status. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included mothers without prevalent anxiety or depression at time of conception, who delivered at Geisinger in Pennsylvania between January 2009-January 2013. We assembled phase-specific UNGD activity data from public sources. Mothers were categorized as exposed (quartile 4) or unexposed (quartiles 1-3) based on average daily inverse distance-squared UNGD activity metric between conception and the week prior to anxiety or depression (cases) or the pregnancy-average daily metric (non-cases). We estimated associations with a doubly robust estimator (targeted minimum loss-based estimation) and adjusted for potential individual- and community-level confounding variables. RESULTS: Analyses included 8,371 births to 7,715 mothers, 12.2% of whom had antenatal anxiety or depression. We found 4.3 additional cases of antenatal anxiety or depression per 100 women (95% CI: 1.5, 7.0) under the scenario where all mothers lived in the highest quartile of UNGD activity versus quartiles 1-3. The risk difference appeared larger among mothers receiving Medical Assistance (indicator of low family income) compared to those who did not, 5.6 (95% CI: 0.5, 10.6) versus 2.9 (95% CI: -0.7, 6.5) additional cases of antenatal anxiety or depression per 100 women. We found no relationship between antenatal anxiety or depression and adverse birth outcomes and no mediation effect either overall or when stratifying by Medical Assistance. CONCLUSION: We observed a relationship between UNGD activity and antenatal anxiety and depression, which did not mediate the overall association between UNGD activity and adverse birth outcomes. ",
        "Associations of Usual Pace and Complex Task Gait Speeds With Incident Mobility Disability. BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: To assess whether gait speed under complex conditions predicts long-term risk for mobility disability as well as or better than usual-pace gait speed. DESIGN: Longitudinal cohort study. SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: Subsample of Health Aging and Body Composition study with follow-up from 2002 to 2003 to 2010 to 2011, including 337 community-dwelling adults (mean age = 78.5 years, 50.7% female, 26.1% black). MEASUREMENTS: Associations of gait speed measured under usual-pace, fast-pace, dual-task, and narrow-path conditions with mobility disability, defined by any self-reported difficulty walking \u00bc mile assessed annually, were tested by Cox proportional hazard models adjusted for demographic and health characteristics. Models were fitted for each walking condition, and R2 statistics were used to compare predictive value across models. Models were repeated for persistent mobility disability, defined as at least two consecutive years of mobility disability. RESULTS: Mobility disability occurred in 204 (60.5%) participants over the 8-year follow-up. There was a lower hazard of developing mobility disability with faster gait speed under all conditions. Hazard ratios, confidence intervals, and R2 of gait speed predicting mobility disability were similar across all four walking conditions (R2 range = 0.22-0.27), but were strongest for dual-task gait speed (hazard ratio [95% confidence interval], R2 of fully adjusted models = 0.81 [0.75-0.88], 0.27). Results were comparable for persistent mobility disability (R2 range = 0.26-0.28). CONCLUSION: Slower gait speed under both usual-pace and complex conditions may be a clinical indicator of future risk of mobility disability. These results support the call for increased use of gait speed measures in routine geriatric care. J Am Geriatr Soc 67:2072-2076, 2019. ",
        "Uncovering the Networks of Topological Neighborhoods in \u03b2-Strand and Amyloid \u03b2-Sheet Structures. Although multiple hydrophobic, aromatic \u03c0-\u03c0, and electrostatic interactions are proposed to be involved in amyloid fibril formation, the precise interactions within amyloid structures remain poorly understood. Here, we carried out detailed quantum theory of atoms-in-molecules (QTAIM) analysis to examine the hydrophobic core of amyloid parallel and antiparallel \u03b2-sheet structures, and found the presence of multiple inter-strand and intra-strand topological neighborhoods, represented by networks of through-space bond paths. Similar bond paths from side chain to side chain and from side chain to main chain were found in a single \u03b2-strand and in di- and tripeptides. Some of these bond-path networks were enhanced upon \u03b2-sheet formation. Overall, our results indicate that the cumulative network of weak interactions, including various types of hydrogen bonding (X-H-Y; X, Y\u2009=\u2009H, C, O, N, S), as well as non-H-non-H bond paths, is characteristic of amyloid \u03b2-sheet structure. The present study postulated that the presence of multiple through-space bond-paths, which are local and directional, can coincide with the attractive proximity effect in forming peptide assemblies. This is consistent with a new view of the van der Waals (vdW) interactions, one of the origins of hydrophobic interaction, which is updating to be a directional intermolecular force. ",
        "A Wearable Skinlike Ultra-Sensitive Artificial Graphene Throat. Most mute people cannot speak due to their vocal cord lesion. Herein, to assist mute people to \"speak\", we proposed a wearable skinlike ultrasensitive artificial graphene throat (WAGT) that integrated both sound/motion detection and sound emission in single device. In this work, the growth and patterning of graphene can be realized at the same time, and a thin poly(vinyl alcohol) film with laser-scribed graphene was obtained by a water-assisted transferring process. In virtue of the skinlike and low-resistant substrate, the WAGT has a high detection sensitivity (relative resistance changes up to 150% at 133 \u03a9) and an excellent sound-emitting ability (up to 75 dB at 0.38 W power and 2 mm distance). On the basis of the excellent mechanical-electrical performance of graphene structure, the sound detecting and emitting mechanisms of WAGT are realized and discussed. For sound detection, both the motion of larynx and vibration of vocal cord contribute to throat movements. For sound emission, a thermal acoustic model for WAGT was established to reveal the principle of sound emitting. More importantly, a homemade circuit board was fabricated to build a dual-mode system, combining the detection and emitting systems. Meanwhile, different human motions, such as strong and small throat movements, were also detected and transformed into different sounds like \"OK\" and \"NO\". Therefore, the implementation of these sound/motion detection acoustic systems enable graphene to achieve device-level applications to system-level applications, and those graphene acoustic systems are wearable for its miniaturization and light weight.

        "Bioinspired mechanically active adhesive dressings to accelerate wound closure. Inspired by embryonic wound closure, we present mechanically active dressings to accelerate wound healing. Conventional dressings passively aid healing by maintaining moisture at wound sites. Recent developments have focused on drug and cell delivery to drive a healing process, but these methods are often complicated by drug side effects, sophisticated fabrication, and high cost. Here, we present novel active adhesive dressings consisting of thermoresponsive tough adhesive hydrogels that combine high stretchability, toughness, tissue adhesion, and antimicrobial function. They adhere strongly to the skin and actively contract wounds, in response to exposure to the skin temperature. In vitro and in vivo studies demonstrate their efficacy in accelerating and supporting skin wound healing. Finite element models validate and refine the wound contraction process enabled by these active adhesive dressings. This mechanobiological approach opens new avenues for wound management and may find broad utility in applications ranging from regenerative medicine to soft robotics. ",

        "Family Legacy of Diabetes-Related Behaviors: An Exploration of the Experiences of African American Parents and Adult Children. African Americans are at higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and this risk may be influenced by familial experiences and cultural norms throughout the life course. This led us to conduct this study of 20 African American families with strong histories of T2DM to explore familial complexities that prevent or help manage diabetic symptoms. Experiences were analyzed inductively through individual family profiles created using content-analytic summaries. When profiles were further analyzed for emerging and theoretically informed data patterns, two themes emerged: (a) family interactions characterized by T2DM-related actions and communication patterns, and (b) intergenerational patterns of openness characterized by variations in approach within generational cohort and parental gender. Through inquiries related to intergenerational experiences with T2DM, nursing and health care professionals may be better able to tailor and promote success for prevention and management of behaviors among high-risk African Americans.

        "GM1 Ganglioside Modifies \u03b1-Synuclein Toxicity and is Neuroprotective in a Rat \u03b1-Synuclein Model of Parkinson's Disease. While GM1 may interact with \u03b1-synuclein in vitro to inhibit aggregation, the ability of GM1 to protect against \u03b1-synuclein toxicity in vivo has not been investigated. We used targeted adeno-associated viral vector (AAV) overexpression of human mutant \u03b1-synuclein (A53T) in the rat substantia nigra (SN) to produce degeneration of SN dopamine neurons, loss of striatal dopamine levels, and behavioral impairment. Some animals received daily GM1 ganglioside administration for 6 weeks, beginning 24\u2009hours after AAV-A53T administration or delayed start GM1 administration for 5 weeks beginning 3 weeks after AAV-A53T administration. Both types of GM1 administration protected against loss of SN dopamine neurons and striatal dopamine levels, reduced \u03b1-synuclein aggregation, and delayed start administration of GM1 reversed early appearing behavioral deficits. These results extend prior positive results in MPTP models, are consistent with the results of a small clinical study of GM1 in PD patients that showed slowing of symptom progression with chronic use, and argue for the continued refinement and development of GM1 as a potential disease modifying therapy for PD.

        "Association of Dietary Fiber and Yogurt Consumption With Lung Cancer Risk: A Pooled Analysis. Importance: Dietary fiber (the main source of prebiotics) and yogurt (a probiotic food) confer various health benefits via modulating the gut microbiota and metabolic pathways. However, their associations with lung cancer risk have not been well investigated. Objective: To evaluate the individual and joint associations of dietary fiber and yogurt consumption with lung cancer risk and to assess the potential effect modification of the associations by lifestyle and other dietary factors. Design, Setting, and Participants: This pooled analysis included 10 prospective cohorts involving 1\u202f445\u202f850 adults from studies that were conducted in the United States, Europe, and Asia. Data analyses were performed between November 2017 and February 2019. Using harmonized individual participant data, hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals for lung cancer risk associated with dietary fiber and yogurt intakes were estimated for each cohort by Cox regression and pooled using random-effects meta-analysis. Participants who had a history of cancer at enrollment or developed any cancer, died, or were lost to follow-up within 2 years after enrollment were excluded. Exposures: Dietary fiber intake and yogurt consumption measured by validated instruments. Main Outcomes and Measures: Incident lung cancer, subclassified by histologic type (eg, adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and small cell carcinoma). Results: The analytic sample included 627\u202f988 men, with a mean (SD) age of 57.9 (9.0) years, and 817\u202f862 women, with a mean (SD) age of 54.8 (9.7) years. During a median follow-up of 8.6 years, 18\u202f822 incident lung cancer cases were documented. Both fiber and yogurt intakes were inversely associated with lung cancer risk after adjustment for status and pack-years of smoking and other lung cancer risk factors: hazard ratio, 0.83 (95% CI, 0.76-0.91) for the highest vs lowest quintile of fiber intake; and hazard ratio, 0.81 (95% CI, 0.76-0.87) for high vs no yogurt consumption. The fiber or yogurt associations with lung cancer were significant in never smokers and were consistently observed across sex, race/ethnicity, and tumor histologic type. When considered jointly, high yogurt consumption with the highest quintile of fiber intake showed more than 30% reduced risk of lung cancer than nonyogurt consumption with the lowest quintile of fiber intake (hazard ratio, 0.67 [95% CI, 0.61-0.73] in total study populations; hazard ratio 0.69 [95% CI, 0.54-0.89] in never smokers), suggesting potential synergism. Conclusions and Relevance: Dietary fiber and yogurt consumption was associated with reduced risk of lung cancer after adjusting for known risk factors and among never smokers. Our findings suggest a potential protective role of prebiotics and probiotics against lung carcinogenesis. ",
        "Intravascular innate immune cells reprogrammed via intravenous nanoparticles to promote functional recovery after spinal cord injury. Traumatic primary spinal cord injury (SCI) results in paralysis below the level of injury and is associated with infiltration of hematogenous innate immune cells into the injured cord. Methylprednisolone has been applied to reduce inflammation following SCI, yet was discontinued due to an unfavorable risk-benefit ratio associated with off-target effects. In this study, i.v. administered poly(lactide-coglycolide) nanoparticles were internalized by circulating monocytes and neutrophils, reprogramming these cells based on their physicochemical properties and not by an active pharmaceutical ingredient, to exhibit altered biodistribution, gene expression, and function. Approximately 80% of nanoparticle-positive immune cells were observed within the injury, and, additionally, the overall accumulation of innate immune cells at the injury was reduced 4-fold, coinciding with down-regulated expression of proinflammatory factors and increased expression of antiinflammatory and proregenerative genes. Furthermore, nanoparticle administration induced macrophage polarization toward proregenerative phenotypes at the injury and markedly reduced both fibrotic and gliotic scarring 3-fold. Moreover, nanoparticle administration with the implanted multichannel bridge led to increased numbers of regenerating axons, increased myelination with about 40% of axons myelinated, and an enhanced locomotor function (score of 6 versus 3 for control group). These data demonstrate that nanoparticles provide a platform that limits acute inflammation and tissue destruction, at a favorable risk-benefit ratio, leading to a proregenerative microenvironment that supports regeneration and functional recovery. These particles may have applications to trauma and potentially other inflammatory diseases. ",
        "Particulate matter air pollution and national and county life expectancy loss in the USA: A spatiotemporal analysis. BACKGROUND: Exposure to fine particulate matter pollution (PM2.5) is hazardous to health. Our aim was to directly estimate the health and longevity impacts of current PM2.5 concentrations and the benefits of reductions from 1999 to 2015, nationally and at county level, for the entire contemporary population of the contiguous United States. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We used vital registration and population data with information on sex, age, cause of death, and county of residence. We used four Bayesian spatiotemporal models, with different adjustments for other determinants of mortality, to directly estimate mortality and life expectancy loss due to current PM2.5 pollution and the benefits of reductions since 1999, nationally and by county. The covariates included in the adjusted models were per capita income; percentage of population whose family income is below the poverty threshold, who are of Black or African American race, who have graduated from high school, who live in urban areas, and who are unemployed; cumulative smoking; and mean temperature and relative humidity. In the main model, which adjusted for these covariates and for unobserved county characteristics through the use of county-specific random intercepts, PM2.5 pollution in excess of the lowest observed concentration (2.8 \u03bcg/m3) was responsible for an estimated 15,612 deaths (95% credible interval 13,248-17,945) in females and 14,757 deaths (12,617-16,919) in males. These deaths would lower national life expectancy by an estimated 0.15 years (0.13-0.17) for women and 0.13 years (0.11-0.15) for men. The life expectancy loss due to PM2.5 was largest around Los Angeles and in some southern states such as Arkansas, Oklahoma, and Alabama. At any PM2.5 concentration, life expectancy loss was, on average, larger in counties with lower income and higher poverty rate than in wealthier counties. Reductions in PM2.5 since 1999 have lowered mortality in all but 14 counties where PM2.5 increased slightly. The main limitation of our study, similar to other observational studies, is that it is not guaranteed for the observed associations to be causal. We did not have annual county-level data on other important determinants of mortality, such as healthcare access and quality and diet, but these factors were adjusted for with use of county-specific random intercepts. CONCLUSIONS: According to our estimates, recent reductions in particulate matter pollution in the USA have resulted in public health benefits. Nonetheless, we estimate that current concentrations are associated with mortality impacts and loss of life expectancy, with larger impacts in counties with lower income and higher poverty rate. ",
        "FDA Sodium Reduction Targets and the Food Industry: Are There Incentives to Reformulate? Microsimulation Cost-Effectiveness Analysis. Policy Points The World Health Organization has recommended sodium reduction as a \"best buy\" to prevent cardiovascular disease (CVD). Despite this, Congress has temporarily blocked the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) from implementing voluntary industry targets for sodium reduction in processed foods, the implementation of which could cost the industry around $16 billion over 10 years. We modeled the health and economic impact of meeting the two-year and ten-year FDA targets, from the perspective of people working in the food system itself, over 20 years, from 2017 to 2036. Benefits of implementing the FDA voluntary sodium targets extend to food companies and food system workers, and the value of CVD-related health gains and cost savings are together greater than the government and industry costs of reformulation. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) set draft voluntary targets to reduce sodium levels in processed foods. We aimed to determine cost effectiveness of meeting these draft sodium targets, from the perspective of US food system workers. We employed a microsimulation cost-effectiveness analysis using the US IMPACT Food Policy model with two scenarios: (1) short term, achieving two-year FDA reformulation targets only, and (2) long term, achieving 10-year FDA reformulation targets. We modeled four close-to-reality populations: food system \"ever\" workers; food system \"current\" workers in 2017; and subsets of processed food \"ever\" and \"current\" workers. Outcomes included cardiovascular disease cases prevented and postponed as well as incremental cost-effectiveness ratio per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained from 2017 to 2036. Among food system ever workers, achieving long-term sodium reduction targets could produce 20-year health gains of approximately 180,000 QALYs (95% uncertainty interval [UI]: 150,000 to 209,000) and health cost savings of approximately $5.2 billion (95% UI: $3.5 billion to $8.3 billion), with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $62,000 (95% UI: $1,000 to $171,000) per QALY gained. For the subset of processed food industry workers, health gains would be approximately 32,000 QALYs (95% UI: 27,000 to 37,000); cost savings, $1.0 billion (95% UI: $0.7bn to $1.6bn); and ICER, $486,000 (95% UI: $148,000 to $1,094,000) per QALY gained. Because many health benefits may occur in individuals older than 65 or the uninsured, these health savings would be shared among individuals, industry, and government. The benefits of implementing the FDA voluntary sodium targets extend to food companies and food system workers, with the value of health gains and health care cost savings outweighing the costs of reformulation, although not for the processed food industry.

        "CCR5AS lncRNA variation differentially regulates CCR5, influencing HIV disease outcome. Multiple genome-wide studies have identified associations between outcome of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and polymorphisms in and around the gene encoding the HIV co-receptor CCR5, but the functional basis for the strongest of these associations, rs1015164A/G, is unknown. We found that rs1015164 marks variation in an activating transcription factor 1 binding site that controls expression of the antisense long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) CCR5AS. Knockdown or enhancement of CCR5AS expression resulted in a corresponding change in CCR5 expression on CD4+ T cells. CCR5AS interfered with interactions between the RNA-binding protein Raly and the CCR5 3' untranslated region, protecting CCR5 messenger RNA from Raly-mediated degradation. Reduction in CCR5 expression through inhibition of CCR5AS diminished infection of CD4+ T cells with CCR5-tropic HIV in vitro. These data represent a rare determination of the functional importance of a genome-wide disease association where expression of a lncRNA affects HIV infection and disease progression. ",
        "Mediterranean-style diet in pregnant women with metabolic risk factors (ESTEEM): A pragmatic multicentre randomised trial. BACKGROUND: Pregnant women with metabolic risk factors are at high risk of complications. We aimed to assess whether a Mediterranean-style diet reduces adverse pregnancy outcomes in high-risk women. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We conducted a multicentre randomised trial in 5 maternity units (4 in London and 1 in Birmingham) between 12 September 2014 and 29 February 2016. We randomised inner-city pregnant women with metabolic risk factors (obesity, chronic hypertension, or hypertriglyceridaemia) to a Mediterranean-style diet with high intake of nuts, extra virgin olive oil, fruits, vegetables, nonrefined grains, and legumes; moderate to high consumption of fish; low to moderate intake of poultry and dairy products; low intake of red and processed meat; and avoidance of sugary drinks, fast food, and food rich in animal fat versus usual care. Participants received individualised dietary advice at 18, 20, and 28 weeks' gestation. The primary endpoints were composite maternal (gestational diabetes or preeclampsia) and composite offspring (stillbirth, small for gestational age, or admission to neonatal care unit) outcomes prioritised by a Delphi survey. We used an intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis with multivariable models and identified the stratification variables and prognostic factors a priori. We screened 7,950 and randomised 1,252 women. Baseline data were available for 593 women in the intervention (93.3% follow-up, 553/593) and 612 in the control (95.6% follow-up, 585/612) groups. Over a quarter of randomised women were primigravida (330/1,205; 27%), 60% (729/1,205) were of Black or Asian ethnicity, and 69% (836/1,205) were obese. Women in the intervention arm consumed more nuts (70.1% versus 22.9%; adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 6.8, 95% confidence interval [CI] 4.3-10.6, p \u2264 0.001) and extra virgin olive oil (93.2% versus 49.0%; aOR 32.2, 95% CI 16.0-64.6, p \u2264 0.001) than controls; increased their intake of fish (p < 0.001), white meat (p < 0.001), and pulses (p = 0.05); and reduced their intake of red meat (p < 0.001), butter, margarine, and cream (p < 0.001). There was no significant reduction in the composite maternal (22.8% versus 28.6%; aOR 0.76, 95% CI 0.56-1.03, p = 0.08) or composite offspring (17.3% versus 20.9%; aOR 0.79, 95% CI 0.58-1.08, p = 0.14) outcomes. There was an apparent reduction in the odds of gestational diabetes by 35% (aOR 0.65, 95% CI 0.47-0.91, p = 0.01) but not in other individual components of the composite outcomes. Mothers gained less gestational weight (mean 6.8 versus 8.3 kg; adjusted difference -1.2 Kg, 95% CI -2.2 to -0.2, p = 0.03) with intervention versus control. There was no difference in any of the other maternal and offspring complications between both groups. When we pooled findings from the Effect of Simple, Targeted Diet in Pregnant Women With Metabolic Risk Factors on Pregnancy Outcomes (ESTEEM) trial with similar trials using random effects meta-analysis, we observed a significant reduction in gestational diabetes (odds ratio [OR] 0.67, 95% CI 0.53-0.84, I2 = 0%), with no heterogeneity (2 trials, 2,397 women). The study's limitations include the use of participant reported tools for adherence to the intervention instead of objective biomarkers. CONCLUSIONS: A simple, individualised, Mediterranean-style diet in pregnancy did not reduce the overall risk of adverse maternal and offspring complications but has the potential to reduce gestational weight gain and the risk of gestational diabetes.

        "Digital Games and Mindfulness Apps: Comparison of Effects on Post Work Recovery. BACKGROUND: Engagement in activities that promote the dissipation of work stress is essential for post work recovery and consequently for well-being. Previous research suggests that activities that are immersive, active, and engaging are especially effective at promoting recovery. Therefore, digital games may be able to promote recovery, but little is known about how they compare with other popular mobile activities, such as mindfulness apps that are specifically designed to support well-being. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate and compare the effectiveness of a digital game and mindfulness app in promoting post work recovery, first in a laboratory setting and then in a field study. METHODS: Study 1 was a laboratory experiment (n=45) in which participants' need for recovery was induced by a work task, before undertaking 1 of 3 interventions: a digital game (Block! Hexa Puzzle), a mindfulness app (Headspace), or a nonmedia control with a fidget spinner (a physical toy). Recovery in the form of how energized participants felt (energetic arousal) was compared before and after the intervention and how recovered participants felt (recovery experience) was compared across the conditions. Study 2 was a field study with working professionals (n=20), for which participants either played the digital game or used the mindfulness app once they arrived home after work for a period of 5 working days. Measures of energetic arousal were taken before and after the intervention, and the recovery experience was measured after the intervention along with measures of enjoyment and job strain. RESULTS: A 3\u00d72 mixed analysis of variance identified that, in study 1, the digital game condition increased energetic arousal (indicative of improved recovery) whereas the other 2 conditions decreased energetic arousal (F2,42=3.76; P=.03). However, there were no differences between the conditions in recovery experience (F2,42=.01; P=.99). In study 2, multilevel model comparisons identified that neither the intervention nor day of the week had a significant main effect on how energized participants felt. However, for those in the digital game condition, daily recovery experience increased during the course of the study, whereas for those in the mindfulness condition, it decreased (F1,18=9.97; P=.01). Follow-up interviews with participants identified 3 core themes: detachment and restoration, fluctuations and differences, and routine and scheduling. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that digital games may be effective in promoting post work recovery in laboratory contexts (study 1) and in the real world, although the effect in this case may be cumulative rather than instant (study 2).

        "Increased Skin Conductance Response in the Immediate Aftermath of Trauma Predicts PTSD Risk. Background: Exposure to a traumatic event leads to posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in 10-20% of exposed individuals. Predictors of risk are needed to target early interventions to those who are most vulnerable. The objective of the study was to test whether a noninvasive mobile device that measures a physiological biomarker of autonomic nervous system activation could predict future PTSD symptoms. Methods: Skin conductance response (SCR) was collected during a trauma interview in the emergency department within hours of exposure to trauma in 95 individuals. Trajectories of PTSD symptoms over 12 months post-trauma were identified using Latent Growth Mixture Modeling. Results: SCR was significantly correlated with the probability of being in the chronic PTSD trajectory following trauma exposure in the ED (r=0.489, p<0.000001). Lasso regression with elastic net was performed with demographic and clinical measures obtained in the ED, demonstrating that SCR was the most significant predictor of the chronic PTSD trajectory (p<0.00001). Conclusions: The current study is the first prospective study of PTSD showing SCR in the immediate aftermath of trauma predicts subsequent development of chronic PTSD. This finding points to an easily obtained, and neurobiologically informative, biomarker in emergency departments that can be disseminated to predict the development of PTSD. ",
        "Reducing Hypoglycemia in Critical Care Patients Using a Nurse-Driven Root Cause Analysis Process. BACKGROUND: Successful blood glucose control is associated with improved outcomes of critically ill patients. However, insulin treatment can cause hypoglycemia, an important patient safety concern. The Joint Commission has recommended that all episodes of hypoglycemia be evaluated with a root cause analysis. OBJECTIVE: To reduce episodes of hypoglycemia through the analysis of data related to each episode. METHODS: The interdisciplinary team of the 16-bed critical care unit of a university-affilited teaching hospital developed a process to analyze, in real time, each episode of hypoglycemia (blood glucose level <60 mg/dL), including evaluation of patient risk factors and nursing interventions. The nursing staff integrated the root cause analysis into daily practice. The preimplementation period encompassed 2429 consecutive admissions, and the implementation period encompassed 2608 consecutive admissions. RESULTS: The percentage of patients with hypoglycemia decreased substantially during the implementation period among those without (from 6.15% to 3.78%; P = .001) and with diabetes (from 13.14% to 7.23%; P = .002). Mean blood glucose level decreased during the implementation period among patients without diabetes (P < .001), and did not change significantly among patients with diabetes (P = .23). The coefficient of variation, reflecting glucose variability, decreased during the implementation period among patients without and with diabetes (P < .001 for each). CONCLUSION: The nurse-driven root cause analysis was associated with a substantial reduction in hypoglycemia, with concomitant decreases in mean blood glucose level among patients without diabetes and glucose variability in patients without and with diabetes.

        "3D bioprinting of collagen to rebuild components of the human heart. Collagen is the primary component of the extracellular matrix in the human body. It has proved challenging to fabricate collagen scaffolds capable of replicating the structure and function of tissues and organs. We present a method to 3D-bioprint collagen using freeform reversible embedding of suspended hydrogels (FRESH) to engineer components of the human heart at various scales, from capillaries to the full organ. Control of pH-driven gelation provides 20-micrometer filament resolution, a porous microstructure that enables rapid cellular infiltration and microvascularization, and mechanical strength for fabrication and perfusion of multiscale vasculature and tri-leaflet valves. We found that FRESH 3D-bioprinted hearts accurately reproduce patient-specific anatomical structure as determined by micro-computed tomography. Cardiac ventricles printed with human cardiomyocytes showed synchronized contractions, directional action potential propagation, and wall thickening up to 14% during peak systole. ",
        "Prevalence and Severity of Food Allergies Among US Adults. Importance: Food allergy is a costly, potentially life-threatening condition. Although studies have examined the prevalence of childhood food allergy, little is known about prevalence, severity, or health care utilization related to food allergies among US adults. Objective: To provide nationally representative estimates of the distribution, severity, and factors associated with adult food allergies. Design, Setting, and Participants: In this cross-sectional survey study of US adults, surveys were administered via the internet and telephone from October 9, 2015, to September 18, 2016. Participants were first recruited from NORC at the University of Chicago's probability-based AmeriSpeak panel, and additional participants were recruited from the non-probability-based Survey Sampling International (SSI) panel. Exposures: Demographic and allergic participant characteristics. Main Outcomes and Measures: Self-reported food allergies were the main outcome and were considered convincing if reported symptoms to specific allergens were consistent with IgE-mediated reactions. Diagnosis history to specific allergens and food allergy-related health care use were also primary outcomes. Estimates were based on this nationally representative sample using small-area estimation and iterative proportional fitting methods. To increase precision, AmeriSpeak data were augmented by calibration-weighted, non-probability-based responses from SSI. Results: Surveys were completed by 40\u202f443 adults (mean [SD] age, 46.6 [20.2] years), with a survey completion rate of 51.2% observed among AmeriSpeak panelists (n\u2009=\u20097210) and 5.5% among SSI panelists (n\u2009=\u200933\u202f233). Estimated convincing food allergy prevalence among US adults was 10.8% (95% CI, 10.4%-11.1%), although 19.0% (95% CI, 18.5%-19.5%) of adults self-reported a food allergy. The most common allergies were shellfish (2.9%; 95% CI, 2.7%-3.1%), milk (1.9%; 95% CI, 1.8%-2.1%), peanut (1.8%; 95% CI, 1.7%-1.9%), tree nut (1.2%; 95% CI, 1.1%-1.3%), and fin fish (0.9%; 95% CI, 0.8%-1.0%). Among food-allergic adults, 51.1% (95% CI, 49.3%-52.9%) experienced a severe food allergy reaction, 45.3% (95% CI, 43.6%-47.1%) were allergic to multiple foods, and 48.0% (95% CI, 46.2%-49.7%) developed food allergies as an adult. Regarding health care utilization, 24.0% (95% CI, 22.6%-25.4%) reported a current epinephrine prescription, and 38.3% (95% CI, 36.7%-40.0%) reported at least 1 food allergy-related lifetime emergency department visit. Conclusions and Relevance: These data suggest that at least 10.8% (>26 million) of US adults are food allergic, whereas nearly 19% of adults believe that they have a food allergy. Consequently, these findings suggest that it is crucial that adults with suspected food allergy receive appropriate confirmatory testing and counseling to ensure food is not unnecessarily avoided and quality of life is not unduly impaired.

        "Bardet-Biedl Syndrome in rhesus macaques: A nonhuman primate model of retinitis pigmentosa. The development of therapies for retinal disorders is hampered by a lack of appropriate animal models. Higher nonhuman primates are the only animals with retinal structure similar to humans, including the presence of a macula and fovea. However, few nonhuman primate models of genetic retinal disease are known. We identified a lineage of rhesus macaques with a frameshift mutation in exon 3 of the BBS7 gene c.160delG (p.Ala54fs) that is predicted to produce a non-functional protein. In humans, mutations in this and other BBS genes cause Bardet-Biedl syndrome, a ciliopathy and a syndromic form of retinitis pigmentosa generally occurring in conjunction with kidney dysfunction, polydactyly, obesity, and/or hypogonadism. Three full- or half-sibling monkeys homozygous for the BBS7 c.160delG variant, at ages 3.5, 4 and 6 years old, displayed a combination of severe photoreceptor degeneration and progressive kidney disease. In vivo retinal imaging revealed features of severe macular degeneration, including absence of photoreceptor layers, degeneration of the retinal pigment epithelium, and retinal vasculature atrophy. Electroretinography in the 3.5-year-old case demonstrated loss of scotopic and photopic a-waves and markedly reduced and delayed b-waves. Histological assessments in the 4- and 6-year-old cases confirmed profound loss of photoreceptors and inner retinal neurons across the posterior retina, with dramatic thinning and disorganization of all cell layers, abundant microglia, absent or displaced RPE cells, and significant gliosis in the subretinal space. Retinal structure, including presence of photoreceptors, was preserved only in the far periphery. Ultrasound imaging of the kidneys revealed deranged architecture, and renal histopathology identified distorted contours with depressed, fibrotic foci and firmly adhered renal capsules; renal failure occurred in the 6-year-old case. Magnetic resonance imaging obtained in one case revealed abnormally low total brain volume and unilateral ventricular enlargement. The one male had abnormally small testes at 4 years of age, but polydactyly and obesity were not observed. Thus, monkeys homozygous for the BBS7 c.160delG variant closely mirrored several key features of the human BBS syndrome. This finding represents the first identification of a naturally-occurring nonhuman primate model of BBS, and more broadly the first such model of retinitis pigmentosa and a ciliopathy with an associated genetic mutation. This important new preclinical model will provide the basis for better understanding of disease progression and for the testing of new therapeutic options, including gene and cell-based therapies, not only for BBS but also for multiple forms of photoreceptor degeneration.

        "Influenza vaccination and 1-year risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure, pneumonia, and mortality among intensive care unit survivors aged 65\u00a0years or older: a nationwide population-based cohort study. PURPOSE: We examined whether influenza vaccination affects 1-year risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure, pneumonia, and death among intensive care unit (ICU) survivors aged\u2009\u2265\u200965\u00a0years. METHODS: Danish Intensive Care Database data on all elderly (\u2009\u2265\u200965 years) patients hospitalized in Danish ICUs in the period 2005-2015, and subsequently discharged, were linked with data from other medical registries, including data on uptake of the seasonal influenza vaccine. We computed these patients' 1-year risk of hospitalization for myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure, or pneumonia, and their 1-year risk of all-cause mortality. Hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were computed using Cox proportional hazards regression, with adjustment and propensity score matching applied to handle confounding. RESULTS: The study included 89,818 ICU survivors. The influenza vaccinated patients (n\u2009=\u200934,871, 39%) were older, had more chronic diseases, and used more prescription medications than the unvaccinated patients. Adjusted 1-year mortality was decreased among the vaccinated versus the unvaccinated patients (19.3% versus 18.8%; adjusted HR, 0.92; 95% CI 0.89-0.95). Influenza vaccination was also associated with a decreased risk of stroke (adjusted HR, 0.84; 95% CI 0.78-0.92), but only a small, non-significantly decreased risk of myocardial infarction (adjusted HR, 0.93; 95% CI 0.83-1.03). There was no association between vaccination and subsequent hospitalization for heart failure or pneumonia. Propensity score matched analyses confirmed these findings. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with the unvaccinated ICU survivors, the influenza vaccinated ICU survivors had a lower 1-year risk of stroke and a lower 1-year risk of death, whereas no substantial association was observed for the risk of hospitalization for myocardial infarction, heart failure, or pneumonia. Our findings support influenza vaccination of individuals aged\u2009\u2265\u200965\u00a0years. ",
        "Comparison of Pedestrian Detection With and Without Yellow-Lens Glasses During Simulated Night Driving With and Without Headlight Glare. Importance: Some marketing materials for yellow-lens night-driving glasses claim that they increase nighttime road visibility and reduce oncoming headlight glare (HLG). However, there is no scientific evidence to support these claims. Objective: To measure the association between yellow-lens glasses and the detection of pedestrians with and without an oncoming HLG, using a driving simulator equipped with a custom HLG simulator. Design, Setting, and Participants: A single-center cohort study was conducted between September 8, 2016, and October 25, 2017, at the Schepens Eye Research Institute. A total of 22 individuals participated in the study, divided into groups to determine response to a pedestrian wearing a navy blue shirt by younger individuals and, to control for participant's age and the interaction of the shirt color with the filter, response to a pedestrian wearing an orange shirt by a group of younger and older participants. Exposures: Participants drove scripted night-driving scenarios, 3 times with 3 commercially available yellow-lens glasses and once with clear-lens glasses, with the HLG simulator turned on and off. A total of 8 conditions were used for each participant. Main Outcomes and Measures: Pedestrian detection response time. Results: The 22 participants who completed the study included 12 younger (mean [SD] age, 28 [7] years; 6 men) individuals who responded to a pedestrian wearing a dark navy blue shirt, as well as 6 younger (mean [SD] age, 27 [4] years; 4 men) and 4 older (mean [SD], 70 [11] years; all men) participants who responded to a pedestrian in an orange shirt. All participants had normal visual acuity (mean [SD], -0.05 [0.06] logMAR). No significant difference in response time with yellow lens was found in all experiment conditions; younger participants for dark navy blue shirt pedestrians (F1,33\u2009=\u20090.59; P\u2009=\u2009.45), orange shirt pedestrians (F1,15\u2009=\u20090.13; P\u2009=\u2009.72), and older participants for orange shirt pedestrians (F1,9\u2009=\u20090.84; P\u2009=\u2009.38). Among all participants (n\u2009=\u200922), no significant main effect of yellow lenses was found (F1,63\u2009=\u20090.64; P\u2009=\u2009.42). In all measuring conditions, the response times with the yellow lenses were not better than with the clear lenses. Significant main effects of HLG were found with dark navy blue shirt pedestrian condition for young participants (F1,33\u2009=\u20097.34; P\u2009<\u2009.001) and with orange shirt pedestrian condition for older individuals (F1,9\u2009=\u200975.32; P\u2009<\u2009.001), where the difference in response time between with and without HLG was larger for older (1.5 seconds) than younger (0.3 seconds) participants. Conclusions and Relevance: Using a driver simulator equipped with an HLG simulator, yellow-lens night-driving glasses did not appear to improve pedestrian detection at night or reduce the negative effects of HLG on pedestrian detection performance. These findings do not appear to support having eye care professionals advise patients to use yellow-lens night-driving glasses. ",
        "Highly diversified shrew hepatitis B viruses corroborate ancient origins and divergent infection patterns of mammalian hepadnaviruses. Shrews, insectivorous small mammals, pertain to an ancient mammalian order. We screened 693 European and African shrews for hepatitis B virus (HBV) homologs to elucidate the enigmatic genealogy of HBV. Shrews host HBVs at low prevalence (2.5%) across a broad geographic and host range. The phylogenetically divergent shrew HBVs comprise separate species termed crowned shrew HBV (CSHBV) and musk shrew HBV (MSHBV), each containing distinct genotypes. Recombination events across host orders, evolutionary reconstructions, and antigenic divergence of shrew HBVs corroborated ancient origins of mammalian HBVs dating back about 80 million years. Resurrected CSHBV replicated in human hepatoma cells, but human- and tupaia-derived primary hepatocytes were resistant to hepatitis D viruses pseudotyped with CSHBV surface proteins. Functional characterization of the shrew sodium taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (Ntcp), CSHBV/MSHBV surface peptide binding patterns, and infection experiments revealed lack of Ntcp-mediated entry of shrew HBV. Contrastingly, HBV entry was enabled by the shrew Ntcp. Shrew HBVs universally showed mutations in their genomic preCore domains impeding hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) production and resembling those observed in HBeAg-negative human HBV. Deep sequencing and in situ hybridization suggest that HBeAg-negative shrew HBVs cause intense hepatotropic monoinfections and low within-host genomic heterogeneity. Geographical clustering and low MSHBV/CSHBV-specific seroprevalence suggest focal transmission and high virulence of shrew HBVs. HBeAg negativity is thus an ancient HBV infection pattern, whereas Ntcp usage for entry is not evolutionarily conserved. Shrew infection models relying on CSHBV/MSHBV revertants and human HBV will allow comparative assessments of HBeAg-mediated HBV pathogenesis, entry, and species barriers. ",
        "Development and characterization of swine primary respiratory epithelial cells and their susceptibility to infection by four influenza virus types. Influenza viruses are a group of respiratory pathogens that have evolved into four different types: A, B, C, and D. A common feature is that all four types are capable of replicating and transmitting among pigs. Here, we describe the development of isogenous cell culture system from the swine respiratory tract to study influenza viruses. Phenotypic characterization of swine primary nasal turbinate, trachea and lung cells revealed high expression of cytokeratin and demonstrated tissue site dependent expression of tight junction proteins. Furthermore, lectin binding assay on these cells demonstrated higher levels of Sia2-6Gal than Sia2-3Gal receptors and supported the replication of influenza A, B, C, and D viruses to appreciable levels at both 33 and 37\u202f\u00b0C, but replication competence was dependent on virus type or temperature used. Overall, these swine primary respiratory cells showed epithelial phenotype, which is suitable for studying the comparative biology and pathobiology of influenza viruses. ",
        "Association of social contact with dementia and cognition: 28-year follow-up of the Whitehall II cohort study. BACKGROUND: There is need to identify targets for preventing or delaying dementia. Social contact is a potential target for clinical and public health studies, but previous observational studies had short follow-up, making findings susceptible to reverse causation bias. We therefore examined the association of social contact with subsequent incident dementia and cognition with 28 years' follow-up. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of the Whitehall II longitudinal prospective cohort study of employees of London civil service departments, aged 35-55 at baseline assessment in 1985-1988 and followed to 2017. Social contact was measured six times through a self-report questionnaire about frequency of contact with non-cohabiting relatives and friends. Dementia status was ascertained from three linked clinical and mortality databases, and cognition was assessed five times using tests of verbal memory, verbal fluency, and reasoning. Cox regression models with inverse probability weighting to account for attrition and missingness examined the association between social contact at age 50, 60, and 70 years and subsequent incident dementia. Mixed linear models examined the association of midlife social contact between 45 and 55 years and cognitive trajectory during the subsequent 14 years. Analyses were adjusted for age, sex, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, education, health behaviours, employment status, and marital status. Of 10,308 Whitehall II study participants, 10,228 provided social contact data (mean age 44.9 years [standard deviation (SD) 6.1 years] at baseline; 33.1% female; 89.1% white ethnicity). More frequent social contact at age 60 years was associated with lower dementia risk (hazard ratio [HR] for each SD higher social contact frequency = 0.88 [95% CI 0.79, 0.98], p = 0.02); effect size of the association of social contact at 50 or 70 years with dementia was similar (0.92 [95% CI 0.83, 1.02], p = 0.13 and 0.91 [95% CI 0.78, 1.06], p = 0.23, respectively) but not statistically significant. The association between social contact and incident dementia was driven by contact with friends (HR = 0.90 [95% CI 0.81, 1.00], p = 0.05), but no association was found for contact with relatives. More frequent social contact during midlife was associated with better subsequent cognitive trajectory: global cognitive function was 0.07 (95% CI 0.03, 0.11), p = 0.002 SDs higher for those with the highest versus lowest tertile of social contact frequency, and this difference was maintained over 14 years follow-up. Results were consistent in a series of post hoc analyses, designed to assess potential biases. A limitation of our study is ascertainment of dementia status from electronic health records rather than in-person assessment of diagnostic status, with the possibility that milder dementia cases were more likely to be missed. CONCLUSIONS: Findings from this study suggest a protective effect of social contact against dementia and that more frequent contact confers higher cognitive reserve, although it is possible that the ability to maintain more social contact may be a marker of cognitive reserve. Future intervention studies should seek to examine whether improving social contact frequency is feasible, acceptable, and efficacious in changing cognitive outcomes. ",
        "The global prevalence of latent tuberculosis: a systematic review and meta-analysis. In 1999, the World Health Organization (WHO) estimated that one-third of the world's population had latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI), which was recently updated to one-fourth. However, this is still based on controversial assumptions in combination with tuberculin skin test (TST) surveys. Interferon-\u03b3 release assays (IGRAs) with a higher specificity than TST have since been widely implemented, but never used to estimate the global LTBI prevalence.We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of LTBI estimates based on both IGRA and TST results published between 2005 and 2018. Regional and global estimates of LTBI prevalence were calculated. Stratification was performed for low, intermediate and high TB incidence countries and a pooled estimate for each area was calculated using a random effects model.Among 3280 studies screened, we included 88 studies from 36 countries with 41 IGRA (n=67\u200a167) and 67 TST estimates (n=284\u200a644). The global prevalence of LTBI was 24.8% (95% CI 19.7-30.0%) and 21.2% (95% CI 17.9-24.4%), based on IGRA and a 10-mm TST cut-off, respectively. The prevalence estimates correlated well to WHO incidence rates (Rs=0.70, p<0.001).In the first study of the global prevalence of LTBI derived from both IGRA and TST surveys, we found that one-fourth of the world's population is infected. This is of relevance, as both tests, although imperfect, are used to identify individuals eligible for preventive therapy. Enhanced efforts are needed targeting the large pool of latently infected individuals, as this constitutes an enormous source of potential active tuberculosis. ",
        "Effects of single and integrated water, sanitation, handwashing, and nutrition interventions on child soil-transmitted helminth and Giardia infections: A cluster-randomized controlled trial in rural Kenya. BACKGROUND: Helminth and protozoan infections affect more than 1 billion children globally. Improving water quality, sanitation, handwashing, and nutrition could be more sustainable control strategies for parasite infections than mass drug administration, while providing other quality of life benefits. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We enrolled geographic clusters of pregnant women in rural western Kenya into a cluster-randomized controlled trial (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01704105) that tested 6 interventions: water treatment, improved sanitation, handwashing with soap, combined water treatment, sanitation, and handwashing (WSH), improved nutrition, and combined WSH and nutrition (WSHN). We assessed intervention effects on parasite infections by measuring Ascaris lumbricoides, Trichuris trichiura, hookworm, and Giardia duodenalis among children born to the enrolled pregnant women (index children) and their older siblings. After 2 years of intervention exposure, we collected stool specimens from 9,077 total children aged 2 to 15 years in 622 clusters, including 2,346 children in an active control group (received household visits but no interventions), 1,117 in the water treatment arm, 1,160 in the sanitation arm, 1,141 in the handwashing arm, 1,064 in the WSH arm, 1,072 in the nutrition arm, and 1,177 in the WSHN arm. In the control group, 23% of children were infected with A. lumbricoides, 1% with T. trichiura, 2% with hookworm, and 39% with G. duodenalis. The analysis included 4,928 index children (median age in years: 2) and 4,149 older siblings (median age in years: 5); study households had an average of 5 people, <10% had electricity access, and >90% had dirt floors. Compared to the control group, Ascaris infection prevalence was lower in the water treatment arm (prevalence ratio [PR]: 0.82 [95% CI 0.67, 1.00], p = 0.056), the WSH arm (PR: 0.78 [95% CI 0.63, 0.96], p = 0.021), and the WSHN arm (PR: 0.78 [95% CI 0.64, 0.96], p = 0.017). We did not observe differences in Ascaris infection prevalence between the control group and the arms with the individual interventions sanitation (PR: 0.89 [95% CI 0.73, 1.08], p = 0.228), handwashing (PR: 0.89 [95% CI 0.73, 1.09], p = 0.277), or nutrition (PR: 86 [95% CI 0.71, 1.05], p = 0.148). Integrating nutrition with WSH did not provide additional benefit. Trichuris and hookworm were rarely detected, resulting in imprecise effect estimates. No intervention reduced Giardia. Reanalysis of stool samples by quantitative polymerase chain reaction confirmed the reductions in Ascaris infections measured by microscopy in the WSH and WSHN groups. Trial limitations included imperfect uptake of targeted intervention behaviors, limited power to detect effects on rare parasite infections, and that it was not feasible to blind participants and sample collectors to treatment status. However, lab technicians and data analysts were blinded to treatment status. The trial was funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and the United States Agency for International Development. CONCLUSIONS: Integration of improved water quality, sanitation, and handwashing could contribute to sustainable control strategies for Ascaris infections, particularly in similar settings with recent or ongoing deworming programs. Combining nutrition with WSH did not provide further benefits, and water treatment alone was similarly effective to integrated WSH. Our findings provide new evidence that drinking water should be given increased attention as a transmission pathway for Ascaris. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01704105. ",
        "Molecular Study of Thyroid Cancer in World Trade Center Responders. Thyroid cancer incidence is higher in World Trade Center (WTC) responders compared with the general population. It is unclear whether this excess in thyroid cancer is associated with WTC-related exposures or if instead there is an over-diagnosis of malignant thyroid cancer among WTC first responders due to enhanced surveillance and physician bias. To maximize diagnostic yield and determine the false positive rate for malignancy, the histological diagnoses of thyroid cancer tumors from WTC responders and age, gender, and histology matched non-WTC thyroid cancer cases were evaluated using biomarkers of malignancy. Using a highly accurate panel of four biomarkers that are able to distinguish benign from malignant thyroid cancer, our results suggest that over-diagnosis by virtue of misdiagnosis of a benign tumor as malignant does not explain the increased incidence of thyroid cancer observed in WTC responders. Therefore, rather than over-diagnosis due to physician bias, the yearly screening visits by the World Trade Center Health Program are identifying true cases of thyroid cancer. Continuing regular screening of this cohort is thus warranted. ",
        "Cochlear shape reveals that the human organ of hearing is sex-typed from birth. Sex differences in behavioral and neural characteristics can be caused by cultural influences but also by sex-based differences in neurophysiological and sensorimotor features. Since signal-response systems influence decision-making, cooperative and collaborative behaviors, the anatomical or physiological bases for any sex-based difference in sensory mechanisms are important to explore. Here, we use uniform scaling and nonparametric representations of the human cochlea, the main organ of hearing that imprints its adult-like morphology within the petrosal bone from birth. We observe a sex-differentiated torsion along the 3D cochlear curve in samples of 94 adults and 22 juvenile skeletons from cross-cultural contexts. The cochlear sexual dimorphism measured in our study allows sex assessment from the human skeleton with a mean accuracy ranging from 0.91 to 0.93 throughout life. We conclude that the human cochlea is sex-typed from an early post-natal age. This, for the first time, allows nondestructive sex determination of juveniles' skeletal remains in which the biomolecules are too degraded for study but in which the petrosal is preserved, one of the most common bone within archaeological assemblages. Our observed sex-typed cochlear shape from birth is likely associated with complex evolutionary processes in modern humans for reasons not yet fully understood. ",
        "Deficient head motor control in functional dizziness: Experimental evidence of central sensory-motor dysfunction in persistent physical symptoms. Understanding the mechanisms of symptoms that are insufficiently explained by organic dysfunction remains challenging. Recently, it has been proposed that such \"functional symptoms\" are based on erroneous sensory processing in the central nervous system (CNS), with internal expectations dominating sensory inputs. In a pilot study, we used a head motor control set-up to assess the interplay between sensory input and expectation on the example of patients with functional dizziness. Eight patients and 11 age-matched healthy controls performed large active eye-head gaze shifts towards visual targets in the natural situation and with the head moment of inertia 3.3-fold increased. The latter induces head oscillations and the expected sensory outcome of the movement, estimated in the CNS, does not match the actual sensory input. Head oscillations were assessed in patients and in healthy subjects and compared to prior results from patients with organic disease (vestibular loss and cerebellar ataxia). Head oscillations in patients with functional dizziness were different from those of healthy subjects (F(1,17)=27.26, P<0.001, partial \u03b72=0.62), and similar to those of patients with cerebellar ataxia, and with vestibular loss (F(2,19)=0.56, P=0.58). Even in the natural, unweighted, condition, head oscillations were higher in functional dizziness patients than in healthy subjects (P=0.001). Since an extensive work-up failed to demonstrate any explanatory peripheral vestibular, motor, or cerebellar organic dysfunction, these motor control deficits are a first indication of erroneous interplay between expectations and sensory input in the CNS that could account for persistent physical symptoms.

        "Comprehensive comparative effectiveness and safety of first-line antihypertensive drug classes: a systematic, multinational, large-scale analysis. BACKGROUND: Uncertainty remains about the optimal monotherapy for hypertension, with current guidelines recommending any primary agent among the first-line drug classes thiazide or thiazide-like diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, and non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, in the absence of comorbid indications. Randomised trials have not further refined this choice. METHODS: We developed a comprehensive framework for real-world evidence that enables comparative effectiveness and safety evaluation across many drugs and outcomes from observational data encompassing millions of patients, while minimising inherent bias. Using this framework, we did a systematic, large-scale study under a new-user cohort design to estimate the relative risks of three primary (acute myocardial infarction, hospitalisation for heart failure, and stroke) and six secondary effectiveness and 46 safety outcomes comparing all first-line classes across a global network of six administrative claims and three electronic health record databases. The framework addressed residual confounding, publication bias, and p-hacking using large-scale propensity adjustment, a large set of control outcomes, and full disclosure of hypotheses tested. FINDINGS: Using 4\u00b79 million patients, we generated 22\u2008000 calibrated, propensity-score-adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) comparing all classes and outcomes across databases. Most estimates revealed no effectiveness differences between classes; however, thiazide or thiazide-like diuretics showed better primary effectiveness than angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors: acute myocardial infarction (HR 0\u00b784, 95% CI 0\u00b775-0\u00b795), hospitalisation for heart failure (0\u00b783, 0\u00b774-0\u00b795), and stroke (0\u00b783, 0\u00b774-0\u00b795) risk while on initial treatment. Safety profiles also favoured thiazide or thiazide-like diuretics over angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. The non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers were significantly inferior to the other four classes. INTERPRETATION: This comprehensive framework introduces a new way of doing observational health-care science at scale. The approach supports equivalence between drug classes for initiating monotherapy for hypertension-in keeping with current guidelines, with the exception of thiazide or thiazide-like diuretics superiority to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and the inferiority of non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers.

        "Contribution of gut microbiota to metabolism of dietary glycine betaine in mice and in vitro colonic fermentation. BACKGROUND: Accumulating evidence is supporting the protective effect of whole grains against several chronic diseases. Simultaneously, our knowledge is increasing on the impact of gut microbiota on our health and on how diet can modify the composition of our bacterial cohabitants. Herein, we studied C57BL/6\u2009J mice fed with diets enriched with rye bran and wheat aleurone, conventional and germ-free C57BL/6NTac mice on a basal diet, and the colonic fermentation of rye bran in an in vitro model of the human gastrointestinal system. We performed 16S rRNA gene sequencing and metabolomics on the study samples to determine the effect of bran-enriched diets on the gut microbial composition and the potential contribution of microbiota to the metabolism of a novel group of betainized compounds. RESULTS: The bran-enriched study diets elevated the levels of betainized compounds in the colon contents of C57BL/6\u2009J mice. The composition of microbiota changed, and the bran-enriched diets induced an increase in the relative abundance of several bacterial taxa, including Akkermansia, Bifidobacterium, Coriobacteriaceae, Lactobacillus, Parasutterella, and Ruminococcus, many of which are associated with improved health status or the metabolism of plant-based molecules. The levels of betainized compounds in the gut tissues of germ-free mice were significantly lower compared to conventional mice. In the in vitro model of the human gut, the production of betainized compounds was observed throughout the incubation, while the levels of glycine betaine decreased. In cereal samples, only low levels or trace amounts of other betaines than glycine betaine were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide evidence that the bacterial taxa increased in relative abundance by the bran-based diet are also involved in the metabolism of glycine betaine into other betainized compounds, adding another potential compound group acting as a mediator of the synergistic metabolic effect of diet and colonic microbiota.

        "Multiscale reverse engineering of the human ocular surface. Here we present a miniaturized analog of a blinking human eye to reverse engineer the complexity of the interface between the ocular system and the external environment. Our model comprises human cells and provides unique capabilities to replicate multiscale structural organization, biological phenotypes and dynamically regulated environmental homeostasis of the human ocular surface. Using this biomimetic system, we discovered new biological effects of blink-induced mechanical forces. Furthermore, we developed a specialized in vitro model of evaporative dry-eye disease for high-content drug screening. This work advances our ability to emulate how human physiological systems interface with the external world, and may contribute to the future development of novel screening platforms for biopharmaceutical and environmental applications.

        "Unified single-cell analysis of testis gene regulation and pathology in five mouse strains. To fully exploit the potential of single-cell functional genomics in the study of development and disease, robust methods are needed to simplify the analysis of data across samples, time-points and individuals. Here we introduce a model-based factor analysis method, SDA, to analyze a novel 57,600 cell dataset from the testes of wild-type mice and mice with gonadal defects due to disruption of the genes Mlh3, Hormad1, Cul4a or Cnp. By jointly analyzing mutant and wild-type cells we decomposed our data into 46 components that identify novel meiotic gene-regulatory programs, mutant-specific pathological processes, and technical effects, and provide a framework for imputation. We identify, de novo, DNA sequence motifs associated with individual components that define temporally varying modes of gene expression control. Analysis of SDA components also led us to identify a rare population of macrophages within the seminiferous tubules of Mlh3-/- and Hormad1-/- mice, an area typically associated with immune privilege.

        "First-In-Human Phase 1 Study of a Nonwoven Fabric Bioabsorbable Spacer for Particle Therapy: Space-Making Particle Therapy (SMPT). Purpose: Surgical spacer placement (SSP) is useful in particle therapy (PT) for patients with abdominal or pelvic tumors located adjacent to normal organs. We developed a nonwoven fabric bioabsorbable spacer made of polyglycolic acid (PGA) sutures that degrades via hydrolysis. We then conducted this first-in-human phase 1 study of the combination of SSP and PT using the PGA spacer, which we termed space-making PT (SMPT). This study aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of SMPT in patients with unresectable malignant tumor located adjacent to normal organs. Methods and Materials: The eligibility criteria included histologically proven malignant abdominal or pelvic tumor adjacent to the intestines, no metastasis, and no previous radiation therapy. Periodic computed tomography (CT) images were obtained before SSP and before, during, and after PT until the spacer disappeared. Treatment planning was performed for each CT image set until the end of PT, and doses for the planning target volume and organs at risk were analyzed. The thickness and volume of the PGA spacer were measured in each CT image set. Adverse events were evaluated according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0. Results: Five patients were enrolled in this study. All patients received 70.4\u00a0Gy (relative biological effectiveness) of irradiation. V95% of the planning target volume before SSP, at the beginning of PT, and at the end of PT was 82.1%\u00a0\u00b1\u00a011.3%, 98.1%\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.1%, and 97.1%\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.8%, respectively. The PGA spacers maintained enough thickness (\u22651\u00a0cm) until the end of PT and disappeared within 8\u00a0months after SSP in all patients. No grade \u22653 acute adverse events were observed. Conclusions: The SMPT is feasible and useful for abdominal or pelvic tumors adjacent to the intestines. This method may be applicable to unresectable tumors located adjacent to normal organs and may expand the indications of PT. ",
        "Primary infection with dengue or Zika virus does not affect the severity of heterologous secondary infection in macaques. Zika virus (ZIKV) and dengue virus (DENV) are genetically and antigenically related flaviviruses that now co-circulate in much of the tropical and subtropical world. The rapid emergence of ZIKV in the Americas in 2015 and 2016, and its recent associations with Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, birth defects, and fetal loss have led to the hypothesis that DENV infection induces cross-reactive antibodies that influence the severity of secondary ZIKV infections. It has also been proposed that pre-existing ZIKV immunity could affect DENV pathogenesis. We examined outcomes of secondary ZIKV infections in three rhesus and fifteen cynomolgus macaques, as well as secondary DENV-2 infections in three additional rhesus macaques up to a year post-primary ZIKV infection. Although cross-binding antibodies were detected prior to secondary infection for all animals and cross-neutralizing antibodies were detected for some animals, previous DENV or ZIKV infection had no apparent effect on the clinical course of heterotypic secondary infections in these animals. All animals had asymptomatic infections and, when compared to controls, did not have significantly perturbed hematological parameters. Rhesus macaques infected with DENV-2 approximately one year after primary ZIKV infection had higher vRNA loads in plasma when compared with serum vRNA loads from ZIKV-naive animals infected with DENV-2, but a differential effect of sample type could not be ruled out. In cynomolgus macaques, the serotype of primary DENV infection did not affect the outcome of secondary ZIKV infection. ",
        "Lysine harvesting is an antioxidant strategy and triggers underground polyamine metabolism. Both single and multicellular organisms depend on anti-stress mechanisms that enable them to deal with sudden changes in the environment, including exposure to heat and oxidants. Central to the stress response are dynamic changes in metabolism, such as the transition from the glycolysis to the pentose phosphate pathway-a conserved first-line response to oxidative insults1,2. Here we report a second metabolic adaptation that protects microbial cells in stress situations. The role of the yeast polyamine transporter Tpo1p3-5 in maintaining oxidant resistance is unknown6. However, a proteomic time-course experiment suggests a link to lysine metabolism. We reveal a connection between polyamine and lysine metabolism during stress situations,\u00a0in the form of a promiscuous enzymatic reaction in which the first enzyme of the polyamine pathway, Spe1p, decarboxylates lysine and forms an alternative polyamine, cadaverine. The reaction proceeds in the presence of extracellular lysine, which is taken up by cells to reach concentrations up to one hundred times higher than those required for growth. Such extensive harvest is not observed for the other amino acids, is dependent on the polyamine pathway and triggers a reprogramming of redox metabolism. As a result, NADPH-which would otherwise be required for lysine biosynthesis-is channelled into glutathione metabolism, leading to a large increase in glutathione concentrations, lower levels of reactive oxygen species and increased oxidant tolerance. Our results show that nutrient uptake occurs not only to enable cell growth, but when the nutrient availability is favourable it\u00a0also enables cells to reconfigure their metabolism to preventatively mount stress protection.

        "Child friendly spaces impact across five humanitarian settings: a meta-analysis. BACKGROUND: Humanitarian crises present major threats to the wellbeing of children. These threats include risks of violence, abduction and abuse, emotional distress and the disruption of development. Humanitarian response efforts frequently address these threats through psychosocial programming. Systematic reviews have demonstrated the weak evidence-base regarding the impact of such interventions. This analysis assesses the impact of Child Friendly Spaces (CFS), one such commonly implemented intervention after humanitarian emergencies. METHODS: We completed baseline and endline (three-six months post-baseline) assessments regarding protection concerns, psychosocial wellbeing, developmental assets and community resources for a total of 1010 children and 1312 carers in catchment areas for interventions with humanitarian populations in Ethiopia, Uganda, Iraq, Jordan, and Nepal. We estimated intervention effect-sizes with Cohen's d for difference in mean difference scores between attenders and non-attenders - who proved comparable on baseline measures - by site. We then pooled findings for a meta-analysis summarizing overall impacts across domains. RESULTS: Amongst children aged 6-11, significant intervention impacts were observed through site-level analysis for protection concerns (Ethiopia, Cohen's d\u2009=\u20090.48, 95% CI 0.08-0.88), psychosocial wellbeing (Ethiopia, d\u2009=\u20090.51, 95% CI 0.10-0.91; and Uganda, d\u2009=\u20090.21, 95% CI 0.02-0.40), and developmental assets (Uganda, d\u2009=\u20090.37, 95% CI 0.15-0.59; and Iraq, d\u2009=\u20090.86, 95% CI 0.18-1.54). Pooled analyses for this age group found impacts of intervention to be significant only for psychosocial wellbeing (d\u2009=\u20090.18, 95% CI 0.03-0.33). Among children aged 12-17, site-level analysis indicated intervention impact for protection concerns in one site (Iraq, d\u2009=\u20090.58, 95% CI 0.07-1.09), with pooled analysis indicating no significant impacts. CONCLUSION: CFS can provide - albeit inconsistently - a protective and promotive environment for younger children. CFS show no impact with older children and in connecting children and carers with wider community resources. A major reappraisal of programming approaches and quality assurance mechanisms is required. ",
        "Gab3 is required for IL-2- and IL-15-induced NK cell expansion and limits trophoblast invasion during pregnancy. The scaffolding protein Grb2-associated binding protein 3 (Gab3) is a member of the Gab family, whose functions have remained elusive. Here, we identify Gab3 as a key determinant of peripheral NK cell expansion. Loss of Gab3 resulted in impaired IL-2 and IL-15-induced NK cell priming and expansion due to a selective impairment in MAPK signaling but not STAT5 signaling. In vivo, we found that Gab3 is required for recognition and elimination of \"missing-self\" and tumor targets. Unexpectedly, our studies also revealed that Gab3 plays an important role during pregnancy. Gab3-deficient mice exhibited impaired uterine NK cell expansion associated with abnormal spiral artery remodeling and increased trophoblast invasion in the decidua basalis. This coincided with stillbirth, retained placenta, maternal hemorrhage, and undelivered fetoplacental units at term. Thus, Gab3 is a key component required for cytokine-mediated NK cell priming and expansion that is essential for antitumor responses and limits trophoblast cell invasion during pregnancy. ",
        "Immunization with mannosylated nanovaccines and inhibition of the immune-suppressing microenvironment sensitizes melanoma to immune checkpoint modulators. A low response rate, acquired resistance and severe side effects have limited the clinical outcomes of immune checkpoint therapy. Here, we show that combining cancer nanovaccines with an anti-PD-1 antibody (\u03b1PD-1) for immunosuppression blockade and an anti-OX40 antibody (\u03b1OX40) for effector T-cell stimulation, expansion and survival can potentiate the efficacy of melanoma therapy. Prophylactic and therapeutic combination regimens of dendritic cell-targeted mannosylated nanovaccines with \u03b1PD-1/\u03b1OX40 demonstrate a synergism that stimulates T-cell infiltration into tumours at early treatment stages. However, this treatment at the therapeutic regimen does not result in an enhanced inhibition of tumour growth compared to \u03b1PD-1/\u03b1OX40 alone and is accompanied by an increased infiltration of myeloid-derived suppressor cells in tumours. Combining the double therapy with ibrutinib, a myeloid-derived suppressor cell inhibitor, leads to a remarkable tumour remission and prolonged survival in melanoma-bearing mice. The synergy between the mannosylated nanovaccines, ibrutinib and \u03b1PD-1/\u03b1OX40 provides essential insights to devise alternative regimens to improve the efficacy of immune checkpoint modulators in solid tumours by regulating the endogenous immune response.

        "Ultrasonographic Guidance to Improve First-Attempt Success in Children With Predicted Difficult Intravenous Access in the Emergency Department: A Randomized Controlled Trial. STUDY OBJECTIVE: We determine whether ultrasonographically guided intravenous line placement improves the rate of first-attempt success by 20% for children with predicted difficult intravenous access. Secondary objectives included determining whether ultrasonographically guided intravenous line placement reduces the attempt number, improves time to access or parental satisfaction, or affects intravenous line survival and complications. METHODS: This was a prospective, randomized controlled trial conducted in an urban tertiary care pediatric emergency department that enrolled a convenience sample of children requiring an intravenous line and who were predicted to have difficult intravenous access according to a previously validated score. Participants were randomized to traditional or ultrasonographically guided intravenous line placement on first attempt and stratified by aged 0 to 3 versus older than 3 years. RESULTS: One hundred sixty-seven patients were enrolled and randomized to traditional intravenous line or to a care bundle with a multidisciplinary team trained to place ultrasonographically guided intravenous lines. First-attempt success was increased in the ultrasonographically guided intravenous line placement arm (n=83) compared with the traditional intravenous line arm (n=84) (85.4% versus 45.8%; relative risk 1.9; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.5 to 2.4). There were fewer attempts in the ultrasonographically guided intravenous line placement arm than in the traditional intravenous line arm (median 1 versus 2; median difference 1; 95% CI 0.8 to 1.2) and a shorter time from randomization to intravenous line flush (median 14 minutes [interquartile range 11 to 20] versus 28 minutes [interquartile range 16 to 42]). A Kaplan-Meier survival analysis demonstrated that ultrasonographically guided intravenous lines survived longer than traditional ones (median 7.3 days [95% CI 3.7 to 9.5] versus 2.3 days [95% CI 1.8 to 3.3]). There was no difference in complications between the groups. Parents were more satisfied with ultrasonographically guided intravenous line placement. CONCLUSION: Ultrasonographically guided intravenous line placement in children with predicted difficult intravenous access improved first-attempt success and intravenous line longevity when conducted by a team of trained providers.

        "Comprehensive comparative effectiveness and safety of first-line antihypertensive drug classes: a systematic, multinational, large-scale analysis. BACKGROUND: Uncertainty remains about the optimal monotherapy for hypertension, with current guidelines recommending any primary agent among the first-line drug classes thiazide or thiazide-like diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, and non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, in the absence of comorbid indications. Randomised trials have not further refined this choice. METHODS: We developed a comprehensive framework for real-world evidence that enables comparative effectiveness and safety evaluation across many drugs and outcomes from observational data encompassing millions of patients, while minimising inherent bias. Using this framework, we did a systematic, large-scale study under a new-user cohort design to estimate the relative risks of three primary (acute myocardial infarction, hospitalisation for heart failure, and stroke) and six secondary effectiveness and 46 safety outcomes comparing all first-line classes across a global network of six administrative claims and three electronic health record databases. The framework addressed residual confounding, publication bias, and p-hacking using large-scale propensity adjustment, a large set of control outcomes, and full disclosure of hypotheses tested. FINDINGS: Using 4\u00b79 million patients, we generated 22\u2008000 calibrated, propensity-score-adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) comparing all classes and outcomes across databases. Most estimates revealed no effectiveness differences between classes; however, thiazide or thiazide-like diuretics showed better primary effectiveness than angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors: acute myocardial infarction (HR 0\u00b784, 95% CI 0\u00b775-0\u00b795), hospitalisation for heart failure (0\u00b783, 0\u00b774-0\u00b795), and stroke (0\u00b783, 0\u00b774-0\u00b795) risk while on initial treatment. Safety profiles also favoured thiazide or thiazide-like diuretics over angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. The non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers were significantly inferior to the other four classes. INTERPRETATION: This comprehensive framework introduces a new way of doing observational health-care science at scale. The approach supports equivalence between drug classes for initiating monotherapy for hypertension-in keeping with current guidelines, with the exception of thiazide or thiazide-like diuretics superiority to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and the inferiority of non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers.

        "Associations of dietary choline intake with risk of incident dementia and with cognitive performance: the Kuopio Ischaemic Heart Disease Risk Factor Study. BACKGROUND: Moderate egg intake has been associated with better cognitive performance in observational studies. This association may be due to the rich content of choline, especially phosphatidylcholine, in eggs because choline has been suggested to have a role in the prevention of cognitive decline. OBJECTIVES: We investigated the associations of dietary choline intake with the risk of incident dementia and with cognitive performance in middle-aged and older men in the prospective, population-based Kuopio Ischaemic Heart Disease Risk Factor Study. METHODS: A population-based sample of 2497 dementia-free men aged 42-60 y was examined in 1984-1989. A subset of 482 men completed 5 different cognitive performance tests 4 y later. Dementia and Alzheimer disease diagnoses were retrieved from Finnish health registers. Dietary intakes were assessed with the use of 4-d food records at baseline. Cox regression and ANCOVA were used for the analyses. All analyses were also stratified by the apolipoprotein E phenotype (APOE-\u03b54 compared with other phenotypes). These data were available for 1259 men. RESULTS: The mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SD total choline intake was 431\u00a0\u00b1\u00a088 mg/d, of which 188\u00a0\u00b1\u00a063 mg/d was phosphatidylcholine. During a 21.9-y follow-up, 337 men were diagnosed with dementia. Those in the highest compared with the lowest phosphatidylcholine intake quartile had 28% (95% CI: 1%, 48%; P-trend\u00a0=\u00a00.02 across quartiles) lower multivariable-adjusted risk of incident dementia. Total choline intake had no association with the risk of incident dementia. However, both total choline and phosphatidylcholine intakes were associated with better performance in cognitive tests assessing frontal and temporal lobe functioning. For example, higher intakes were associated with better performance in verbal fluency and memory functions. The APOE phenotype had little or no impact on the associations. CONCLUSION: Higher phosphatidylcholine intake was associated with lower risk of incident dementia and better cognitive performance in men in eastern Finland. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT03221127. ",
        "Performing different kinds of physical exercise differentially attenuates the genetic effects on obesity measures: Evidence from 18,424 Taiwan Biobank participants. Obesity is a worldwide health problem that is closely linked to many metabolic disorders. Regular physical exercise has been found to attenuate the genetic predisposition to obesity. However, it remains unknown what kinds of exercise can modify the genetic risk of obesity. This study included 18,424 unrelated Han Chinese adults aged 30-70 years who participated in the Taiwan Biobank (TWB). A total of 5 obesity measures were investigated here, including body mass index (BMI), body fat percentage (BFP), waist circumference (WC), hip circumference (HC), and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR). Because there have been no large genome-wide association studies on obesity for Han Chinese, we used the TWB internal weights to construct genetic risk scores (GRSs) for each obesity measure, and then test the significance of GRS-by-exercise interactions. The significance level throughout this work was set at 0.05/550 = 9.1x10-5 because a total of 550 tests were performed. Performing regular exercise was found to attenuate the genetic effects on 4 obesity measures, including BMI, BFP, WC, and HC. Among the 18 kinds of self-reported regular exercise, 6 mitigated the genetic effects on at least one obesity measure. Regular jogging blunted the genetic effects on BMI, BFP, and HC. Mountain climbing, walking, exercise walking, international standard dancing, and a longer practice of yoga also attenuated the genetic effects on BMI. Exercises such as cycling, stretching exercise, swimming, dance dance revolution, and qigong were not found to modify the genetic effects on any obesity measure. Across all 5 obesity measures, regular jogging consistently presented the most significant interactions with GRSs. Our findings show that the genetic effects on obesity measures can be decreased to various extents by performing different kinds of exercise. The benefits of regular physical exercise are more impactful in subjects who are more predisposed to obesity. ",
        "The NDV-3A vaccine protects mice from multidrug resistant Candida auris infection. Candida auris is an emerging, multi-drug resistant, health care-associated fungal pathogen. Its predominant prevalence in hospitals and nursing homes indicates its ability to adhere to and colonize the skin, or persist in an environment outside the host-a trait unique from other Candida species. Besides being associated globally with life-threatening disseminated infections, C. auris also poses significant clinical challenges due to its ability to adhere to polymeric surfaces and form highly drug-resistant biofilms. Here, we performed bioinformatic studies to identify the presence of adhesin proteins in C. auris, with sequence as well as 3-D structural homologies to the major adhesin/invasin of C. albicans, Als3. Anti-Als3p antibodies generated by vaccinating mice with NDV-3A (a vaccine based on the N-terminus of Als3 protein formulated with alum) recognized C. auris in vitro, blocked its ability to form biofilms and enhanced macrophage-mediated killing of the fungus. Furthermore, NDV-3A vaccination induced significant levels of C. auris cross-reactive humoral and cellular immune responses, and protected immunosuppressed mice from lethal C. auris disseminated infection, compared to the control alum-vaccinated mice. The mechanism of protection is attributed to anti-Als3p antibodies and CD4+ T helper cells activating tissue macrophages. Finally, NDV-3A potentiated the protective efficacy of the antifungal drug micafungin, against C. auris candidemia. Identification of Als3-like adhesins in C. auris makes it a target for immunotherapeutic strategies using NDV-3A, a vaccine with known efficacy against other Candida species and safety as well as efficacy in clinical trials. Considering that C. auris can be resistant to almost all classes of antifungal drugs, such an approach has profound clinical relevance. ",
        "IP1867B suppresses the insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R) ablating epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitor resistance in adult high grade gliomas. High grade gliomas (HGGs) are aggressive primary brain tumours with local invasive growth and poor clinical prognosis. Clinical outcome is compounded by resistance to standard and novel therapeutics. We have evaluated reformulated aspirin (IP1867B) alone and in combination with conventional and novel anti-aHGG agents. We show that recent biopsy-derived aHGG models were highly resistant to conventional therapeutics although show sensitivity to IP1867B, a reformulated \"liquid\" aspirin. IP1867B treatment mediated a potent suppression of the IL6/STAT3 and NF-\u03baB pathways and observed a significant reduction in EGFR transcription and protein expression. We observed the loss of the insulin-like growth factor 1 and insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor expression at both the transcript and protein level post IP1867B treatment. This increased sensitivity to EGFR inhibitors. In vivo, IP1867B was very well tolerated, had little-to-no gastric lesions versus aspirin and, directed a significant reduction of tumour burden with suppression of EGFR, IGF1 and IGFR1. With EGFR inhibitors, we noted a potent synergistic response in aHGG cells. These data provide a rationale for further investigation of IP1867B with a number of anti-EGFR agents currently being evaluated in the clinic. ",
        "Combined GLP-1, Oxyntomodulin, and Peptide YY Improves Body Weight and Glycemia in Obesity and Prediabetes/Type 2 Diabetes: A Randomized, Single-Blinded, Placebo-Controlled Study. OBJECTIVE: Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) augments postprandial secretion of glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1), oxyntomodulin (OXM), and peptide YY (PYY). Subcutaneous infusion of these hormones (\"GOP\"), mimicking postprandial levels, reduces energy intake. Our objective was to study the effects of GOP on glycemia and body weight when given for 4 weeks to patients with diabetes and obesity. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In this single-blinded mechanistic study, obese patients with prediabetes/diabetes were randomized to GOP (n = 15) or saline (n = 11) infusion for 4 weeks. We also studied 21 patients who had undergone RYGB and 22 patients who followed a very low-calorie diet (VLCD) as unblinded comparators. Outcomes measured were 1) body weight, 2) fructosamine levels, 3) glucose and insulin during a mixed meal test (MMT), 4) energy expenditure (EE), 5) energy intake (EI), and 6) mean glucose and measures of glucose variability during continuous glucose monitoring. RESULTS: GOP infusion was well tolerated over the 4-week period. There was a greater weight loss (P = 0.025) with GOP (mean change -4.4 [95% CI -5.3, -3.5] kg) versus saline (-2.5 [-4.1, -0.9] kg). GOP led to a greater improvement (P = 0.0026) in fructosamine (-44.1 [-62.7, -25.5] \u00b5mol/L) versus saline (-11.7 [-18.9, -4.5] \u00b5mol/L). Despite a smaller weight loss compared with RYGB and VLCD, GOP led to superior glucose tolerance after a mixed-meal stimulus and reduced glycemic variability compared with RYGB and VLCD. CONCLUSIONS: GOP infusion improves glycemia and reduces body weight. It achieves superior glucose tolerance and reduced glucose variability compared with RYGB and VLCD. GOP is a viable alternative for the treatment of diabetes with favorable effects on body weight. ",
        "PD-1 blockade in subprimed CD8 cells induces dysfunctional PD-1+CD38hi cells and anti-PD-1 resistance. Understanding resistance to antibody to programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1; anti-PD-1) is crucial for the development of reversal strategies. In anti-PD-1-resistant models, simultaneous anti-PD-1 and vaccine therapy reversed resistance, while PD-1 blockade before antigen priming abolished therapeutic outcomes. This was due to induction of dysfunctional PD-1+CD38hi CD8+ cells by PD-1 blockade in suboptimally primed CD8 cell conditions induced by tumors. This results in erroneous T cell receptor signaling and unresponsiveness to antigenic restimulation. On the other hand, PD-1 blockade of optimally primed CD8 cells prevented the induction of dysfunctional CD8 cells, reversing resistance. Depleting PD-1+CD38hi CD8+ cells enhanced therapeutic outcomes. Furthermore, non-responding patients showed more PD-1+CD38+CD8+ cells in tumor and blood than responders. In conclusion, the status of CD8+ T cell priming is a major contributor to anti-PD-1 therapeutic resistance. PD-1 blockade in unprimed or suboptimally primed CD8 cells induces resistance through the induction of PD-1+CD38hi CD8+ cells that is reversed by optimal priming. PD-1+CD38hi CD8+ cells serve as a predictive and therapeutic biomarker for anti-PD-1 treatment. Sequencing of anti-PD-1 and vaccine is crucial for successful therapy. ",
        "Peroxynitrite supports a metabolic reprogramming in merlin-deficient Schwann cells and promotes cell survival. Neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) is an autosomal-dominant disorder characterized by the development of bilateral vestibular schwannomas. The NF2 gene encodes the tumor suppressor merlin, and loss of merlin activity promotes tumorigenesis and causes NF2. Cellular redox signaling has been implicated in different stages of tumor development. Among reactive nitrogen species, peroxynitrite is the most powerful oxidant produced by cells. We recently showed that peroxynitrite-mediated tyrosine nitration down-regulates mitochondrial metabolism in tumor cells. However, whether peroxynitrite supports a metabolic shift that could be exploited for therapeutic development is unknown. Here, we show that vestibular schwannomas from NF2 patients and human, merlin-deficient (MD) Schwann cells have high levels of endogenous tyrosine nitration, indicating production of peroxynitrite. Furthermore, scavenging or inhibiting peroxynitrite formation significantly and selectively decreased survival of human and mouse MD-Schwann cells. Using multiple complementary methods, we also found that merlin deficiency leads to a reprogramming of energy metabolism characterized by a peroxynitrite-dependent decrease of oxidative phosphorylation and increased glycolysis and glutaminolysis. In MD-Schwann cells, scavenging of peroxynitrite increased mitochondrial oxygen consumption and membrane potential, mediated by the up-regulation of the levels and activity of mitochondrial complex IV. This increase in mitochondrial activity correlated with a decrease in the glycolytic rate and glutamine dependence. This is the first demonstration of a peroxynitrite-dependent reprogramming of energy metabolism in tumor cells. Oxidized proteins constitute a novel target for therapeutic development not only for the treatment of NF2 schwannomas but also other tumors in which peroxynitrite plays a regulatory role. ",
        "Thyroid Function Screening in Children and Adolescents With Mood and Anxiety Disorders. OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of abnormal thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) measures in youth with severe mood and anxiety disorders and to examine clinical and demographic predictors of abnormal TSH measures. METHODS: We retrospectively examined screening TSH concentrations in psychiatrically hospitalized children and adolescents (3-19 years) with mood/anxiety disorders (DSM-IV and DSM-5 criteria) at a large, urban, pediatric hospital between September 2013 and April 2017. Symptoms were extracted from the medical record using adaptive natural language processing algorithms, and the utility of demographic, clinical, and treatment variables as predictors of abnormal TSH measures was evaluated using logistic regression. RESULTS: In this sample (N = 1,017, mean \u00b1 SD age = 14.7 \u00b1 2.24 years), 62 patients had a TSH concentration > 3.74 \u03bcIU/mL (5.3% [n = 6] of patients < 12 years of age and 6.2% [n = 56] of patients \u2265 12 years of age), and 7 patients had a TSH concentration < 0.36 \u03bcIU/mL. Elevated TSH concentrations were associated with a recent weight gain (odds ratio [OR] = 3.60; 95% CI, 1.13-9.61; P = .017), a history of thyroid disease (OR = 6.88; 95% CI, 2.37-10.7; P \u2264 .0001), abnormal menstrual bleeding/menometrorrhagia (OR = 2.03; CI, 1.04-3.63; P = .024), and benzodiazepine treatment (OR = 2.29; 95% CI, 1.07-4.52; P = .02). No association was observed for sex, age, or body mass index z score. Among patients with elevated TSH measures, 12.9% (n = 8, mean \u00b1 SD age = 16.5 \u00b1 1.5 years, 87.5% female) had an abnormal free/total thyroxine (T\u2084) level or other biochemical findings consistent with thyroid disease. Patients with thyroid disease (compared to those patients with elevated TSH and normal active thyroid hormone concentrations) were older (16.5 \u00b1 1.5 vs 14.6 \u00b1 2.3 years, P = .020) but did not differ in sex distribution (87.5% vs 63.6% female, P = .444). CONCLUSIONS: TSH concentrations are abnormal in approximately 6% of psychiatrically hospitalized youth, although thyroid disease was present in < 1% of the total sample. Targeted screening should focus on patients with recent weight gain, those treated with benzodiazepines, and girls with a history of abnormal uterine bleeding/menometrorrhagia. ",
        "Expansion of Luminal Progenitor Cells in the Aging Mouse and Human Prostate. Aging is associated with loss of tissue mass and a decline in adult stem cell function in many tissues. In contrast, aging in the prostate is associated with growth-related diseases including benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Surprisingly, the effects of aging on prostate epithelial cells have not been established. Here we find that organoid-forming progenitor activity of mouse prostate basal and luminal cells is maintained with age. This is caused by an age-related expansion of progenitor-like luminal cells that share features with human prostate luminal progenitor cells. The increase in luminal progenitor cells may contribute to greater risk for growth-related disease in the aging prostate. Importantly, we demonstrate expansion of human luminal progenitor cells in BPH. In summary, we define a Trop2+ luminal progenitor subset and identify an age-related shift in the luminal compartment of the mouse and human prostate epithelium. ",
        "Sox9 Is a Modifier of the Liver Disease Severity in a Mouse Model of Alagille Syndrome. BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Alagille syndrome (ALGS) is a multisystem developmental disorder characterized by bile duct (BD) paucity, caused primarily by haploinsufficiency of the Notch ligand jagged1. The course of the liver disease is highly variable in ALGS. However, the genetic basis for ALGS phenotypic variability is unknown. Previous studies have reported decreased expression of the transcription factor SOX9 (sex determining region Y-box 9) in late embryonic and neonatal livers of Jag1-deficient mice. Here, we investigated the effects of altering the Sox9 gene dosage on the severity of liver disease in an ALGS mouse model. APPROACH AND RESULTS: Conditional removal of one copy of Sox9 in Jag1+/- livers impairs the biliary commitment of cholangiocytes and enhances the inflammatory reaction and liver fibrosis. Loss of both copies of Sox9 in Jag1+/- livers further worsens the phenotypes and results in partial lethality. Ink injection experiments reveal impaired biliary tree formation in the periphery of P30 Jag1+/- livers, which is improved by 5\u00a0months of age. Sox9 heterozygosity worsens the P30 biliary tree phenotype and impairs the partial recovery in 5-month-old animals. Notably, Sox9 overexpression improves BD paucity and liver phenotypes in Jag1+/- mice without ectopic hepatocyte-to-cholangiocyte transdifferentiation or long-term liver abnormalities. Notch2 expression in the liver is increased following Sox9 overexpression, and SOX9 binds the Notch2 regulatory region in the liver. Histological analysis shows a correlation between the level and pattern of SOX9 expression in the liver and outcome of the liver disease in patients with ALGS. CONCLUSIONS: Our results establish Sox9 as a dosage-sensitive modifier of Jag1+/- liver phenotypes with a permissive role in biliary development. Our data further suggest that liver-specific increase in SOX9 levels is a potential therapeutic approach for BD paucity in ALGS. ",
        "The Orphan Cytokine Receptor CRLF3 Emerged With the Origin of the Nervous System and Is a Neuroprotective Erythropoietin Receptor in Locusts. The orphan cytokine receptor-like factor 3 (CRLF3) was identified as a neuroprotective erythropoietin receptor in locust neurons and emerged with the evolution of the eumetazoan nervous system. Human CRLF3 belongs to class I helical cytokine receptors that mediate pleiotropic cellular reactions to injury and diverse physiological challenges. It is expressed in various tissues including the central nervous system but its ligand remains unidentified. A CRLF3 ortholog in the holometabolous beetle Tribolium castaneum was recently shown to induce anti-apoptotic mechanisms upon stimulation with human recombinant erythropoietin. To test the hypothesis that CRLF3 represents an ancient cell-protective receptor for erythropoietin-like cytokines, we investigated its presence across metazoan species. Furthermore, we examined CRLF3 expression and function in the hemimetabolous insect Locusta migratoria. Phylogenetic analysis of CRLF3 sequences indicated that CRLF3 is absent in Porifera, Placozoa and Ctenophora, all lacking the traditional nervous system. However, it is present in all major eumetazoan groups ranging from cnidarians over protostomians to mammals. The CRLF3 sequence is highly conserved and abundant amongst vertebrates. In contrast, relatively few invertebrates express CRLF3 and these sequences show greater variability, suggesting frequent loss due to low functional importance. In L. migratoria, we identified the transcript Lm-crlf3 by RACE-PCR and detected its expression in locust brain, skeletal muscle and hemocytes. These findings correspond to the ubiquitous expression of crlf3 in mammalian tissues. We demonstrate that the sole addition of double-stranded RNA to the culture medium (called soaking RNA interference) specifically interferes with protein expression in locust primary brain cell cultures. This technique was used to knock down Lm-crlf3 expression and to abolish its physiological function. We confirmed that recombinant human erythropoietin rescues locust brain neurons from hypoxia-induced apoptosis and showed that this neuroprotective effect is absent after knocking down Lm-crlf3. Our results affirm the erythropoietin-induced neuroprotective function of CRLF3 in a second insect species from a different taxonomic group. They suggest that the phylogenetically conserved CRLF3 receptor may function as a cell protective receptor for erythropoietin or a structurally related cytokine also in other animals including vertebrate and mammalian species.

        "Prevalence of Mental Health Disorders Among Adults With Cerebral Palsy: A Cross-sectional Analysis. Background: Persons with cerebral palsy (CP) have an increased risk for secondary chronic conditions during childhood, including mental health disorders. However, little is known about how these disorders affect adults with CP. Objective: To determine the prevalence of mental health disorders among adults with CP compared with those without CP. Design: Cross-sectional. Setting: 2016 Optum Clinformatics Data Mart. Patients: 8.7 million adults (including 7348 adults with CP). Measurements: Other neurodevelopmental comorbid conditions (intellectual disabilities, autism spectrum disorders, epilepsy) and 37 mental health disorders (as 6 categories) were identified on the basis of diagnosis codes. Direct age-standardized prevalence of the mental health disorder categories was estimated by sex for adults with CP alone, adults with CP and neurodevelopmental disorders, and adults without CP. Results: Men with CP alone had higher age-standardized prevalence than men without CP for schizophrenic disorders (2.8% [95% CI, 2.2% to 3.4%] vs. 0.7%), mood affective disorders (19.5% [CI, 18.0% to 21.0%] vs. 8.1%), anxiety disorders (19.5% [CI, 18.0% to 21.0%] vs. 11.1%), disorders of adult personality and behavior (1.2% [CI, 0.8% to 1.6%] vs. 0.3%), and alcohol- and opioid-related disorders (4.7% [CI, 3.9% to 5.5%] vs. 3.0%). The same pattern was observed for women. Compared with adults with CP alone, those with CP and neurodevelopmental disorders had similar or higher age-standardized prevalence of the 6 mental health disorder categories, except for the lower prevalence of alcohol- and opioid-related disorders in men. Limitations: Single claims code was used to define the cohort of interest. Information on the severity of CP was not available. Conclusion: Compared with adults without CP, those with CP have an elevated prevalence of mental health disorders, some of which may be more pronounced in patients with comorbid neurodevelopmental disorders.

        "Care Settings and Clinical Characteristics of Older Adults with Moderately Severe Dementia. OBJECTIVES: Little population-level evidence exists to guide the development of interventions for people with dementia in non-nursing home settings. We hypothesized people living at home with moderately severe dementia would differ in social, functional, and medical characteristics from those in either residential care or nursing home settings. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study using pooled data from the National Health and Aging Trends Study, an annual survey of a nationally representative sample of Medicare beneficiaries. SETTING: US national sample. PARTICIPANTS: Respondents newly meeting criteria for incident moderately severe dementia, defined as probable dementia with functional impairment: 728 older adults met our definition between 2012 and 2016. MEASUREMENTS: Social characteristics examined included age, sex, race/ethnicity, country of origin, income, educational attainment, partnership status, and household size. Functional characteristics included help with daily activities, falls, mobility device use, and limitation to home or bed. Medical characteristics included comorbid conditions, self-rated health, hospital stay, symptoms, and dementia behaviors. RESULTS: Extrapolated to the population, an estimated 3.3 million older adults developed incident moderately severe dementia between 2012 and 2016. Within this cohort, 64% received care at home, 19% in residential care, and 17% in a nursing facility. social, functional, and medical characteristics differed across care settings. Older adults living at home were 2 to 5 times more likely to be members of disadvantaged populations and had more medical needs: 71% reported bothersome pain compared with 60% in residential care or 59% in nursing homes. CONCLUSION: Over a 5-year period, 2.1 million people lived at home with incident moderately severe dementia. People living at home had a higher prevalence of demographic characteristics associated with systematic patterns of disadvantage, more social support, less functional impairment, worse health, and more symptoms compared with people living in residential care or nursing facilities. This novel study provides insight into setting-specific differences among people with dementia. J Am Geriatr Soc 67:1907-1912, 2019. ",
        "Multicenter Trial of [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography Staging of Head and Neck Cancer and Negative Predictive Value and Surgical Impact in the N0 Neck: Results From ACRIN 6685. PURPOSE: The objective of this study was to determine the negative predictive value (NPV) of positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) for the clinically N0 neck on the basis of neck dissection. METHODS: Participants with newly diagnosed, first-time, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) and at least one clinically N0 neck side for which dissection was planned were included. A total of 287 participants were prospectively enrolled from 23 American College of Radiology Imaging Network-qualified institutions. PET/CT was compared with findings at neck dissection. RESULTS: PET/CT scans and pathology findings were available for 270 N0 neck sides from 212 participants. For visual assessment, the NPV specific to the clinical-N0 sides was 0.868 (95% CI, 0.803 to 0.925). For dichotomized maximum standardized uptake value, the NPVs specific to the nodal basins were 0.940 (95% CI, 0.928 to 0.952) and 0.937 (95% CI, 0.925 to 0.949) at prespecified cutoffs of 2.5 and 3.5, respectively. The optimal cutoff maximum standardized uptake value was determined to be 1.8, with an NPV of 0.942 (95% CI, 0.930 to 0.953). The PET/CT-informed surgical treatment plan was changed in 51 of 237 participants (22%) compared with the PET/CT-blinded surgical plan. In 34 participants (14%), this led to planned dissection of additional nodal levels. In 12 participants (5%), this led to fewer planned dissected nodal levels. Negative PET/CT scans in N0 necks was true negative in 87% and false negative in 13%. CONCLUSION: [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose-PET/CT has high NPV for the N0 neck in T2 to T4 HNSCC. The surgical treatment plans on the basis of PET/CT findings may be changed in approximately 22% of this group. These findings suggest that [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose-PET/CT may assist the clinician in deciding on the best therapy for the clinically N0 neck in HNSCC. Well-designed clinical trials should be performed to test the outcome of omitting neck dissection by using PET/CT. ",
        "Allele specific repair of splicing mutations in cystic fibrosis through AsCas12a genome editing. Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive disease caused by mutations in\u00a0the CFTR\u00a0gene. The 3272-26A>G and 3849+10kbC>T CFTR mutations alter the correct splicing of the CFTR gene, generating new acceptor and donor splice sites respectively. Here we develop a genome editing approach to permanently correct these genetic defects, using a single crRNA and the Acidaminococcus sp. BV3L6, AsCas12a. This genetic repair strategy is highly precise, showing very strong discrimination between the wild-type and mutant sequence and a complete absence of detectable off-targets. The efficacy of this gene correction strategy is verified in intestinal organoids and airway epithelial cells derived from CF patients carrying the 3272-26A>G or 3849+10kbC>T mutations, showing efficient repair and complete functional recovery of the CFTR channel. These results demonstrate that allele-specific genome editing with AsCas12a can correct aberrant CFTR splicing mutations, paving the way for a permanent splicing correction in genetic diseases. ",
        "Role of Nonsteroidal Antiinflammatory Drugs in the Association Between Osteoarthritis and Cardiovascular Diseases: A Longitudinal Study. OBJECTIVE: To elucidate the role of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in the increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) among osteoarthritis (OA) patients. METHODS: This longitudinal study was based on linked health administrative data from British Columbia, Canada. From a population-based cohort of 720,055 British Columbians, we selected 7,743 OA patients and 23,229 age- and sex-matched non-OA controls. We used multivariable Cox proportional hazards models to estimate the risk of developing incident CVD (primary outcome) as well as ischemic heart disease, congestive heart failure, and stroke (secondary outcomes). To estimate the mediating effect of NSAIDs, defined as current use of an NSAID according to linked PharmaNet data, in the OA-CVD relationship, we implemented a marginal structural model. RESULTS: OA patients had a higher risk of developing CVD than controls without OA. After adjusting for socioeconomic status, body mass index, hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and Romano comorbidity score, the adjusted hazard ratio (HR) was 1.23 (95% confidence interval [95% CI] 1.17-1.28). The adjusted HRs for congestive heart failure, ischemic heart disease, and stroke were 1.42 (95% CI 1.33-1.51), 1.17 (95% CI 1.10-1.26), and 1.14 (95% CI 1.07-1.22), respectively. Approximately 41% of the total effect of OA on increased CVD risk was mediated through NSAIDs. For the secondary outcomes, the proportion mediated through NSAIDs was 23%, 56%, and 64% for congestive heart failure, ischemic heart disease, and stroke, respectively. CONCLUSION: The findings of this first study to evaluate the mediating role of NSAIDs in the relationship between OA and CVD suggest that NSAID use contributes substantially to the OA-CVD association.

        "Chronic gamma radiation resistance in fungi correlates with resistance to chromium and elevated temperatures, but not with resistance to acute irradiation. Exposure to chronic ionizing radiation (CIR) from nuclear power plant accidents, acts of terrorism, and space exploration poses serious threats to humans. Fungi are a group of highly radiation-resistant eukaryotes, and an understanding of fungal CIR resistance mechanisms holds the prospect of protecting humans. We compared the abilities of 95 wild-type yeast and dimorphic fungal isolates, representing diverse Ascomycota and Basidiomycota, to resist exposure to five environmentally-relevant stressors: CIR (long-duration growth under 36\u2009Gy/h) and acute (10 kGy/h) ionizing radiation (IR), heavy metals (chromium, mercury), elevated temperature (up to 50\u2009\u00b0C), and low pH (2.3). To quantify associations between resistances to CIR and these other stressors, we used correlation analysis, logistic regression with multi-model inference, and customized machine learning. The results suggest that resistance to acute IR in fungi is not strongly correlated with the ability of a given fungal isolate to grow under CIR. Instead, the strongest predictors of CIR resistance in fungi were resistance to chromium (III) and to elevated temperature. These results suggest fundamental differences between the mechanisms of resistance to chronic and acute radiation. Convergent evolution towards radioresistance among genetically distinct groups of organisms is considered here. ",
        "Personalized circulating tumor DNA analysis to detect residual disease after neoadjuvant therapy in breast cancer. Longitudinal analysis of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) has shown promise for monitoring treatment response. However, most current methods lack adequate sensitivity for residual disease detection during or after completion of treatment in patients with nonmetastatic cancer. To address this gap and to improve sensitivity for minute quantities of residual tumor DNA in plasma, we have developed targeted digital sequencing (TARDIS) for multiplexed analysis of patient-specific cancer mutations. In reference samples, by simultaneously analyzing 8 to 16 known mutations, TARDIS achieved 91 and 53% sensitivity at mutant allele fractions (AFs) of 3 in 104 and 3 in 105, respectively, with 96% specificity, using input DNA equivalent to a single tube of blood. We successfully analyzed up to 115 mutations per patient in 80 plasma samples from 33 women with stage I to III breast cancer. Before treatment, TARDIS detected ctDNA in all patients with 0.11% median AF. After completion of neoadjuvant therapy, ctDNA concentrations were lower in patients who achieved pathological complete response (pathCR) compared to patients with residual disease (median AFs, 0.003 and 0.017%, respectively, P = 0.0057, AUC = 0.83). In addition, patients with pathCR showed a larger decrease in ctDNA concentrations during neoadjuvant therapy. These results demonstrate high accuracy for assessment of molecular response and residual disease during neoadjuvant therapy using ctDNA analysis. TARDIS has achieved up to 100-fold improvement beyond the current limit of ctDNA detection using clinically relevant blood volumes, demonstrating that personalized ctDNA tracking could enable individualized clinical management of patients with cancer treated with curative intent.

        "Stress-induced cortical dopamine response is altered in subjects at clinical high risk for psychosis using cannabis. Stress and cannabis use are risk factors for the development of psychosis. We have previously shown that subjects at clinical high risk for psychosis (CHR) exhibit a higher striatal dopamine response to stress compared with healthy volunteers (HV), with chronic cannabis use blunting this response. However, it is unknown if this abnormal dopamine response extends to the prefrontal cortex (PFC). Here, we investigated dorsolateral PFC (dlPFC) and medial PFC (mPFC) dopamine release using [11 C]FLB457 positron emission tomography (PET) and a validated stress task. Thirty-three participants completed two PET scans (14 CHR without cannabis use, eight CHR regular cannabis users [CHR-CUs] and 11 HV) while performing a Sensory Motor Control Task (control scan) and the Montreal Imaging Stress Task (stress scan). Stress-induced dopamine release (\u0394BPND ) was defined as percent change in D2/3 receptor binding potential between both scans using a novel correction for injected mass of [11 C]FLB457. \u0394BPND was significantly different between groups in mPFC (F(2,30) = 5.40, .010), with CHR-CUs exhibiting lower \u0394BPND compared with CHR (.008). Similarly, salivary cortisol response (\u0394AUCI ) was significantly lower in CHR-CU compared with CHR (F(2,29) = 5.08, .013; post hoc .018) and positively associated with \u0394BPND . Furthermore, CHR-CUs had higher attenuated psychotic symptoms than CHR following the stress task, which were negatively associated with \u0394BPND . Length of cannabis use was negatively associated with \u0394BPND in mPFC when controlling for current cannabis use. Given the global trend to legalize cannabis, this study is important as it highlights the effects of regular cannabis use on cortical dopamine function in high-risk youth. ",
        "Nordic walking for women with breast cancer: A systematic review. Nordic walking (NW) seems to be an interesting rehabilitation strategy for women with breast cancer (BC). No review article that has synthesised and summarised the existing scientific evidence about the effect of NW on BC survivors has been published so far. A systematic review was conducted aimed at identifying the characteristics and methodological quality of the studies that have analysed the effects of NW on women with BC. The critical appraisal of the randomised controlled trials (RCTs) was retrieved from the Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro). The methodological quality of the uncontrolled studies was evaluated by means of the Quality Assessment Tool for Before-After Studies with No Control Group. Nine investigations (four RCTs and five quasi-experimental studies) were included in the final analysis. The RCTs showed a fair methodological quality, while the quasi-experimental studies obtained a score ranging from \"fair\" to \"poor\". Judging from the findings of the analysed studies, NW had a significant and positive impact on a number of BC symptoms, including lymphedema, physical fitness, disability and morbid perceptions. No adverse effects were reported. However, due to the methodological limitations observed, further research is needed to confirm such findings. ",
        "The Association of Optimism with Sleep Duration and Quality: Findings from the Coronary Artery Risk and Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) Study. Optimism is associated with better health outcomes with hypothesized effects due in part to optimism's association with restorative health processes. Limited work has examined whether optimism is associated with better quality sleep, a major restorative process. We test the hypothesis that greater optimism is associated with more favorable sleep quality and duration. Main analyses included adults aged 32-51 who participated in the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study (n\u2009=\u20093,548) during the fifth (Year 15: 2000-2001) and sixth (Year 20: 2005-2006) follow-up visits. Optimism was assessed using the revised Life-Orientation Test. Self-report measures of sleep quality and duration were obtained twice 5\u2009years apart. A subset of CARDIA participants (2003-2005) additionally provided actigraphic data and completed the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS). Multivariate regression analyses were used to examine associations of optimism and sleep indicators. In cross-sectional analyses of 3548 participants, each standard deviation (SD) higher optimism score resulted in 78% higher odds of self-reporting very good sleep quality. Prospectively, a 1-SD higher optimism score was related to higher odds of reporting persistently good sleep quality across 5-years relative to those with persistently poor sleep [OR = 1.31; 95%CI:1.10,1.56]. In participant with supplementary data, each SD higher optimism score was marginally associated with 22% greater odds of favorable sleep quality [OR = 1.22; 95%CI:1.00,1.49] as measured by the PSQI, with possible mediation by depressive symptoms. Optimism was unrelated to objective actigraphic sleep data. Findings support a positive cross-sectional and prospective association between optimism and self-reported sleep behavior. ",
        "Machine Learning Approaches to Predict 6-Month Mortality Among Patients With Cancer. Importance: Machine learning algorithms could identify patients with cancer who are at risk of short-term mortality. However, it is unclear how different machine learning algorithms compare and whether they could prompt clinicians to have timely conversations about treatment and end-of-life preferences. Objectives: To develop, validate, and compare machine learning algorithms that use structured electronic health record data before a clinic visit to predict mortality among patients with cancer. Design, Setting, and Participants: Cohort study of 26\u202f525 adult patients who had outpatient oncology or hematology/oncology encounters at a large academic cancer center and 10 affiliated community practices between February 1, 2016, and July 1, 2016. Patients were not required to receive cancer-directed treatment. Patients were observed for up to 500 days after the encounter. Data analysis took place between October 1, 2018, and September 1, 2019. Exposures: Logistic regression, gradient boosting, and random forest algorithms. Main Outcomes and Measures: Primary outcome was 180-day mortality from the index encounter; secondary outcome was 500-day mortality from the index encounter. Results: Among 26\u202f525 patients in the analysis, 1065 (4.0%) died within 180 days of the index encounter. Among those who died, the mean age was 67.3 (95% CI, 66.5-68.0) years, and 500 (47.0%) were women. Among those who were alive at 180 days, the mean age was 61.3 (95% CI, 61.1-61.5) years, and 15\u202f922 (62.5%) were women. The population was randomly partitioned into training (18\u202f567 [70.0%]) and validation (7958 [30.0%]) cohorts at the patient level, and a randomly selected encounter was included in either the training or validation set. At a prespecified alert rate of 0.02, positive predictive values were higher for the random forest (51.3%) and gradient boosting (49.4%) algorithms compared with the logistic regression algorithm (44.7%). There was no significant difference in discrimination among the random forest (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC], 0.88; 95% CI, 0.86-0.89), gradient boosting (AUC, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.85-0.89), and logistic regression (AUC, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.84-0.88) models (P for comparison\u2009=\u2009.02). In the random forest model, observed 180-day mortality was 51.3% (95% CI, 43.6%-58.8%) in the high-risk group vs 3.4% (95% CI, 3.0%-3.8%) in the low-risk group; at 500 days, observed mortality was 64.4% (95% CI, 56.7%-71.4%) in the high-risk group and 7.6% (7.0%-8.2%) in the low-risk group. In a survey of 15 oncology clinicians with a 52.1% response rate, 100 of 171 patients (58.8%) who had been flagged as having high risk by the gradient boosting algorithm were deemed appropriate for a conversation about treatment and end-of-life preferences in the upcoming week. Conclusions and Relevance: In this cohort study, machine learning algorithms based on structured electronic health record data accurately identified patients with cancer at risk of short-term mortality. When the gradient boosting algorithm was applied in real time, clinicians believed that most patients who had been identified as having high risk were appropriate for a timely conversation about treatment and end-of-life preferences.

        "Urinary pro-thrombotic, anti-thrombotic, and fibrinolytic molecules as biomarkers of lupus nephritis. OBJECTIVE: This study evaluates the utility of urinary pro-thrombotic molecules such as tissue factor (TF), anti-thrombotic molecules such as tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI), and fibrinolytic molecules such as plasmin and d-dimer as biomarkers of lupus nephritis (LN). METHODS: Urine samples from 113 biopsy-proven LN patients (89 active LN and 24 inactive LN), 45 chronic kidney disease patients, and 41 healthy controls were examined for d-dimer, plasmin, TF, and TFPI levels by ELISA. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) analysis, multivariate regression analysis, and Bayesian network analysis were performed to assess the diagnostic value of the assayed molecules in LN. RESULTS: Although urinary d-dimer, plasmin, TF, and TFPI were all elevated in active LN compared to all control groups, and correlated with rSLEDAI and SLICC RAS disease activity indices, urine plasmin emerged as the strongest independent predictor of eGFR and renal disease status, by multivariate regression analysis and Bayesian network analysis. Whereas urine plasmin discriminated active LN from inactive disease with an AUC of 0.84, the combination of urine plasmin and TFPI discriminated ALN from ILN with an AUC of 0.86, with both surpassing the specificity and positive predictive value of traditional markers such as anti-dsDNA and complement C3. CONCLUSION: Both thrombogenic and thrombolytic cascades appear to be upregulated in lupus nephritis, with proteins from both cascades appearing in the urine. Of the coagulation cascade proteins surveyed, urine plasmin emerges as the strongest predictor of eGFR and clinical renal disease in patients with LN. ",
        "ADF/Cofilin-Mediated Actin Turnover Promotes Axon Regeneration in the Adult CNS. Injured axons fail to regenerate in the adult CNS, which contrasts with their vigorous growth during embryonic development. We explored the potential of re-initiating axon extension after injury by reactivating the molecular mechanisms that drive morphogenetic transformation of neurons during development. Genetic loss- and gain-of-function experiments followed by time-lapse microscopy, in\u00a0vivo imaging, and whole-mount analysis show that axon regeneration is fueled by elevated actin turnover. Actin depolymerizing factor (ADF)/cofilin controls actin turnover to sustain axon regeneration after spinal cord injury through its actin-severing activity. This pinpoints ADF/cofilin as a key regulator of axon growth competence, irrespective of developmental stage. These findings reveal the central role of actin dynamics regulation in this process and elucidate a core mechanism underlying axon growth after CNS trauma. Thereby, neurons maintain the capacity to stimulate developmental programs during adult life, expanding their potential for plasticity. Thus, actin turnover is a key process for future regenerative interventions. ",
        "Emergence of Oxacillin Resistance in Stealth Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus Due to mecA Sequence Instability. Staphylococcus aureus strains that possess a mecA gene but are phenotypically susceptible to oxacillin and cefoxitin (OS-MRSA) have been recognized for over a decade and are a challenge for diagnostic laboratories. The mechanisms underlying the discrepancy vary from isolate to isolate. We characterized seven OS-MRSA clinical isolates of six different spa types from six different states by whole-genome sequencing to identify the nucleotide sequence changes leading to the OS-MRSA phenotype. The results demonstrated that oxacillin susceptibility was associated with mutations in regions of nucleotide repeats within mecA Subinhibitory antibiotic exposure selected for secondary mecA mutations that restored oxacillin resistance. Thus, strains of S. aureus that contain mecA but are phenotypically susceptible can become resistant after antibiotic exposure, which may result in treatment failure.

Nanosecond pulsed electric fields (nsPEFs) have gained attention as a novel physical stimulus for life sciences. Although cancer therapy is currently their promising application, nsPEFs have further potential owing to their ability to elicit various cellular responses. This study aimed to explore stimulatory actions of nsPEFs, and we used HL-60 cells that were differentiated into neutrophils under cultured conditions. Exposure of neutrophil-differentiated HL-60 cells to nsPEFs led to the extracellular release of chromosomal DNA, which appears to be equivalent to neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) that serve as a host defense mechanism against pathogens. Fluorometric measurement of extracellular DNA showed that DNA extrusion was rapidly induced after nsPEF exposure and increased over time. Western blot analysis demonstrated that nsPEFs induced histone citrullination that is the hydrolytic conversion of arginine to citrulline on histones and facilitates chromatin decondensation. DNA extrusion and histone citrullination by nsPEFs were cell type-specific and Ca2+-dependent events. Taken together, these observations suggest that nsPEFs drive the mechanism for neutrophil-specific immune response without infection, highlighting a novel aspect of nsPEFs as a physical stimulus. ",
        "Relationship between 25-Hydroxyvitamin D, bone density, and Parkinson's disease symptoms. OBJECTIVES: Vitamin D deficiency is widespread in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). Our aim was to determine whether serum vitamin D levels correlated with bone mineral density (BMD) and non-motor symptoms in patients with PD. MATERIALS & METHODS: A consecutive series of 182 patients with PD and 185 healthy controls were included. Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) levels were measured by immunoassay, while BMD of the lumbar spine and femoral neck was measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Associations between serum vitamin D levels and clinical data were evaluated using partial correlation analysis. RESULTS: Patients with PD had significantly lower serum 25(OH)D levels relative to healthy controls (49.75\u00a0\u00b1\u00a014.11 vs 43.40\u00a0\u00b1\u00a016.51, P\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Furthermore, PD patients with lower vitamin D levels had a significantly higher frequency of falls (P\u00a0=\u00a00.033) and insomnia (P\u00a0=\u00a00.015). They also had significantly higher scores for the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI; P\u00a0=\u00a00.014), depression (P\u00a0=\u00a00.020), and anxiety (P\u00a0=\u00a00.009). Finally, patients with PD also had a significantly lower mean BMD of the lumbar spine (P\u00a0=\u00a00.011) and femoral neck (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001). After adjusting for age, sex, and body mass index, vitamin D levels significantly correlated with falls, insomnia, and scores for the PSQI, depression, and anxiety. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with PD, vitamin D levels significantly correlated with falls and some non-motor symptoms. However, no associations were found between BMD and the serum 25(OH)D levels in patients with PD. Thus, vitamin D supplementation is a potential therapeutic for non-motor PD symptoms. ",
        "Colorectal cancer patients under the age of 50 experience delays in primary care leading to emergency diagnoses: a population-based study. AIM: The incidence of colorectal cancer in the under 50s is increasing. In this national population-based study we aim to show that missed opportunities for diagnosis in primary care are leading to referral delays and emergency diagnoses in young patients. METHOD: We compared the interval before diagnosis, presenting symptom(s) and the odds ratio (OR) of an emergency diagnosis for those under the age of 50 with older patients sourced from the cancer registry with linkage to a national database of primary-care records. RESULTS: The study included 7315 patients, of whom 508 (6.9%) were aged under 50 years, 1168 (16.0%) were aged 50-59, 2294 (31.4%) were aged 60-69 and 3345 (45.7%) were aged 70-79\u00a0years. Young patients were more likely to present with abdominal pain and via an emergency, and had the lowest percentage of early stage cancer. They experienced a longer interval between referral and diagnosis (12.5\u00a0days) than those aged 60-69, reflecting the higher proportion of referrals via the nonurgent pathway (33.3%). The OR of an emergency diagnosis did not differ with age if a red-flag symptom was noted at presentation, but increased significantly for young patients if the symptom was nonspecific. CONCLUSION: Young patients present to primary care with symptoms outside the national referral guidelines, increasing the likelihood of an emergency diagnosis. ",
        "Electromagnetic fields alter the motility of metastatic breast cancer cells. Interactions between cells and their environment influence key physiologic processes such as their propensity to migrate. However, directed migration controlled by extrinsically applied electrical signals is poorly understood. Using a novel microfluidic platform, we found that metastatic breast cancer cells sense and respond to the net direction of weak (\u223c100\u2009\u00b5V\u2009cm-1), asymmetric, non-contact induced Electric Fields (iEFs). iEFs inhibited EGFR (Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor) activation, prevented formation of actin-rich filopodia, and hindered the motility of EGF-treated breast cancer cells. The directional effects of iEFs were nullified by inhibition of Akt phosphorylation. Moreover, iEFs in combination with Akt inhibitor reduced EGF-promoted motility below the level of untreated controls. These results represent a step towards isolating the coupling mechanism between cell motility and iEFs, provide valuable insights into how iEFs target multiple diverging cancer cell signaling mechanisms, and demonstrate that electrical signals are a fundamental regulator of cancer cell migration.

        "The FDA-Approved Oral Drug Nitazoxanide Amplifies Host Antiviral Responses and Inhibits Ebola Virus. Here, we show that the US Food and Drug Administration-approved oral drug nitazoxanide (NTZ) broadly amplifies the host innate immune response to viruses and inhibits Ebola virus (EBOV) replication. We find that NTZ enhances retinoic-acid-inducible protein I (RIG-I)-like-receptor, mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein, interferon regulatory factor 3, and interferon activities and induces transcription of the antiviral phosphatase GADD34. NTZ significantly inhibits EBOV replication in human cells through its effects on RIG-I and protein kinase R (PKR), suggesting that it counteracts EBOV VP35 protein's ability to block RIG-I and PKR sensing of EBOV. NTZ also inhibits a second negative-strand RNA virus, vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), through RIG-I and GADD34, but not PKR, consistent with VSV's distinct host innate immune evasion mechanisms. Thus, NTZ counteracts varied virus-specific immune evasion strategies by generally enhancing the RNA sensing and interferon axis that is triggered by foreign cytoplasmic RNA exposure, and holds promise as an oral therapy against EBOV.

        "Seroprevalence, Risk Factors, and Rodent Reservoirs of Leptospirosis in an Urban Community of Puerto Rico, 2015. BACKGROUND: The burden of leptospirosis in Puerto Rico remains unclear due to underreporting. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey and rodent trapping was performed in a community within San Juan, Puerto Rico to determine the seroprevalence and risk factors for Leptospira infection. The microscopic agglutination test was used to detect anti-Leptospira antibodies as a marker of previous infection. We evaluated Leptospira carriage by quantitative polymerase chain reaction among rodents trapped at the community site. RESULTS: Of 202 study participants, 55 (27.2%) had Leptospira agglutinating antibodies. Among the 55 seropositive individuals, antibodies were directed most frequently against serogroups Icterohaemorrhagiae (22.0%) and Autumnalis (10.6%). Of 18 captured rodents, 11 (61.1%) carried pathogenic Leptospira (Leptospira borgpetersenii, 7 and Leptospira interrogans, 2). Four participants showed their highest titer against an isolate obtained from a rodent (serogroup Ballum). Increasing household distance to the canal that runs through the community was associated with decreased risk of infection (odds ratio = 0.934 per 10-meter increase; 95% confidence interval, .952-.992). CONCLUSIONS: There are high levels of Leptospira exposure in an urban setting in Puerto Rico, for which rodents may be an important reservoir for transmission. Our findings indicate that prevention should focus on mitigating risk posed by infrastructure deficiencies such as the canal. ",
        "The Lung Mucosa Environment in the Elderly Increases Host Susceptibility to Mycobacterium tuberculosis Infection. As we age, there is an increased risk for the development of tuberculosis (TB) caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection. Few studies consider that age-associated changes in the alveolar lining fluid (ALF) may increase susceptibility by altering soluble mediators of innate immunity. We assessed the impact of adult or elderly human ALF during Mtb infection in vitro and in vivo. We identified amplification of pro-oxidative and proinflammatory pathways in elderly ALF and decreased binding capability of surfactant-associated surfactant protein A (SP-A) and surfactant protein D (SP-D) to Mtb. Human macrophages infected with elderly ALF-exposed Mtb had reduced control and fewer phagosome-lysosome fusion events, which was reversed when elderly ALF was replenished with functional SP-A/SP-D. In vivo, exposure to elderly ALF exacerbated Mtb infection in young mice. Our studies demonstrate how the pulmonary environment changes as we age and suggest that Mtb may benefit from declining host defenses in the lung mucosa of the elderly. ",
        "Improved efficacy of naproxen-loaded NLC for temporomandibular joint administration. Inflammatory conditions of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) and peripheral tissues affect many people around the world and are commonly treated with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). However, in order to get desirable results, treatments with NSAIDs may take weeks, causing undesirable side effects and requiring repeated administration. In this sense, this work describes the development of an optimized nanostructured lipid carrier (NLC) formulation for intra-articular administration of naproxen (NPX). An experimental design (23) selected the best formulation in terms of its physicochemical and structural properties, elucidated by different methods (DLS, NTA, TEM, DSC, and ATR-FTIR). The chosen formulation (NLC-NPX) was tested on acute inflammatory TMJ nociception, in a rat model. The optimized excipients composition provided higher NPX encapsulation efficiency (99.8%) and the nanoparticles were found stable during 1 year of storage at 25\u2009\u00b0C. In vivo results demonstrated that the sustained delivery of NPX directly in the TMJ significantly reduced leukocytes migration and levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1), for more than a week. These results point out the NLC-NPX formulation as a promising candidate for the safe treatment of inflammatory pain conditions of TMJ or other joints. ",
        "The Effects of Intuitive Movement Reembodiment on the Quality of Life of Older Adults With Dementia: A Pilot Study. BACKGROUND: The creative use of reminiscent music and natural movements were reported to have positive effects on the well-being of older adults with cognitive impairment. OBJECTIVES: To explore the effects of the intuitive movement reembodiment (IMR) program on the quality of life (QoL) of older adults with dementia. METHODS: Data collected from 22 participants were analyzed: group 1 (mild dementia), group 2 (moderate dementia), group 3 (advanced dementia). All study groups participated in 10 weekly sessions. Self-reported QoL ratings were gathered through using the World Health Organisation (WHO)-5 questionnaire, alongside qualitative evidence recorded through onsite observation. RESULTS: Statistically significant improvement in QoL was demonstrated after session 6. The qualitative analysis showed that the IMR sessions provided a sense of humor, imagination, and intuition that motivated the participants to dance and interact with joy. CONCLUSION: These preliminary positive findings need to be replicated in a larger randomized controlled trial. ",
        "Ensilication Improves the Thermal Stability of the Tuberculosis Antigen Ag85b and an Sbi-Ag85b Vaccine Conjugate. There is an urgent need for the development of vaccine thermostabilisation methodologies as the maintenance of a continuous and reliable cold chain remains a major hurdle to the global distribution of safe and effective vaccines. Ensilication, a method that encases proteins in a resistant silica cage has been shown to physically prevent the thermal denaturation of a number of model proteins. In this study we investigate the utility of this promising approach in improving the thermal stability of antigens and vaccine conjugates highly relevant to the development of candidate tuberculosis vaccines, including antigen 85b conjugated with the Staphylococcus aureus-protein based adjuvant Sbi. Here we analyse the sensitivity of these constructs to thermal denaturation and demonstrate for the first time the benefits of ensilication in conferring these vaccine-relevant proteins with protection against temperature-induced loss of structure and function without the need for refrigeration. Our results reveal the potential of ensilication in facilitating the storage and transport of vaccines at ambient temperatures in the future and therefore in delivering life-saving vaccines globally, and in particular to remote areas of developing countries where disease rates are often highest.

        "Early Detection of Peripheral Blood Cell Signature in Children Developing \u03b2-Cell Autoimmunity at a Young Age. The appearance of type 1 diabetes (T1D)-associated autoantibodies is the first and only measurable parameter to predict progression toward T1D in genetically susceptible individuals. However, autoantibodies indicate an active autoimmune reaction, wherein the immune tolerance is already broken. Therefore, there is a clear and urgent need for new biomarkers that predict the onset of the autoimmune reaction preceding autoantibody positivity or reflect progressive \u03b2-cell destruction. Here we report the mRNA sequencing-based analysis of 306 samples including fractionated samples of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells as well as CD4-CD8- cell fractions and unfractionated peripheral blood mononuclear cell samples longitudinally collected from seven children who developed \u03b2-cell autoimmunity (case subjects) at a young age and matched control subjects. We identified transcripts, including interleukin 32 (IL32), that were upregulated before T1D-associated autoantibodies appeared. Single-cell RNA sequencing studies revealed that high IL32 in case samples was contributed mainly by activated T cells and NK cells. Further, we showed that IL32 expression can be induced by a virus and cytokines in pancreatic islets and \u03b2-cells, respectively. The results provide a basis for early detection of aberrations in the immune system function before T1D and suggest a potential role for IL32 in the pathogenesis of T1D. ",
        "Intense Light-Mediated Circadian Cardioprotection via Transcriptional Reprogramming of the Endothelium. Consistent daylight oscillations and abundant oxygen availability are fundamental to human health. Here, we investigate the intersection between light-sensing (Period 2 [PER2]) and oxygen-sensing (hypoxia-inducible factor [HIF1A]) pathways in cellular adaptation to\u00a0myocardial ischemia. We demonstrate that intense light is cardioprotective via circadian PER2 amplitude enhancement, mimicking hypoxia-elicited adenosine-\u00a0and HIF1A-metabolic adaptation to myocardial ischemia under normoxic conditions. Whole-genome array from intense light-exposed wild-type or Per2-/- mice and myocardial ischemia in endothelial-specific PER2-deficient mice uncover a critical role for intense light in maintaining endothelial barrier function via light-enhanced HIF1A transcription. A proteomics screen in human endothelia reveals a dominant role for PER2 in metabolic reprogramming to hypoxia via mitochondrial translocation, tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle enzyme activity regulation, and HIF1A transcriptional adaption to hypoxia. Translational investigation of intense light in human subjects identifies similar PER2 mechanisms, implicating the use of intense light for the treatment of cardiovascular disease. ",
        "New Concerns for Neurocognitive Function during Deep Space Exposures to Chronic, Low Dose-Rate, Neutron Radiation. As NASA prepares for a mission to Mars, concerns regarding the health risks associated with deep space radiation exposure have emerged. Until now, the impacts of such exposures have only been studied in animals after acute exposures, using dose rates \u223c1.5\u00d7105 higher than those actually encountered in space. Using a new, low dose-rate neutron irradiation facility, we have uncovered that realistic, low dose-rate exposures produce serious neurocognitive complications associated with impaired neurotransmission. Chronic (6 month) low-dose (18 cGy) and dose rate (1 mGy/d) exposures of mice to a mixed field of neutrons and photons result in diminished hippocampal neuronal excitability and disrupted hippocampal and cortical long-term potentiation. Furthermore, mice displayed severe impairments in learning and memory, and the emergence of distress behaviors. Behavioral analyses showed an alarming increase in risk associated with these realistic simulations, revealing for the first time, some unexpected potential problems associated with deep space travel on all levels of neurological function.

        "Dysregulated claudin-5 cycling in the inner retina causes retinal pigment epithelial cell atrophy. Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of central retinal vision loss worldwide, with an estimated 1 in 10 people over the age of 55 showing early signs of the condition. There are currently no forms of therapy available for the end stage of dry AMD, geographic atrophy (GA). Here, we show that the inner blood-retina barrier (iBRB) is highly dynamic and may play a contributory role in GA development. We have discovered that the gene CLDN5, which encodes claudin-5, a tight junction protein abundantly expressed at the iBRB, is regulated by BMAL1 and the circadian clock. Persistent suppression of claudin-5 expression in mice exposed to a cholesterol-enriched diet induced striking retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cell atrophy, and persistent targeted suppression of claudin-5 in the macular region of nonhuman primates induced RPE cell atrophy. Moreover, fundus fluorescein angiography in human and nonhuman primate subjects showed increased retinal vascular permeability in the evening compared with the morning. These findings implicate an inner retina-derived component in the early pathophysiological changes observed in AMD, and we suggest that restoring the integrity of the iBRB may represent a novel therapeutic target for the prevention and treatment of GA secondary to dry AMD.

        "Intranasal micro-optical coherence tomography imaging for cystic fibrosis studies. Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disease caused by mutations in the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene. Although impairment of mucociliary clearance contributes to severe morbidity and mortality in people with CF, a clear understanding of the pathophysiology is lacking. This is, in part, due to the absence of clinical imaging techniques capable of capturing CFTR-dependent functional metrics at the cellular level. Here, we report the clinical translation of a 1-\u03bcm resolution micro-optical coherence tomography (\u03bcOCT) technology to quantitatively characterize the functional microanatomy of human upper airways. Using a minimally invasive intranasal imaging approach, we performed a clinical study on age- and sex-matched CF and control groups. We observed delayed mucociliary transport rate at the cellular level, depletion of periciliary liquid layer, and prevalent loss of ciliation in subjects with CF. Distinctive morphological differences in mucus and various forms of epithelial injury were also revealed by \u03bcOCT imaging and had prominent effects on the mucociliary transport apparatus. Elevated mucus reflectance intensity in CF, a proxy for viscosity in situ, had a dominant effect. These results demonstrate the utility of \u03bcOCT to determine epithelial function and monitor disease status of CF airways on a per-patient basis, with applicability for other diseases of mucus clearance.

        "Dissolution of a fibrous peptide by terahertz free electron laser. Fibrous peptides such as amyloid fibrils have various roles in biological system, e.g., as causal factor of serious amyloidosis in human and as functional regulator of cell formation in bacteria and eukaryotes. In addition, the fiber-type format is promising as biocompatible scaffold. Therefore, the dissolution method of peptide fibril is potentially useful at many scenes in medical and material fields: as reductive way of pathogenic amyloid, as modification technique of cell structure, and as fabrication tool of biomaterials. However, the fibril structure is generally difficult to be dissociated due to its rigid stacked conformation. Here, we propose a physical engineering technology using terahertz free electron laser (FEL) at far-infrared wavelengths from 70 to 80\u2009\u03bcm. Infrared microscopy analysis of the irradiated fibril of calcitonin peptide as a model showed that \u03b2-sheet was decreased, and \u03b1-helix, turn, and others were increased, compared to those of the fibril before the FEL irradiation. Interestingly, the dissociative effect by the far-infrared laser was remarkable than that by the mid-infrared laser tuned to 6.1\u2009\u03bcm that corresponds to amide I. In addition, simple heating at 363\u2009K deformed the fibril state but increased the amount of \u03b2-sheet, which was contrast with the action by the FEL, and scanning-electron microscopy and Congo-red staining revealed that the fibril was collapsed power-dependently within a range from 25 to 900\u2009mJ energies supplied with the FEL at 74\u2009\u03bcm. It can be considered that irradiation of intense terahertz wave can dissociate fibrous conformation of peptide with little influence of thermal effect. ",
        "Right Structural and Functional Reorganization in Four-Year-Old Children with Perinatal Arterial Ischemic Stroke Predict Language Production. Brain imaging methods have contributed to shed light on the mechanisms of recovery after early brain insult. The assumption that the unaffected right hemisphere can take over language functions after left perinatal stroke is still under debate. Here, we report how patterns of brain structural and functional reorganization were associated with language outcomes in a group of four-year-old children with left perinatal arterial ischemic stroke (PAIS). Specifically, we gathered specific fine-grained developmental measures of receptive and productive aspects of language as well as standardized measures of cognitive development. We also collected structural neuroimaging data as well as functional activations during a passive listening story-telling fMRI task and a resting state session (rs-fMRI). Children with a left perinatal stroke showed larger lateralization indices of both structural and functional connectivity of the dorsal language pathway towards the right hemisphere that, in turn, were associated with better language outcomes. Importantly, the pattern of structural asymmetry was significantly more right-lateralized in children with a left perinatal brain insult than in a group of matched healthy controls. These results strongly suggest that early lesions of the left dorsal pathway and the associated perisylvian regions can induce the interhemispheric transfer of language functions to right homolog regions. This study provides combined evidence of structural and functional brain reorganization of language networks after early stroke with strong implications for neurobiological models of language development.

        "Hsp70 and Hsp40 inhibit an inter-domain interaction necessary for transcriptional activity in the androgen receptor. Molecular chaperones such as Hsp40 and Hsp70 hold the androgen receptor (AR) in an inactive conformation. They are released in the presence of androgens, enabling transactivation and causing the receptor to become aggregation-prone. Here we show that these molecular chaperones recognize a region of the AR N-terminal domain (NTD), including a FQNLF motif, that interacts with the AR ligand-binding domain (LBD) upon activation. This suggests that competition between molecular chaperones and the LBD for the FQNLF motif regulates AR activation. We also show that, while the free NTD oligomerizes, binding to Hsp70 increases its solubility. Stabilizing the NTD-Hsp70 interaction with small molecules reduces AR aggregation and promotes its degradation in cellular and mouse models of the neuromuscular disorder spinal bulbar muscular atrophy. These results help resolve the mechanisms by which molecular chaperones regulate the balance between AR aggregation, activation and quality control. ",
        "A Comparison of Emergency Preparedness Between High School Coaches and Club Sport Coaches. CONTEXT: Recent studies suggested that a large population of high school-aged athletes participate on club sport teams. Despite attempts to document emergency preparedness in high school athletics, the adherence to emergency and medical coverage standards among club sport teams is unknown. OBJECTIVE: To determine if differences in emergency preparedness and training existed between coaches of high school teams and coaches of high school-aged club teams. DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey. SETTING: Online questionnaire. PATIENTS OR OTHER PARTICIPANTS: A total of 769 coaches (females = 266, 34.6%) completed an anonymous online questionnaire regarding their emergency preparedness and training. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): The questionnaire consisted of (1) demographics and team information, (2) emergency preparedness factors (automated external defibrillator [AED] availability, emergency action plan [EAP] awareness, medical coverage), and (3) emergency training requirements (cardiopulmonary resuscitation/AED, first aid). RESULTS: High school coaches were more likely than club sport coaches to be aware of the EAP for their practice venue (83.9% versus 54.4%, P < .001), but most coaches in both categories had not practiced their EAP in the past 12 months (70.0% versus 68.9%, P = .54). High school coaches were more likely to be made aware of the EAP during competitions (47.5% versus 37.1%, P = .02), but the majority of coaches in both categories indicated that they were never made aware of EAPs. High school coaches were more likely than club coaches to (1) have an AED available at practice (87.9% versus 58.8%, P < .001), (2) report that athletic trainers were responsible for medical care at practices (31.2% versus 8.8%, P < .001) and competitions (57.9% versus 31.2%, P < .001), and (3) be required to have cardiopulmonary resuscitation, AED, or first-aid training (P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: High school coaches displayed much greater levels of emergency preparedness and training than coaches of high school-aged club teams. Significant attention and effort may be needed to address the lack of emergency preparedness and training observed in club coaches. ",
        "Cigarette Smoke Induces Metabolic Reprogramming of the Tumor Stroma in Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma. Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is comprised of metabolically linked distinct compartments. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAF) and nonproliferative carcinoma cells display a glycolytic metabolism, while proliferative carcinoma cells rely on mitochondrial oxidative metabolism fueled by the catabolites provided by the adjacent CAFs. Metabolic coupling between these reprogrammed compartments contributes to HNSCC aggressiveness. In this study, we examined the effects of cigarette smoke-exposed CAFs on metabolic coupling and tumor aggressiveness of HNSCC. Cigarette smoke (CS) extract was generated by dissolving cigarette smoke in growth media. Fibroblasts were cultured in CS or control media. HNSCC cells were cocultured in vitro and coinjected in vivo with CS or control fibroblasts. We found that CS induced oxidative stress, glycolytic flux and MCT4 expression, and senescence in fibroblasts. MCT4 upregulation was critical for fibroblast viability under CS conditions. The effects of CS on fibroblasts were abrogated by antioxidant treatment. Coculture of carcinoma cells with CS fibroblasts induced metabolic coupling with upregulation of the marker of glycolysis MCT4 in fibroblasts and markers of mitochondrial metabolism MCT1 and TOMM20 in carcinoma cells. CS fibroblasts increased CCL2 expression and macrophage migration. Coculture with CS fibroblasts also increased two features of carcinoma cell aggressiveness: resistance to cell death and enhanced cell migration. Coinjection of carcinoma cells with CS fibroblasts generated larger tumors with reduced apoptosis than control coinjections, and upregulation of MCT4 by CS exposure was a driver of these effects. We demonstrate that a tumor microenvironment exposed to CS is sufficient to modulate metabolism and cancer aggressiveness in HNSCC. IMPLICATIONS: CS shifts cancer stroma toward glycolysis and induces head and neck cancer aggressiveness with a mitochondrial profile linked by catabolite transporters and oxidative stress.

        "MVPA Analysis of Intertrial Phase Coherence of Neuromagnetic Responses to Words Reliably Classifies Multiple Levels of Language Processing in the Brain. Neural processing of language is still among the most poorly understood functions of the human brain, whereas a need to objectively assess the neurocognitive status of the language function in a participant-friendly and noninvasive fashion arises in various situations. Here, we propose a solution for this based on a short task-free recording of MEG responses to a set of spoken linguistic contrasts. We used spoken stimuli that diverged lexically (words/pseudowords), semantically (action-related/abstract), or morphosyntactically (grammatically correct/ungrammatical). Based on beamformer source reconstruction we investigated intertrial phase coherence (ITPC) in five canonical bands (\u03b1, \u03b2, and low, medium, and high \u03b3) using multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA). Using this approach, we could successfully classify brain responses to meaningful words from meaningless pseudowords, correct from incorrect syntax, as well as semantic differences. The best classification results indicated distributed patterns of activity dominated by core temporofrontal language circuits and complemented by other areas. They varied between the different neurolinguistic properties across frequency bands, with lexical processes classified predominantly by broad \u03b3, semantic distinctions by \u03b1 and \u03b2, and syntax by low \u03b3 feature patterns. Crucially, all types of processing commenced in a near-parallel fashion from \u223c100 ms after the auditory information allowed for disambiguating the spoken input. This shows that individual neurolinguistic processes take place simultaneously and involve overlapping yet distinct neuronal networks that operate at different frequency bands. This brings further hope that brain imaging can be used to assess neurolinguistic processes objectively and noninvasively in a range of populations. ",
        "Eight-year trajectories of changes in health-related quality of life in knee osteoarthritis: Data from the Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI). BACKGROUND: Knee osteoarthritis (OA) worsens health-related quality of life (HRQoL) but the symptom pathway varies from person to person. We aimed to identify groups of people with knee OA or at its increased risk whose HRQoL changed similarly. Our secondary aim was to evaluate if patient-related characteristics, incidence of knee replacement (KR) and prevalence of pain medication use differed between the identified HRQoL trajectory groups. METHODS: Eight-year follow-up data of 3053 persons with mild knee OA or at increased risk were obtained from the public Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI) database. Group-based trajectory modeling was used to identify patterns of experiencing a decrease of \u226510 points (Minimal Important Change, MIC) in the Quality of Life subscale of the Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score compared to baseline. Multinomial logistic regression, Cox regression and generalized estimating equation models were used to study secondary aims. RESULTS: Four HRQoL trajectory groups were identified. Persons in the 'no change' group (62.9%) experienced no worsening in HRQoL. 'Rapidly' (9.5%) and 'slowly' worsening (17.1%) groups displayed an increasing probability of experiencing the MIC in HRQoL. The fourth group (10.4%) had 'improving' HRQoL. Female gender, higher body mass index, smoking, knee pain, and lower income at baseline were associated with belonging to the 'rapidly worsening' group. People in 'rapidly' (hazard ratio (HR) 6.2, 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.6-10.7) and 'slowly' worsening (HR 3.4, 95% CI 2.0-5.9) groups had an increased risk of requiring knee replacement. Pain medication was more rarely used in the 'no change' than in the other groups. CONCLUSIONS: HRQoL worsening was associated with several risk factors; surgical and pharmacological interventions were more common in the poorer HRQoL trajectory groups indicating that HRQoL does reflect the need for OA treatment. These findings may have implications for targeting interventions to specific knee OA patient groups. ",
        "Alcohol Use in Pregnancy and Miscarriage: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis. To systematically review and critically evaluate studies reporting alcohol exposure during pregnancy and miscarriage. We searched PubMed, EMBASE, PsycINFO, and ProQuest Theses for publications from January 1970 to January 2019. We identified studies about alcohol exposure during pregnancy and miscarriage. Information about study population, alcohol exposure assessment, outcome definition, covariates, and measures of association was collected. We assessed study quality using an adapted Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Data were abstracted by 2 investigators independently. We conducted a random-effects meta-analysis to calculate the association between alcohol exposure and miscarriage risk and performed subgroup analyses to determine robustness of results to study differences. For studies reporting dose-specific effects, a pooled dose-response association was estimated using generalized least squares regression with and without restricted cubic spline terms for number of drinks consumed per week. Of 2,164 articles identified, 24 were eligible for inclusion. Meta-analysis of data from 231,808 pregnant women finds those exposed to alcohol during pregnancy have a greater risk of miscarriage compared to those who abstained (odds ratio [OR] 1.19, 95% confidence intervals [CI] 1.12, 1.28). Estimates did not vary by study design, study country, or method of alcohol ascertainment. For alcohol use of 5 or fewer drinks per week, each additional drink per week was associated with a 6% increase in miscarriage risk (OR 1.06, 95% CI 1.01, 1.10). Common study limitations reflect challenges inherent to this research, including difficulty recruiting participants early enough in pregnancy to observe miscarriage and collecting and quantifying information about alcohol consumption during pregnancy that accurately reflects use. This review provides evidence that alcohol consumption during pregnancy is associated with a dose-mediated increase in miscarriage risk. Future studies evaluating change in alcohol use in pregnancy are needed to provide insight into how alcohol consumption prior to pregnancy recognition impacts risk. ",
        "An ImmunoPEGliposome for Targeted Antimalarial Combination Therapy at the Nanoscale. Combination therapies, where two drugs acting through different mechanisms are administered simultaneously, are one of the most efficient approaches currently used to treat malaria infections. However, the different pharmacokinetic profiles often exhibited by the combined drugs tend to decrease treatment efficacy as the compounds are usually eliminated from the circulation at different rates. To circumvent this obstacle, we have engineered an immunoliposomal nanovector encapsulating hydrophilic and lipophilic compounds in its lumen and lipid bilayer, respectively. The antimalarial domiphen bromide has been encapsulated in the liposome membrane with good efficiency, although its high IC50 of ca. 1 \u00b5M for living parasites complicates its use as immunoliposomal therapy due to erythrocyte agglutination. The conjugation of antibodies against glycophorin A targeted the nanocarriers to Plasmodium-infected red blood cells and to gametocytes, the sole malaria parasite stage responsible for the transmission from the human to the mosquito vector. The antimalarials pyronaridine and atovaquone, which block the development of gametocytes, have been co-encapsulated in glycophorin A-targeted immunoliposomes. The co-immunoliposomized drugs have activities significantly higher than their free forms when tested in in vitro Plasmodium falciparum cultures: Pyronaridine and atovaquone concentrations that, when encapsulated in immunoliposomes, resulted in a 50% inhibition of parasite growth had no effect on the viability of the pathogen when used as free drugs.

        "Heavy screen users are the heaviest among 10,000 children. This cross-sectional study examined the associations of recreational screen time (viewing TV programs on any screen-based device and computer use, performed while sitting) with body mass index (BMI) categories and waist-to-height ratio (WHtR) tertiles in 10,228 children (mean age 11.1 years, SD 0.8). We categorized the children into Light, Medium and Heavy TV viewers and computer users, and into Low, Medium and High exercise groups. Compared with Light TV viewers, Medium (OR: 1.30, 95% CI: 1.11-1.52, when adjusted for age, sex, language, sleep duration and exercise) and Heavy (OR: 1.57, 95% CI: 1.34-1.83) TV viewers had a higher risk of being overweight. Similarly, Heavy computer users had a higher risk of being overweight (OR: 1.42, 95% CI: 1.21-1.67). We observed interactions between exercise and TV viewing (p\u2009=\u20090.012) or computer use (p\u2009=\u20090.010). However, Heavy TV viewers had a higher risk of being overweight in all exercise groups. The associations of TV viewing and computer use were similar with BMI and WHtR. To conclude, heavy sedentary screen time is associated with overweight and central adiposity in children. Moreover, heavy TV viewers have a higher risk for overweight and central adiposity, regardless of weekly exercise duration. ",
        "Inheritance of Neural Substrates for Motivation and Pleasure. Despite advances in the understanding of the reward system and the role of dopamine in recent decades, the heritability of the underlying neural mechanisms is not known. In the present study, we examined the hemodynamic activation of the nucleus accumbens (NAcc), a key hub of the reward system, in 86 healthy monozygotic twins and 88 healthy dizygotic twins during a monetary-incentive-delay task. The participants also completed self-report measures of pleasure. Using voxelwise heritability mapping, we found that activation of the bilateral NAcc during the anticipation of monetary gains had significant heritability (h2 = .20-.49). Moreover, significant shared genetic covariance was observed between pleasure and NAcc activation during the anticipation of monetary gain. These findings suggest that both NAcc activation and self-reported pleasure may be heritable and that their phenotypic correlation may be partially explained by shared genetic variation. ",
        "Ethynylphosphonamidates for the Rapid and Cysteine-Selective Generation of Efficacious Antibody-Drug Conjugates. Requirements for novel bioconjugation reactions for the synthesis of antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) are exceptionally high, since conjugation selectivity as well as the stability and hydrophobicity of linkers and payloads drastically influence the performance and safety profile of the final product. We report Cys-selective ethynylphosphonamidates as new reagents for the rapid generation of efficacious ADCs from native non-engineered monoclonal antibodies through a simple one-pot reduction and alkylation. Ethynylphosphonamidates can be easily substituted with hydrophilic residues, giving rise to electrophilic labeling reagents with tunable solubility properties. We demonstrate that ethynylphosphonamidate-linked ADCs have excellent properties for next-generation antibody therapeutics in terms of serum stability and in\u2005vivo antitumor activity. ",
        "Microneedling as a Treatment for Acne Scarring: A Systematic Review. BACKGROUND: Microneedling is a popular, minimally invasive skin rejuvenation modality for acne scarring. Recent reports have evaluated the efficacy and safety of microneedling monotherapy and combination treatment for scarring. OBJECTIVE: This review aims to systematically analyze the current literature on microneedling techniques used for acne scarring. METHODS: A PubMed search (2009-current) was used to identify literature on microneedling treatment for acne. All randomized and nonrandomized clinical trials, case cohorts, case reports, and case series were included with the exception of 2 studies, which were excluded due to unavailability. RESULTS: All 33 articles evaluated showed improvement of acne scar appearance after microneedling treatment. Evidence was inconsistent when comparing microneedling monotherapy to dual therapy or to fractional laser treatment. CONCLUSION: Microneedling improves acne scarring, and further studies are needed to compare microneedling with other minimally invasive treatments. ",
        "Interleaving Motor Sequence Training With High-Frequency Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation Facilitates Consolidation. The acquisition of novel motor skills is a fundamental process of lifelong learning and crucial for everyday behavior. Performance gains acquired by training undergo a transition from an initially labile state to a state that is progressively robust towards interference, a phenomenon referred to as motor consolidation. Previous work has demonstrated that the primary motor cortex (M1) is a neural key region for motor consolidation. However, it remains unknown whether physiological processes underlying posttraining motor consolidation in M1 are active already during an ongoing training phase or only after completion of the training. We examined whether 10-Hz interleaved repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (i-rTMS) of M1 during rest periods between active motor training in an explicit motor learning task affects posttraining offline consolidation. Relative to i-rTMS to the vertex (control region), i-rTMS to the M1hand area of the nondominant hand facilitated posttraining consolidation assessed 6 h after training without affecting training performance. This facilitatory effect generalized to delayed performance of the mirror-symmetric sequence with the untrained (dominant) hand. These findings indicate that posttraining consolidation can be facilitated independently from training-induced performance increments and suggest that consolidation is initiated already during offline processing in short rest periods between active training phases.

        "Modulating cellular cytotoxicity and phototoxicity of fluorescent organic salts through counterion pairing. Light-activated theranostics offer promising opportunities for disease diagnosis, image-guided surgery, and site-specific personalized therapy. However, current fluorescent dyes are limited by low brightness, high cytotoxicity, poor tissue penetration, and unwanted side effects. To overcome these limitations, we demonstrate a platform for optoelectronic tuning, which allows independent control of the optical properties from the electronic properties of fluorescent organic salts. This is achieved through cation-anion pairing of organic salts that can modulate the frontier molecular orbital without impacting the bandgap. Optoelectronic tuning enables decoupled control over the cytotoxicity and phototoxicity of fluorescent organic salts by selective generation of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species that control cell viability. We show that through counterion pairing, organic salt nanoparticles can be tuned to be either nontoxic for enhanced imaging, or phototoxic for improved photodynamic therapy. ",
        "The Drosophila ERG channel seizure plays a role in the neuronal homeostatic stress response. Neuronal physiology is particularly sensitive to acute stressors that affect excitability, many of which can trigger seizures and epilepsies. Although intrinsic neuronal homeostasis plays an important role in maintaining overall nervous system robustness and its resistance to stressors, the specific genetic and molecular mechanisms that underlie these processes are not well understood. Here we used a reverse genetic approach in Drosophila to test the hypothesis that specific voltage-gated ion channels contribute to neuronal homeostasis, robustness, and stress resistance. We found that the activity of the voltage-gated potassium channel seizure (sei), an ortholog of the mammalian ERG channel family, is essential for protecting flies from acute heat-induced seizures. Although sei is broadly expressed in the nervous system, our data indicate that its impact on the organismal robustness to acute environmental stress is primarily mediated via its action in excitatory neurons, the octopaminergic system, as well as neuropile ensheathing and perineurial glia. Furthermore, our studies suggest that human mutations in the human ERG channel (hERG), which have been primarily implicated in the cardiac Long QT Syndrome (LQTS), may also contribute to the high incidence of seizures in LQTS patients via a cardiovascular-independent neurogenic pathway.

        "Prohibitin is a prognostic marker and therapeutic target to block chemotherapy resistance in Wilms' tumor. Wilms' tumor is the most common type of childhood kidney cancer. To improve risk stratification and identify novel therapeutic targets for patients with Wilms' tumor, we used high-resolution mass spectrometry proteomics to identify urine tumor markers associated with Wilms' tumor relapse. We determined the urine proteomes at diagnosis of 49 patients with Wilms' tumor, non-Wilms' tumor renal tumors, and age-matched controls, leading to the quantitation of 6520 urine proteins. Supervised analysis revealed specific urine markers of renal rhabdoid tumors, kidney clear cell sarcomas, renal cell carcinomas as well as those detected in patients with cured and relapsed Wilms' tumor. In particular, urine prohibitin was significantly elevated at diagnosis in patients with relapsed as compared with cured Wilms' tumor. In a validation cohort of 139 patients, a specific urine prohibitin ELISA demonstrated that prohibitin concentrations greater than 998 ng/mL at diagnosis were significantly associated with ultimate Wilms' tumor relapse. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that prohibitin was highly expressed in primary Wilms' tumor specimens and associated with disease stage. Using functional genetic experiments, we found that prohibitin was required for the growth and survival of Wilms' tumor cells. Overexpression of prohibitin was sufficient to block intrinsic mitochondrial apoptosis and to cause resistance to diverse chemotherapy drugs, at least in part by dysregulating factors that control apoptotic cytochrome c release from mitochondrial cristae. Thus, urine prohibitin may improve therapy stratification, noninvasive monitoring of treatment response, and early disease detection. In addition, therapeutic targeting of chemotherapy resistance induced by prohibitin dysregulation may offer improved therapies for patients with Wilms' and other relapsed or refractory tumors. ",
        "Wireless optofluidic brain probes for chronic neuropharmacology and photostimulation. Both in vivo neuropharmacology and optogenetic stimulation can be used to decode neural circuitry, and can provide therapeutic strategies for brain disorders. However, current neuronal interfaces hinder long-term studies in awake and freely behaving animals, as they are limited in their ability to provide simultaneous and prolonged delivery of multiple drugs, are often bulky and lack multifunctionality, and employ custom control systems with insufficiently versatile selectivity for output mode, animal selection and target brain circuits. Here, we describe smartphone-controlled, minimally invasive, soft optofluidic probes with replaceable plug-like drug cartridges for chronic in vivo pharmacology and optogenetics with selective manipulation of brain circuits. We demonstrate the use of the probes for the control of the locomotor activity of mice for over four weeks via programmable wireless drug delivery and photostimulation. Owing to their ability to deliver both drugs and photopharmacology into the brain repeatedly over long time periods, the probes may contribute to uncovering the basis of neuropsychiatric diseases. ",
        "A Reverse Ecology Approach Based on a Biological Definition of Microbial Populations. Delineating ecologically meaningful populations among microbes is important for identifying their roles in environmental and host-associated microbiomes. Here, we introduce a metric of recent gene flow, which when applied to co-existing microbes, identifies congruent genetic and ecological units separated by strong gene flow discontinuities from their next of kin. We then develop a pipeline to identify genome regions within these units that show differential adaptation and allow mapping of populations onto environmental variables or host associations. Using this reverse ecology approach, we show that the human commensal bacterium Ruminococcus gnavus breaks up into sharply delineated populations that show different associations with health and disease. Defining populations by recent gene flow in this way will facilitate the analysis of bacterial and archaeal genomes using ecological and evolutionary theory developed for plants and animals, thus allowing for testing unifying principles across all biology.

        "Quantifying ultrasonic mouse vocalizations using acoustic analysis in a supervised statistical machine learning framework. Examination of rodent vocalizations in experimental conditions can yield valuable insights into how disease manifests and progresses over time. It can also be used as an index of social interest, motivation, emotional development or motor function depending on the animal model under investigation. Most mouse communication is produced in ultrasonic frequencies beyond human hearing. These ultrasonic vocalizations (USV) are typically described and evaluated using expert defined classification of the spectrographic appearance or simplistic acoustic metrics resulting in nine call types. In this study, we aimed to replicate the standard expert-defined call types of communicative vocal behavior in mice by using acoustic analysis to characterize USVs and a principled supervised learning setup. We used four feature selection algorithms to select parsimonious subsets with maximum predictive accuracy, which are then presented into support vector machines (SVM) and random forests (RF). We assessed the resulting models using 10-fold cross-validation with 100 repetitions for statistical confidence and found that a parsimonious subset of 8 acoustic measures presented to RF led to 85% correct out-of-sample classification, replicating the experts' labels. Acoustic measures can be used by labs to describe USVs and compare data between groups, and provide insight into vocal-behavioral patterns of mice by automating the process on matching the experts' call types.

        "Operative versus non-operative treatment for 2-part proximal humerus fracture: A multicenter randomized controlled trial. BACKGROUND: Although increasingly used, the benefit of surgical treatment of displaced 2-part proximal humerus fractures has not been proven. This trial evaluates the clinical effectiveness of surgery with locking plate compared with non-operative treatment for these fractures. METHODS AND FINDINGS: The NITEP group conducted a superiority, assessor-blinded, multicenter randomized trial in 6 hospitals in Finland, Estonia, Sweden, and Denmark. Eighty-eight patients aged 60 years or older with displaced (more than 1 cm or 45 degrees) 2-part surgical or anatomical neck proximal humerus fracture were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to undergo either operative treatment with a locking plate or non-operative treatment. The mean age of patients was 72 years in the non-operative group and 73 years in the operative group, with a female sex distribution of 95% and 87%, respectively. Patients were recruited between February 2011 and April 2016. The primary outcome measure was Disabilities of Arm, Shoulder, and Hand (DASH) score at 2-year follow-up. Secondary outcomes included Constant-Murley score, the visual analogue scale for pain, the quality of life questionnaire 15D, EuroQol Group's 5-dimension self-reported questionnaire EQ-5D, the Oxford Shoulder Score, and complications. The mean DASH score (0 best, 100 worst) at 2 years was 18.5 points for the operative treatment group and 17.4 points for the non-operative group (mean difference 1.1 [95% CI -7.8 to 9.4], p = 0.81). At 2 years, there were no statistically or clinically significant between-group differences in any of the outcome measures. All 3 complications resulting in secondary surgery occurred in the operative group. The lack of blinding in patient-reported outcome assessment is a limitation of the study. Our assessor physiotherapists were, however, blinded. CONCLUSIONS: This trial found no significant difference in clinical outcomes at 2 years between surgery and non-operative treatment in patients 60 years of age or older with displaced 2-part fractures of the proximal humerus. These results suggest that the current practice of performing surgery on the majority of displaced proximal 2-part fractures of the humerus in older adults may not be beneficial.

        "A vicious cycle of \u03b2 amyloid-dependent neuronal hyperactivation. \u03b2-amyloid (A\u03b2)-dependent neuronal hyperactivity is believed to contribute to the circuit dysfunction that characterizes the early stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Although experimental evidence in support of this hypothesis continues to accrue, the underlying pathological mechanisms are not well understood. In this experiment, we used mouse models of A\u03b2-amyloidosis to show that hyperactivation is initiated by the suppression of glutamate reuptake. Hyperactivity occurred in neurons with preexisting baseline activity, whereas inactive neurons were generally resistant to A\u03b2-mediated hyperactivation. A\u03b2-containing AD brain extracts and purified A\u03b2 dimers were able to sustain this vicious cycle. Our findings suggest a cellular mechanism of A\u03b2-dependent neuronal dysfunction that can be active before plaque formation. ",
        "Convergent Structures Illuminate Features for Germline Antibody Binding and Pan-Lassa Virus Neutralization. Lassa virus (LASV) causes hemorrhagic fever and is endemic in West Africa. Protective antibody responses primarily target the LASV surface glycoprotein (GPC), and GPC-B competition group antibodies often show potent neutralizing activity in humans. However, which features confer potent and broadly neutralizing antibody responses is unclear. Here, we compared three crystal structures of LASV GPC\u00a0complexed with GPC-B antibodies of varying neutralization potency. Each GPC-B antibody recognized an overlapping epitope involved in binding of two adjacent GPC monomers and preserved the prefusion trimeric conformation. Differences among GPC-antibody interactions highlighted specific residues that enhance neutralization. Using structure-guided amino acid substitutions, we increased the neutralization potency and breadth of these antibodies to include all major LASV lineages. The ability to define antibody residues that allow potent and broad neutralizing activity, together with findings from analyses of inferred germline precursors, is critical to develop potent therapeutics and for vaccine design and assessment.

        "Dual DNA Barcoding for the Molecular Identification of the Agents of Invasive Fungal Infections. Invasive fungal infections, such as aspergillosis, candidiasis, and cryptococcosis, have significantly increased among immunocompromised people. To tackle these infections the first and most decisive step is the accurate identification of the causal pathogen. Routine identification of invasive fungal infections has progressed away from culture-dependent methods toward molecular techniques, including DNA barcoding, a highly efficient and widely used diagnostic technique. Fungal DNA barcoding previously relied on a single barcoding region, the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region. However, this allowed only for 75% of all fungi to be correctly identified. As such, the translational elongation factor 1\u03b1 (TEF1\u03b1) was recently introduced as the secondary barcode region to close the gap. Both loci together form the dual fungal DNA barcoding scheme. As a result, the ISHAM Barcoding Database has been expanded to include sequences for both barcoding regions to enable practical implementation of the dual barcoding scheme into clinical practice. The present study investigates the impact of the secondary barcode on the identification of clinically important fungal taxa, that have been demonstrated to cause severe invasive disease. Analysis of the barcoding regions was performed using barcoding gap analysis based on the genetic distances generated with the Kimura 2-parameter model. The secondary barcode demonstrated an improvement in identification for all taxa that were unidentifiable with the primary barcode, and when combined with the primary barcode ensured accurate identification for all taxa analyzed, making DNA barcoding an important, efficient and reliable addition to the diagnostic toolset of invasive fungal infections.

        "Longitudinal Association of Depression Symptoms With Cognition and Cortical Amyloid Among Community-Dwelling Older Adults. Importance: Depressive symptoms are prevalent among older adults and may be early manifestations of Alzheimer disease (AD) before onset of mild cognitive impairment. However, it remains unclear whether worsening depressive symptoms in the presence of AD pathology are associated with cognitive decline in older adults. Objective: To determine the longitudinal association between depressive symptoms, cognition, and cortical amyloid in community-dwelling older adults. Design, Setting, and Participants: Participants from the Harvard Aging Brain Study, a cohort study, underwent annual assessments of depression and cognition and baseline cortical amyloid measurement (mean, 4.42 years; range, 2-7 years). Data collection was from September 2010 to August 2017 in a convenience sample of community-dwelling adults (276 participants, all cognitively unimpaired) with at most mild depression at entry. Main Outcomes and Measures: Depression (Geriatric Depression Scale [GDS]), cognition (Preclinical Alzheimer Cognitive Composite [PACC]), and a continuous measure of cortical amyloid (Pittsburgh Compound-B positron emission tomography imaging). Change in GDS and baseline amyloid were examined as interactive predictors of PACC decline in a linear mixed model with backward elimination, adjusting for age, sex, and education. Results: Participants were 164 women and 112 men (mean [SD] age, 73.5 [6.0] years). At baseline, the mean (SD) GDS score was 3.0 (2.8) (range, 0-12), the mean (SD) PACC score was -0.004 (0.67) (range, -2.32 to 1.88), and the mean (SD) amyloid positron emission tomography distribution volume ratio was 1.16 (0.20) (range, 0.92-1.94). At last follow-up, the mean (SD) GDS score was 3.9 (2.9) (range, 0-12), and the mean (SD) PACC score was -0.09 (1.27) (range, -5.66 to 1.67). The interaction between cortical amyloid and increasing GDS was associated with declining cognition (\u03b2\u2009=\u2009-0.19; 95% CI, -0.27 to -0.12; P\u2009<\u2009.001). Conclusions and Relevance: In this study, cortical amyloid moderated the association between worsening depressive symptoms and declining cognition in older adults. While future work is needed to better understand causal associations, these findings may enhance early detection and prevention of AD clinical symptoms. ",
        "Nonbiological Microsurgery Simulators in Plastic Surgery Training: A Systematic Review. BACKGROUND: Simulation has gained notable recognition for its role as an effective training and assessment modality in the present era of competency-based medical education. Despite the well-documented efficacy of both live and cadaveric animal models, several ethical, financial, and accessibility issues persist with their use. Lower fidelity nonbiological simulators have gained recognition for their ability to circumvent these challenges. This systematic review reports on all prosthetic and virtual reality simulators in use for microsurgery training, with an emphasis on each model's complexity, characteristics, advantages, disadvantages, and validation measures taken. METHODS: A systematic search was performed using the National Library of Medicine (PubMed), MEDLINE, and Embase databases. Search terms were those pertaining to prosthetic and virtual reality models with relevance to microsurgical training in plastic surgery. Three independent reviewers evaluated all articles retrieved based on strict inclusion and exclusion criteria. RESULTS: Fifty-seven articles met the inclusion criteria for review, reporting on 20 basic prosthetic models, 20 intermediate models, 13 advanced models, and six virtual reality simulators. CONCLUSIONS: A comprehensive summary has been compiled of all nonbiological simulators in use for microsurgery training in plastic surgery, demonstrating efficacy for the acquisition and retention of microsurgical skills. Metrics-based validation efforts, however, were often lacking in the literature. As plastic surgery programs continue to innovate, ensure accountability, and safely meet today's training standards, prosthetic simulators are set to play a larger role in the development of a standardized, ethical, accessible, and objectively measurable microsurgery training curriculum for the modern-day plastic and reconstructive surgery resident.

        "Resolving Single-Nanoconstruct Dynamics during Targeting and Nontargeting Live-Cell Membrane Interactions. This paper describes how differences in the dynamics of targeting and nontargeting constructs can provide information on nanoparticle (NP)-cell interactions. We probed translational and rotational dynamics of functionalized Au nanostar (AuNS) nanoconstructs interacting with cells in serum-containing medium. We found that AuNS with targeting ligands had a larger dynamical footprint and faster rotational speed on cell membranes expressing human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2) receptors compared to that of AuNS with nontargeting ligands. Targeting and nontargeting nanoconstructs displayed distinct membrane dynamics despite their similar protein adsorption profiles, which suggests that targeted interactions are preserved even in the presence of a protein corona. The high sensitivity of single-NP dynamics can be used to compare different nanoconstruct properties (such as NP size, shape, and surface chemistry) to improve their design as delivery vehicles. ",
        "Self-administration of edible \u03949-tetrahydrocannabinol and associated behavioral effects in mice. BACKGROUND: With increasing access to legal cannabis across the globe, it is imperative to more closely study its behavioral and physiological effects. Furthermore, with the proliferation of cannabis use, modes of consumption are changing, with edible formulations becoming increasingly popular. Nevertheless, there are relatively few animal models of self-administration of the primary psychoactive component of cannabis, \u03949-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), and almost all incorporate routes of administration other than those used by humans. The aim of the current study was to develop a model of edible THC self-administration and assess its impact on CB1 receptor-mediated behaviors in female and male mice. METHODS: Mice were given limited access to a palatable dough which occasionally contained THC in doses ranging from 1 to 10\u2009mg/kg. Following dough consumption, mice were assessed for home cage locomotor activity, body temperature, or analgesia. Locomotor activity was also assessed in conjunction with the CB1 receptor antagonist SR141716A. RESULTS: Dough was well-consumed, but consumption decreased at the highest THC concentrations. Edible THC produced dose-dependent decreases in locomotor activity and body temperature in both sexes, and these effects were more pronounced in male mice. Hypolocomotion induced by edible THC was attenuated by SR141716A, indicating mediation by CB1 receptor activation. CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to other cannabinoid self-administration models, edible THC is relatively low in stress and uses a route of administration analogous to one used by humans. Potential applications include chronic THC self-administration, determining THC reward/reinforcement, and investigating consequences of oral THC use. ",
        "Diurnal rhythms in gene expression in the prefrontal cortex in schizophrenia. Schizophrenia is associated with disrupted cognitive control and sleep-wake cycles. Here we identify diurnal rhythms in gene expression in the human dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), in schizophrenia and control subjects. We find significant diurnal (24\u2009h) rhythms in control subjects, however, most of these transcripts are not rhythmic in subjects with schizophrenia. Instead, subjects with schizophrenia have a different set of rhythmic transcripts. The top pathways identified in transcripts rhythmic only in subjects with schizophrenia are associated with mitochondrial function. Importantly, these rhythms drive differential expression patterns of these and several other genes that have long been implicated in schizophrenia (including BDNF and GABAergic-related transcripts). Indeed, differential expression of these transcripts is only seen in subjects that died during the night, with no change in subjects that died during the day. These data provide insights into a potential mechanism that underlies changes in gene expression in the dlPFC with schizophrenia. ",
        "Transit amplifying cells coordinate mouse incisor mesenchymal stem cell activation. Stem cells (SCs) receive inductive cues from the surrounding microenvironment and cells. Limited molecular evidence has connected tissue-specific mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) with mesenchymal transit amplifying cells (MTACs). Using mouse incisor as the model, we discover a population of MSCs neibouring to the MTACs and epithelial SCs. With Notch signaling as the key regulator, we disclose molecular proof and lineage tracing evidence showing the distinct MSCs contribute to incisor MTACs and the other mesenchymal cell lineages. MTACs can feedback and regulate the homeostasis and activation of CL-MSCs through Delta-like 1 homolog (Dlk1), which balances MSCs-MTACs number and the lineage differentiation. Dlk1's function on SCs priming and self-renewal depends on its biological forms and its gene expression is under dynamic epigenetic control. Our findings can be validated in clinical samples and applied to accelerate tooth wound healing, providing an intriguing insight of how to direct SCs towards tissue regeneration. ",
        "Association Between Age at Puberty and Bone Accrual From 10 to 25 Years of Age. Importance: Bone health in early life is thought to influence the risk of osteoporosis in later life. Objective: To examine whether puberty timing is associated with bone mineral density accrual up to adulthood. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study used data from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children, a prospective population-based birth cohort initiated in 1991 to 1992 in southwest England. The participants were 6389 healthy British people who underwent regular follow-up, including up to 6 repeated bone density scans from ages 10 to 25 years. Data analysis was performed from June 2018 to June 2019. Exposures: Age at puberty from estimated age at peak height velocity (years). Main Outcomes and Measures: Gains per year in whole-body bone mineral density (grams per square centimeter), assessed by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry at ages 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, and 25 years and modeled using linear splines. Results: A total of 6389 participants (3196 [50.0%] female) were included. The mean (SD) age at peak height velocity was 13.5 (0.9) years for male participants and 11.6 (0.8) years for female participants. Male participants gained bone mineral density at faster rates than did female participants, with the greatest gains in both male participants (0.139 g/cm2/y; 95% CI, 0.127-0.151 g/cm2/y) and female participants (0.106 g/cm2/y; 95% CI, 0.098-0.114 g/cm2/y) observed between the year before and 2 years after peak height velocity. When aligned by chronological age, per 1-year older age at puberty was associated with faster subsequent gains in bone mineral density; the magnitudes of faster gains were greatest between ages 14 and 16 years in both male participants (0.013 g/cm2/y; 95% CI, 0.011-0.015 g/cm2/y) and female participants (0.014 g/cm2/y; 95% CI, 0.014-0.015 g/cm2/y), were greater in male participants (0.011 g/cm2/y; 95% CI, 0.010-0.013 g/cm2/y) than in female participants (0.003 g/cm2/y; 95% CI, 0.003-0.004 g/cm2/y) between ages 16 and 18 years, and were least in both male participants (0.002 g/cm2/y; 95% CI, 0.001-0.003 g/cm2/y) and female participants (0.000 g/cm2/y; 95% CI, -0.001 to 0.000 g/cm2/y) between ages 18 and 25 years. Despite faster gains, older age at puberty was associated with persistently lower bone mineral density, changing from 0.050 g/cm2 (95% CI, -0.056 to -0.045 g/cm2) lower at age 14 years to 0.047 g/cm2 (95% CI, -0.051 to -0.043 g/cm2) lower at age 25 years in male participants and from 0.044 g/cm2 (95% CI, -0.046 to -0.041 g/cm2) to 0.034 g/cm2 (95% CI, -0.036 to -0.032 g/cm2) lower at the same ages in female participants. Conclusions and Relevance: People with older pubertal age should be advised on how to maximize bone mineral density and minimize its decrease in later life to help prevent fracture and osteoporosis.

        "Opioid and Cannabis Co-Use among Adults With Chronic Pain: Relations to Substance Misuse, Mental Health, and Pain Experience. OBJECTIVES: Opioid misuse constitutes a significant public health problem and is associated with a host of negative outcomes. Despite efforts to curb this increasing epidemic, opioids remain the most widely prescribed class of medications. Prescription opioids are often used to treat chronic pain despite the risks associated with use, and chronic pain remains an important factor in understanding this epidemic. Cannabis is another substance that has recently garnered attention in the chronic pain literature, as increasing numbers of individuals use cannabis to manage chronic pain. Importantly, the co-use of substances generally is associated with poorer outcomes than single substance use, yet little work has examined the impact of opioid-cannabis co-use. METHODS: The current study examined the use of opioids alone, compared to use of opioid and cannabis co-use, among adults (n\u200a=\u200a450) with chronic pain on mental health, pain, and substance use outcomes. RESULTS: Results suggest that, compared to opioid use alone, opioid and cannabis co-use was associated with elevated anxiety and depression symptoms, as well as tobacco, alcohol, cocaine, and sedative use problems, but not pain experience. CONCLUSIONS: These findings highlight a vulnerable population of polysubstance users with chronic pain, and indicates the need for more comprehensive assessment and treatment of chronic pain. ",
        "Blockade Of PD-1 Attenuated Postsepsis Aspergillosis Via The Activation of IFN-\u03b3 and The Dampening of IL-10. BACKGROUND: Nosocomial aspergillosis in patients with sepsis has emerged in the past few years. Blockade of PD-1/PD-L pathway has tended to become a promising therapeutic strategy as it improved the outcome of bacterial sepsis and postsepsis secondary fungal infection. Recently, the controversial effects of PD-1 blockade on infectious diseases, including aspergillosis, have been demonstrated; therefore, the efficacy of anti-PD-1 drug still remains to be elucidated. METHODS: Cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) was conducted as a mouse sepsis model. Aspergillus fumigatus spores were intravenously inoculated on day 5 post-CLP, when the immune cells succumbed to exhaustion. Amphotericin B was medicated together with or without anti-PD-1 treatment after Aspergillus infection. RESULTS: Amphotericin B alone was not effective to treat the CLP-mice with secondary aspergillosis. In contrast, antifungal medication with the adjunctive anti-PD-1 treatment attenuated the fungal burdens in blood and internal organs, and improved the survival rate of the mice with secondary aspergillosis. These outcomes of PD-1 blockade were concurring with the enhanced CD86 expression on splenocytes, the augmented serum IFN-\u03b3, and the dampened IL-10. Activated T cells from anti-PD-1-treated mice also highly increased IFN-\u03b3 and diminished IL-10 production. CONCLUSION: The blockade of PD-1 on postsepsis aspergillosis presumably reinvigorated exhausted antigen-presenting cells and T cells by upregulating CD86 expression and IFN-\u03b3 production, and dampened IL-10 production, which consequently leaded to the attenuation of secondary aspergillosis. The adjunctive anti-PD-1 therapy may become a promising strategy for the advanced immunotherapy against lethal fungal infection. ",
        "Perfusion Assessment in Critical Limb Ischemia: Principles for Understanding and the Development of Evidence and Evaluation of Devices: A Scientific Statement From the American Heart Association. There are >12 million patients with peripheral artery disease in the United States. The most severe form of peripheral artery disease is critical limb ischemia (CLI). The diagnosis and management of CLI is often challenging. Ethnic differences in comorbidities and presentation of CLI exist. Compared with white patients, black and Hispanic patients have higher prevalence rates of diabetes mellitus and chronic renal disease and are more likely to present with gangrene, whereas white patients are more likely to present with ulcers and rest pain. A thorough evaluation of limb perfusion is important in the diagnosis of CLI because it can not only enable timely diagnosis but also reduce unnecessary invasive procedures in patients with adequate blood flow or among those with other causes for ulcers, including venous, neuropathic, or pressure changes. This scientific statement discusses the current tests and technologies for noninvasive assessment of limb perfusion, including the ankle-brachial index, toe-brachial index, and other perfusion technologies. In addition, limitations of the current technologies along with opportunities for improvement, research, and reducing disparities in health care for patients with CLI are discussed. ",
        "A Chemo-Enzymatic Cascade for the Smart Detection of Nitro- and Halogenated Phenols. The flavin-dependent monooxygenase, HadA, catalyzes the dehalogenation and denitration of the toxicants, nitro- and halogenated phenols, to benzoquinone. The HadA reaction can be applied in one-pot reactions towards the de\u2005novo synthesis of d-luciferin by coupling with d-Cys condensation. d-luciferin, a valuable chemical widely used in biomedical applications, can be used as a substrate for the reaction of firefly luciferase to generate bioluminescence. As nitro- and halogenated phenols are key indicators of human overexposure to pesticides and pesticide contamination, the technology provides a sensitive and convenient tool for improved biomedical and environmental detection at ppb sensitivity in biological samples without the requirement for any pre-treatment. This dual-pronged method combines the advantages of waste biodetoxification to produce a valuable chemical as well as a smart detection tool for environmental and biomedical detection. ",
        "Bicoid-Dependent Activation of the Target Gene hunchback Requires a Two-Motif Sequence Code in a Specific Basal Promoter. In complex genetic loci, individual enhancers interact most often with specific basal promoters. Here we investigate the activation of the Bicoid target gene hunchback (hb), which contains two basal promoters (P1 and P2). Early in embryogenesis, P1 is silent, while P2 is strongly activated. In\u00a0vivo deletion of P2 does not cause activation of P1, suggesting that P2 contains intrinsic sequence motifs required for activation. We show that a two-motif code (a Zelda binding site plus TATA) is required and sufficient for P2 activation. Zelda sites are present in the promoters of many embryonically expressed genes, but the combination of Zelda plus TATA does not seem to be a general code for early activation or Bicoid-specific activation per se. Because Zelda sites are also found in Bicoid-dependent enhancers, we propose that simultaneous binding to both enhancers and promoters independently synchronizes chromatin accessibility and facilitates correct enhancer-promoter interactions.

        "Needle-shaped amyloid deposition in rat mammary gland: evidence of a novel amyloid fibril protein. Amyloidosis is an extremely rare event in rats. In this study, we report that lipopolysaccharide binding protein (LBP) is the most likely amyloidogenic protein in rat mammary amyloidosis. Histologically, corpora amylacea (CA) and stromal amyloid (SA) were observed in rat mammary glands, and needle-shaped amyloid (NA) was also observed on the surface or gap of CA and SA. Following surveillance in aged rats, NA was observed in 62% of mammary tumours, 25% of male mammary glands and 83% of female mammary glands. Proteomic analysis showed that lactadherin was a major constitutive protein of CA and SA, and both were positive following immunohistochemistry with anti-lactadherin antibodies. In the same analysis, LBP was detected as a prime candidate protein in NA, and NA was positive following immunohistochemistry and immunoelectron microscopy with anti-LBP antibody. Furthermore, synthetic peptides derived from rat LBP formed amyloid fibrils in vitro. Overall, these results provide evidence that LBP is an amyloid precursor protein of NA in rat mammary glands. ",
        "Integrated TORC1 and PKA signaling control the temporal activation of glucose-induced gene expression in yeast. The growth rate of a yeast cell is controlled by the target of rapamycin kinase complex I (TORC1) and cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) pathways. To determine how TORC1 and PKA cooperate to regulate cell growth, we performed temporal analysis of gene expression in yeast switched from a non-fermentable substrate, to glucose, in the presence and absence of TORC1 and PKA inhibitors. Quantitative analysis of these data reveals that PKA drives the expression of key cell growth genes during transitions into, and out of, the rapid growth state in glucose, while TORC1 is important for the steady-state expression of the same genes. This circuit design may enable yeast to set an exact growth rate based on the abundance of internal metabolites such as amino acids, via TORC1, but also adapt rapidly to changes in external nutrients, such as glucose, via PKA.

        "Using big data to explore worldwide trends in objective sleep in the transition to adulthood. BACKGROUND: Development induces changes in sleep, and its duration has been reported to change as a function of aging. Additionally, sleep timing is a marker of pubertal maturation, where during adolescence, the circadian rhythm shifts later. Typically, this is manifested in a later sleep onset in the evening and later awakening in the morning. These changes across development seem to be universal around the world but are unlikely to persist into adulthood. METHODS: This study utilized accelerometer data from 17,355 participants aged 16-30 years (56% female) measured by validated Polar wearables over a 14-day period. We compared sleep duration, chronotype (sleep midpoint) and weekend catch-up (ie, social jetlag) sleep across ages and regions over 242,948 nights. RESULTS: The data indicate a decline in sleep duration as well as a dramatic shift in sleep onset times throughout adolescence. This continues well into early adulthood and stabilizes nearer age 30. Differences in sleep duration across ages were significant, and ranged from 7:53\u00a0h at age 16 to 7:29\u00a0h at age 30 in the sample. Additionally, there was a clear difference between females and males throughout adolescence and young adulthood: girls had longer sleep duration and earlier timed sleep in the current study. Differences in sleep were found between regions across the world, and across European areas. CONCLUSIONS: Both sleep duration and sleep timing go through a clear developmental pattern, particularly in early adulthood. Females had an earlier sleep midpoint and obtained more sleep. Regional differences in sleep occurred across the world. ",
        "A carbohydrate-reduced high-protein diet improves HbA1c and liver fat content in weight stable participants with type 2 diabetes: a randomised controlled trial. AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Dietary recommendations for treating type 2 diabetes are unclear but a trend towards recommending a diet reduced in carbohydrate content is acknowledged. We compared a carbohydrate-reduced high-protein (CRHP) diet with an iso-energetic conventional diabetes (CD) diet to elucidate the effects on glycaemic control and selected cardiovascular risk markers during 6\u00a0weeks of full food provision of each diet. METHODS: The primary outcome of the study was change in HbA1c. Secondary outcomes reported in the present paper include glycaemic variables, ectopic fat content and 24\u00a0h blood pressure. Eligibility criteria were: men and women with type 2 diabetes, HbA1c 48-97\u00a0mmol/mol (6.5-11%), age >18\u00a0years, haemoglobin >6/>7\u00a0mmol/l (women/men) and eGFR >30\u00a0ml\u00a0min-1 (1.73\u00a0m)-2. Participants were randomised by drawing blinded ballots to 6\u2009+\u20096\u00a0weeks of an iso-energetic CRHP vs CD diet in an open label, crossover design aiming at body weight stability. The CRHP/CD diets contained carbohydrate 30/50 energy per cent (E%), protein 30/17E% and fat 40/33E%, respectively. Participants underwent a meal test at the end of each diet period and glycaemic variables, lipid profiles, 24\u00a0h blood pressure and ectopic fat including liver and pancreatic fat content were assessed at baseline and at the end of each diet period. Data were collected at Copenhagen University Hospital, Bispebjerg and Copenhagen University Hospital, Herlev. RESULTS: Twenty-eight participants completed the study. Fourteen participants carried out 6\u00a0weeks of the CRHP intervention followed by 6\u00a0weeks of the CD intervention, and 14 participants received the dietary interventions in the reverse order. Compared with a CD diet, a CRHP diet reduced the primary outcome of HbA1c (mean \u00b1 SEM: -6.2\u2009\u00b1\u20090.8\u00a0mmol/mol (-0.6\u2009\u00b1\u20090.1%) vs -0.75\u2009\u00b1\u20091.0\u00a0mmol/mol (-0.1\u2009\u00b1\u20090.1%); p\u2009<\u20090.001). Nine (out of 37) pre-specified secondary outcomes are reported in the present paper, of which five were significantly different between the diets, (p\u2009<\u20090.05); compared with a CD diet, a CRHP diet reduced the secondary outcomes (mean \u00b1 SEM or medians [interquartile range]) of fasting plasma glucose (-0.71\u2009\u00b1\u20090.20\u00a0mmol/l vs 0.03\u2009\u00b1\u20090.23\u00a0mmol/l; p\u2009<\u20090.05), postprandial plasma glucose AUC (9.58\u2009\u00b1\u20090.29\u00a0mmol/l\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0240\u00a0min vs 11.89\u2009\u00b1\u20090.43\u00a0mmol/l\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0240\u00a0min; p\u2009<\u20090.001) and net AUC (1.25\u2009\u00b1\u20090.20\u00a0mmol/l\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0240\u00a0min vs 3.10\u2009\u00b1\u20090.25\u00a0mmol/l\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0240\u00a0min; p\u2009<\u20090.001), hepatic fat content (-2.4% [-7.8% to -1.0%] vs 0.2% [-2.3% to 0.9%]; p\u2009<\u20090.01) and pancreatic fat content (-1.7% [-3.5% to 0.6%] vs 0.5% [-1.0% to 2.0%]; p\u2009<\u20090.05). Changes in other secondary outcomes, i.e. 24\u00a0h blood pressure and muscle-, visceral- or subcutaneous adipose tissue, did not differ between diets. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: A moderate macronutrient shift by substituting carbohydrates with protein and fat for 6\u00a0weeks reduced HbA1c and hepatic fat content in weight stable individuals with type 2 diabetes.

        "The Role of Exercise in Preventing and Treating Depression. Depression is a leading cause of global burden. The mainstay of treatment is pharmacological and psychological interventions. While effective, not all people will respond to those treatments and alternative approaches for preventing and treating depression are required. Recent literature has demonstrated that higher physical activity (PA) levels and exercise confer protective effects on incident depression. Also, exercise has demonstrated efficacy on reducing symptoms for people with depression. Despite its effectiveness, similar to other treatments, some people may benefit more from exercise and identifying these potential predictors of response is necessary to deal with patients' and professionals' expectations. Dropout from exercise interventions is comparable to dropout from other treatments for depression and similar to dropout from exercise in other clinical populations. However, some strategies to increase adherence are important. In the present article, we provide an updated overview of the use of PA and exercise for the prevention and treatment of depression. ",
        "Human Immunodeficiency Virus Infection and Diverse Physical Health Outcomes: An Umbrella Review of Meta-analyses of Observational Studies. BACKGROUND: Our aim was to assess both the credibility and strength of evidence arising from systematic reviews with meta-analyses of observational studies and physical health outcomes associated with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) but not acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. METHODS: We performed an umbrella review of observational studies. Evidence was graded as convincing, highly suggestive, suggestive, weak, or nonsignificant. RESULTS: From 3413 studies returned, 20 were included, covering 55 health outcomes. Median number of participants was 18 743 (range 403-225 000 000). Overall, 45 (81.8%) of the 55 unique outcomes reported nominally significant summary results (P < .05). Only 5 outcomes (9.0%; higher likelihood of presence of breathlessness, higher chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD] prevalence, maternal sepsis, higher risk of anemia, and higher risk of all fractures among people living with HIV [PLWHIV]) showed suggestive evidence, with P values < 10-3; only 3 (5.5%; higher prevalence of cough in cross-sectional studies, higher incidence of pregnancy-related mortality, and higher incidence of ischemic heart disease among PLWHIV in cohort studies) outcomes showed stronger evidence using a stringent P value (<10-6). None of the unique outcomes presented convincing evidence (Class I), yet 3 outcomes presented highly suggestive evidence, 5 outcomes presented suggestive evidence, and 37 outcomes presented weak evidence. CONCLUSIONS: Results show highly suggestive and suggestive evidence for HIV and the presence of a cough, COPD, ischemic heart disease, pregnancy-related mortality, maternal sepsis, and bone fractures. Public health policies should reflect and accommodate these changes, especially in light of the increases in the life expectancy and the incidence of comorbidities in this population. ",
        "Health Links\u2122 Assessment of Total Worker Health\u00ae Practices as Indicators of Organizational Behavior in Small Business. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to conduct a cross-sectional assessment of the adoption of Total Worker Health (TWH) policies and practices by business size and evaluate extent and alignment of their safety and health. METHODS: We conducted an analysis of 382 businesses that completed the Health Links Assessment. We measured organizational adoption of TWH across six benchmarks: organizational supports, workplace assessments, health policies and programs, safety, engagement, and evaluation. RESULTS: Benchmark scores were significantly associated with business size. Larger businesses were more likely to score higher across each benchmark. CONCLUSION: Small businesses are implementing TWH in a variety of ways and the level of implementation differs by business size. Practical interventions as well as dissemination and implementation research should take business size into account to ensure that TWH is both effective and sustainable in meeting the needs of employees.

        "Dual stem cell therapy synergistically improves cardiac function and vascular regeneration following myocardial infarction. Since both myocardium and vasculature in the heart are excessively damaged following myocardial infarction (MI), therapeutic strategies for treating MI hearts should concurrently target both so as to achieve true cardiac repair. Here we demonstrate a concomitant method that exploits the advantages of cardiomyocytes derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC-CMs) and human mesenchymal stem cell-loaded patch (hMSC-PA) to amplify cardiac repair in a rat MI model. Epicardially implanted hMSC-PA provide a complimentary microenvironment which enhances vascular regeneration through prolonged secretion of paracrine factors, but more importantly it significantly improves the retention and engraftment of intramyocardially injected hiPSC-CMs which ultimately restore the cardiac function. Notably, the majority of injected hiPSC-CMs display adult CMs like morphology suggesting that the secretomic milieu of hMSC-PA constitutes pleiotropic effects in vivo. We provide compelling evidence that this dual approach can be a promising means to enhance cardiac repair on MI hearts. ",
        "A robotic neck brace to characterize head-neck motion and muscle electromyography in subjects with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. OBJECTIVE: This paper presents the first study where a dynamic neck brace was used to characterize the head motion of ALS patients while concurrently recording the surface electromyography (EMG) of the neck muscles. METHODS: Eleven ALS patients and 10 age-matched healthy controls consented and participated in an experiment. Each participant was asked to perform three single-plane motions of the head-neck that included flexion-extension in the sagittal plane, lateral bending in the coronal plane, and axial rotation in the transverse plane. Each motion was performed in a cycle and was repeated five times at self-selected speeds. RESULTS: During single-plane flexion-extension under gravity, compared to healthy peers, ALS patients showed a shorter duration to reach the maximum flexion and an earlier EMG onset in the neck extensors starting from the neutral. The brace measures in activation of the neck muscles in ALS patients were well correlated with clinically measured scores, such as the ALSFRS-r and the FVC. The activation duration of sternocleidomastoid, used to rotate the head, correlated well with the ALSFRS-r and FVC in ALS patients during axial rotation. INTERPRETATION: The ability to synchronously activate a pair of muscles to execute single-plane motions in ALS patients seems to have been compromised due to the disease and potentially results in head drop. The neck brace measures can be adapted in the clinic to complement self-reporting in ALS patients and used to assess the head drop and progress of the disease. ",
        "Age differences in emotion-induced blindness: Positivity effects in early attention. Compared with younger adults, older adults tend to favor positive information more than negative information in their attention and memory. This \"positivity effect\" has been observed in various paradigms, but at which stage it impacts cognitive processing and how it influences processing other stimuli appearing around the same time remains unclear. Across 4 experiments, we examined how older adults prioritize emotional information in early attention. Both younger and older adults demonstrated emotion-induced blindness-identifying targets in a rapid serial display of pictures with less accuracy after emotional compared with neutral distractors-but older adults demonstrated a positivity bias at this early attentional level. Moreover, the bias toward positive but not negative information in older adults was reduced when they had a working memory load. These results suggest that a selective bias toward positive, but not negative, information occurs early in visual processing, and the bias relies on cognitive control resources.

        "Effect of promoting current local research activities on large monitors on the population's interest in health-related research: a randomised controlled trial. OBJECTIVE: The objectives of this study were threefold: to estimate people's interest in health-related research, to understand to what extent people appreciate being actively informed about current local health-related research and to investigate whether their interest can be influenced by advertising local current health-related research using large TV monitors. DESIGN: Randomised controlled trial using a stepped wedge design. SETTING: The emergency department waiting room at two public hospitals in northern Queensland, Australia. PARTICIPANTS: Waiting patients and their accompanying friends and relatives in the emergency department waiting room not requiring immediate medical attention. INTERVENTIONS: A TV monitor advertising local current health-related research. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: OR for the effect of intervention on changing the interest in health-related research compared with a control group while adjusting for gender, age and socioeconomic standard. RESULTS: The intervention significantly increased the short-term interest in health-related research with an OR of 1.3 (1.1-1.7, p=0.0063). We also noted that being female and being older was correlated to a higher interest in health-related research CONCLUSIONS: This study found that proactive information significantly increased the general populations' interest in health-related research. There are reasonable set up costs involved but the costs for maintaining the system were very low. Hence, it seems reasonable that research-active organisations should give much higher priority to this type of activity. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: ACTRN12617001085369. ",
        "Exposure to Parental Depression in Adolescence and Risk for Metabolic Syndrome in Adulthood. The psychosocial consequences of living with a depressed parent have been well characterized. Less well known, however, is how this exposure is predictive of later physical health problems. The present study evaluated how parental depression across youths' adolescence (ages 11-18) was associated with youth metabolic syndrome at age 25 (n\u00a0=\u00a0391). Youth self-regulation and health behaviors were considered as possible moderators of the link between parental depression and youth metabolic syndrome. Analyses revealed that parental depression in adolescence was associated with a composite score reflecting metabolic syndrome components in early adulthood. Furthermore, self-regulation and health behaviors moderated this link, such that links between parental depression and the metabolic syndrome existed only for youth with low self-regulation or unhealthy behaviors.

        "Adenosine Kinase Inhibition Augments Conducted Vasodilation and Prevents Left Ventricle Diastolic Dysfunction in Heart Failure With Preserved Ejection Fraction. BACKGROUND: Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is often manifested as impaired cardiovascular reserve. We sought to determine if conducted vasodilation, which coordinates microvascular resistance longitudinally to match tissue metabolic demand, becomes compromised in HFpEF. We hypothesized that the metabolic vasodilator adenosine facilitates and that inhibition of ADK (adenosine kinase) augments conducted vasodilation for a more efficient myocardial perfusion and improved left ventricle (LV) diastolic function in HFpEF. METHODS AND RESULTS: We assessed conducted vasodilation in obese ZSF1 rats that develop LV diastolic dysfunction and is used to model human HFpEF. Additionally, conducted vasodilation was measured in arterioles isolated from the right atrial appendages of patients with HFpEF. We found a markedly reduced conducted vasodilation both in obese ZSF1 rats and in patients with HFpEF. Impaired conducted vasodilation was accompanied by increased vascular ADK expression. Isolated rat and human arterioles incubated with adenosine (10 nmol/L) or ADK inhibitor ABT-702 (0.1 \u00b5mol/L) both displayed augmented conducted vasodilation. Treatment of obese ZSF1 rats with ABT-702 (1.5 mg/kg, IP for 8 weeks) prevented LV diastolic dysfunction, and in a crossover design augmented conducted vasodilation and improved LV diastolic function. ABT-702 treated obese ZSF1 rats exhibited reduced expression of myocardial carbonic anhydrase 9 and collagen, surrogate markers of myocardial hypoxia. CONCLUSIONS: Upregulation of vascular ADK mitigates adenosine-facilitated conducted vasodilation in obese ZSF1 rats and in patients with HFpEF. We propose that pharmacological inhibition of ADK could be beneficial for therapeutic augmentation of conducted vasodilation, thereby improving tissue perfusion and LV diastolic function in HFpEF. ",
        "The host cell secretory pathway mediates the export of Leishmania virulence factors out of the parasitophorous vacuole. To colonize phagocytes, Leishmania subverts microbicidal processes through components of its surface coat that include lipophosphoglycan and the GP63 metalloprotease. How these virulence glycoconjugates are shed, exit the parasitophorous vacuole (PV), and traffic within host cells is poorly understood. Here, we show that lipophosphoglycan and GP63 are released from the parasite surface following phagocytosis and redistribute to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of macrophages. Pharmacological disruption of the trafficking between the ER and the Golgi hindered the exit of these molecules from the PV and dampened the cleavage of host proteins by GP63. Silencing by RNA interference of the soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive-factor attachment protein receptors Sec22b and syntaxin-5, which regulate ER-Golgi trafficking, identified these host proteins as components of the machinery that mediates the spreading of Leishmania effectors within host cells. Our findings unveil a mechanism whereby a vacuolar pathogen takes advantage of the host cell's secretory pathway to promote egress of virulence factors beyond the PV. ",
        "Role of glucocorticoid- and monoamine-metabolizing enzymes in stress-related psychopathological processes. Glucocorticoid signaling is fundamental in healthy stress coping and in the pathophysiology of stress-related diseases, such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Glucocorticoids are metabolized by cytochrome P450 (CYP) as well as 11-\u03b2-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11\u03b2HSD1) and 2 (11\u03b2HSD2). Acute stress-induced increase in glucocorticoid concentrations stimulates the expression of several CYP sub-types. CYP is primarily responsible for glucocorticoid metabolism and its increased activity can result in decreased circulating glucocorticoids in response to repeated stress stimuli. In addition, repeated stress-induced glucocorticoid release can promote 11\u03b2HSD1 activation and 11\u03b2HSD2 inhibition, and the 11\u03b2HSD2 suppression can lead to apparent mineralocorticoid excess. The activation of CYP and 11\u03b2HSD1 and the suppression of 11\u03b2HSD2 may at least partly contribute to development of the blunted glucocorticoid response to stressors characteristic in high trait anxiety, PTSD, and other stress-related disorders. Glucocorticoids and glucocorticoid-metabolizing enzymes interact closely with other biomolecules such as inflammatory cytokines, monoamines, and some monoamine-metabolizing enzymes, namely the monoamine oxidase type A (MAO-A) and B (MAO-B). Glucocorticoids boost MAO activity and this decreases monoamine levels and induces oxidative tissue damage which then activates inflammatory cytokines. The inflammatory cytokines suppress CYP expression and activity. This dynamic cross-talk between glucocorticoids, monoamines, and their metabolizing enzymes could be a critical factor in the pathophysiology of stress-related disorders.Lay summaryGlucocorticoids, which are produced and released under the control by brain regulatory centers, are fundamental in the stress response. This review emphasizes the importance of glucocorticoid metabolism and particularly the interaction between the brain and the liver as the major metabolic organ in the body. The activity of enzymes involved in glucocorticoid metabolism is proposed to play not only an important role in positive, healthy glucocorticoid effects, but also to contribute to the development and course of stress-related diseases.

        "An Integrative Model of Cellular States, Plasticity, and Genetics for Glioblastoma. Diverse genetic, epigenetic, and developmental programs drive glioblastoma, an incurable and poorly understood tumor, but their precise characterization remains challenging. Here, we use an integrative approach spanning single-cell RNA-sequencing of 28 tumors, bulk genetic and expression analysis of 401 specimens from the The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), functional approaches, and single-cell lineage tracing to derive a unified model of cellular states and genetic diversity in glioblastoma. We find that malignant cells in glioblastoma exist in four main cellular states that recapitulate distinct neural cell types, are influenced by the tumor microenvironment, and exhibit plasticity. The relative frequency of cells in each state varies between glioblastoma samples and is influenced by copy number amplifications of the CDK4, EGFR, and PDGFRA loci and by mutations in the NF1 locus, which each favor a defined state. Our work provides a blueprint for glioblastoma, integrating the malignant cell programs, their plasticity, and their modulation by genetic drivers. ",
        "Dietary Walnut Supplementation Alters Mucosal Metabolite Profiles During DSS-Induced Colonic Ulceration. Walnuts contain a complex array of natural compounds and phytochemicals that exhibit a wide range of health benefits, including protection against inflammation and colon cancer. In this study, we assess the effects of dietary supplementation with walnuts on colonic mucosal injury induced in mice by the ulcerogenic agent, dextran sodium sulfate (DSS). C57Bl/6J mice were started on the Total Western Diet supplemented with freshly-ground whole walnuts (0, 3.5, 7 and 14% g/kg) 2 weeks prior to a 5-day DSS treatment and walnut diets were continued throughout the entire experimental period. Mice were examined at 2 days or 10 days after withdrawal of DSS. In a separate study, a discovery-based metabolite profiling analysis using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) was performed on fecal samples and colonic mucosa following two weeks of walnut supplementation. Dietary walnut supplementation showed significant effects in the 10-day post-DSS recovery-phase study, in which the extent of ulceration was significantly reduced (7.5% vs. 0.3%, p < 0.05) with 14% walnuts. In the metabolite-profiling analysis, walnuts caused a significant increase in several polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), including docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and 9-oxo-10(E),12(E)-octadecadienoic acid (9-oxoODA), as well as kynurenic acid. In colon tissue samples, walnuts caused a significant increase in the levels of S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) and betaine, important components of fatty acid \u03b2-oxidation. These metabolite changes may contribute in part to the observed protection against DSS-induced inflammatory tissue injury. ",
        "City-wide electronic health records reveal gender and age biases in administration of known drug-drug interactions. The occurrence of drug-drug-interactions (DDI) from multiple drug dispensations is a serious problem, both for individuals and health-care systems, since patients with complications due to DDI are likely to reenter the system at a costlier level. We present a large-scale longitudinal study (18 months) of the DDI phenomenon at the primary- and secondary-care level using electronic health records (EHR) from the city of Blumenau in Southern Brazil (pop. \u2248340,000). We found that 181 distinct drug pairs known to interact were dispensed concomitantly to 12% of the patients in the city's public health-care system. Further, 4% of the patients were dispensed drug pairs that are likely to result in major adverse drug reactions (ADR)-with costs estimated to be much larger than previously reported in smaller studies. The large-scale analysis reveals that women have a 60% increased risk of DDI as compared to men; the increase becomes 90% when considering only DDI known to lead to major ADR. Furthermore, DDI risk increases substantially with age; patients aged 70-79 years have a 34% risk of DDI when they are dispensed two or more drugs concomitantly. Interestingly, a statistical null model demonstrates that age- and female-specific risks from increased polypharmacy fail by far to explain the observed DDI risks in those populations, suggesting unknown social or biological causes. We also provide a network visualization of drugs and demographic factors that characterize the DDI phenomenon and demonstrate that accurate DDI prediction can be included in health care and public-health management, to reduce DDI-related ADR and costs.

        "Single-Cell Survey of Human Lymphatics Unveils Marked Endothelial Cell Heterogeneity and Mechanisms of Homing for Neutrophils. Lymphatic vessels form a critical component in the regulation of human health and disease. While their functional significance is increasingly being recognized, the comprehensive heterogeneity of lymphatics remains uncharacterized. Here, we report the profiling of 33,000 lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) in human lymph nodes (LNs) by single-cell RNA sequencing. Unbiased clustering revealed six major types of human LECs. LECs lining the subcapsular\u00a0sinus (SCS) of LNs abundantly expressed neutrophil chemoattractants, whereas LECs lining the medullary sinus (MS) expressed a C-type lectin CD209. Binding of a carbohydrate Lewis X (CD15) to CD209 mediated neutrophil binding to the MS. The neutrophil-selective homing by MS LECs may retain neutrophils in the LN medulla and allow lymph-borne pathogens to clear, preventing their spread through LNs in humans. Our study provides a comprehensive characterization of LEC heterogeneity and unveils a previously undefined role for medullary LECs in human immunity. ",
        "Bilirubin Links Heme Metabolism to Neuroprotection by Scavenging Superoxide. Bilirubin is one of the most frequently measured metabolites in medicine, yet its physiologic roles remain unclear. Bilirubin can act as an antioxidant in\u00a0vitro, but whether its redox activity is physiologically relevant is unclear because many other antioxidants are far more abundant in\u00a0vivo. Here, we report that depleting endogenous bilirubin renders mice hypersensitive to oxidative stress. We find that mice lacking bilirubin are particularly vulnerable to superoxide (O2\u22c5-) over other tested reactive oxidants and electrophiles. Whereas major antioxidants such as glutathione and cysteine exhibit little to no reactivity toward\u00a0O2\u22c5-, bilirubin readily scavenges O2\u22c5-. We find that bilirubin's redox activity is particularly important in the brain, where it prevents excitotoxicity and neuronal death by scavenging O2\u22c5- during NMDA neurotransmission. Bilirubin's unique redox activity toward O2\u22c5- may underlie a prominent physiologic role despite being significantly less abundant than other endogenous and exogenous antioxidants. ",
        "Flavonoid intake is associated with lower mortality in the Danish Diet Cancer and Health Cohort. Flavonoids, plant-derived polyphenolic compounds, have been linked with health benefits. However, evidence from observational studies is incomplete; studies on cancer mortality are scarce and moderating effects of lifestyle risk factors for early mortality are unknown. In this prospective cohort study including 56,048 participants of the Danish Diet, Cancer, and Health cohort crosslinked with Danish nationwide registries and followed for 23 years, there are 14,083 deaths. A moderate habitual intake of flavonoids is inversely associated with all-cause, cardiovascular- and cancer-related mortality. This strong association plateaus at intakes of approximately 500\u2009mg/day. Furthermore, the inverse associations between total flavonoid intake and mortality outcomes are stronger and more linear in smokers than in non-smokers, as well as in heavy (>20\u2009g/d) vs. low-moderate (<20\u2009g/d) alcohol consumers. These findings highlight the potential to reduce mortality through recommendations to increase intakes of flavonoid-rich foods, particularly in smokers and high alcohol consumers. ",
        "Self-administration of edible \u03949-tetrahydrocannabinol and associated behavioral effects in mice. BACKGROUND: With increasing access to legal cannabis across the globe, it is imperative to more closely study its behavioral and physiological effects. Furthermore, with the proliferation of cannabis use, modes of consumption are changing, with edible formulations becoming increasingly popular. Nevertheless, there are relatively few animal models of self-administration of the primary psychoactive component of cannabis, \u03949-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), and almost all incorporate routes of administration other than those used by humans. The aim of the current study was to develop a model of edible THC self-administration and assess its impact on CB1 receptor-mediated behaviors in female and male mice. METHODS: Mice were given limited access to a palatable dough which occasionally contained THC in doses ranging from 1 to 10\u2009mg/kg. Following dough consumption, mice were assessed for home cage locomotor activity, body temperature, or analgesia. Locomotor activity was also assessed in conjunction with the CB1 receptor antagonist SR141716A. RESULTS: Dough was well-consumed, but consumption decreased at the highest THC concentrations. Edible THC produced dose-dependent decreases in locomotor activity and body temperature in both sexes, and these effects were more pronounced in male mice. Hypolocomotion induced by edible THC was attenuated by SR141716A, indicating mediation by CB1 receptor activation. CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to other cannabinoid self-administration models, edible THC is relatively low in stress and uses a route of administration analogous to one used by humans. Potential applications include chronic THC self-administration, determining THC reward/reinforcement, and investigating consequences of oral THC use. ",
        "Use of Mechanical Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation Devices for Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest, 2010-2016. Importance: Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest is a common scenario facing prehospital emergency medical services (EMS) professionals and nearly always involves either manual or mechanical cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). Mechanical CPR devices are expensive and prior clinical trials have not provided evidence of benefit for patients when compared with manual CPR. Objectives: To investigate the use of mechanical CPR in the prehospital setting and determine whether patient demographic characteristics or geographical location is associated with its use. Design, Setting, and Participants: A retrospective cross-sectional study was performed using the 2010 through 2016 National Emergency Medical Services Information System data. Participants included all patients identified by EMS professionals as having out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. Main Outcomes and Measures: Use of CPR, categorized as manual or mechanical. Results: From 2010 to 2016, 892\u202f022 patients (38.6% female, 60.4% male, missing for 1%; mean [SD] age, 61.1 [20.5] years) with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest were identified by EMS professionals. Overall, manual CPR was used for 618\u202f171 patients (69.3%) and mechanical CPR was used for 45\u202f493 patients (5.1%). The risk-standardized rate of mechanical CPR use, accounting for patient demographic and geographical characteristics, rose from 1.9% in 2010 to 8.0% in 2016 (P\u2009<\u2009.001). In multivariable analyses, use of mechanical CPR devices was increasingly likely over time among patients identified with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest treated by EMS professionals, increasing from an adjusted odds ratio of 1.58 (95% CI, 1.42-1.77; P\u2009<\u2009.001) when comparing 2011 with 2010, to an adjusted odds ratio of 11.32 (95% CI, 10.22-12.54; P\u2009<\u2009.001) when comparing 2016 with 2010. In addition, several other patient demographic and geographical characteristics were associated with a higher likelihood of receiving mechanical CPR, including being 65 years or older, being male, being Hispanic, as well as receiving treatment in the Northeast Census Region, in a suburban location, or in a zip code with a median annual income greater than $20\u202f000. Conclusions and Relevance: Mechanical CPR device use increased more than 4-fold among patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest treated by EMS professionals. Given the high costs of mechanical CPR devices, better evidence is needed to determine whether these devices improve clinically meaningful outcomes for patients treated for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest by prehospital EMS professionals to justify the significant increase in their use.

        "Energy expenditure associated with posture transitions in preschool children. BACKGROUND: Despite growing scientific interest in the benefits of breaking up sedentary time with intermittent standing or walking, few studies have investigated the energy cost of posture transitions. This study aimed to determine whether posture transitions are associated with increased energy expenditure in preschool children. METHODS: Forty children (mean age 5.3 \u00b1 1.0y) completed a ~150-min room calorimeter protocol involving sedentary, light, and moderate- to vigorous-intensity activities. This study utilised data from ~65-min of the protocol, during which children were undertaking sedentary behaviours (TV viewing, drawing/colouring in, and playing with toys on the floor). Posture was coded as sit/lie, stand, walk, or other using direct observation; posture transitions were classified as sit/lie to stand/walk, sit/lie to other, stand/walk to other, or vice versa. Energy expenditure was calculated using the Weir equation and used to calculate individualised MET and activity energy expenditure (AEE) values. Spearman's rank correlations were used to compare the number of posture transitions, in the individual activities separately and combined, with corresponding MET and AEE values. Participants were divided into tertiles based on the number of posture transitions; MET and AEE values of children in the lowest and highest tertiles of posture transitions were compared using unpaired t-tests. Effect sizes (Cohen's d) were calculated. RESULTS: There was a positive correlation between the total number of posture transitions and average METs (rs = 0.42, p = 0.02) and AEE (rs = 0.43, p = 0.02). MET differences between the lowest and highest tertiles of posture transitions resulted in a small effect size for playing with toys (d = 0.27), and moderate effect sizes for TV viewing, drawing and all three activities combined (d = 0.61, 0.50 and 0.64 respectively). Similar results were found for AEE. CONCLUSIONS: Results from this study showed that variation in posture transitions may be associated with variation in energy expenditure in preschool children. The findings suggest that the concept that variation in posture transitions may have meaningful biological or health effects in early childhood is worth investigating further. ",
        "Human apolipoprotein E promotes hepatitis B virus infection and production. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a common cause of liver diseases, including chronic hepatitis, steatosis, fibrosis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). HBV chronically infects about 240 million people worldwide, posing a major global health problem. The current standard antiviral therapy effectively inhibits HBV replication but does not eliminate the virus unlike direct-acting antivirals (DAA) for curing hepatitis C. Our previous studies have demonstrated that human apolipoprotein E (apoE) plays important roles in hepatitis C virus infection and morphogenesis. In the present study, we have found that apoE is also associated with HBV and is required for efficient HBV infection. An apoE-specific monoclonal antibody was able to capture HBV similar to anti-HBs. More importantly, apoE monoclonal antibody could effectively block HBV infection, resulting in a greater than 90% reduction of HBV infectivity. Likewise, silencing of apoE expression or knockout of apoE gene by CRISPR/Cas9 resulted in a greater than 90% reduction of HBV infection and more than 80% decrease of HBV production, which could be fully restored by ectopic apoE expression. However, apoE silencing or knockout did not significantly affect HBV DNA replication or the production of nonenveloped (naked) nucleocapsids. These findings demonstrate that human apoE promotes HBV infection and production. We speculate that apoE may also play a role in persistent HBV infection by evading host immune response similar to its role in the HCV life cycle and pathogenesis. Inhibitors interfering with apoE biogenesis, secretion, and/or binding to receptors may serve as antivirals for elimination of chronic HBV infection. ",
        "In Vivo Restoration of Myocardial Conduction With Carbon Nanotube Fibers. BACKGROUND: Impaired myocardial conduction is the underlying mechanism for re-entrant arrhythmias. Carbon nanotube fibers (CNTfs) combine the mechanical properties of suture materials with the conductive properties of metals and may form a restorative solution to impaired myocardial conduction. METHODS: Acute open chest electrophysiology studies were performed in sheep (n=3). Radiofrequency ablation was used to create epicardial conduction delay after which CNTf and then silk suture controls were applied. CNTfs were surgically sewn across the right atrioventricular junction in rodents, and acute (n=3) and chronic (4-week, n=6) electrophysiology studies were performed. Rodent toxicity studies (n=10) were performed. Electrical analysis of the CNTf-myocardial interface was performed. RESULTS: In all cases, the large animal studies demonstrated improvement in conduction velocity using CNTf. The acute rodent model demonstrated ventricular preexcitation during sinus rhythm. All chronic cases demonstrated resumption of atrioventricular conduction, but these required atrial pacing. There was no gross or histopathologic evidence of toxicity. Ex vivo studies demonstrated contact impedance significantly lower than platinum iridium. CONCLUSIONS: Here, we show that in sheep, CNTfs sewn across epicardial scar acutely improve conduction. In addition, CNTf maintain conduction for 1 month after atrioventricular nodal ablation in the absence of inflammatory or toxic responses in rats but only in the paced condition. The CNTf/myocardial interface has such low impedance that CNTf can facilitate local, downstream myocardial activation. CNTf are conductive, biocompatible materials that restore electrical conduction in diseased myocardium, offering potential long-term restorative solutions in pathologies interrupting efficient electrical transduction in electrically excitable tissues.

        "Neurophysiological and Interpersonal Correlates of Emotional Face Processing in Alcohol Use Disorder. BACKGROUND: A growing literature suggests deficient emotional facial expression (EFE) processing among recently abstinent individuals with alcohol use disorders (AUDs). Further investigation is needed to clarify valence-related discrepancies and elucidate neural and psychosocial correlates. We examined neurobehavioral indices of EFE processing and interpersonal problems in treatment seekers with AUDs and healthy community controls (CCs). METHODS: Thirty-four individuals with AUDs and 39 CCs completed an emotion judgment task (EJT), requiring discrimination between happy, angry, and sad EFEs. A second task requiring discrimination of male and female faces with neutral expressions served as the control task (i.e., sex judgment task, SJT). Neurophysiological (i.e., N170 and P3) and behavioral measures were analyzed using generalized linear mixed models (GLMM). Interpersonal problems were assessed with the Inventory of Interpersonal Problems-64 (IIP-64). The relationship of IIP-64 and EJT performance was investigated via within-group correlations. RESULTS: Analysis of the SJT revealed no group differences in behavioral measures, N170 amplitude, or P3 latency. P3 amplitudes, however, were significantly lower in the AUD group. For the EJT, initial observations of group differences in P3 amplitude were accounted for by differences in the control task. Behavioral analyses indicated that the AUD group was significantly less accurate than the CC group. Hypothesis-driven analyses using GLMM-estimated group differences indicated that anger processing was affected to a greater degree than were other emotions. Significant EJT/IIP-64 correlations were observed for anger processing within the AUD group and were confined to IIP-64 subscales with relatively high ratings on the affiliation dimension. CONCLUSIONS: Findings provide partial support for an emotion-specific processing deficit in persons with AUDs. Anger processing was more robustly affected than other emotions and was associated with interpersonal problems characterized by being overly needy, nonassertive, and overly accommodating. Results extend prior reports and reinforce the need for comprehensive study of emotion processing and its real-world implications. ",
        "Cephamycins inhibit pathogen sporulation and effectively treat recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection. Spore-forming bacteria encompass a diverse range of genera and species, including important human and animal pathogens, and food contaminants. Clostridioides difficile is one such bacterium and is a global health threat because it is the leading cause of antibiotic-associated diarrhoea in hospitals. A crucial mediator of C. difficile disease initiation, dissemination and re-infection is the formation of spores that are resistant to current therapeutics, which do not target sporulation. Here, we show that cephamycin antibiotics inhibit C. difficile sporulation by targeting spore-specific penicillin-binding proteins. Using a mouse disease model, we show that combined treatment with the current standard-of-care antibiotic, vancomycin, and a cephamycin prevents disease recurrence. Cephamycins were found to have broad applicability as an anti-sporulation strategy, as they inhibited sporulation in other spore-forming pathogens, including the food contaminant Bacillus cereus. This study could directly and immediately affect treatment of C. difficile infection and advance drug development to control other important spore-forming bacteria that are problematic in the food industry (B. cereus), are potential bioterrorism agents (Bacillus anthracis) and cause other animal and human infections.

        "Lower Urinary Tract Infections: Management, Outcomes and Risk Factors for Antibiotic Re-prescription in Primary Care. Background: Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are major drivers of antibiotic prescribing in primary care. Inappropriate antibiotic prescribing for UTIs likely drives antibiotic resistance. We aimed to describe current investigation and antibiotic treatment to examine opportunities for improved antimicrobial stewardship. Methods: We identified a cohort of all patients with lower UTI diagnosis between 2011 and 2015 in the 390 primary care practices contributing data to ResearchOne in England. We examined investigation, antibiotic treatment and antibiotic re-prescription within 28\u202fdays according to guideline-defined patient groups. We assessed risk factors for re-prescription using mixed-effect logistic regression. Findings: In total, 494,675 UTIs were diagnosed in 300,354 patients. Median age was 54\u202fyears, and 83.3% were women. Same-day antibiotic was prescribed for 85.7% of UTIs; 56.8% were treated with trimethoprim, and urine sampling was undertaken in 25.0%. The antibiotic re-prescription rate was low (17,430, 4.1%) and increased slightly over time in men (from 5.2% in 2011 to 6.2% in 2015). Overall, 21.1% of pre-prescription were for the same antibiotic. The percentage of adults with recurrent UTIs ranged from 1.0% in 18-64\u202fyear-old men to 2.6% in women \u2265\u00a065\u202fyears. The risk of antibiotic re-prescription increased with age, calendar year, recent antibiotic prescribing and treatment with antibiotic other than trimethoprim or nitrofurantoin. Interpretation: Most patients diagnosed with lower UTI in primary care receive same-day empirical antibiotics with little diversity in choice of agent. The antibiotic re-prescription rate is low. Microbiological investigation and re-prescription of the same antibiotic given for the initial episode happened in one quarter of UTIs. Funding: UK National Health Service Improvement. ",
        "Identification of murine gammaherpesvirus 68 miRNA-mRNA hybrids reveals miRNA target conservation among gammaherpesviruses including host translation and protein modification machinery. Gammaherpesviruses, including the human pathogens Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV), establish lifelong latent infection in B cells and are associated with a variety of tumors. In addition to protein coding genes, these viruses encode numerous microRNAs (miRNAs) within their genomes. While putative host targets of EBV and KSHV miRNAs have been previously identified, the specific functions of these miRNAs during in vivo infection are largely unknown. Murine gammaherpesvirus 68 (MHV68) is a natural pathogen of rodents that is genetically related to both EBV and KSHV, and thus serves as an excellent model for the study of EBV and KSHV genetic elements such as miRNAs in the context of infection and disease. However, the specific targets of MHV68 miRNAs remain completely unknown. Using a technique known as qCLASH (quick crosslinking, ligation, and sequencing of hybrids), we have now identified thousands of Ago-associated, direct miRNA-mRNA interactions during lytic infection, latent infection and reactivation from latency. Validating this approach, detailed molecular analyses of specific interactions demonstrated repression of numerous host mRNA targets of MHV68 miRNAs, including Arid1a, Ctsl, Ifitm3 and Phc3. Notably, of the 1,505 MHV68 miRNA-host mRNA targets identified in B cells, 86% were shared with either EBV or KSHV, and 64% were shared among all three viruses, demonstrating significant conservation of gammaherpesvirus miRNA targeting. Pathway analysis of MHV68 miRNA targets further revealed enrichment of cellular pathways involved in protein synthesis and protein modification, including eIF2 Signaling, mTOR signaling and protein ubiquitination, pathways also enriched for targets of EBV and KSHV miRNAs. These findings provide substantial new information about specific targets of MHV68 miRNAs and shed important light on likely conserved functions of gammaherpesvirus miRNAs. ",
        "Blood-Brain Barrier Dysfunction in a 3D In Vitro Model of Alzheimer's Disease. Harmful materials in the blood are prevented from entering the healthy brain by a highly selective blood-brain barrier (BBB), and impairment of barrier function has been associated with a variety of neurological diseases. In Alzheimer's disease (AD), BBB breakdown has been shown to occur even before cognitive decline and brain pathology. To investigate the role of the cerebral vasculature in AD, a physiologically relevant 3D human neural cell culture microfluidic model is developed having a brain endothelial cell monolayer with a BBB-like phenotype. This model is shown to recapitulate several key aspects of BBB dysfunction observed in AD patients: increased BBB permeability, decreased expression of claudin-1, claudin-5, and VE-cadherin, increased expression of matrix-metalloproteinase-2 and reactive oxygen species, and deposition of \u03b2-amyloid (A\u03b2) peptides at the vascular endothelium. Thus, it provides a well-controlled platform for investigating BBB function as well as for screening of new drugs that need to pass the BBB to gain access to neural tissues. ",
        "Are Aerobic Programs Similar in Design to Cardiac Rehabilitation Beneficial for Survivors of Stroke? A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis. Background Survivors of stroke face movement disability and increased cardiovascular disease and stroke risk. Treatment includes rehabilitation focused on functional movement with less emphasis on aerobic capacity. After rehabilitation, survivors of stroke must self-manage activity with limited appropriate community programs. Lack of structured activity contributes to sedentary behavior. The objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to review aerobic programs for stroke survivors similar in activity and dosage to cardiac rehabilitation programs to determine their efficacy for improving aerobic and walking capacity. Methods and Results Preferred Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were used to review 5 databases. Group interventions for survivors of stroke with a primary aerobic component and dosage from 18 to 36 visits over 8 to 18\u00a0weeks (matching cardiac rehabilitation requirements in the United States) were included. The 6-minute walk test, maximal oxygen consumption (VO2) peak, and walking speed were included as measures of aerobic capacity. Summary effect sizes and outcome measure mean differences were calculated for preintervention to postintervention, and summary effect sizes were calculated for preintervention to follow-up. Activity type and initial 6-minute walk test moderator analyses were performed. Nineteen studies with 23 eligible groups were selected. Survivors of stroke improved their composite aerobic capacity with an effect size of 0.38 (95% CI, 0.27-0.49). Studies including 6-minute walk test demonstrated a pooled difference in means of 53.3\u00a0m (95% CI, 36.8-69.8\u00a0m). Follow-up data were inconclusive. Conclusions Survivors of stroke benefit from aerobic programs with similar dosing to cardiac rehabilitation in the United States. The potential integration into existing programs could expand the community exercise options. ",
        "cindr, the Drosophila Homolog of the CD2AP Alzheimer's Disease Risk Gene, Is Required for Synaptic Transmission and Proteostasis. The Alzheimer's disease (AD) susceptibility gene, CD2-associated protein (CD2AP), encodes an actin binding adaptor protein, but its function in the nervous system is largely unknown. Loss of the Drosophila ortholog cindr enhances neurotoxicity of human Tau, which forms neurofibrillary tangle pathology in AD. We show that Cindr is expressed in neurons and present at synaptic terminals. cindr mutants show impairments in synapse maturation and both synaptic vesicle recycling and release. Cindr associates and genetically interacts with 14-3-3\u03b6, regulates the ubiquitin-proteasome system, and affects turnover of Synapsin and the plasma membrane calcium ATPase (PMCA). Loss of cindr elevates PMCA levels and reduces cytosolic calcium. Studies of Cd2ap null mice support a conserved role in synaptic proteostasis, and CD2AP protein levels are inversely related to Synapsin abundance in human postmortem brains. Our results reveal CD2AP neuronal requirements with relevance to AD susceptibility, including for proteostasis, calcium handling, and synaptic structure and function. ",
        "Superresolution architecture of cornerstone focal adhesions in human pluripotent stem cells. While it is clear that key transcriptional programmes are important for maintaining pluripotency, the requirement for cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix remains poorly defined. Human pluripotent stem cells\u00a0(hPSCs) form colonies encircled by an actin ring and large stable cornerstone focal adhesions (FA). Using superresolution two-colour interferometric photo-activated localisation microscopy, we examine the three-dimensional architecture of cornerstone adhesions and report vertical lamination of FA proteins with three main structural features distinct from previously studied focal adhesions: 1) integrin \u03b25 and talin are present at high density, at the edges of cornerstone FA, adjacent to a vertical kank-rich protein wall, 2) vinculin localises higher than previously reported, displaying a head-above-tail orientation, and 3) surprisingly, actin and \u03b1-actinin are present in two discrete z-layers. Finally, we report that depletion of kanks diminishes FA patterning, and actin organisation within the colony, indicating a role for kanks in hPSC colony architecture. ",
        "Pairing vagus nerve stimulation with tones drives plasticity across the auditory pathway. Previous studies have demonstrated that pairing vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) with sounds can enhance the primary auditory cortex (A1) response to the paired sound. The neural response to sounds following VNS-sound pairing in other subcortical and cortical auditory fields has not been documented. We predicted that VNS-tone pairing would increase neural responses to the paired tone frequency across the auditory pathway. In this study, we paired VNS with the presentation of a 9-kHz tone 300 times a day for 20 days. We recorded neural responses to tones from 2,950 sites in the inferior colliculus (IC), A1, anterior auditory field (AAF), and posterior auditory field (PAF) 24 h after the last pairing session in anesthetized rats. We found that VNS-tone pairing increased the percentage of IC, A1, AAF, and PAF that responds to the paired tone frequency. Across all tested auditory fields, the response strength to tones was strengthened in VNS-tone paired rats compared with control rats. VNS-tone pairing reduced spontaneous activity, frequency selectivity, and response threshold across the auditory pathway. This is the first study to document both cortical and subcortical plasticity following VNS-sound pairing. Our findings suggest that VNS paired with sound presentation is an effective method to enhance auditory processing.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Previous studies have reported primary auditory cortex plasticity following vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) paired with a sound. This study extends previous findings by documenting that fields across the auditory pathway are altered by VNS-tone pairing. VNS-tone pairing increases the percentage of each field that responds to the paired tone frequency. This is the first study to document both cortical and subcortical plasticity following VNS-sound pairing. ",
        "Nipah and Hendra Virus Glycoproteins Induce Comparable Homologous but Distinct Heterologous Fusion Phenotypes. Nipah and Hendra viruses (NiV and HeV) exhibit high lethality in humans and are biosafety level 4 (BSL-4) paramyxoviruses in the growing genus Henipavirus The attachment (G) and fusion (F) envelope glycoproteins are both required for viral entry into cells and for cell-cell fusion, which is pathognomonic of henipaviral infections. Here, we compared the fusogenic capacities between homologous and heterologous pairs of NiV and HeV glycoproteins. Importantly, to accurately measure their fusogenic capacities, as these depend on glycoprotein cell surface expression (CSE) levels, we inserted identical extracellular tags to both fusion (FLAG tags) or both attachment (hemagglutinin [HA] tags) glycoproteins. Importantly, these tags were placed in extracellular sites where they did not affect glycoprotein expression or function. NiV and HeV glycoproteins induced comparable levels of homologous HEK293T cell-cell fusion. Surprisingly, however, while the heterologous NiV F/HeV G (NF/HG) combination yielded a hypofusogenic phenotype, the heterologous HeV F/NiV G (HF/NG) combination yielded a hyperfusogenic phenotype. Pseudotyped viral entry levels primarily corroborated the fusogenic phenotypes of the glycoprotein pairs analyzed. Furthermore, we constructed G and F chimeras that allowed us to map the overall regions in G and F that contributed to these hyperfusogenic or hypofusogenic phenotypes. Importantly, the fusogenic phenotypes of the glycoprotein combinations negatively correlated with the avidities of F-G interactions, supporting the F/G dissociation model of henipavirus-induced membrane fusion, even in the context of heterologous glycoprotein pairs.IMPORTANCE The NiV and HeV henipaviruses are BSL-4 pathogens transmitted from bats. NiV and HeV often lead to human death and animal diseases. The formation of multinucleated cells (syncytia) is a hallmark of henipaviral infections and is caused by fusion of cells coordinated by interactions of the viral attachment (G) and fusion (F) glycoproteins. We found via various assays that viral entry and syncytium formation depend on the viral origin of the glycoproteins, with HeV F and NiV G promoting higher membrane fusion levels than their counterparts. This is important knowledge, since both viruses use the same bat vector species and potential coinfections of these or subsequent hosts may alter the outcome of disease. ",
        "New developments in our understanding of vitamin metabolism, action and treatment. Although vitamin D has been reported to have pleiotropic effects including effects on the immune system and on cancer progression, the principal action of vitamin D is the maintenance of calcium and phosphate homeostasis. The importance of vitamin D in this process is emphasized by the consequences of vitamin D deficiency which includes rickets in children and osteomalacia in adults. Vitamin D deficiency has also been reported to increase the risk of falls and osteoporotic fractures. Although vitamin D fortification of foods (including dairy products) has contributed to a marked decrease in rickets in the Western world, vitamin D deficiency in children and adults is still prevalent world-wide. This review summarizes new developments in our understanding of vitamin D endocrine system and addresses clinical syndromes related to abnormalities in vitamin D metabolism and action. In addition, the current understanding of the evaluation of vitamin D deficiency and sufficiency and recommendations for achieving vitamin D sufficiency are discussed. ",
        "It Takes an E-Village: Supporting African American Mothers in Sustaining Breastfeeding Through Facebook Communities. BACKGROUND: Lack of breastfeeding support is a common barrier reported by African American mothers, whose breastfeeding rates remain significantly below the national average. Despite mothers' reported use of social network sites to access support on topics relating to child rearing, few studies have examined their use to exchange breastfeeding support. RESEARCH AIMS: To describe (1) the experiences of African American mothers who participate in breastfeeding support groups on Facebook and (2) the breastfeeding beliefs, practices, and outcomes for this population of mothers. METHODS: This was a prospective, cross-sectional qualitative study with an online focus group design. The study was guided by Black Feminist Thought and an integrated model of behavior prediction. Four online focus groups (N = 22) were conducted using video conferencing during September 2017 with African American mothers who were participating in breastfeeding support groups on Facebook. RESULTS: Thematic analysis was used to develop four themes and two subthemes, including creating a community for Black mothers, online interactions and levels of engagement, advantages of participating in online support groups, critiques of online support groups, empowerment of self and others, and shifts in breastfeeding perceptions and decisions. Among participants in this study, positive imagery of African American breastfeeding mothers and ongoing support from women with shared experiences improved confidence with public breastfeeding and prolonged goals for breastfeeding duration. CONCLUSION: Receiving peer support within Facebook communities may positively influence breastfeeding norms and confidence in breastfeeding, help mothers to overcome breastfeeding challenges, and ultimately extend intended breastfeeding duration.

Objective: To evaluate the association of intensive blood pressure treatment with cerebral white matter lesion and brain volumes. Design, Setting, and Participants: A substudy of a multicenter randomized clinical trial of hypertensive adults 50 years or older without a history of diabetes or stroke at 27 sites in the United States. Randomization began on November 8, 2010. The overall trial was stopped early because of benefit for its primary outcome (a composite of cardiovascular events) and all-cause mortality on August 20, 2015. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed on a subset of participants at baseline (n\u2009=\u2009670) and at 4 years of follow-up (n\u2009=\u2009449); final follow-up date was July 1, 2016. Interventions: Participants were randomized to a systolic blood pressure (SBP) goal of either less than 120 mm Hg (intensive treatment, n\u2009=\u2009355) or less than 140 mm Hg (standard treatment, n\u2009=\u2009315). Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was change in total white matter lesion volume from baseline. Change in total brain volume was a secondary outcome. Results: Among 670 recruited patients who had baseline MRI (mean age, 67.3 [SD, 8.2] years; 40.4% women), 449 (67.0%) completed the follow-up MRI at a median of 3.97 years after randomization, after a median intervention period of 3.40 years. In the intensive treatment group, based on a robust linear mixed model, mean white matter lesion volume increased from 4.57 to 5.49 cm3 (difference, 0.92 cm3 [95% CI, 0.69 to 1.14]) vs an increase from 4.40 to 5.85 cm3 (difference, 1.45 cm3 [95% CI, 1.21 to 1.70]) in the standard treatment group (between-group difference in change, -0.54 cm3 [95% CI, -0.87 to -0.20]). Mean total brain volume decreased from 1134.5 to 1104.0 cm3 (difference, -30.6 cm3 [95% CI, -32.3 to -28.8]) in the intensive treatment group vs a decrease from 1134.0 to 1107.1 cm3 (difference, -26.9 cm3 [95% CI, 24.8 to 28.8]) in the standard treatment group (between-group difference in change, -3.7 cm3 [95% CI, -6.3 to -1.1]). Conclusions and Relevance: Among hypertensive adults, targeting an SBP of less than 120 mm Hg, compared with less than 140 mm Hg, was significantly associated with a smaller increase in cerebral white matter lesion volume and a greater decrease in total brain volume, although the differences were small.

        "24-Hour Movement Behaviors and Impulsivity. BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to examine individual and concurrent associations between meeting the Canadian 24-Hour Movement Guidelines for Children and Youth (9-11 hours of sleep per night, \u22642 hours of recreational screen time (ST) per day, and at least 60 minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity per day) and dimensions of impulsivity. METHODS: Data from this cross-sectional observational study were part of the first annual curated release of the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study. Participants included 4524 children between the ages of 8 and 11 years. RESULTS: In analyses, it was shown that adherence to individual movement behavior recommendations as well as combinations of adherence to movement behavior recommendations were associated with each dimension of impulsivity. Meeting all 3 movement behavior recommendations was associated with lower positive urgency (95% confidence interval [CI]: -0.12 to -0.05), negative urgency (95% CI: -0.04 to -0.08), Behavioral Inhibition System (95% CI: -0.08 to -0.01), greater perseverance (95% CI: 0.09 to 0.15), and better scores on delay-discounting (95% CI: 0.57 to 0.94). Meeting the ST and sleep recommendations was associated with less impulsive behaviors on all dimensions of impulsivity: negative urgency (95% CI: -0.20 to -0.10), positive urgency (95% CI: -0.16 to -0.08), perseverance (95% CI: 0.06 to 0.15), Behavioral Inhibition System (95% CI: -0.15 to -0.03), Behavioral Activation System (BAS) reward responsiveness (95% CI: -0.04 to -0.05), BAS drive (95% CI: -0.14 to -0.06), BAS fun-seeking (95% CI: -0.15 to -0.17), and delay-discounting task (95% CI: 0.68 to 0.97). CONCLUSIONS: Findings support efforts to determine if limiting recreational ST while promoting adequate sleep enhances the treatment and prevention of impulsivity-related disorders. ",
        "Serum Endocannabinoid and Mood Changes after Exercise in Major Depressive Disorder. The endocannabinoid (eCB) system is implicated in the pathophysiology of depression and is responsive to acute exercise in healthy adults. We aimed to describe acute changes in serum eCB across a prescribed moderate (MOD) and a self-selected/preferred (PREF) intensity exercise session in women with major depressive disorder (MDD) and determine relationships between changes in eCB and mood states. Women with MDD (n = 17) exercised in separate sessions for 20 min on a cycle ergometer at both MOD or PREF in a within-subjects design. Blood was drawn before and within 10 min after exercise. Serum concentrations of eCB (anandamide [AEA], 2-arachidonoylglycerol) and related lipids (palmitoylethanolamine, oleoylethanolamine, 2-oleoylglycerol) were quantified using stable isotope-dilution, liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry. The profile of mood states and state-trait anxiety inventory (state only) were completed before, 10 min and 30 min postexercise. Significant elevations in AEA (P = 0.013) and oleoylethanolamine (P = 0.024) occurred for MOD (moderate effect sizes: Cohen's d = 0.58 and 0.41, respectively). Significant (P < 0.05) moderate negative associations existed between changes in AEA and mood states for MOD at 10 min (depression, confusion, fatigue, total mood disturbance [TMD] and state anxiety) and 30 min postexercise (confusion, TMD and state anxiety). Significant (P < 0.05) moderate negative associations existed between 2-arachidonoylglycerol and mood states at 10 min (depression and confusion) and 30 min postexercise (confusion and TMD). Changes in eCB or related lipids or eCB-mood relationships were not found for PREF. Given the broad, moderate-strength relationships between improvements in mood states and eCB increases after MOD, it is plausible that the eCB system contributes to the mood-enhancing effects of prescribed acute exercise in MDD. Alternative mechanisms are likely involved in the positive mood state effects of preferred exercise. ",
        "Dose Escalation Trial of the Wee1 Inhibitor Adavosertib (AZD1775) in Combination With Gemcitabine and Radiation for Patients With Locally Advanced Pancreatic Cancer. PURPOSE: AZD1775 (adavosertib) is an inhibitor of the Wee1 kinase. In this study, we built on our preclinical studies to evaluate the safety and efficacy of AZD1775 in combination with gemcitabine and radiation in patients with newly diagnosed locally advanced pancreatic cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty-four patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer were enrolled with the intention to receive four 21-day cycles of gemcitabine (1,000 mg/m2 days 1 and 8) with AZD1775 (once daily on days 1, 2, 8, and 9). Cycles 2 and 3 were administered concurrently with radiation, and cycles 5 to 8 were optional. AZD1775 was dose escalated using a time-to-event continual reassessment method on the basis of the rate of dose-limiting toxicities within the first 15 weeks of therapy. The primary objective was to determine the maximum tolerated dose of AZD1775 given in conjunction with gemcitabine and radiation. Secondary objectives were to estimate overall and progression-free survival and determine pharmacodynamic activity of AZD1775 in surrogate tissues. RESULTS: The recommended phase II dose of AZD1775 was 150 mg/d. Eight patients (24%) experienced a dose-limiting toxicity, most commonly anorexia, nausea, or fatigue. The median overall survival for all patients was 21.7 months (90% CI, 16.7 to 24.8 months), and the median progression-free survival was 9.4 months (90% CI, 8.0 to 9.9 months). Hair follicle biopsy samples demonstrated evidence of Wee1 inhibition with decreased phosphorylation of cyclin-dependent kinase 1 staining by immunohistochemistry after AZD1775 administration at the recommended phase II dose. CONCLUSION: AZD1775 in combination with gemcitabine and radiation therapy was well tolerated at a dose that produced target engagement in a surrogate tissue. The overall survival is substantially higher than prior results combining gemcitabine with radiation therapy and warrants additional investigation. ",
        "The Generation of Time in the Hippocampal Memory System. We propose that ramping time cells in the lateral entorhinal cortex can be produced by synaptic adaptation and demonstrate this in an integrate-and-fire attractor\u00a0network model. We propose that competitive networks in the hippocampal system can convert these entorhinal ramping cells into hippocampal time cells and demonstrate this in a competitive network. We propose that this conversion is necessary to provide orthogonal hippocampal time representations to encode the temporal sequence of events in hippocampal episodic memory, and we support that with analytic arguments. We demonstrate that this processing can produce hippocampal neuronal ensembles that not only show replay of the sequence later on, but can also do this in reverse order in reverse replay. This research addresses a major issue in neuroscience: the mechanisms by which time is encoded in the brain and how the time representations are then useful in the hippocampal memory of events and their order.

        "Chemical Induction of Aminoglycoside Uptake Overcomes Antibiotic Tolerance and Resistance in Staphylococcus aureus. Aminoglycoside antibiotics require proton motive force (PMF) for bacterial internalization. In non-respiring populations, PMF drops below the level required for drug influx, limiting the utility of aminoglycosides against strict and facultative anaerobes. We recently demonstrated that rhamnolipids (RLs), biosurfactant molecules produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, potentiate aminoglycoside activity against Staphylococcus aureus. Here, we demonstrate that RLs induce PMF-independent aminoglycoside uptake to restore sensitivity to otherwise tolerant persister, biofilm, small colony variant, and anaerobic populations of S. aureus. Furthermore, we show that this approach represses the rise of resistance, restores sensitivity to highly resistant clinical isolates, and is effective against other Gram-positive pathogens. Finally, while other membrane-acting agents can synergize with aminoglycosides, induction of PMF-independent uptake is uncommon, and distinct to RLs among several compounds tested. In all, small-molecule induction of PMF-independent aminoglycoside uptake circumvents phenotypic tolerance, overcomes genotypic resistance, and expands the utility of aminoglycosides against intrinsically recalcitrant bacterial populations.

        "Crossing the blood-brain-barrier with nanoligand drug carriers self-assembled from a phage display peptide. The filamentous bacteriophage fd bind a cell target with exquisite specificity through its few copies of display peptides, whereas nanoparticles functionalized with hundreds to thousands of synthetically generated phage display peptides exhibit variable and often-weak target binding. We hypothesise that some phage peptides in a hierarchical structure rather than in monomeric form recognise and bind their target. Here we show hierarchial forms of a brain-specific phage-derived peptide (herein as NanoLigand Carriers, NLCs) target cerebral endothelial cells through transferrin receptor and the receptor for advanced glycation-end products, cross the blood-brain-barrier and reach neurons and microglial cells. Through intravenous delivery of NLC-\u03b2-secretase 1 (BACE1) siRNA complexes we show effective BACE1 down-regulation in the brain without toxicity and inflammation. Therefore, NLCs act as safe multifunctional nanocarriers, overcome efficacy and specificity limitations in active targeting with nanoparticles bearing phage display peptides or cell-penetrating peptides and expand the receptor repertoire of the display peptide.

        "Molecular features of lipoprotein CD0873: A potential vaccine against the human pathogen Clostridioides difficile. Clostridioides difficile is the primary cause of antibiotic-associated diarrhea and colitis, a healthcare-associated intestinal disease resulting in a significant fatality rate. Colonization of the gut is critical for C. difficile pathogenesis. The bacterial molecules essential for efficient colonization therefore offer great potential as vaccine candidates. Here we present findings demonstrating that the C. difficile immunogenic lipoprotein CD0873 plays a critical role in pathogen success in vivo We found that in a dixenic colonization model, a CD0873-positive strain of C. difficile significantly outcompeted a CD0873-negative strain. Immunization of mice with recombinant CD0873 prevented long-term gut colonization and was correlated with a strong secretory IgA immune response. We further present high-resolution crystal structures of CD0873, at 1.35-2.50 \u00c5 resolutions, offering a first view of the ligand-binding pocket of CD0873 and provide evidence that this lipoprotein adhesin is part of a tyrosine import system, an amino acid key in C. difficile infection. These findings suggest that CD0873 could serve as an effective component in a vaccine against C. difficile. ",
        "Physical Activity and Risk of Postoperative Delirium. BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE: Regular physical activity (PA) has been associated with improved cognitive function, but its effect on postoperative delirium (POD) has not been established. Our objectives were to determine the effect of baseline PA on the incidence of POD in older patients undergoing elective orthopedic surgery and to determine whether these effects were independent of cognitive reserve. We hypothesize that PA protects against POD by bolstering physiologic reserve needed to withstand the stressors of surgery. DESIGN: Secondary analysis of a prospective, single-center, cohort study. SETTING: Urban academic hospital. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 132 nondemented, English-speaking adults older than 60\u2009years undergoing elective orthopedic surgery. MEASUREMENTS: Subjects were screened for POD and delirium severity using the Confusion Assessment Method and the Memorial Delirium Assessment Scale. Baseline cognitive activities and PAs were assessed with a validated Leisure Activity Scale. Regular PA was categorized as 6 to 7 days per week. The association of regular PA with incidence of POD was assessed using multivariable logistic regression, adjusting for age, sex, Charlson Comorbidity Index, cognitive reserve, and cognitive function. Linear regression was used to assess the association of delirium severity with regular PA. RESULTS: Of 132 patients, 41 (31.1%) developed POD. Regular PA was associated with a 74% lower odds of developing POD (odds ratio [OR] = 0.26; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.08-0.82). There was no significant interaction between PA and cognitive reserve (P =\u2009.70). Of 85 women, 25 (29.4%), and of 47 men, 16 (34.0%) developed POD. In stratified analysis, women who engaged in regular PA had dramatically lower odds of POD (OR = 0.08; 95% CI = 0.01-0.63) compared with men (OR = 0.93; 95% CI = 0.18-4.97). CONCLUSIONS: Regular PA is associated with decreased incidence of POD, especially among women. Future studies should address the basis of sex differences in PA benefits on delirium.

        "Enhanced Primary Tumor Penetration Facilitates Nanoparticle Draining into Lymph Nodes after Systemic Injection for Tumor Metastasis Inhibition. Lymph nodes (LNs) are normally the primary site of tumor metastasis, and effective delivery of chemotherapeutics into LNs through systemic administration is critical for metastatic cancer treatment. Here, we uncovered that improved perfusion in a primary tumor facilitates nanoparticle translocation to LNs for inhibiting tumor metastasis. On the basis of our finding that an iCluster platform, which undergoes size reduction from \u223c100 nm to \u223c5 nm at the tumor site, markedly improved particle perfusion in the interstitium of the primary tumor, we further revealed in the current study that such tumor-specific size transition promoted particle intravasation into tumor lymphatics and migration into LNs. Quantitative analysis indicated that the drug deposition in LNs after iCluster treatment was significantly higher in the presence of a primary tumor in comparison with that after primary tumor resection. Early intervention of metastatic 4T1 tumors with iCluster chemotherapy and subsequent surgical resection of the primary tumor resulted in significantly extending animal survival, with 4 out of the 10 mice remaining completely tumor-free for 110 days. Additionally, in the more clinical relevant late metastatic model, iCluster inhibited the metastatic colonies to the lungs and extended animal survival time. This finding provides insights into the design of more effective nanomedicines for treating metastatic cancer. ",
        "Association of Gluten Intake During the First 5 Years of Life With Incidence of Celiac Disease Autoimmunity and Celiac Disease Among Children at Increased Risk. Importance: High gluten intake during childhood may confer risk of celiac disease. Objectives: To investigate if the amount of gluten intake is associated with celiac disease autoimmunity and celiac disease in genetically at-risk children. Design, Setting, and Participants: The participants in The Environmental Determinants of Diabetes in the Young (TEDDY), a prospective observational birth cohort study designed to identify environmental triggers of type 1 diabetes and celiac disease, were followed up at 6 clinical centers in Finland, Germany, Sweden, and the United States. Between 2004 and 2010, 8676 newborns carrying HLA antigen genotypes associated with type 1 diabetes and celiac disease were enrolled. Screening for celiac disease with tissue transglutaminase autoantibodies was performed annually in 6757 children from the age of 2 years. Data on gluten intake were available in 6605 children (98%) by September 30, 2017. Exposures: Gluten intake was estimated from 3-day food records collected at ages 6, 9, and 12 months and biannually thereafter until the age of 5 years. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was celiac disease autoimmunity, defined as positive tissue transglutaminase autoantibodies found in 2 consecutive serum samples. The secondary outcome was celiac disease confirmed by intestinal biopsy or persistently high tissue transglutaminase autoantibody levels. Results: Of the 6605 children (49% females; median follow-up: 9.0 years [interquartile range, 8.0-10.0 years]), 1216 (18%) developed celiac disease autoimmunity and 447 (7%) developed celiac disease. The incidence for both outcomes peaked at the age of 2 to 3 years. Daily gluten intake was associated with higher risk of celiac disease autoimmunity for every 1-g/d increase in gluten consumption (hazard ratio [HR], 1.30 [95% CI, 1.22-1.38]; absolute risk by the age of 3 years if the reference amount of gluten was consumed, 28.1%; absolute risk if gluten intake was 1-g/d higher than the reference amount, 34.2%; absolute risk difference, 6.1% [95% CI, 4.5%-7.7%]). Daily gluten intake was associated with higher risk of celiac disease for every 1-g/d increase in gluten consumption (HR, 1.50 [95% CI, 1.35-1.66]; absolute risk by age of 3 years if the reference amount of gluten was consumed, 20.7%; absolute risk if gluten intake was 1-g/d higher than the reference amount, 27.9%; absolute risk difference, 7.2% [95% CI, 6.1%-8.3%]). Conclusions and Relevance: Higher gluten intake during the first 5 years of life was associated with increased risk of celiac disease autoimmunity and celiac disease among genetically predisposed children.

        "Precise detection of low-level somatic mutation in resected epilepsy brain tissue. Low-level somatic mutations have been shown to be the major genetic etiology of intractable epilepsy. The extents thereof, however, have yet to be systematically and accurately explored in a large cohort of resected epilepsy brain tissues. Moreover, clinically useful and precise analysis tools for detecting low-level somatic mutations from unmatched formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) brain samples, the most clinically relevant samples, are still lacking. In total, 446 tissues samples from 232 intractable epilepsy patients with various brain pathologies were analyzed using deep sequencing (average read depth, 1112x) of known epilepsy-related genes (up to 28 genes) followed by confirmatory site-specific amplicon sequencing. Pathogenic mutations were discovered in 31.9% (74 of 232) of the resected epilepsy brain tissues and were recurrently found in only eight major focal epilepsy genes, including AKT3, DEPDC5, MTOR, PIK3CA, TSC1, TSC2, SCL35A2, and BRAF. Somatic mutations, two-hit mutations, and germline mutations accounted for 22.0% (51), 0.9% (2), and 9.1% (21) of the patients with intractable epilepsy, respectively. The majority of pathogenic somatic mutations (62.3%, 33 of 53) had a low variant allelic frequency of less than 5%. The use of deep sequencing replicates in the eight major focal epilepsy genes robustly increased PPVs to 50-100% and sensitivities to 71-100%. In an independent FCDII cohort of only unmatched FFPE brain tissues, deep sequencing replicates in the eight major focal epilepsy genes identified pathogenic somatic mutations in 33.3% (5 of 15) of FCDII individuals (similar to the genetic detecting rate in the entire FCDII cohort) without any false-positive calls. Deep sequencing replicates of major focal epilepsy genes in unmatched FFPE brain tissues can be used to accurately and efficiently detect low-level somatic mutations, thereby improving overall patient care by enriching genetic counseling and informing treatment decisions.

        "Dorsal Amygdala Neurotrophin-3 Decreases Anxious Temperament in Primates. BACKGROUND: An early-life anxious temperament (AT) is a risk factor for the development of anxiety, depression, and comorbid substance abuse. We validated a nonhuman primate model of early-life AT and identified the dorsal amygdala as a core component of AT's neural circuit. Here, we combine RNA sequencing, viral-vector gene manipulation, functional brain imaging, and behavioral phenotyping to uncover AT's molecular substrates. METHODS: In response to potential threat, AT and brain metabolism were assessed in 46 young rhesus monkeys. We identified AT-related transcripts using RNA-sequencing data from dorsal amygdala tissue (including central nucleus of the amygdala [Ce] and dorsal regions of the basal nucleus). Based on the results, we overexpressed the neurotrophin-3 gene, NTF3, in the dorsal amygdala using intraoperative magnetic resonance imaging-guided surgery (n\u00a0= 5 per group). RESULTS: This discovery-based approach identified AT-related alterations in the expression of well-established and novel genes, including an inverse association between NTRK3 expression and AT. NTRK3 is an interesting target because it is a relatively unexplored neurotrophic factor that modulates intracellular neuroplasticity pathways. Overexpression of the transcript for NTRK3's endogenous ligand, NTF3, in the dorsal amygdala resulted in reduced AT and altered function in AT's neural circuit. CONCLUSIONS: Together, these data implicate neurotrophin-3/NTRK3 signaling in the dorsal amygdala in mediating primate anxiety. More generally, this approach provides an important step toward understanding the molecular underpinnings of early-life AT and will be useful in guiding the development of treatments to prevent the development of stress-related psychopathology.

        "A conserved role of the insulin-like signaling pathway in diet-dependent uric acid pathologies in Drosophila melanogaster. Elevated uric acid (UA) is a key risk factor for many disorders, including metabolic syndrome, gout and kidney stones. Despite frequent occurrence of these disorders, the genetic pathways influencing UA metabolism and the association with disease remain poorly understood. In humans, elevated UA levels resulted from the loss of the of the urate oxidase (Uro) gene around 15 million years ago. Therefore, we established a Drosophila melanogaster model with reduced expression of the orthologous Uro gene to study the pathogenesis arising from elevated UA. Reduced Uro expression in Drosophila resulted in elevated UA levels, accumulation of concretions in the excretory system, and shortening of lifespan when reared on diets containing high levels of yeast extract. Furthermore, high levels of dietary purines, but not protein or sugar, were sufficient to produce the same effects of shortened lifespan and concretion formation in the Drosophila model. The insulin-like signaling (ILS) pathway has been shown to respond to changes in nutrient status in several species. We observed that genetic suppression of ILS genes reduced both UA levels and concretion load in flies fed high levels of yeast extract. Further support for the role of the ILS pathway in modulating UA metabolism stems from a human candidate gene study identifying SNPs in the ILS genes AKT2 and FOXO3 being associated with serum UA levels or gout. Additionally, inhibition of the NADPH oxidase (NOX) gene rescued the reduced lifespan and concretion phenotypes in Uro knockdown flies. Thus, components of the ILS pathway and the downstream protein NOX represent potential therapeutic targets for treating UA associated pathologies, including gout and kidney stones, as well as extending human healthspan.

        "Dysregulation of M segment gene expression contributes to influenza A virus host restriction. The M segment of the 2009 pandemic influenza A virus (IAV) has been implicated in its emergence into human populations. To elucidate the genetic contributions of the M segment to host adaptation, and the underlying mechanisms, we examined a panel of isogenic viruses that carry avian- or human-derived M segments. Avian, but not human, M segments restricted viral growth and transmission in mammalian model systems, and the restricted growth correlated with increased expression of M2 relative to M1. M2 overexpression was associated with intracellular accumulation of autophagosomes, which was alleviated by interference of the viral proton channel activity by amantadine treatment. As M1 and M2 are expressed from the M mRNA through alternative splicing, we separated synonymous and non-synonymous changes that differentiate human and avian M segments and found that dysregulation of gene expression leading to M2 overexpression diminished replication, irrespective of amino acid composition of M1 or M2. Moreover, in spite of efficient replication, virus possessing a human M segment that expressed avian M2 protein at low level did not transmit efficiently. We conclude that (i) determinants of transmission reside in the IAV M2 protein, and that (ii) control of M segment gene expression is a critical aspect of IAV host adaptation needed to prevent M2-mediated dysregulation of vesicular homeostasis.

        "Dissecting the heterogeneity of DENV vaccine-elicited cellular immunity using single-cell RNA sequencing and metabolic profiling. Generating effective and durable T cell immunity is a critical prerequisite for vaccination against dengue virus (DENV) and other viral diseases. However, understanding the molecular mechanisms of vaccine-elicited T cell immunity remains a critical knowledge gap in vaccinology. In this study, we utilize single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) and longitudinal TCR clonotype analysis to identify a unique transcriptional signature present in acutely\u00a0activated and clonally-expanded T cells that become committed to the memory repertoire. This effector/memory-associated transcriptional signature is dominated by a robust metabolic transcriptional program. Based on this transcriptional signature, we are able to define a set of markers that identify the most durable vaccine-reactive memory-precursor CD8+ T cells. This study illustrates the power of scRNAseq as an analytical tool to assess the molecular mechanisms of host control and vaccine modality in determining the magnitude, diversity and persistence of vaccine-elicited cell-mediated immunity.

        "Activation of Toll-like receptor 7/8 encoded by the X chromosome alters sperm motility and provides a novel simple technology for sexing sperm. In most mammals, the male to female sex ratio of offspring is about 50% because half of the sperm contain either the Y chromosome or X chromosome. In mice, the Y chromosome encodes fewer than 700 genes, whereas the X chromosome encodes over 3,000 genes. Although overall gene expression is lower in sperm than in somatic cells, transcription is activated selectively in round spermatids. By regulating the expression of specific genes, we hypothesized that the X chromosome might exert functional differences in sperm that are usually masked during fertilization. In this study, we found that Toll-like receptors 7/8 (TLR7/8) coding the X chromosome were expressed by approximately 50% of the round spermatids in testis and in approximately 50% of the epididymal sperm. Especially, TLR7 was localized to the tail, and TLR8 was localized to the midpiece. Ligand activation of TLR7/8 selectively suppressed the mobility of the X chromosome-bearing sperm (X-sperm) but not the Y-sperm without altering sperm viability or acrosome formation. The difference in sperm motility allowed for the separation of Y-sperm from X-sperm. Following in vitro fertilization using the ligand-selected high-mobility sperm, 90% of the embryos were XY male. Likewise, 83% of the pups obtained following embryo transfer were XY males. Conversely, the TLR7/8-activated, slow mobility sperm produced embryos and pups that were 81% XX females. Therefore, the functional differences between Y-sperm and X-sperm motility were revealed and related to different gene expression patterns, specifically TLR7/8 on X-sperm. ",
        "Prenatal exposure to opioid maintenance treatment and neonatal outcomes: Nationwide registry studies from the Czech Republic and Norway. There is lack of knowledge about the safety of treatment with methadone and buprenorphine as part of opioid maintenance treatment (OMT) during pregnancy. The purpose of this study was to examine neonatal outcomes concerning the use of OMT during pregnancy. We used nationwide registry linkages from the Czech Republic (2000-2014) and Norway (2004-2013). We compared prenatally OMT-exposed newborns with (a) newborns of women hospitalized with opioid use disorder during pregnancy in the Czech sample and (b) newborns with neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) in Norway. We performed multivariate linear and binary logistic regression exploring the associations between OMT and neonatal outcomes (growth parameters, gestational age, fetal death, small for gestational age, Apgar score, and NAS). Regression coefficients (b) and odds ratios (ORs) were estimated. The cohorts consisted of 333 Czech, and 235 Norwegian OMT-exposed newborns, and 106 and 294 newborns in the comparison groups, respectively. In both countries, the neonatal growth parameters were similar in the OMT and the comparison groups. In Norway, OMT exposure prolonged gestational age (adjusted b\u00a0=\u00a00.96\u00a0weeks, 95% confidence interval [CI] =0.39-1.53) while the odds of preterm birth and Apgar score at 5\u00a0minutes were lower than in the comparison group (adjusted OR\u00a0=\u00a00.35, 0.16-0.75 and aOR\u00a0=\u00a00.21, 0.06-0.78, respectively). Newborns of women in OMT had similar growth parameters as newborns of women with opioid use disorders who were not in OMT during pregnancy. Overall, our findings do not suggest that OMT results in worse neonatal outcomes. ",
        "Nutrient restriction causes reversible G2 arrest in Xenopus neural progenitors. Nutrient status affects brain development; however, the effects of nutrient availability on neural progenitor cell proliferation in vivo are poorly understood. Without food, Xenopus laevis tadpoles enter a period of stasis during which neural progenitor proliferation is drastically reduced, but resumes when food becomes available. Here, we investigate how neural progenitors halt cell division in response to nutrient restriction and subsequently re-enter the cell cycle upon feeding. We demonstrate that nutrient restriction causes neural progenitors to arrest in G2 of the cell cycle with increased DNA content, and that nutrient availability triggers progenitors to re-enter the cell cycle at M phase. Initiation of the nutrient restriction-induced G2 arrest is rapamycin insensitive, but cell cycle re-entry requires mTOR. Finally, we show that activation of insulin receptor signaling is sufficient to increase neural progenitor cell proliferation in the absence of food. A G2 arrest mechanism provides an adaptive strategy to control brain development in response to nutrient availability by triggering a synchronous burst of cell proliferation when nutrients become available. This may be a general cellular mechanism that allows developmental flexibility during times of limited resources. ",
        "Putting a stereotype to the test: The case of gender differences in multitasking costs in task-switching and dual-task situations. According to a popular stereotype, women are better at multitasking than men, but empirical evidence for gender differences in multitasking performance is mixed. Previous work has focused on specific aspects of multitasking or has not considered gender differences in abilities contributing to multitasking performance. We therefore tested gender differences (N = 96, 50% female) in sequential (i.e., task switching) and concurrent (i.e., dual tasking) multitasking, while controlling for possible gender differences in working memory, processing speed, spatial abilities, and fluid intelligence. Applying two standard experimental paradigms allowed us to test multitasking abilities across five different empirical indices (i.e., performance costs) for both reaction time (RT) and accuracy measures, respectively. Multitasking resulted in substantial performance costs across all experimental conditions without a single significant gender difference in any of these ten measures, even when controlling for gender differences in underlying cognitive abilities. Thus, our results do not confirm the widespread stereotype that women are better at multitasking than men at least in the popular sequential and concurrent multitasking settings used in the present study.

        "Coordinated circadian timing through the integration of local inputs in Arabidopsis thaliana. Individual plant cells have a genetic circuit, the circadian clock, that times key processes to the day-night cycle. These clocks are aligned to the day-night cycle by multiple environmental signals that vary across the plant. How does the plant integrate clock rhythms, both within and between organs, to ensure coordinated timing? To address this question, we examined the clock at the sub-tissue level across Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings under multiple environmental conditions and genetic backgrounds. Our results show that the clock runs at different speeds (periods) in each organ, which causes the clock to peak at different times across the plant in both constant environmental conditions and light-dark (LD) cycles. Closer examination reveals that spatial waves of clock gene expression propagate both within and between organs. Using a combination of modeling and experiment, we reveal that these spatial waves are the result of the period differences between organs and local coupling, rather than long-distance signaling. With further experiments we show that the endogenous period differences, and thus the spatial waves, can be generated by the organ specificity of inputs into the clock. We demonstrate this by modulating periods using light and metabolic signals, as well as with genetic perturbations. Our results reveal that plant clocks can be set locally by organ-specific inputs but coordinated globally via spatial waves of clock gene expression. ",
        "External auditory exostoses among western Eurasian late Middle and Late Pleistocene humans. External auditory exostoses (EAE) have been noted among the Neandertals and a few other Pleistocene humans, but until recently they have been discussed primary as minor pathological lesions with possible auditory consequences. An assessment of available western Eurasian late Middle and Late Pleistocene human temporal bones with sufficiently preserved auditory canals (n = 77) provides modest levels of EAE among late Middle Pleistocene archaic humans (\u224820%) and early modern humans (Middle Paleolithic: \u224825%; Early/Mid Upper Paleolithic: 20.8%; Late Upper Paleolithic: 9.5%). The Neandertals, however, exhibit an exceptionally high level of EAE (56.5%; 47.8% if two anomalous cases are considered normal). The levels of EAE for the early modern humans are well within recent human ranges of variation, frequencies which are low for equatorial inland and high latitude samples but occasionally higher elsewhere. The Early/Mid Upper Paleolithic frequency is nonetheless high for a high latitude sample under interpleniglacial conditions. Given the strong etiological and environmental associations of EAE development with exposure to cold water and/or damp wind chill, the high frequency of EAE among the Neandertals implies frequent aquatic resource exploitation, more frequent than the archeological and stable isotopic evidence for Middle Paleolithic/Neandertal littoral and freshwater resource foraging implies. As such, the Neandertal data parallel a similar pattern evident in eastern Eurasian archaic humans. Yet, factors in addition to cold water/wind exposure may well have contributed to their high EAE frequencies. ",
        "Virtual reality for management of pain in hospitalized patients: A randomized comparative effectiveness trial. OBJECTIVES: Therapeutic virtual reality (VR) has emerged as an effective, drug-free tool for pain management, but there is a lack of randomized, controlled data evaluating its effectiveness in hospitalized patients. We sought to measure the impact of on-demand VR versus \"health and wellness\" television programming for pain in hospitalized patients. METHODS: We performed a prospective, randomized, comparative effectiveness trial in hospitalized patients with an average pain score of \u22653 out of 10 points. Patients in the experimental group received a library of 21 VR experiences administered using the Samsung Gear Oculus headset; control patients viewed specialized television programming to promote health and wellness. Clinical staff followed usual care; study interventions were not protocolized. The primary outcome was patient-reported pain using a numeric rating scale, as recorded by nursing staff during usual care. Pre- and post-intervention pain scores were compared immediately after initial treatment and after 48- and 72-hours. RESULTS: There were 120 subjects (61 VR; 59 control). The mean within-subject difference in immediate pre- and post-intervention pain scores was larger in the VR group (-1.72 points; SD 3.56) than in the control group (-0.46 points; SD 3.01); this difference was significant in favor of VR (P < .04). When limited to the subgroup of patients with severe baseline pain (\u22657 points), the effect of VR was more pronounced vs. control (-3.04, SD 3.75 vs. -0.93, SD 2.16 points; P = .02). In regression analyses adjusting for pre-intervention pain, time, age, gender, and type of pain, VR yielded a .59 (P = .03) and .56 (P = .04) point incremental reduction in pain versus control during the 48- and 72-hour post-intervention periods, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: VR significantly reduces pain versus an active control condition in hospitalized patients. VR is most effective for severe pain. Future trials should evaluate standardized order sets that interpose VR as an early non-drug option for analgesia. ",
        "Evolution of Evidence and Guideline Recommendations for the Medical Management of Severe Traumatic Brain Injury. Brain Trauma Foundation (BTF) Guidelines for medical management of severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) have become a global standard for the treatment of TBI patients. We aim to explore the evolution of the guidelines for the management of severe TBI. We reviewed the four editions of the BTF guidelines published over the past 20 years. The 1996 and 2000 editions were merged because of minimal differences, and are referred to as the 1996 edition. We described changes in topics and recommendations over time, and analyzed predictors of survival of recommendations with logistical regression. The guidelines contained 27 recommendations on 18 topics in 2016, 35 recommendations on 15 topics in 2007, and 22 recommendations on 10 topics in 1996. Substantial delays were found between the search for evidence and the guideline publication, ranging from 18 to 34 months. The overall body of evidence comprised 189 studies on 18 topics in 2016, compared with 156 studies on 15 topics in 2007 and 180 studies on 10 topics in 1996. Over time, a total of 175 studies were discarded from the evidence base following more rigorous grading of evidence. A total of 15/23 (65%) of the 1996/2000 recommendations were discarded over time. Out of 12 new recommendations introduced in the 2007 edition, 8 (66%) were discarded in 2016. Survival of recommendations varied between 33% and 100% for level I recommendations and between 11% and 31% for level II and III recommendations. No predictors of survival of recommendations were found. Substantial delays exist between literature search and publication, and survival rate of TBI guideline recommendations is poor. These factors may adversely affect currency and adherence to guidelines. The TBI community should take responsibility for improving the quality of the evidence base and ensuring that the translation of the evidence into guidelines supports clinicians in daily clinical practice.

        "ERK Regulates HIF1\u03b1-Mediated Platinum Resistance by Directly Targeting PHD2 in Ovarian Cancer. PURPOSE: Up to 80% of patients with ovarian cancer develop platinum resistance over time to platinum-based chemotherapy. Increased HIF1\u03b1 level is an important mechanism governing platinum resistance in platinum-resistant ovarian cancer (PROC). However, the mechanism regulating HIF1\u03b1 stability in PROC remains largely unknown. Here, we elucidate the mechanism of HIF1\u03b1 stability regulation in PROC and explore therapeutic approaches to overcome cisplatin resistance in ovarian cancer. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We first used a quantitative high-throughput combinational screen (qHTCS) to identify novel drugs that could resensitize PROC cells to cisplatin. Next, we evaluated the combination efficacy of inhibitors of HIF1\u03b1 (YC-1), ERK (selumetinib), and TGF\u03b21 (SB431542) with platinum drugs by in vitro and in vivo experiments. Moreover, a novel TGF\u03b21/ERK/PHD2-mediated pathway regulating HIF1\u03b1 stability in PROC was discovered. RESULTS: YC-1 and selumetinib resensitized PROC cells to cisplatin. Next, the prolyl hydroxylase domain-containing protein 2 (PHD2) was shown to be a direct substrate of ERK. Phosphorylation of PHD2 by ERK prevents its binding to HIF1\u03b1, thus inhibiting HIF1\u03b1 hydroxylation and degradation-increasing HIF1\u03b1 stability. Significantly, ERK/PHD2 signaling in PROC cells is dependent on TGF\u03b21, promoting platinum resistance by stabilizing HIF1\u03b1. Inhibition of TGF\u03b21 by SB431542, ERK by selumetinib, or HIF1\u03b1 by YC-1 efficiently overcame platinum resistance both in vitro and in vivo. The results from clinical samples confirm activation of the ERK/PHD2/HIF1\u03b1 axis in patients with PROC, correlating highly with poor prognoses for patients. CONCLUSIONS: HIF1\u03b1 stabilization is regulated by TGF\u03b21/ERK/PHD2 axis in PROC. Hence, inhibiting TGF\u03b21, ERK, or HIF1\u03b1 is potential strategy for treating patients with PROC. ",
        "Disparity of Race Reporting and Representation in Clinical Trials Leading to Cancer Drug Approvals From 2008 to 2018. Importance: Representative racial/ethnic participation in research, especially in clinical trials that establish standards of care, is necessary to minimize disparities in outcomes and to uphold societal equity in health care. Objective: To evaluate the frequency of race reporting and proportional race representation in trials supporting US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) oncology drug approvals. Design, Setting, and Participants: Database study of all reported trials supporting FDA oncology drug approvals granted between July 2008 and June 2018. Primary reports of trials were obtained from PubMed and ClinicalTrials.gov. Food and Drug Administration approvals were identified using the FDA archives. The US population-based cancer estimates by race were calculated using National Cancer Institute-Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results and US Census databases. Main Outcomes and Measures: Primary outcomes were the proportion of trials reporting race and the proportion of patients by race participating in trials. Secondary outcomes included race subgroup analyses reporting and gaps between race proportion in trials and the US population. Descriptive statistics, Fisher exact, and \u03c72 tests were used to analyze the data. Proportions and odds ratios (OR) with 95% CIs were reported. Results: Among 230 trials with a total of 112\u202f293 participants, 145 (63.0%) reported on at least 1 race, 18 (7.8%) documented the 4 major races in the United States (white, Asian, black, and Hispanic), and 58 (25.2%) reported race subgroup analyses. Reporting on white, Asian, black, and Hispanic races was included in 144 (62.6%), 110 (47.8%), 88 (38.2%), and 23 (10.0%) trials, respectively. Between July 2008 and June 2013 vs July 2013 and June 2018, the number of trials reporting race (45 [56.6%] vs 100 [67.1%]; OR, 1.63; 95% CI, 0.93-2.87; P\u2009=\u2009.09) and race subgroup analysis (13 [16.1%] vs 45 [30.2%]; OR, 2.26, 95% CI, 1.16-4.67; P\u2009=\u2009.03) changed minimally and varied across races. Whites, Asians, blacks, and Hispanics represented 76.3%, 18.3%, 3.1% and 6.1% of trial participants, respectively, and the proportion for each race enrolled over time changed nominally (blacks, 3.6% vs 2.9% and Hispanics, 5.3% vs 6.7%) from July 2008 to June 2013 vs July 2013 to June 2018. Compared with their proportion of US cancer incidence, blacks (22% of expected) and Hispanics (44% of expected) were underrepresented compared with whites (98% of expected) and Asians (438% of expected). Conclusions and Relevance: Race and race subgroup analysis reporting occurs infrequently, and black and Hispanic races are consistently underrepresented compared with their burden of cancer incidence in landmark trials that led to FDA oncology drug approvals. Enhanced minority engagement is needed in trials to ensure the validity of results and reliable benefits to all. ",
        "Agreement Between Arterial Carbon Dioxide Levels With End-Tidal Carbon Dioxide Levels and Associated Factors in Children Hospitalized With Traumatic Brain Injury. Importance: Alterations in the partial pressure of carbon dioxide, arterial (Paco2) can affect cerebral perfusion after traumatic brain injury. End-tidal carbon dioxide (EtCO2) monitoring is a noninvasive tool used to estimate Paco2 values. Objective: To examine the agreement between Paco2 and EtCO2 and associated factors in children with traumatic brain injury. Design, Setting, and Participants: A secondary analysis was conducted using data from a prospective cohort study of 137 patients younger than 18 years with traumatic brain injury who were admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit of a level I trauma center between May 1, 2011, and July 31, 2017. Analysis was performed from December 17, 2018, to January 10, 2019. Main Outcomes and Measures: The closest EtCO2 value obtained within 30 minutes of a Paco2 value and the closest systolic blood pressure value obtained within 60 minutes prior to a Paco2 value during the first 24 hours after admission were recorded. The main outcome of Paco2-EtCO2 agreement was defined as Paco2 between 0 and 5 mm Hg greater than the paired EtCO2 value, and it was determined using Bland-Altman analysis, Passing and Bablok regression, and the Pearson correlation coefficient. Multivariable regression models determined which factors were associated with agreement. Results: The analysis included 137 patients (34 girls and 103 boys; mean [SD] age, 10.0 [6.3] years) and 445 paired Paco2-EtCO2 data points. On average, Paco2 was 2.7 mm Hg (95% limits of agreement, -11.3 to 16.7) higher than EtCO2. Overall, 187 of all Paco2-EtCO2 pairs (42.0%) agreed. There was larger variation in the Paco2-EtCO2 difference during the first 8 hours compared with 9 to 24 hours after admission to the pediatric intensive care unit. Development of pediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome within 24 hours of admission was associated with a lower likelihood of Paco2-EtCO2 agreement (adjusted odds ratio, 0.20; 95% CI, 0.08-0.51) compared with no development of pediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome. A diagnosis of pediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome 1 to 7 days after admission was associated with a larger first-day Paco2-EtCO2 difference compared with those who never developed pediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome (mean [SD] difference, 4.48 [3.70] vs 0.46 [5.50] mm Hg). Conclusions and Relevance: In this study of pediatric traumatic brain injury, Paco2-EtCO2 agreement was low, especially among patients with pediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome. Low Paco2-EtCO2 agreement early in hospitalization may be associated with future development of pediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome. Data on EtCO2 should not be substituted for data on Paco2 during the first 24 hours. ",
        "Incidence of Pediatric Cannabis Exposure Among Children and Teenagers Aged 0 to 19 Years Before and After Medical Marijuana Legalization in Massachusetts. Importance: Pediatric health care contacts due to cannabis exposure increased in Colorado and Washington State after cannabis (marijuana) policies became more liberal, but evidence from other US states is limited. Objective: To document the incidence of pediatric cannabis exposure cases reported to the Regional Center for Poison Control and Prevention (RPC) before and after medical marijuana legalization (MML) in Massachusetts. Design, Setting, and Participants: Cross-sectional comparison of pediatric cannabis exposure cases 4 years before and after MML in Massachusetts. The exposure cases included those of 218 children and teenagers aged between 0 and 19 years, as reported to the RPC from 2009 to 2016. Census data were used to determine the incidence. Data analysis was performed from November 12, 2018, to July 20, 2019. Exposure: Cannabis products. Main Outcomes and Measures: Incidence of RPC-reported cannabis exposure cases, both single substance and polysubstance, for the age group of 0 to 19 years, and cannabis product type, coingestants, and clinical effects. Results: During the 8-year study period (2009-2016), the RPC received 218 calls involving cannabis exposure (98 single substance, 120 polysubstance) in children and teenagers aged 0 to 19 years, representing 0.15% of all RPC calls in that age group for that period. Of the total exposure cases, males accounted for 132 (60.6%) and females 86 (39.4%). The incidence of single-substance cannabis calls increased from 0.4 per 100\u202f000 population before MML to 1.1 per 100\u202f000 population after (incidence rate ratio, 2.4; 95% CI, 1.5-3.9), a 140% increase. The age group of 15 to 19 years had the highest frequency of RPC-reported cannabis exposures (178 calls [81.7%]). The proportion of all RPC calls due to single-substance cannabis exposure increased overall for all age groups from 29 before MML to 69 afterward. Exposure to edible products increased after MML for most age groups. Conclusions and Relevance: Pediatric cannabis exposure cases increased in Massachusetts after medical marijuana was legalized in 2012, despite using childproof packaging and warning labels. This study provides additional evidence suggesting that MML may be associated with an increase in cannabis exposure cases among very young children, and extends prior work showing that teenagers are also experiencing increased cannabis-related health system contacts via the RPC. Additional efforts are needed to keep higher-potency edible products and concentrated extracts from children and teenagers, especially considering the MML and retail cannabis sales in an increasing number of US states.

        "Computationally guided personalized targeted ablation of persistent atrial fibrillation. Atrial fibrillation (AF)-the most common arrhythmia-significantly increases the risk of stroke and heart failure. Although catheter ablation can restore normal heart rhythms, patients with persistent AF who develop atrial fibrosis often undergo multiple failed ablations, and thus increased procedural risks. Here, we present personalized computational modelling for the reliable predetermination of ablation targets, which are then used to guide the ablation procedure in patients with persistent AF and atrial fibrosis. First, we show that a computational model of the atria of patients identifies fibrotic tissue that, if ablated, will not sustain AF. Then, we report the results of integrating the target ablation sites in a clinical mapping system and testing its feasibility in ten patients with persistent AF. The computational prediction of ablation targets avoids lengthy electrical mapping and could improve the accuracy and efficacy of targeted AF ablation in patients while eliminating the need for repeat procedures.

        "Cross-sectional survey of orthotic service provision in the UK: does where you live affect the service you receive?. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the quantity and quality of orthotic service provision within the UK. DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey obtained through freedom of information request in 2017. SETTING: National Health Service (NHS) Trusts/Health Boards (HBs) across the UK. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Descriptive statistics of survey results, including information related to finance, volume of appointments, patients and orthotic products, waiting times, staffing, complaints, outcome measures and key performance indicators. RESULTS: Responses were received from 61% (119/196) of contacted Trusts/HBs; 86% response rate from Scotland (12/14) and Wales (6/7), 60% (3/5) from Northern Ireland and 58% (98/170) from England. An inhouse service was provided by 32% (35/110) of responses and 68% (74/110) were funded by a block contract. Long waiting times for appointments and lead times for footwear/orthoses, and large variations in patient entitlements for orthotic products across Trusts/HBs were evident. Variations in the length of appointment times were also evident between regions of the UK and between contracted and inhouse services, with all appointment times relatively short. There was evidence of improvements in service provision; ability for direct general practitioner referral and orthotic services included within multidisciplinary clinics. However, this was not found in all Trusts/HBs. CONCLUSIONS: The aim to provide a complete UK picture of orthotic service provision was hindered by the low response rate and limited information provided in some responses, with greater ability of Trusts/HBs to answer questions related to quantity of service than those that reflect quality. However, results highlight the large discrepancies in service provision between Trusts/HBs, the gaps in data capture and the need for the UK NHS to establish appropriate processes to record the quantity and quality of orthotic service provision. In addition to standardising appointment times across the NHS, guidelines on product entitlements for patients and their lead times should be prescribed to promote equity. ",
        "Examination of molecular space and feasible structures of bioactive components of humic substances by FTICR MS data mining in ChEMBL database. Humic substances (HS) are complex natural mixtures comprising a large variety of compounds produced during decomposition of decaying biomass. The molecular composition of HS is extremely diverse as it was demonstrated with the use of high resolution mass spectrometry. The building blocks of HS are mostly represented by plant-derived biomolecules (lignins, lipids, tannins, carbohydrates, etc.). As a result, HS show a wide spectrum of biological activity. Despite that, HS remain a 'biological activity black-box' due to unknown structures of constituents responsible for the interaction with molecular targets. In this study, we investigated the antiviral activity of eight HS fractions isolated from peat and coal, as well as of two synthetic humic-like materials. We determined molecular compositions of the corresponding samples using ultra-high resolution Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance mass-spectrometry (FTICR MS). Inhibitory activity of HS was studied with respect to reproduction of tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV), which is a representative of Flavivirus genus, and to a panel of enteroviruses (EVs). The samples of natural HS inhibited TBEV reproduction already at a concentration of 1\u2009\u00b5g/mL, but they did not inhibit reproduction of EVs. We found that the total relative intensity of FTICR MS formulae within elemental composition range commonly attributed to flavonoid-like structures is correlating with the activity of the samples. In order to surmise on possible active structural components of HS, we mined formulae within FTICR MS assignments in the ChEMBL database. Out of 6502 formulae within FTICR MS assignments, 3852 were found in ChEMBL. There were more than 71 thousand compounds related to these formulae in ChEMBL. To support chemical relevance of these compounds to natural HS we applied the previously developed approach of selective isotopic exchange coupled to FTICR MS to obtain structural information on the individual components of HS. This enabled to propose compounds from ChEMBL, which corroborated the labeling data. The obtained results provide the first insight onto the possible structures, which comprise antiviral components of HS and, respectively, can be used for further disclosure of antiviral activity mechanism of HS.

        "Pro-Survival Lipid Sphingosine-1-Phosphate Metabolically Programs T Cells to Limit Anti-tumor Activity. Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P), a bioactive lysophospholipid generated by sphingosine kinase 1 (SphK1), regulates lymphocyte egress into circulation via S1P receptor 1 (S1PR1) signaling, and it controls the differentiation of regulatory T\u00a0cells (Tregs) and T helper-17 cells. However, the mechanisms by which receptor-independent SphK1-mediated intracellular S1P levels modulate T\u00a0cell functionality remains unknown. We show here that SphK1-deficient T\u00a0cells maintain central memory phenotype and exhibit higher mitochondrial respiration and reduced differentiation to Tregs. Mechanistically, we discovered a direct correlation between SphK1-generated S1P and lipid transcription factor PPAR\u03b3 (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma) activity, which in turn regulates lipolysis in T\u00a0cells. Genetic and pharmacologic inhibition of SphK1 improved metabolic fitness and anti-tumor activity of T\u00a0cells against murine melanoma. Further, inhibition of SphK1 and PD1 together led to improved control of\u00a0melanoma. Overall, these data highlight the clinical\u00a0potential of limiting SphK1/S1P signaling for enhancing anti-tumor-adoptive T\u00a0cell therapy. ",
        "Human GNPTAB stuttering mutations engineered into mice cause vocalization deficits and astrocyte pathology in the corpus callosum. Stuttering is a common neurodevelopmental disorder that has been associated with mutations in genes involved in intracellular trafficking. However, the cellular mechanisms leading to stuttering remain unknown. Engineering a mutation in N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphate transferase subunits \u03b1 and \u03b2 (GNPTAB) found in humans who stutter into the mouse Gnptab gene resulted in deficits in the flow of ultrasonic vocalizations similar to speech deficits of humans who stutter. Here we show that other human stuttering mutations introduced into this mouse gene, Gnptab Ser321Gly and Ala455Ser, produce the same vocalization deficit in 8-day-old pup isolation calls and do not affect other nonvocal behaviors. Immunohistochemistry showed a marked decrease in staining of astrocytes, particularly in the corpus callosum of the Gnptab Ser321Gly homozygote mice compared to wild-type littermates, while the staining of cerebellar Purkinje cells, oligodendrocytes, microglial cells, and dopaminergic neurons was not significantly different. Diffusion tensor imaging also detected deficits in the corpus callosum of the Gnptab Ser321Gly mice. Using a range of cell type-specific Cre-drivers and a Gnptab conditional knockout line, we found that only astrocyte-specific Gnptab-deficient mice displayed a similar vocalization deficit. These data suggest that vocalization defects in mice carrying human stuttering mutations in Gnptab derive from abnormalities in astrocytes, particularly in the corpus callosum, and provide support for hypotheses that focus on deficits in interhemispheric communication in stuttering.

        "Cellular internalization of bystander nanomaterial induced by TAT-nanoparticles and regulated by extracellular cysteine. Entry into cells is necessary for many nanomaterial applications, and a common solution is to functionalize nanoparticles (NPs) with cell-penetrating ligands. Despite intensive studies on these functionalized NPs, little is known about their effect on cellular activities to engulf other cargo from the nearby environment. Here, we use NPs functionalized with TAT (transactivator of transcription) peptide (T-NPs) as an example to investigate their impact on cellular uptake of bystander cargo. We find that T-NP internalization enables cellular uptake of bystander NPs, but not common fluid markers, through a receptor-dependent macropinocytosis pathway. Moreover, the activity of this bystander uptake is stimulated by cysteine presence in the surrounding solution. The cargo selectivity and cysteine regulation are further demonstrated ex vivo and in vivo. These findings reveal another mechanism for NP entry into cells and open up an avenue of studying the interplay among endocytosis, amino acids, and nanomaterial delivery. ",
        "Plasmonic Paper Microneedle Patch for On-Patch Detection of Molecules in Dermal Interstitial Fluid. Minimally invasive devices to detect molecules in dermal interstitial fluid (ISF) are desirable for point-of-care diagnostic and monitoring applications. In this study, we developed a microneedle (MN) patch that collects ISF for on-patch biomarker analysis by surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS). The micrometer-scale MNs create micropores in the skin surface, through which microliter quantities of ISF are collected onto plasmonic paper on the patch backing. The plasmonic paper was prepared by immobilizing poly(styrenesulfonate) (PSS) coated gold nanorods (AuNRs) on a thin strip of filter paper using plasmonic calligraphy. Negatively charged PSS was used to bind positively charged rhodamine 6G (R6G), which served as a model compound, and thereby localize R6G on AuNR surface. R6G bound on the AuNR surface was detected and quantified by acquiring SERS spectra from the plasmonic paper MN patch. This approach was used to measure pharmacokinetic profiles of R6G in ISF and serum from rats in vivo. This proof-of-concept study indicates that a plasmonic paper MN patch has the potential to enable on-patch measurement of molecules in ISF for research and future medical applications. ",
        "Circulating CXCR5-PD-1hi peripheral T helper cells are associated with progression to type 1 diabetes. AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Type 1 diabetes is preceded by a period of asymptomatic autoimmunity characterised by positivity for islet autoantibodies. Therefore, T helper cell responses that induce B cell activation are likely to play a critical role in the disease process. Here, we aimed to evaluate the role of a recently described subset, C-X-C motif chemokine receptor type 5-negative, programmed cell death protein 1-positive (CXCR5-PD-1hi) peripheral T helper (Tph) cells, in human type 1 diabetes. METHODS: The phenotype of blood CXCR5-PD-1hi CD4+ T cells was analysed by multicolour flow cytometry. The frequencies of circulating CXCR5-PD-1hi T cells were analysed in a cohort of 44 children with newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes, 40 autoantibody-positive (AAb+) at-risk children and 84 autoantibody-negative healthy control children, and the findings were replicated in a separate cohort of 15 children with newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes and 15 healthy control children. RESULTS: Circulating CXCR5-PD-1hi Tph cells share several features associated with B cell helper function with circulating CXCR5+PD-1hi follicular T helper (Tfh) cells. Moreover, the frequency of circulating Tph cells was increased in children with newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes, especially in those who are positive for multiple autoantibodies. Importantly, circulating Tph cells were also increased in autoantibody-positive at-risk children who later progressed to type 1 diabetes. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Our results demonstrate that circulating CXCR5-PD-1hi Tph cells are associated with progression to clinical type 1 diabetes. Consequently, Tph cells could have potential both as a biomarker of disease progression and as a target for immunotherapy in type 1 diabetes. ",
        "Physical activity during adolescence and risk of colorectal adenoma later in life: results from the Nurses' Health Study II. BACKGROUND: Physical activity during adulthood has been consistently associated with lower risk of colorectal cancers, but whether physical activity during adolescence may also play a role in colorectal carcinogenesis is unclear. METHODS: We included 28,250 women in the Nurses' Health Study II who provided data on physical activity during adolescence (ages 12-22 years) in 1997 and underwent lower bowel endoscopy (1998-2011). We used logistic regression models for clustered data to examine the association between physical activity during adolescence and risk of adenoma later in life. RESULTS: Physical activity during adolescence was inversely associated with risk of colorectal adenoma (2373 cases), independent of physical activity during adulthood. The multivariable-adjusted odds ratio (OR) of adenoma was 0.89 (95% CI 0.77-1.02; Ptrend\u2009=\u20090.03) comparing women with\u2009\u2265\u200972 metabolic equivalent of tasks-hours/week (MET-h/week) to\u2009<\u200921 MET-h/week. Women with high physical activity during both adolescence (\u226553.3 MET-h/week) and adulthood (\u226523.1 MET-h/week) had significantly lower risk of adenoma (all adenomas: OR 0.76; 95% CI 0.66-0.88; advanced adenoma: OR 0.61; 95% CI 0.45-0.82) compared to women with low physical activity during both stages of life. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that physical activity during adolescence may lower the risk of colorectal adenoma later in life. ",
        "The sRNA DicF integrates oxygen sensing to enhance enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli virulence via distinctive RNA control mechanisms. To establish infection, enteric pathogens integrate environmental cues to navigate the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) and precisely control expression of virulence determinants. During passage through the GIT, pathogens encounter relatively high levels of oxygen in the small intestine before transit to the oxygen-limited environment of the colon. However, how bacterial pathogens sense oxygen availability and coordinate expression of virulence traits is not resolved. Here, we demonstrate that enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli O157:H7 (EHEC) regulates virulence via the oxygen-responsive small RNA DicF. Under oxygen-limited conditions, DicF enhances global expression of the EHEC type three secretion system, which is a key virulence factor required for host colonization, through the transcriptional activator PchA. Mechanistically, the pchA coding sequence (CDS) base pairs with the 5' untranslated region of the mRNA to sequester the ribosome binding site (RBS) and inhibit translation. DicF disrupts pchA cis-interactions by binding to the pchA CDS, thereby unmasking the pchA RBS and promoting PchA expression. These findings uncover a feed-forward regulatory pathway that involves distinctive mechanisms of RNA-based regulation and that provides spatiotemporal control of EHEC virulence. ",
        "Distribution differences in prognostic copy number alteration profiles in IDH-wild-type glioblastoma cause survival discrepancies across cohorts. The diagnosis and prognostication of glioblastoma (GBM) remain to be solely dependent on histopathological findings and few molecular markers, despite the clinical heterogeneity in this entity. To address this issue, we investigated the prognostic impact of copy number alterations (CNAs) using two population-based IDH-wild-type GBM cohorts: an original Japanese cohort and a dataset from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). The molecular disproportions between these cohorts were dissected in light of cohort differences in GBM. The Japanese cohort was collected from cases registered in Kansai Molecular Diagnosis Network for CNS tumors (KNBTG). The somatic landscape around CNAs was analyzed for 212 KNBTG cases and 359 TCGA cases. Next, the clinical impacts of CNA profiles were investigated for 140 KNBTG cases and 152 TCGA cases treated by standard adjuvant therapy using temozolomide-based chemoradiation. The comparative profiling indicated unequal distribution of specific CNAs such as EGFR, CDKN2A, and PTEN among the two cohorts. Especially, the triple overlap CNAs in these loci (triple CNA) were much higher in frequency in TCGA (70.5%) than KNBTG (24.3%), and its prognostic impact was independently validated in both cohorts. The KNBTG cohort significantly showed better prognosis than the TCGA cohort (median overall survival 19.3 vs 15.6\u2009months). This survival difference between the two cohorts completely resolved after subclassifying all cases according to the triple CNA status. The prognostic significance of triple CNA was identified in IDH-wild-type GBM. Distribution difference in prognostic CNA profiles potentially could cause survival differences across cohorts in clinical studies. ",
        "Abemaciclib Is Effective Against Pancreatic Cancer Cells and Synergizes with HuR and YAP1 Inhibition. Mutation or promoter hypermethylation of CDKN2A is found in over 90% of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas (PDAC) and leads to loss of function of cell-cycle inhibitors p16 (INK4A) and p14 (ARF) resulting in unchecked proliferation. The CDK4/6 inhibitor, abemaciclib, has nanomolar IC50s in PDAC cell lines and decreases growth through inhibition of phospho-Rb (pRb), G1 cell-cycle arrest, apoptosis, and the senescent phenotype detected with \u03b2-galactosidase staining and relevant mRNA elevations. Daily abemaciclib treatments in mouse PDAC xenograft studies were safe and demonstrated a 3.2-fold decrease in tumor volume compared with no treatment (P < 0.0001) accompanying a decrease in both pRb and Ki67. We determined that inhibitors of HuR (ELAVL1), a prosurvival mRNA stability factor that regulates cyclin D1, and an inhibitor of Yes-Associated Protein 1 (YAP1), a pro-oncogenic, transcriptional coactivator important for CDK6 and cyclin D1, were both synergistic with abemaciclib. Accordingly, siRNA oligonucleotides targeted against HuR, YAP1, and their common target cyclin D1, validated the synergy studies. In addition, we have seen increased sensitivity to abemaciclib in a PDAC cell line that harbors a loss of the ELAVL1 gene via CRISP-Cas9 technology. As an in vitro model for resistance, we investigated the effects of long-term abemaciclib exposure. PDAC cells chronically cultured with abemaciclib displayed a reduction in cellular growth rates (GR) and coresistance to gemcitabine and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), but not to HuR or YAP1 inhibitors as compared with no treatment controls. We believe that our data provide compelling preclinical evidence for an abemaciclib combination-based clinical trial in patients with PDAC. IMPLICATIONS: Our data suggest that abemaciclib may be therapeutically relevant for the treatment in PDAC, especially as part of a combination regimen inhibiting YAP1 or HuR. ",
        "Comprehensive comparative effectiveness and safety of first-line antihypertensive drug classes: a systematic, multinational, large-scale analysis. BACKGROUND: Uncertainty remains about the optimal monotherapy for hypertension, with current guidelines recommending any primary agent among the first-line drug classes thiazide or thiazide-like diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, and non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, in the absence of comorbid indications. Randomised trials have not further refined this choice. METHODS: We developed a comprehensive framework for real-world evidence that enables comparative effectiveness and safety evaluation across many drugs and outcomes from observational data encompassing millions of patients, while minimising inherent bias. Using this framework, we did a systematic, large-scale study under a new-user cohort design to estimate the relative risks of three primary (acute myocardial infarction, hospitalisation for heart failure, and stroke) and six secondary effectiveness and 46 safety outcomes comparing all first-line classes across a global network of six administrative claims and three electronic health record databases. The framework addressed residual confounding, publication bias, and p-hacking using large-scale propensity adjustment, a large set of control outcomes, and full disclosure of hypotheses tested. FINDINGS: Using 4\u00b79 million patients, we generated 22\u2008000 calibrated, propensity-score-adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) comparing all classes and outcomes across databases. Most estimates revealed no effectiveness differences between classes; however, thiazide or thiazide-like diuretics showed better primary effectiveness than angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors: acute myocardial infarction (HR 0\u00b784, 95% CI 0\u00b775-0\u00b795), hospitalisation for heart failure (0\u00b783, 0\u00b774-0\u00b795), and stroke (0\u00b783, 0\u00b774-0\u00b795) risk while on initial treatment. Safety profiles also favoured thiazide or thiazide-like diuretics over angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. The non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers were significantly inferior to the other four classes. INTERPRETATION: This comprehensive framework introduces a new way of doing observational health-care science at scale. The approach supports equivalence between drug classes for initiating monotherapy for hypertension-in keeping with current guidelines, with the exception of thiazide or thiazide-like diuretics superiority to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and the inferiority of non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers.

        "MEK Inhibition Modulates Cytokine Response to Mediate Therapeutic Efficacy in Lung Cancer. Activating mutations in BRAF, a key mediator of RAS signaling, are present in approximately 50% of melanoma patients. Pharmacologic inhibition of BRAF or the downstream MAP kinase MEK is highly effective in treating BRAF-mutant melanoma. In contrast, RAS pathway inhibitors have been less effective in treating epithelial malignancies, such as lung cancer. Here, we show that treatment of melanoma patients with BRAF and MEK inhibitors (MEKi) activated tumor NF-\u03baB activity. MEKi potentiated the response to TNF\u03b1, a potent activator of NF-\u03baB. In both melanoma and lung cancer cells, MEKi increased cell-surface expression of TNF\u03b1 receptor 1 (TNFR1), which enhanced NF-\u03baB activation and augmented expression of genes regulated by TNF\u03b1 and IFN\u03b3. Screening of 289 targeted agents for the ability to increase TNF\u03b1 and IFN\u03b3 target gene expression demonstrated that this was a general activity of inhibitors of MEK and ERK kinases. Treatment with MEKi led to acquisition of a novel vulnerability to TNF\u03b1 and IFN\u03b3-induced apoptosis in lung cancer cells that were refractory to MEKi killing and augmented cell-cycle arrest. Abolishing the expression of TNFR1 on lung cancer cells impaired the antitumor efficacy of MEKi, whereas the administration of TNF\u03b1 and IFN\u03b3 in MEKi-treated mice enhanced the antitumor response. Furthermore, immunotherapeutics known to induce expression of these cytokines synergized with MEKi in eradicating tumors. These findings define a novel cytokine response modulatory function of MEKi that can be therapeutically exploited. SIGNIFICANCE: Lung cancer cells are rendered sensitive to MEK inhibitors by TNF\u03b1 and IFN\u03b3, providing a strong mechanistic rationale for combining immunotherapeutics, such as checkpoint blockers, with MEK inhibitor therapy for lung cancer.See related commentary by Havel, p. 5699.

        "Discovery of a bone-like blood particle in the peripheral circulation of humans and rodents. OBJECTIVE: To characterize ossified bone marrow blood vessels and confirm the presence of ossified particles (OSP) in humans and rodents. METHODS: Human bone marrow blood vessels were processed for scanning and transmission electron microscopy. Whole blood samples were collected from younger (26-39\u00a0years; n\u00a0=\u00a06) and older (55-63\u00a0years; n\u00a0=\u00a06) volunteers and male Fischer-344 rats (1\u00a0month, n\u00a0=\u00a07; 6\u00a0months, n\u00a0=\u00a07; 12\u00a0months, n\u00a0=\u00a07; 18-months, n\u00a0=\u00a06; 24\u00a0months, n\u00a0=\u00a08). OSP in the whole blood samples were sorted and imaged with microscopy to determine diameter, circularity, and solidity. Additionally, the chemical composition of OSP was determined via elemental analysis. RESULTS: SEM revealed two types of ossified bone marrow blood vessels: that is, \"transitioning\" and \"ossified.\" OSP were adhered to the surface of transitioning vessels and theoretically gain access to and circulate within the blood. The majority of OSP were\u00a0\u226415 \u03bcm in diameter, but many were of sufficient size to serve as emboli (ie, >15 \u03bcm).OSP were predominately oblong in shape and several had jagged tips and edges. CONCLUSIONS: We introduce a novel, bone-like blood particle that may be diagnostic of bone marrow blood vessel ossification. Further, OSP may associate with several disease states (eg, atherosclerosis). ",
        "Effect of Primary Care Parent-Targeted Interventions on Parent-Adolescent Communication About Sexual Behavior and Alcohol Use: A Randomized Clinical Trial. Importance: Adolescent well care visits provide opportunities for clinicians to facilitate parent-adolescent communication (PAC) to reduce pregnancy, sexually transmitted infections, and alcohol-related harm among adolescents. Objective: To test the effect of brief parent-targeted interventions delivered in primary care settings on PAC about sexual and alcohol use behaviors. Design, Setting, and Participants: Randomized clinical trial conducted at a primary care pediatric practice from January 4, 2016, to April 10, 2017. Adolescents who were scheduled for a well care visit were recruited, along with their parent or guardian. Data analyses continued through April 30, 2018. Interventions: During well care visits, parents in sexual health intervention and alcohol prevention intervention groups received coaching to discuss written intervention materials encouraging PAC about sex or alcohol, respectively, with their adolescent within 2 weeks, followed by a brief clinician endorsement. After 2 weeks, parents received a follow-up telephone call. Control group parents received usual care. Main Outcomes and Measures: Participants were surveyed 4 months after the well care visit. Parent-reported and adolescent-reported quality of PAC was measured using the 20-item Parent-Adolescent Communication Scale, in which a higher score indicates better PAC; and frequency of PAC about sex or alcohol was measured using a 4-point Likert-type scale with 1 indicating not at all or never, and 4 indicating a lot or often. Results: Of 196 parent-adolescent dyads assessed for eligibility, 118 (60.2%) were eligible to participate. These 118 dyads were randomized to 1 of 3 groups: (1) sexual health intervention (n\u2009=\u200938 [32.2%]); (2) alcohol prevention intervention (n\u2009=\u200940 [33.9%]); and control (n\u2009=\u200940 [33.9%]); 104 parents (88.1%) and 99 adolescents (83.9%) completed the study. Parents included 112 women (94.9%) and had a mean (SD) age of 45.8 (6.9) years. Adolescents included 60 girls (50.9%); 67 adolescents (56.8%) were aged 14 years, and 51 adolescents (43.2%) were aged 15 years. Participant race/ethnicity reflected that of the practice (63 black adolescents [53.4%]; 46 white adolescents [38.9%]; 111 non-Hispanic adolescents [94.1%]). At baseline, 15 adolescents (12.7%) reported a history of sexual behavior and 16 adolescents (13.6%) reported a history of alcohol use. Intention-to-treat analyses found that 4 months after the intervention, adolescents in the sexual health intervention group reported a higher mean frequency score for PAC about sex compared with those in the control group (2.32 [95% CI, 1.97-2.66] vs 1.79 [95% CI, 1.50-2.08]; P\u2009=\u2009.02); adolescents in the alcohol prevention intervention group reported a higher mean frequency score for PAC about alcohol compared with those in the control group (2.93 [95% CI, 2.60-3.25] vs 2.40 [95% CI, 2.08-2.72]; P\u2009=\u2009.03). Parent-reported frequency scores for PAC about sex or alcohol did not differ by group. Conclusions and Relevance: Brief parent-targeted interventions in primary care settings increased adolescent-reported frequency of PAC about sexual health and alcohol use and may be an important strategy for parents to influence adolescent behaviors and health outcomes.

        "Do Financial Incentives Change Length-of-stay Performance in Emergency Departments? A Retrospective Study of the Pay-for-performance Program in Metro Vancouver. BACKGROUND: Pay-for-performance (P4P) programs have been implemented in various forms to reduce emergency department (ED) patient length of stay (LOS). This retrospective study investigated to what extent the timing of patient disposition in Metro Vancouver EDs was influenced by a LOS-based P4P program. METHODS: We analyzed ED visit records of four major hospitals in Metro Vancouver, Canada. For each ED, we individually tested whether LOS was distributed discontinuously at the LOS target before and after the P4P program was terminated. For the P4P effective period, we examined whether patients discharged just prior to the LOS target had a higher 7-day return-and-admission (RA) rate-the probability that a patient, after being discharged home, returned to any ED within 7 days and was admitted to an inpatient unit-than patients discharged just after the target. RESULTS: Prior to the termination of the P4P program, in all four EDs, the LOS density of admitted patients was discontinuous and had a significant drop at the P4P 10-hours admission LOS target; a similar phenomenon was observed among discharged patients at the 4-hours discharge LOS target, but only in the two lower-volume EDs. Furthermore, in a lower-volume ED, patients who were discharged right before the 4-hours P4P LOS target had a higher 7-day RA rate than patients discharged right after the LOS target. After the termination of the discharge incentive, the discontinuity at the discharge LOS target became less evident, but patients were still more frequently admitted just before 10 hours in three of the four EDs as the local health authority continued to support the admission incentive scheme after the government terminated the P4P program. CONCLUSIONS: The LOS-based financial incentive scheme appears to have influenced the timing of ED patient dispositions. The results suggest mixed consequences of the P4P program-it can reduce access block for admitted patients but may also lead to discharges associated with return visits and admissions. ",
        "The persistent influence of caste on under-five mortality: Factors that explain the caste-based gap in high focus Indian states. OBJECTIVE: Although under-five mortality rate (U5MR) is declining in India, it is still high in a few selected states and among the scheduled caste (SC) and scheduled tribe (ST) population of the country. This study re-examines the association between caste and under-five deaths in high focus Indian states following the implementation of the country's National Rural Health Mission (NRHM) program. In addition, we aim to quantify the contribution of socioeconomic determinants in explaining the gap in under-five death risk between the SC/ST population and non-SC/ST population in high focus states in India. DATA AND METHOD: Using data from the National Family Health Survey (NFHS), we calculated the U5MR by applying a synthetic cohort probability approach. We applied a binary logistic regression model to examine the association of under-five deaths with the selected covariates. Further, we used Fairlie's decomposition technique to understand the relative contribution of socioeconomic variables on under-five death risk between the caste groups. FINDINGS: In high focus Indian states, the under-five mortality risk between well-off and deprived caste children has declined in the post-NRHM period, indicating a positive impact in terms of reducing caste-based inequalities in the high focus states. Despite the reduction in under-five death risk, children belonging to the SC population experience higher mortality rates than children belonging to the non-SC/ST population from 1992 to 2016. Both macro level (district level mortality rates) and individual (regression analysis) analyses showed that children belonging to SCs experience the highest likelihood of dying before their fifth birthday. A decomposition analysis revealed that 83% of the caste-based gap in the under-five deaths is due to the distribution of women's level of educational attainment and household wealth between the SC/ST and non-SC/ST population. Program indicators such as place of birth and number of antenatal care (ANC) visit also contributed significantly to widening caste-based gaps in U5MR. CONCLUSION: The study indicates that there is still room to improve access to health facilities for mothers and children belonging to deprived caste groups in India. Continuous efforts to raise the level of maternal education and the economic status of people belonging to deprived caste groups should be pursued simultaneously. ",
        "The Genomic Landscape of Merkel Cell Carcinoma and Clinicogenomic Biomarkers of Response to Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor Therapy. PURPOSE: Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is a rare, aggressive cutaneous malignancy, which has demonstrated sensitivity to immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy. Here, we perform the largest genomics study in MCC to date to characterize the molecular landscape and evaluate for clinical and molecular correlates to immune checkpoint inhibitor response. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Comprehensive molecular profiling was performed on 317 tumors from patients with MCC, including the evaluation of oncogenic mutations, tumor mutational burden (TMB), mutational signatures, and the Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV). For a subset of 57 patients, a retrospective analysis was conducted to evaluate for clinical and molecular correlates to immune checkpoint inhibitor response and disease survival. RESULTS: Genomic analyses revealed a bimodal distribution in TMB, with 2 molecularly distinct subgroups. Ninety-four percent (n = 110) of TMB-high specimens exhibited an ultraviolet light (UV) mutational signature. MCPyV genomic DNA sequences were not identified in any TMB-high cases (0/117), but were in 63% (110/175) of TMB-low cases. For 36 evaluable patients treated with checkpoint inhibitors, the overall response rate was 44% and response correlated with survival at time of review (100% vs. 20%, P < 0.001). Response rate was 50% in TMB-high/UV-driven and 41% in TMB-low/MCPyV-positive tumors (P = 0.63). Response rate was significantly correlated with line of therapy: 75% in first-line, 39% in second-line, and 18% in third-line or beyond (P = 0.0066). PD-1, but not PD-L1, expression was associated with immunotherapy response (77% vs. 21%, P = 0.00598, for PD-1 positive and negative, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: We provide a comprehensive genomic landscape of MCC and demonstrate clinicogenomic associates of immunotherapy response. ",
        "A subset of HLA-DP molecules serve as ligands for the natural cytotoxicity receptor NKp44. Natural killer (NK) cells can recognize virus-infected and stressed cells1 using activating and inhibitory receptors, many of which interact with HLA class I. Although early studies also suggested a functional impact of HLA class II on NK cell activity2,3, the NK cell receptors that specifically recognize HLA class II molecules have never been identified. We investigated whether two major families of NK cell receptors, killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs) and natural cytotoxicity receptors (NCRs), contained receptors that bound to HLA class II, and identified a direct interaction between the NK cell receptor NKp44 and a subset of HLA-DP molecules, including HLA-DP401, one of the most frequent class II allotypes in white populations4. Using NKp44\u03b6+ reporter cells and primary human NKp44+ NK cells, we demonstrated that interactions between NKp44 and HLA-DP401 trigger functional NK cell responses. This interaction between a subset of HLA-DP molecules and NKp44 implicates HLA class II as a component of the innate immune response, much like HLA class I. It also provides a potential mechanism for the described associations between HLA-DP subtypes and several disease outcomes, including hepatitis B virus infection5-7, graft-versus-host disease8 and inflammatory bowel disease9,10.

        "Appreciation of Postpartum Changes of the Rectus Muscles in Primary and Repeated Abdominoplasty. BACKGROUND: Abdominoplasty is one of the top five most commonly performed cosmetic procedures. Whereas widening of the linea alba is a well-accepted consequence of pregnancy, the changes to the rectus abdominis muscles are less well known and thus unappreciated and undertreated. METHODS: After institutional review board approval, the Northwestern Enterprise Data Warehouse identified nulliparous and multiparous women, aged 18 to 45 years, who underwent abdominal computed tomography between 2000 and the present. Measurements included the width and cross-sectional area of each rectus muscle, width of the linea alba, and circumference of the abdominal cavity at the level of the L3 vertebra. In addition, two case reports addressing these anatomical changes with muscle modification and mesh reinforcement are presented. RESULTS: Sixty women were identified that met our inclusion criteria: 15 nulliparous, 15 after one pregnancy (para 1), 15 after two pregnancies (para 2), and 15 after three or more pregnancies (para \u2265 3). The linea alba was significantly widened after one pregnancy from 1.14 cm to 2.29 cm, but did not significantly widen further with each subsequent pregnancy. The width of each rectus muscle was significantly widened from 6.00 \u00b1 0.60 cm in nulliparous to 6.61 \u00b1 0.58 cm in para 1, significantly widened again to 7.03 \u00b1 0.46 cm in para 2, but not significantly widened after that (6.97 \u00b1 1.00 cm in para 3). CONCLUSIONS: In addition to widening of the linea alba, pregnancy alters the shape of the rectus abdominis muscle. Correction of muscle width during abdominoplasty may be a necessary adjunct to achieve the proper tension in both primary and revision procedures. CLINICAL QUESTION/LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic, V.

        "Association of Smoking Cessation With Subsequent Risk of Cardiovascular Disease. Importance: The time course of cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk after smoking cessation is unclear. Risk calculators consider former smokers to be at risk for only 5 years. Objective: To evaluate the association between years since quitting smoking and incident CVD. Design, Setting, and Participants: Retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data from Framingham Heart Study participants without baseline CVD (original cohort: attending their fourth examination in 1954-1958; offspring cohort: attending their first examination in 1971-1975) who were followed up through December 2015. Exposures: Time-updated self-reported smoking status, years since quitting, and cumulative pack-years. Main Outcomes and Measures: Incident CVD (myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure, or cardiovascular death). Primary analyses included both cohorts (pooled) and were restricted to heavy ever smokers (\u226520 pack-years). Results: The study population included 8770 individuals (original cohort: n\u2009=\u20093805; offspring cohort: n\u2009=\u20094965) with a mean age of 42.2 (SD, 11.8) years and 45% male. There were 5308 ever smokers with a median 17.2 (interquartile range, 7-30) baseline pack-years, including 2371 heavy ever smokers (406 [17%] former and 1965 [83%] current). Over 26.4 median follow-up years, 2435 first CVD events occurred (original cohort: n\u2009=\u20091612 [n\u2009=\u2009665 among heavy smokers]; offspring cohort: n\u2009=\u2009823 [n\u2009=\u2009430 among heavy smokers]). In the pooled cohort, compared with current smoking, quitting within 5 years was associated with significantly lower rates of incident CVD (incidence rates per 1000 person-years: current smoking, 11.56 [95% CI, 10.30-12.98]; quitting within 5 years, 6.94 [95% CI, 5.61-8.59]; difference, -4.51 [95% CI, -5.90 to -2.77]) and lower risk of incident CVD (hazard ratio, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.49-0.76). Compared with never smoking, quitting smoking ceased to be significantly associated with greater CVD risk between 10 and 15 years after cessation in the pooled cohort (incidence rates per 1000 person-years: never smoking, 5.09 [95% CI, 4.52-5.74]; quitting within 10 to <15 years, 6.31 [95% CI, 4.93-8.09]; difference, 1.27 [95% CI, -0.10 to 3.05]; hazard ratio, 1.25 [95% CI, 0.98-1.60]). Conclusions and Relevance: Among heavy smokers, smoking cessation was associated with significantly lower risk of CVD within 5 years relative to current smokers. However, relative to never smokers, former smokers' CVD risk remained significantly elevated beyond 5 years after smoking cessation. ",
        "AP-1 activity induced by co-stimulation is required for chromatin opening during T cell activation. Activation of T cells is dependent on the organized and timely opening and closing of chromatin. Herein, we identify AP-1 as the transcription factor that directs most of this remodeling. Chromatin accessibility profiling showed quick opening of closed chromatin in naive T cells within 5 h of activation. These newly opened regions were strongly enriched for the AP-1 motif, and indeed, ChIP-seq demonstrated AP-1 binding at >70% of them. Broad inhibition of AP-1 activity prevented chromatin opening at AP-1 sites and reduced the expression of nearby genes. Similarly, induction of anergy in the absence of co-stimulation during activation was associated with reduced induction of AP-1 and a failure of proper chromatin remodeling. The translational relevance of these findings was highlighted by the substantial overlap of AP-1-dependent elements with risk loci for multiple immune diseases, including multiple sclerosis, inflammatory bowel disease, and allergic disease. Our findings define AP-1 as the key link between T cell activation and chromatin remodeling. ",
        "A carrier-free multiplexed gene editing system applicable for suspension cells. Genetically engineered cells via CRISPR/Cas9 system can serve as powerful sources for cancer immunotherapeutic applications. Furthermore, multiple genetic alterations are necessary to overcome tumor-induced immune-suppressive mechanisms. However, one of the major obstacles is the technical difficulty with efficient multiple gene manipulation of suspension cells due to the low transfection efficacy. Herein, we established a carrier-free multiplexed gene editing platform in a simplified method, which can enhance the function of cytotoxic CD8+ T cells by modulating suspension cancer cells. Our multiple Cas9 ribonucleoproteins (RNPs) enable simultaneous disruption of two programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) ligands, functioning as negative regulators in the immune system, by accessing engineered Cas9 proteins with abilities of complexation and cellular penetration. In addition, combination with electroporation enhanced multiple gene editing efficacy, compared with that by treatment of multiple Cas9 RNPs alone. This procedure resulted in high gene editing at multiple loci of suspension cells. The treatment of multiple Cas9 RNPs targeting both ligands strongly improved Th1-type cytokine production of cytotoxic CD8+ T cells, resulting in synergistic cytotoxic effects against cancer. Simultaneous suppression of PD-L1 and PD-L2 on cancer cells via our developed editing system allows effective anti-tumor immunity. Furthermore, the treatment of multiple Cas9 RNPs targeting PD-L1, PD-L2, and TIM-3 had approximately 70-90% deletion efficacy. Thus, our multiplexed gene editing strategy endows potential clinical utilities in cancer immunotherapy. ",
        "Progressive multiple sclerosis: from pathophysiology to therapeutic strategies. Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the central nervous system that involves demyelination and axonal degeneration. Although substantial progress has been made in drug development for relapsing-remitting MS, treatment of the progressive forms of the disease, which are characterized clinically by the accumulation of disability in the absence of relapses, remains unsatisfactory. This unmet clinical need is related to the complexity of the pathophysiological mechanisms involved in MS progression. Chronic inflammation, which occurs behind a closed blood-brain barrier with activation of microglia and continued involvement of T cells and B cells, is a hallmark pathophysiological feature. Inflammation can enhance mitochondrial damage in neurons, which, consequently, develop an energy deficit, further reducing axonal health. The growth-inhibitory and inflammatory environment of lesions also impairs remyelination, a repair process that might protect axons from degeneration. Moreover, neurodegeneration is accelerated by the altered expression of ion channels on denuded axons. In this Review, we discuss the current understanding of these disease mechanisms and highlight emerging therapeutic strategies based on these insights, including those targeting the neuroinflammatory and degenerative aspects as well as remyelination-promoting approaches.

        "An excreted small molecule promotes C. elegans reproductive development and aging. Excreted small-molecule signals can bias developmental trajectories and physiology in diverse animal species. However, the chemical identity of these signals remains largely obscure. Here we report identification of an unusual N-acylated glutamine derivative, nacq#1, that accelerates reproductive development and shortens lifespan in Caenorhabditis elegans. Produced predominantly by C. elegans males, nacq#1 hastens onset of sexual maturity in hermaphrodites by promoting exit from the larval dauer diapause and by accelerating late larval development. Even at picomolar concentrations, nacq#1 shortens hermaphrodite lifespan, suggesting a trade-off between reproductive investment and longevity. Acceleration of development by nacq#1 requires chemosensation and is dependent on three homologs of vertebrate steroid hormone receptors. Unlike ascaroside pheromones, which are restricted to nematodes, fatty acylated amino acid derivatives similar to nacq#1 have been reported from humans and invertebrates, suggesting that related compounds may serve signaling functions throughout metazoa.

        "Structure of amyloid-\u03b2 (20-34) with Alzheimer's-associated isomerization at Asp23 reveals a distinct protofilament interface. Amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) harbors numerous posttranslational modifications (PTMs) that may affect Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis. Here we present the 1.1\u2009\u00c5 resolution MicroED structure of an A\u03b2 20-34 fibril with and without the disease-associated PTM, L-isoaspartate, at position 23 (L-isoAsp23). Both wild-type and L-isoAsp23 protofilaments adopt \u03b2-helix-like folds with tightly packed cores, resembling the cores of full-length fibrillar A\u03b2 structures, and both self-associate through two distinct interfaces. One of these is a unique A\u03b2 interface strengthened by the isoaspartyl modification. Powder diffraction patterns suggest a similar structure may be adopted by protofilaments of an analogous segment containing the heritable Iowa mutation, Asp23Asn. Consistent with its early onset phenotype in patients, Asp23Asn accelerates aggregation of A\u03b2 20-34, as does the L-isoAsp23 modification. These structures suggest that the enhanced amyloidogenicity of the modified A\u03b2 segments may also reduce the concentration required to achieve nucleation and therefore help spur the pathogenesis of AD.
