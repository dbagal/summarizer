        "Feeling Young and in Control: Daily Control Beliefs Are Associated With Younger Subjective Ages. OBJECTIVES: Daily variations in control beliefs are associated with developmental outcomes. We predicted that on days when older adults feel more in control than their personal average, they would also report feeling younger, and explored the relationship in younger adults. METHOD: A total of 116 older and 107 younger adults completed a 9-day daily diary study. On Day 1 participants reported on demographic variables. On Days 2-9, participants reported their daily subjective age, daily control beliefs, daily stressors, and daily physical health symptoms. All measures were completed online via Qualtrics. Results were analyzed using multilevel models. RESULTS: Controlling for age, gender, education, daily stressors, daily physical health, and average control, there was a significant main effect of daily control beliefs on daily subjective age. Older adults felt significantly younger on days with a greater sense of control than usual, but this effect was absent in younger adults. For younger adults, average exposure to daily stressors and daily fluctuations in physical health were better predictors of daily subjective age. DISCUSSION: These findings suggest that higher daily control is associated with younger subjective ages in older adults, whereas other factors may play a more central role in the daily variations of younger adults' subjective ages.

        "Women have lower chances than men to be resuscitated and survive out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. AIMS: Previous studies on sex differences in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) had limited scope and yielded conflicting results. We aimed to provide a comprehensive overall view on sex differences in care utilization, and outcome of OHCA. METHODS AND RESULTS: We performed a population-based cohort-study, analysing all emergency medical service (EMS) treated resuscitation attempts in one province of the Netherlands (2006-2012). We calculated odds ratios (ORs) for the association of sex and chance of a resuscitation attempt by EMS, shockable initial rhythm (SIR), and in-hospital treatment using logistic regression analysis. Additionally, we provided an overview of sex differences in overall survival and survival at successive stages of care, in the entire study population and in patients with SIR. We identified 5717 EMS-treated OHCAs (28.0% female). Women with OHCA were less likely than men to receive a resuscitation attempt by a bystander (67.9% vs. 72.7%; P\u2009<\u20090.001), even when OHCA was witnessed (69.2% vs. 73.9%; P\u2009<\u20090.001). Women who were resuscitated had lower odds than men for overall survival to hospital discharge [OR 0.57; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.48-0.67; 12.5% vs. 20.1%; P\u2009<\u20090.001], survival from OHCA to hospital admission (OR 0.88; 95% CI 0.78-0.99; 33.6% vs. 36.6%; P\u2009=\u20090.033), and survival from hospital admission to discharge (OR 0.49, 95% CI 0.40-0.60; 33.1% vs. 51.7%). This was explained by a lower rate of SIR in women (33.7% vs. 52.7%; P\u2009<\u20090.001). After adjustment for resuscitation parameters, female sex remained independently associated with lower SIR rate. CONCLUSION: In case of OHCA, women are less often resuscitated by bystanders than men. When resuscitation is attempted, women have lower survival rates at each successive stage of care. These sex gaps are likely explained by lower rate of SIR in women, which can only partly be explained by resuscitation characteristics. ",
        "After the Burden is Lifted: Caregivers' Recovery of Life Satisfaction after The Death or Recovery of a Spouse. OBJECTIVE: How do caregivers' life satisfaction shift upon the recovery of an ill spouse? Paradoxically, there is a greater increase in life satisfaction upon death than recovery of a spouse. Our analysis explores this paradox. METHOD: We follow the two groups of exiting caregivers longitudinally for four years from when the partner is still in need of care until the death (N= 152) or recovery (N= 112) of a previously ill partner, comparing their trajectory of life satisfaction. We use the years 2001-2016 of the German-Socio-Economic Panel Study and a growth-curve analysis. RESULTS: Contrary to our expectations, bereaved caregivers experience a significantly stronger increase in life satisfaction than spouses whose partners recover from a serious illness, even when we stratify by age, gender and initial life satisfaction to account for significantly different subsample composition. Surprisingly, life satisfaction remains unchanged when the partner recovers. Only if a heavy burden in terms of unpaid care and housework hours or prior care need is lifted, do we observe an increase in life satisfaction among spouses with recovering partners, which is like the one experienced by bereaved caregivers.

        "Male/Female Differences in the Impact of Caring for Elderly Relatives on Labor Market Attachment and Hours of Work: 1997-2015. OBJECTIVES: Using representative samples of the Canadian labor market (N = 5,871,850), this study examined male/female differences in the impact of informal care on labor market attachment, and the extent to which differences in labor market participation and employment relationships explained these differences over a 19-year period. METHODS: We examined four outcomes related to labor market impacts associated with caring for elderly relatives: leaving the labor market, working part-time, taking time off work in the previous week, and the amount of time taken off from work. Regression models examined differences between men and women, and the extent to which gendered labor market roles accounted for these differences. RESULTS: We observed an increase in all labor market outcomes over the study period. Women were more likely than men to experience each outcome. Adjusting for labor market role variables did not change these estimates appreciably. After adjustment for differences in labor market roles women were 73% more likely to leave the labor market, more than 5 times more likely to work part-time, and twice as likely to take time off in the last week due to informal care. Further, for temporary absences to provide care, women took an average of 160 min more per week than men. DISCUSSION: Taken together, these results suggest an increasing impact of informal care on labor market participation in Canada between 1997 and 2005, and it remains gendered. ",
        "The impact of first- and second-eye cataract surgery on motor vehicle crashes and associated costs. Objective: to evaluate the association between first- and second-eye cataract surgery and motor vehicle crashes for older drivers and the associated costs to the community. Design: retrospective population-based cohort study. Subjects: a total of 2,849 drivers aged 60 years and older who had undergone both first- and second-eye cataract surgery were involved in 3,113 motor vehicle crashes as drivers during the study period. Methods: de-identified data were obtained using the Western Australian Data Linkage System from 1 January 2003 to 31 December 2015. Poisson regression analysis based on Generalised Estimating Equations was undertaken to compare the frequency of crashes in the year before first eye cataract surgery, between first and second eye surgery and 1 year after second eye surgery. Results: first eye cataract surgery was associated with a significant 61% reduction in crash frequency (P < 0.001) and second eye surgery was associated with a significant 23% reduction in crashes (P < 0.001), compared to the year before first eye cataract surgery after accounting for age, gender, marital status, accessibility, socio-economic status, driving exposure and comorbidities. The estimated cost savings from the reduction in crashes in the year after second eye cataract surgery compared to the year before first eye cataract surgery was $14.9 million. Conclusions: first- and second-eye cataract surgery were associated with a significant reduction in motor vehicle crashes, with first eye surgery having the greatest impact. These results provide encouragement for the timely provision of first- and second-eye cataract surgery for older drivers. ",
        "Adherence to diet quality indices in relation to semen quality and reproductive hormones in young men. STUDY QUESTION: Is adherence to an a priori defined diet quality indices [Alternate Healthy Index 2010 (AHEI-2010), relative Mediterranean diet score (rMED) or dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH)] associated with semen quality and reproductive hormone levels in young men?. SUMMARY ANSWER: Greater adherence to the DASH diet is related to higher sperm counts. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Studies assessing the relationship between dietary intake and male reproductive function have mainly been focused on specific nutrients, food groups or data-driven dietary patterns, but the evidence on a priori defined dietary indices is still scarce. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: Cross-sectional study of 209 male university students recruited from October 2010 to November 2011 in Murcia Region (Southern Spain). PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Healthy young men aged 18-23\u00a0years were included in this study. Diet was assessed using a validated food frequency questionnaire and three a priori-defined dietary indices (AHEI-2010, rMED and DASH) were calculated. Linear regression was used to analyze the relation between the three dietary indices and semen quality parameters and reproductive hormone levels accounting for potential confounders and covariates. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: We found statistically significant positive associations between the DASH index and sperm concentration (P, trend\u2009=\u20090.04), total sperm count (P, trend\u2009=\u20090.04) and total motile sperm count (P, trend\u2009=\u20090.02). No associations were observed for other semen parameters or male reproductive hormones. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: Even though we adjusted for several known and suspected confounders we cannot exclude the possibility of residual or unmeasured confounding or chance findings. Subjects were blinded to the study outcomes thus reducing the potential influence on their report of diet. Our sample size may be too small to rule out associations with other semen parameters or reproductive hormones. Causal inference is limited, as usual with all observational studies. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: The results suggest that greater adherence to the DASH may help improve sperm counts. This study was carried out on young men from the general population. However, results may differ among other populations (e.g. infertile men). Therefore, further research is needed to confirm these findings and extend these results to other populations.

        "Grape or grain but never the twain? A randomized controlled multiarm matched-triplet crossover trial of beer and wine. Background: Alcohol-induced hangover constitutes a significant, yet understudied, global hazard and a large socio-economic burden. Old folk wisdoms such as \"Beer before wine and you'll feel fine; wine before beer and you'll feel queer\" exist in many languages. However, whether these concepts in fact reduce hangover severity is unclear. Objectives: The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of the combination and order of beer and wine consumption on hangover intensity. Methods: In this multiarm, parallel randomized controlled matched-triplet crossover open-label interventional trial, participants were matched into triplets and randomly assigned according to age, gender, body composition, alcohol drinking habits, and hangover frequency. Study group 1 consumed beer up to a breath alcohol concentration (BrAC) \u22650.05% and then wine to BrAC \u22650.11% (vice versa for study group 2). Control group subjects consumed either only beer or only wine. On a second intervention day (crossover) \u22651 wk later, study-group subjects were switched to the opposite drinking order. Control-group subjects who drank only beer on the first intervention received only wine on the second study day (and vice versa). Primary endpoint was hangover severity assessed by Acute Hangover Scale rating on the day following each intervention. Secondary endpoints were factors associated with hangover intensity. Results: Ninety participants aged 19-40 y (mean age 23.9), 50% female, were included (study group 1 n\u00a0=\u00a031, study group 2 n\u00a0=\u00a031, controls n\u00a0=\u00a028). Neither type nor order of consumed alcoholic beverages significantly affected hangover intensity (P\u00a0>\u00a00.05). Multivariate regression analyses revealed perceived drunkenness and vomiting as the strongest predictors for hangover intensity. Conclusions: Our findings dispel the traditional myths \"Grape or grain but never the twain\" and \"Beer before wine and you'll feel fine; wine before beer and you'll feel queer\" regarding moderate-to-severe alcohol intoxication, whereas subjective signs of progressive intoxication were confirmed as accurate predictors of hangover severity. This trial was prospectively registered at the Witten/Herdecke University Ethics Committee as 140/2016 and retrospectively registered at the German Clinical Trials Register as DRKS00015285. ",
        "Mortality reduction with physical activity in patients with and without cardiovascular disease. AIMS: Physical activity has been shown to reduce mortality in a dose-response fashion. Current guidelines recommend 500-1000 metabolic equivalent task (MET)-min per week of regular physical activity. This study aimed to compare the impact of leisure-time physical activity on mortality in primary versus secondary cardiovascular prevention. METHODS AND RESULTS: This study included a total of 131\u00a0558 and 310\u00a0240 subjects with and without cardiovascular disease (CVD), respectively, from a population-based cohort. Leisure-time physical activity was measured by self-report questionnaires. The study subjects were followed-up for a median of 5.9 years, and the main study outcome was all-cause mortality. There was an inverse relationship between the physical activity level and the mortality risk in both groups. The benefit in the secondary prevention group was shown to be greater than that in the primary prevention group: every 500 MET-min/week increase in physical activity resulted in a 14% and 7% risk reduction in mortality in the secondary and primary prevention groups, respectively (interaction P < 0.001). In addition, while individuals without CVD benefited the most between 1 and 500 MET-min/week of physical activity, the benefit in those with CVD continued above 500\u2009-\u20091000 MET-min/week. The adjusted mortality risk of individuals with CVD who performed a high level of physical activity (\u22651000 MET-min/week) was shown to be comparable to or lower than that of their counterparts without CVD. CONCLUSION: Individuals with CVD may benefit from physical activity to a greater extent than do healthy subjects without CVD. ",
        "Bedtime hypertension treatment improves cardiovascular risk reduction: the Hygia Chronotherapy Trial. AIMS: The Hygia Chronotherapy Trial, conducted within the clinical primary care setting, was designed to test whether bedtime in comparison to usual upon awakening hypertension therapy exerts better cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk reduction. METHODS AND RESULTS: In this multicentre, controlled, prospective endpoint trial, 19 084 hypertensive patients (10 614 men/8470 women, 60.5\u2009\u00b1\u200913.7\u2009years of age) were assigned (1:1) to ingest the entire daily dose of \u22651 hypertension medications at bedtime (n\u2009=\u20099552) or all of them upon awakening (n\u2009=\u20099532). At inclusion and at every scheduled clinic visit (at least annually) throughout follow-up, ambulatory blood pressure (ABP) monitoring was performed for 48\u2009h. During the 6.3-year median patient follow-up, 1752 participants experienced the primary CVD outcome (CVD death, myocardial infarction, coronary revascularization, heart failure, or stroke). Patients of the bedtime, compared with the upon-waking, treatment-time regimen showed significantly lower hazard ratio-adjusted for significant influential characteristics of age, sex, type 2 diabetes, chronic kidney disease, smoking, HDL cholesterol, asleep systolic blood pressure (BP) mean, sleep-time relative systolic BP decline, and previous CVD event-of the primary CVD outcome [0.55 (95% CI 0.50-0.61), P\u2009<\u20090.001] and each of its single components (P\u2009<\u20090.001 in all cases), i.e. CVD death [0.44 (0.34-0.56)], myocardial infarction [0.66 (0.52-0.84)], coronary revascularization [0.60 (0.47-0.75)], heart failure [0.58 (0.49-0.70)], and stroke [0.51 (0.41-0.63)]. CONCLUSION: Routine ingestion by hypertensive patients of \u22651 prescribed BP-lowering medications at bedtime, as opposed to upon waking, results in improved ABP control (significantly enhanced decrease in asleep BP and increased sleep-time relative BP decline, i.e. BP dipping) and, most importantly, markedly diminished occurrence of major CVD events.

        "Association between regional body fat and cardiovascular disease risk among postmenopausal women with normal body mass index. AIMS: Central adiposity is associated with increased cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk, even among people with normal body mass index (BMI). We tested the hypothesis that regional body fat deposits (trunk or leg fat) are associated with altered risk of CVD among postmenopausal women with normal BMI. METHODS AND RESULTS: We included 2683 postmenopausal women with normal BMI (18.5 to <25\u2009kg/m2) who participated in the Women's Health Initiative and had no known CVD at baseline. Body composition was determined by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry. Incident CVD events including coronary heart disease and stroke were ascertained through February 2017. During a median 17.9\u2009years of follow-up, 291 incident CVD cases occurred. After adjustment for demographic, lifestyle, and clinical risk factors, neither whole-body fat mass nor fat percentage was associated with CVD risk. Higher percent trunk fat was associated with increased risk of CVD [highest vs. lowest quartile hazard ratio (HR) = 1.91, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.33-2.74; P-trend <0.001], whereas higher percent leg fat was associated with decreased risk of CVD (highest vs. lowest quartile HR = 0.62, 95% CI 0.43-0.89; P-trend = 0.008). The association for trunk fat was attenuated yet remained significant after further adjustment for waist circumference or waist-to-hip ratio. Higher percent trunk fat combined with lower percent leg fat was associated with particularly high risk of CVD (HR comparing extreme groups = 3.33, 95% CI 1.46-7.62). CONCLUSION: Among postmenopausal women with normal BMI, both elevated trunk fat and reduced leg fat are associated with increased risk of CVD. ",
        "Changes in exercise frequency and cardiovascular outcomes in older adults. AIMS: Little is known about the association of changes in moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) level with cardiovascular disease (CVD), especially in older adults whose ability to engage in frequent MVPA naturally wanes as they age. We aimed to examine the association of changes in MVPA and CVD in older adults. METHODS AND RESULTS: In a nationwide cohort study of older adults aged 60 years or older, we identified more than 1.1 million subjects without previous history of CVD at baseline who underwent two consecutive national health screening from 2009 to 2012. We prospectively assessed the risk of CVD occurred between 2013 and 2016 according to changes in frequency of MVPA by initial MVPA status. Compared to those who were continuously physically inactive, those who increased their frequency of MVPA from physically inactive to 1-2 times per week [0.7/1000 person-years (PY) decrease in incidence rate (IR); adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) 0.95; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.92-0.99], 3-4 times per week (1.5/1000 PY decrease in IR; aHR 0.89; 95% CI 0.84-0.94), \u22655 times per week (0.4/1000 PY decrease in IR; aHR 0.91; 95% CI 0.85-0.97) had a significantly reduced risk for total CVD (P for trend <0.001). Older adults who became physically inactive from engaging in more than 1-2 times of MVPA per week had a higher CVD risk compared to those who maintained their frequency of MVPA. CONCLUSION: Among older adults, engaging in higher frequency of MVPA or maintaining MVPA level was associated with reduced risk of CVD. ",
        "The association of insomnia and sleep apnea with deployment and combat exposure in the entire population of US army soldiers from 1997 to 2011: a retrospective cohort investigation. Since 2001, the United States has been engaged in the longest and most expensive overseas conflict in its history. Sleep disorders, especially insomnia and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), are common in service members and appear related to deployment and combat exposure, but this has not been systematically examined. Therefore, the incidence of clinically diagnosed insomnia and OSA from 1997 to 2011 in the entire population of US Army soldiers was determined and associations of these disorders with deployment and combat exposure examined. This observational retrospective cohort study linked medical, demographic, deployment, and combat casualty data from all active duty US Army soldiers serving from 1997 to 2011 (n = 1 357 150). The mediating effects of multiple known comorbid conditions were considered. From 2003 to 2011, there were extraordinary increases in incidence of insomnia (652%) and OSA (600%). Factors increasing insomnia risk were deployment (risk ratio [RR] [deployed/not deployed] = 2.06; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.04-2.08) and combat exposure (RR [exposed/not exposed] = 1.20; 95% CI, 1.19-1.22). Risk of OSA was increased by deployment (RR [deployed/not deployed] = 2.14; 95% CI, 2.11-2.17), but not combat exposure (RR [exposed/not exposed] = 1.00; 95% CI, 0.98-1.02). These relationships remained after accounting for other factors in multivariable analyses. A number of comorbid medical conditions such as posttraumatic stress disorder and traumatic brain injury mediated a portion of the association between the sleep disorders and deployment. It is essential to determine underlying mechanisms responsible for these very large increases in insomnia and OSA and introduce effective preventive measures. ",
        "Obesity and Longer Term Risks of Dementia in 65-74 Year Olds. BACKGROUND: overweight or obesity at ages <65 years associates with increased dementia incidence, but at \u226565 years estimates are paradoxical. Weight loss before dementia diagnosis, plus smoking and diseases causing weight loss may confound associations. OBJECTIVE: to estimate weight loss before dementia diagnosis, plus short and longer-term body mass index associations with incident dementia in 65-74 year olds within primary care populations in England. METHODS: we studied dementia diagnosis free subjects: 257,523 non-smokers without baseline cancer, heart failure or multi-morbidity (group A) plus 161,927 with these confounders (group B), followed \u226414.9 years. Competing hazard models accounted for mortality. RESULTS: in group A, 9,774 were diagnosed with dementia and in those with repeat weight measures, 54% lost \u22652.5 kg during 10 years pre-diagnosis. During <10 years obesity (\u226530.0 kg/m2) or overweight (25.0 to <30.0) were inversely associated with incident dementia (versus 22.5 to <25.0). However, from 10 to 14.9 years, obesity was associated with increased dementia incidence (hazard ratio [HR] 1.17; 95% CI: 1.03-1.32). Overweight protective associations disappeared in longer-term analyses (HR, 1.01; 95% CI: 0.90-1.13). In group B, (n = 6,070 with incident dementia), obesity was associated with lower dementia risks in the short and longer-term. CONCLUSIONS: in 65-74 year olds (free of smoking, cancer, heart failure or multi-morbidity at baseline) obesity associates with higher longer-term incidence of dementia. Paradoxical associations were present short-term and in those with likely confounders. Reports of protective effects of obesity or overweight on dementia risk in older groups may reflect biases, especially weight loss before dementia diagnosis. Adiposity in middle and old age and risk of death from dementia: 40-year follow-up of 19,000 men in the Whitehall study. AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: to examine the hypothesis that obesity is protective for dementia, we compared the associations of death from dementia with body weight and body mass index (BMI) in both middle and old age. DESIGN: height and weight were measured in a prospective study of 19,019 middle-aged men in the Whitehall study in 1967-70 and in 6,158 surviving participants at resurvey in 1997. Cox regression was used to examine the associations of death from dementia over a 40-year period with weight or BMI measured by health professionals in middle and old age adjusting for age, smoking habits, employment grade and marital status. SETTING: central government employees in London, UK. MAIN OUTCOMES MEASURE: death due to dementia in 320 participants. RESULTS: body weight measured in middle age was weakly inversely associated with death from dementia (hazard ratio 0.98 [95%CI: 0.97-0.99] per kg), but neither height nor BMI were related to risk of dementia. In contrast, body weight in old age was more strongly inversely related to deaths from dementia (0.96; [0.95-0.98] per kg) as was BMI (0.92 [0.86-0.97] per kg/m2). Weight loss over the 30 years between baseline and resurvey was associated with a higher risk of death from dementia, with an adjusted HR per kg/30 years of 1.04 [95%CI: 1.02-1.08] and the association with loss of BMI was even stronger (adjusted HR of 1.10 [1.03-1.19]) per kg/m2 decrease. CONCLUSIONS: the stronger inverse associations of deaths from dementia with BMI in old age, compared with middle age, together with strong positive associations of loss of BMI or body weight between middle and old age casts doubt on previous suggestions that obesity protects against death from dementia.

        "Severe obesity as a barrier to international travel: a qualitative analysis. BACKGROUND: It is unknown whether obesity is a barrier to international travel. The purpose of this qualitative study was to describe the travel experiences of a cohort of severely obese individuals attending a hospital-based bariatric service, to identify their perceived barriers to travel and to generate recommendations that address the needs of severely obese individuals. METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with severely obese patients attending a regional, structured, multidisciplinary lifestyle modification programme. Coding and thematic analysis of the transcripts were completed by three independent researchers. A thematic analysis was performed based on examination of the transcribed interviews. Demographic and clinical data such as gender, age and body mass index were also recorded. RESULTS: Twelve patients (six males), with a mean age of 54\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.98\u00a0years and a mean body mass index of 46.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a08.2\u00a0kg/m2, agreed to semi-structured interviews (14-52-minute duration). The principal themes emerging from the interviews included obese air traveller embarrassment, physical discomfort on commercial flights, perceived weight bias, challenges in accessing hotel rooms, heat intolerance in warm climates, restricted leisure travel activities and medical co-morbidities. Most of the interviewees perceived a health benefit to travel but regarded obesity as a significant barrier to international travel. CONCLUSION: These findings highlight the limitations experienced by obese travellers when engaging in international travel. Our results may inform the pre-travel health advice given to obese travellers. They might also serve to raise awareness among operators within the travel industry of the difficulties travellers with severe obesity face. ",
        "Are all vaccines safe for the pregnant traveller? A systematic review and meta-analysis. Pregnant travelers and their offspring are vulnerable to severe outcomes following a wide range of infections. Vaccine preventable diseases can have a particularly severe course in pregnant women, but little is known about the safety of travel vaccines in pregnant women. We performed a systematic review of all published literature concerning the safety of vaccines frequently given to travelers such as yellow fever, MMR (mumps, measles, and rubella), influenza, Tdap (tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis), meningococcus, hepatitis A and B, rabies, polio, typhoid fever, tick-borne encephalitis, and Japanese encephalitis vaccines. We included case series, cohort studies, and randomized controlled trials (RCTs). For the meta-analysis we included only RCTs that compared the administration of a vaccine to placebo or to no vaccine. Outcome measures included severe systemic adverse events, maternal outcomes related to the course of pregnancy, neonatal outcomes, and local adverse events. We calculated the risk ratio (RR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI) as the summary measure. The safety of influenza vaccine is supported by high-quality evidence. For Tdap vaccine no evidence of any harm was found in the meta-analysis of RCTs. A slight increase in chorioamnionitis rate was reported in three out of twelve observational studies. However, this small possible risk is far outweighed by a much larger benefit in terms of infant morbidity and mortality. Meningococcal vaccines are probably safe during pregnancy, as supported by RCTs comparing meningococcal vaccines to other vaccines. Data from observational studies support the safety of hepatitis A, hepatitis B, and rabies vaccines, as well as that of the live attenuated yellow fever vaccine. We found little or no data about the safety of polio, typhoid, Japanese encephalitis, tick-borne encephalitis and MMR vaccines during pregnancy. ",
        "The risk and prevention of venous thromboembolism in the pregnant traveller. The average risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in long haul travellers is approximately 2.8 per 1000 travellers, which is increased in the presence of other VTE risk factors. In pregnant long-haul travellers, little is known in terms of the absolute risk of VTE in these women and, therefore, there is limited consensus on appropriate thromboprophylaxis in this setting. This review will provide guidance to allow practitioners to safely minimize the risk of travel related VTE in pregnant women. The suggestions provided are based on limited data, extrapolated risk estimates of VTE in pregnant travellers, and recommendations from published guidelines. We found that the absolute VTE risk per flight appears to be <1% for the average pregnant or postpartum traveller. In pregnant travellers with a prior history of VTE, a potent thrombophilia or strong antepartum risk factors (e.g. combination of obesity and immobility), the risk of VTE with travel appears to be >1%. Postpartum, the risk of VTE with travel may be >1% for women with thrombophilias (particularly in those with a family history), other transient risk factors and in women with a prior VTE. Based on our findings, we recommend simple measures be taken by all pregnant travellers, such as frequent ambulation, hydration and calf exercises. In those at an intermediate risk, we suggest a consideration of 20-30mmHg compression stockings. In the highest risk group, we suggest careful consideration for low molecular weight heparin thromboprophylaxis. If there are specific concerns, we advise consultation with a thrombosis expert at the nearest local centre. ",
        "BMI Change During Puberty Is an Important Determinant of Adult Type 2 Diabetes Risk in Men. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine the role of change in body mass index (BMI) during puberty, independent of childhood overweight, for risk of adult type 2 diabetes in men. STUDY DESIGN, POPULATION, AND OUTCOME: We included 36,176 men who had weight and height measured at age 8 and 20 years available from the BMI Epidemiology Study and the Conscription register. Information on type 2 diabetes (n = 1,777) was retrieved from the Swedish National Patient Register. Hazard ratios and 95% CIs were estimated by Cox regressions including birth year and country of birth as covariates. Because the assumption of proportional hazards was violated for the association between BMI change during puberty and type 2 diabetes, we split the follow-up time into early (\u226455.7 years) and late (>55.7 years). RESULTS: Both childhood overweight and high BMI increase during puberty associated with risk of adult type 2 diabetes. Men with childhood overweight that normalized during puberty did not have significantly increased risk of type 2 diabetes [early type 2 diabetes 1.28 (0.89; 1.82); late type 2 diabetes 1.35 (0.97; 1.87)]. Men who developed overweight during puberty [early 4.67 (3.90; 5.58); late 2.85 (2.25; 3.61)] and men overweight throughout childhood and puberty [early 4.82 (3.84; 6.05); late 3.04 (2.27; 4.06)] had substantially increased risk of type 2 diabetes compared with men who were never overweight. CONCLUSION: BMI change during puberty is an important and childhood BMI a modest independent determinant of adult type 2 diabetes risk in men. ",
        "Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of the Magnitude of Structural, Clinical, and Physician and Patient Barriers to Cancer Clinical Trial Participation. BACKGROUND: Barriers to cancer clinical trial participation have been the subject of frequent study, but the rate of trial participation has not changed substantially over time. Studies often emphasize patient-related barriers, but other types of barriers may have greater impact on trial participation. Our goal was to examine the magnitude of different domains of trial barriers by synthesizing prior research. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies that examined the trial decision-making pathway using a uniform framework to characterize and quantify structural (trial availability), clinical (eligibility), and patient/physician barrier domains. The systematic review utilized the PubMed, Google Scholar, Web of Science, and Ovid Medline search engines. We used random effects to estimate rates of different domains across studies, adjusting for academic vs community care settings. RESULTS: We identified 13 studies (nine in academic and four in community settings) with 8883 patients. A trial was unavailable for patients at their institution 55.6% of the time (95% confidence interval [CI] = 43.7% to 67.3%). Further, 21.5% (95% CI = 10.9% to 34.6%) of patients were ineligible for an available trial, 14.8% (95% CI = 9.0% to 21.7%) did not enroll, and 8.1% (95% CI = 6.3% to 10.0%) enrolled. Rates of trial enrollment in academic (15.9% [95% CI = 13.8% to 18.2%]) vs community (7.0% [95% CI = 5.1% to 9.1%]) settings differed, but not rates of trial unavailability, ineligibility, or non-enrollment. CONCLUSIONS: These findings emphasize the enormous need to address structural and clinical barriers to trial participation, which combined make trial participation unachievable for more than three of four cancer patients.

        "Passive smoking in childhood increases the risk of developing rheumatoid arthritis. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the link between smoking status, including childhood and adult passive exposure, and the risk of incident RA. METHODS: The French E3N cohort includes 98 995 female volunteers prospectively followed since 1990. Self-administered questionnaires sent every 2-3 years collected medical events, general, lifestyle and environmental characteristics. RA diagnoses were collected in three successive questionnaires and confirmed if women received reimbursement for an RA-specific medication. The risk of incident RA was estimated using an age-adjusted Cox model that considers smoking status as a time-dependent variable. RESULTS: Among 71 248 women, 371 incident RA cases were confirmed. Ever-smokers not exposed to passive smoking had an increased risk of RA [1.38 (95% CI 1.10, 1.74)]. In never-smokers, passive smoking exposure during childhood was associated with a borderline increased risk of RA in the same range as active smoking in adults, with an hazard ratio (HR) of 1.43 (95% CI 0.97, 2.11). Ever-smokers who also had childhood passive smoking exposure had a higher risk of RA than smokers not exposed during childhood [HR 1.67 (95% CI 1.17, 2.39)], but without a significant difference (P = 0.30). RA began earlier in smokers exposed to childhood passive smoking. CONCLUSION: This study confirms that active smoking is associated with an increased risk of RA. It suggests for the first time that passive exposure to tobacco during childhood might also increase the risk of RA in future light smokers and probably non-smokers. Our results highlight the importance of avoiding any tobacco environment in children, especially in those with a family history of RA. ",
        "Household Accessibility and Residential Relocation in Older Adults. OBJECTIVES: It is unclear how home environmental factors influence relocation decisions. We examined whether indoor accessibility, entrance accessibility, bathroom safety features, housing type, and housing condition were associated with relocations either within the community or to residential care facilities. METHODS: We used prospective data over 4 years from the nationally representative National Health and Aging Trends Study in the United States of Medicare beneficiaries 65 years and older living in the community (N = 7,197). We used multinomial regression analysis with survey weights. RESULTS: Over the 4 years, 8.2% of the population moved within the community, and 3.9% moved to residential care facilities. After adjusting for demographics and health factors, poor indoor accessibility was found to be associated with moves within the community but not to residential care facilities. No additional home environmental factors were associated with relocation. DISCUSSION: One-floor dwellings, access to a lift, or having a kitchen, bedroom, and bathroom on the same floor may help older adults age in place. Understanding which modifiable home environmental factors trigger late-life relocation, and to where, has practical implications for developing policies and programs to help older adults age in their place of choice.

        "Going Online to Stay Connected: Online Social Participation Buffers the Relationship Between Pain and Depression. OBJECTIVES: Maintaining offline social participation (i.e., face-to-face social interaction) is key for healthy aging, but older adults who experience pain tend to restrict their social activity outside of the home. The onset of pain may set off a downward spiral where lowered social participation increases the risk of depression and vice versa. This study thus assesses whether online social participation (i.e., the use of online social network sites) moderates the effect of pain on depression, possibly functioning as a compensatory mechanism for reduced offline social participation for those in pain. METHOD: Logistic regression models with a lagged dependent variable were used with panel data from the National Health and Aging Trends Study. An interaction term was included to assess the moderating effect of online social participation. RESULTS: We find that online social participation buffers the detrimental effect of pain on depression. However, the effect of pain on online social participation was not statistically significant. DISCUSSION: Findings show that online social participation can alleviate the negative effects of pain on mental well-being, and suggest that online social participation can supplement attempts to maintain offline social participation in later life, especially for those whose social activity may be limited by pain.

        "Association of Indoor Tanning Exposure With Age at Melanoma Diagnosis and BRAF V600E Mutations. There is limited information on how indoor tanning promotes melanoma development. We investigated indoor tanning use in patients with melanomas in sun-exposed skin and studied the clinicopathological and molecular characteristics in relation to indoor tanning exposure. Patients from a multidisciplinary clinic for cutaneous cancers completed standardized questionnaires on risk factors for melanoma as a component of medical history at their initial consultations. For this study, we included patients from December 2013 to May 2015. The 114 patients who reported indoor tanning exposure were younger at diagnosis than the 222 patients who did not (51.5 vs 64.0\u2009years, two-sided P < .001). BRAF V600E genotype was more prevalent in ever-users than in nonusers (42.9% vs 28.3%, two-sided P = .04) and higher in ever-users who initiated indoor tanning prior to age 25\u2009years compared with age 25 years or older (62.2% vs 31.1%, two-sided P = .003). There were more melanomas in intermittently sun-exposed skin in ever-users than nonusers (65.7% vs 51.9%, respectively, two-sided P = .02). Our data suggest indoor tanning may promote melanomas that arise in skin with low-chronic sun-induced damage through BRAF V600E-mediated melanomagenesis. ",
        "Long-Term Risk of Skin Cancer Among Childhood Cancer Survivors: A DCOG-LATER Cohort Study. BACKGROUND: Skin cancer is common after radiotherapy among childhood cancer survivors (CCSs). We studied risks and risk factors for subsequent skin cancers, with emphasis on radiation dose, exposed skin surface area, and chemotherapeutic agents. METHODS: The DCOG-LATER cohort study includes 5-year Dutch CCSs diagnosed 1963-2001. Subsequent skin cancers were identified from record linkages with the Netherlands Cancer Registry and Dutch Pathology Registry. Incidence rates were compared with general population rates. Multivariable Cox regression models were used, applying a novel method of case-control sampling enabling use of tumor location in cohort analyses. All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: Among 5843 CCSs, 259 developed 1061 basal cell carcinomas (BCCs) (standardized incidence ratio [SIR] = 29.8, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 26.3 to 33.6; excess absolute risk per 10 000 person-years (EAR) = 24.6), 20 had melanoma (SIR\u2009=\u20092.3, 95% CI = 1.4 to 3.5; EAR\u2009=\u20091.1), and 10 had squamous cell carcinoma (SIR\u2009=\u20097.5, 95% CI = 3.6 to 13.8; EAR\u2009=\u20090.8). Cumulative incidence of BCC 40\u2009years after childhood cancer was 19.1% (95% CI = 16.6 to 21.8%) after radiotherapy vs 0.6% expected based on general population rates. After a first BCC, 46.7% had more BCCs later. BCC risk was associated with any radiotherapy to the skin compartment of interest (hazard ratio [HR]\u2009=\u200914.32, 95% CI = 10.10 to 20.29) and with estimated percentage in-field skin surface area (26-75%: HR\u2009=\u20091.99, 95% CI = 1.24 to 3.20; 76-100%: HR\u2009=\u20092.16, 95% CI = 1.33 to 3.53, vs 1-25% exposed; Ptrend among exposed\u2009=\u2009.002), but not with prescribed radiation dose and likelihood of sun-exposed skin-area. Of all chemotherapy groups examined, only vinca alkaloids increased BCC risk (HR\u2009=\u20091.54, 95% CI = 1.04 to 2.27). CONCLUSION: CCSs have a strongly, 30-fold increased BCC risk. BCC risk appears to increase with increasing skin surface area exposed. This knowledge underscores the need for awareness by survivors and their health care providers. ",
        "Prevalence and correlates of obstructive sleep apnea among African Americans: the Jackson Heart Sleep Study. Study Objectives: African Americans have been under-represented in obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) research. This study determined the prevalence and correlates of OSA overall and by sex among African Americans in the Jackson Heart Sleep Study. Methods: Participants (N = 852) underwent a type 3 in-home sleep apnea study, 7 day wrist actigraphy and completed standardized measurements and questionnaires. OSA was defined as an apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) of \u226515, where hypopneas were defined as \u2265 4% associated desaturation. Physician diagnosis of OSA was self-reported. Logistic regression models were fit to determine the associations of demographics, socioeconomic status, sleep symptoms, actigraphy-based sleep, body mass index (BMI), and comorbidities with OSA. Results: Average age was 63.1 (standard deviation = 10.7), 66% were female, and mean BMI was 32.0 (6.9) kg/m2. Approximately 24% had an AHI \u2265 15; of those, 5% had a physician diagnosis of OSA. Prevalence of OSA increased across BMI categories, but not age groups. Men had a 12% higher prevalence of OSA compared with women, p < 0.01. Older age, male sex, higher BMI, larger neck circumference, and report of habitual snoring were independently associated with higher odds of OSA, all p < 0.05. Associations between sleep symptoms and OSA were similar for men and women. Sleepiness and waist circumference were not associated with OSA. Conclusions: There was a high prevalence of objectively measured but undiagnosed OSA in this sample of African Americans. Snoring, BMI, and neck circumference were important markers of OSA for men and women. Our results suggest that screening tools that incorporate information on sleepiness and waist circumference may be suboptimal in this population. ",
        "Adverse childhood experiences affect sleep duration for up to 50 years later. STUDY OBJECTIVES: The main objective for this study was to assess the association of adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) and subsequent short sleep duration among adults. METHODS: This cross-sectional examination used data from the 2011 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, a nationwide telephone-administered survey. Participants completed a standardized questionnaire to report childhood experiences of abuse, neglect, household challenges, and sleep time. Multinominal logistic regression analyses included survey weighting procedures and adjusted for age, race, education, income, sex, and body mass index; associations were also examined by age strata, using age as a proxy for time since ACEs occurred. RESULTS: Complete data were available for 22 403 adults (mean age = 46.66 years) including 14 587 (65%) with optimum sleep duration (7-9 h/night) and 2069 (9%) with short sleep duration (<6 h/night). Compared with adults with optimum sleep duration, the number of ACEs was associated with the odds of short sleep duration (odds ratio [OR] = 1.22, 95% CI = 1.16 to 1.28), and the odds increased as the number of ACEs increased. The association held for each decade of age until the 60s, although the magnitude attenuated. Mental health challenges or poor physical health did not account for the association. CONCLUSION: ACEs increased the odds of chronic short sleep duration during adulthood and showed both a time-dependent and dose-response nature. These associations were independent of self-reported mental health challenges or poor physical health. The association of ACEs with short sleep duration throughout the adult lifespan emphasizes the importance of child health and identifying underlying psychological challenges in adults with sleep difficulties.

        "Are U.S. adults reporting less sleep?: Findings from sleep duration trends in the National Health Interview Survey, 2004-2017. Study Objectives: To document trends in self-reported sleep duration for the noninstitutionalized U.S. civilian population from 2004 to 2017 and examine how sleep trends vary by race/ethnicity. Methods: We use data from the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) for U.S. noninstitutionalized adults aged 18-84 from 2004 to 2017 (N = 398 382). NHIS respondents were asked how much they slept in a 24-hour period on average, which we categorized as \u22646 hr (short sleep), 7-8 hr (adequate sleep), and \u22659 hr (long sleep). We used multinomial logistic regression models to examine trends in self-reported sleep duration and assess race/ethnic differences in these trends. Our models statistically adjusted for demographic, socioeconomic, familial, behavioral, and health covariates. Results: The prevalence of short sleep duration was relatively stable from 2004 to 2012. However, results from multinomial logistic regression models indicated that there was an increasing trend toward short sleep beginning in 2013 (b: 0.09, 95% CI: 0.05-0.14) that continued through 2017 (b: 0.18, 95% CI: 0.13-0.23). This trend was significantly more pronounced among Hispanics and non-Hispanic blacks, which resulted in widening racial/ethnic differences in reports of short sleep. Conclusions: Recent increases in reports of short sleep are concerning as short sleep has been linked with a number of adverse health outcomes in the population. Moreover, growing race/ethnic disparities in short sleep may have consequences for racial and ethnic health disparities. ",
        "Marijuana smoking and markers of testicular function among men from a fertility centre. STUDY QUESTION: Is marijuana smoking associated with semen quality, sperm DNA integrity or serum concentrations of reproductive hormones among subfertile men?. SUMMARY ANSWER: Men who had ever smoked marijuana had higher sperm concentration and count and lower serum FSH concentrations than men who had never smoked marijuana; no differences were observed between current and past marijuana smokers. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Studies of marijuana abuse in humans and animal models of exposure to marijuana suggest that marijuana smoking adversely impacts spermatogenesis. Data is less clear for moderate consumption levels and multiple studies have found higher serum testosterone concentrations among marijuana consumers. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: This longitudinal study included 662 subfertile men enroled at the Massachusetts General Hospital Fertility Center between 2000 and 2017. The men provided a total of 1143 semen samples; 317 men also provided blood samples in which we measured reproductive hormones. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Use of marijuana and other drugs was self-reported at baseline. Standard protocols were followed for measuring semen quality, sex hormones and DNA integrity. We used linear mixed effect models with a random intercept to evaluate the associations of self-reported marijuana smoking at enrolment with semen parameters from subsequently collected samples, and linear regression models for sperm DNA integrity and serum reproductive hormones, while adjusting for confounders including smoking and cocaine use. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: Men who had ever smoked marijuana (N = 365) had significantly higher sperm concentration (62.7 (95% confidence interval: 56.0, 70.3) million/mL) than men who had never smoked marijuana (N = 297) (45.4 (38.6, 53.3) million/mL) after adjusting for potential confounders (P = 0.0003). There were no significant differences in sperm concentration between current (N = 74) (59.5 (47.3, 74.8) million/mL) and past marijuana smokers (N = 291) (63.5 (56.1, 72.0) million/mL; P = 0.60). A similar pattern was observed for total sperm count. Furthermore, the adjusted prevalence of sperm concentration and total sperm motility below WHO reference values among marijuana smokers was less than half that of never marijuana smokers. Marijuana smokers had significantly lower follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) concentrations than never marijuana smokers (-16% (-27%, -4%)) and there were no significant differences between current and past marijuana smokers (P = 0.53). Marijuana smoking was not associated with other semen parameters, with markers of sperm DNA integrity or with reproductive hormones other than FSH. Chance findings cannot be excluded due to the multiple comparisons. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: Our results may not be generalisable to men from the general population. Marijuana smoking was self-reported and there may be misclassification of the exposure. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: These findings are not consistent with a deleterious effect of marijuana on testicular function. Whether these findings are reflective of the previously described role of the endocannabinoid system in spermatogenesis or a spurious association requires confirmation in further studies. STUDY FUNDING/COMPETING INTEREST(S): The project was funded by grants R01ES009718 and P30ES000002 from the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS). None of the authors has any conflicts of interest to declare. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: N/A. ",
        "Urinary Pharmacokinetic Profile of Cannabinoids Following Administration of Vaporized and Oral Cannabidiol and Vaporized CBD-Dominant Cannabis. Cannabis products in which cannabidiol (CBD) is the primary chemical constituent (CBD-dominant) are increasingly popular and widely available. The impact of CBD exposure on urine drug testing has not been well studied. This study characterized the urinary pharmacokinetic profile of 100-mg oral and vaporized CBD, vaporized CBD-dominant cannabis (100-mg CBD; 3.7-mg \u22069-THC) and placebo in healthy adults (n = 6) using a within-subjects crossover design. Urine specimens were collected before and for 5 days after drug administration. Immunoassay (IA) screening (cutoffs of 20, 50 and 100 ng/mL) and LC-MS-MS confirmatory tests (cutoff of 15 ng/mL) for 11-nor-9-carboxy-\u22069-tetrahydrocannabinol (\u22069-THCCOOH) were performed; urine was also analyzed for CBD and other cannabinoids. Urinary concentrations of CBD were higher after oral (mean Cmax: 776 ng/mL) versus vaporized CBD (mean Cmax: 261 ng/mL). CBD concentrations peaked 5 h after oral CBD ingestion and within 1 h after inhalation of vaporized CBD. After pure CBD administration, only 1 out of 218 urine specimens screened positive for \u22069-THCCOOH (20-ng/mL IA cutoff) and no specimens exceeded the 15-ng/mL confirmatory cutoff. After inhalation of CBD-dominant cannabis vapor, nine samples screened positive at the 20-ng/mL IA cutoff, and two of those samples screened positive at the 50-ng/mL IA cutoff. Four samples that screened positive (two at 20 ng/mL and two at 50 ng/mL) confirmed positive with concentrations of \u22069-THCCOOH exceeding 15 ng/mL. These data indicate that acute dosing of pure CBD will not result in a positive urine drug test using current federal workplace drug testing guidelines (50-ng/mL IA cutoff with 15-ng/mL confirmatory cutoff). However, CBD products that also contain \u22069-THC may produce positive urine results for \u22069-THCCOOH. Accurate labeling and regulation of \u22069-THC content in CBD/hemp products are needed to prevent unexpected positive drug tests and unintended drug effects. ",
        "Exposure to air pollution is associated with adverse cardiopulmonary health effects in international travellers. BACKGROUND: With the number of annual global travellers reaching 1.2 billion, many individuals encounter greater levels of air pollution when they travel abroad to megacities around the world. This study's objective was to determine if visits to cities abroad with greater levels of air pollution adversely impact cardiopulmonary health. METHODS: A total of 34 non-smoking healthy adult participants who travelled abroad to selected cities from the New York City (NYC) metropolitan area were pre-trained to measure lung function, blood pressure and heart rate (HR)/HR variability (HRV) and record symptoms before, during and after travelling abroad. Outdoor particulate matter (PM)2.5 concentrations were obtained from central monitors in each city. Associations between PM exposure concentrations and cardiopulmonary health endpoints were analysed using a mixed effects statistical design. RESULTS: East and South Asian cities had significantly higher PM2.5 concentrations compared with pre-travel NYC PM2.5 levels, with maximum concentrations reaching 503 \u03bcg/m3. PM exposure-related associations for lung function were statistically significant and strongest between evening Forced Expiratory Volume in the first second (FEV1) and same-day morning PM2.5 concentrations; a 10-\u03bcg/m3 increase in outdoor PM2.5 was associated with a mean decrease of 7 mL. Travel to a highly polluted city (PM2.5\u2009>\u2009100 \u03bcg/m3) was associated with a 209-ml reduction in evening FEV1 compared with a low polluted city (PM2.5\u2009<\u200935 \u03bcg/m3). In general, participants who travelled to East and South Asian cities experienced increased respiratory symptoms/scores and changes in HR and HRV. CONCLUSIONS: Exposure to increased levels of PM2.5 in cities abroad caused small but statistically significant acute changes in cardiopulmonary function and respiratory symptoms in healthy young adults. These data suggest that travel-related exposure to increased PM2.5 adversely impacts cardiopulmonary health, which may be particularly important for travellers with pre-existing respiratory or cardiac disease.

        "High glycemic index and glycemic load diets as risk factors for insomnia: analyses from the Women's Health Initiative. BACKGROUND: Previous studies have shown mixed results on the association between carbohydrate intake and insomnia. However, any influence that refined carbohydrates have on risk of insomnia is likely commensurate with their relative contribution to the overall diet, so studies are needed that measure overall dietary glycemic index (GI), glycemic load, and intakes of specific types of carbohydrates. OBJECTIVE: We hypothesized that higher GI and glycemic load would be associated with greater odds of insomnia prevalence and incidence. METHODS: This was a prospective cohort study with postmenopausal women who participated in the Women's Health Initiative Observational Study, investigating the relations of GI, glycemic load, other carbohydrate measures (added sugars, starch, total carbohydrate), dietary fiber, and specific carbohydrate-containing foods (whole grains, nonwhole/refined grains, nonjuice fruits, vegetables, dairy products) with odds of insomnia at baseline (between 1994 and 1998; n\u00a0=\u00a077,860) and after 3 y of follow-up (between 1997 and 2001; n\u00a0=\u00a053,069). RESULTS: In cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses, higher dietary GI was associated with increasing odds of prevalent (fifth compared with first quintile OR: 1.11; CI: 1.05, 1.16; P-trend = 0.0014) and incident (fifth compared with first quintile OR: 1.16; CI: 1.08, 1.25; P-trend < 0.0001) insomnia in fully adjusted models. Higher intakes of dietary added sugars, starch, and nonwhole/refined grains were each associated with higher odds of incident insomnia. By contrast, higher nonjuice fruit and vegetable intakes were significantly associated with lower odds of incident insomnia. Also, higher intakes of dietary fiber, whole grains, nonjuice fruit, and vegetables were significantly associated with lower odds of prevalent insomnia. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that high-GI diets could be a risk factor for insomnia in postmenopausal women. Substitution of high-GI foods with minimally processed, whole, fiber-rich carbohydrates should be evaluated as potential treatments of, and primary preventive measures for, insomnia in postmenopausal women.

        "An Exploration of the Impact of Non-Dependent Parental Drinking on Children. AIMS: To examine the impact of non-dependent parental drinking on UK children aged 10-17. METHODS: Cross-sectional survey of UK parents and their children in 2017 (administered to one parent in a household, then their child, totaling 997 adults and 997 children), providing linked data on parental drinking from parent and child perspectives. The survey included measures of parents' alcohol consumption and drinking motivations (both reported by parents) and children's exposure to their parent's drinking patterns and children's experiences of negative outcomes following their parent's drinking (both reported by children), plus sociodemographic measures. RESULTS: Logistic regression analysis indicates a significant positive association between parental consumption level and children reporting experiencing negative outcomes. Witnessing a parent tipsy or drunk and having a parent who reported predominantly negative drinking motives were also associated with increased likelihood of children reporting experiencing negative outcomes. Age was also associated, with older children less likely to report experiencing negative outcomes following their parent's drinking. CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest levels of and motivations for parental drinking, as well as exposure to a parent tipsy or drunk, all influence children's likelihood of experiencing negative outcomes.

        "Yoga in the workplace and health outcomes: a systematic review. BACKGROUND: Health promotion in the workplace is intended to enhance employee health and well-being. Yoga programmes are easy to implement and have been effective in the management of various health conditions. AIMS: To assess the evidence regarding the effectiveness of yoga programmes at work. METHODS: A search of electronic databases of published studies up until the 1st of April 2017. Inclusion criteria for the systematic review were randomized controlled trials of adult employees and yoga in the workplace. Quality appraisal was carried out using the Cochrane Collaboration's tool for assessing risk of bias in randomized trials. RESULTS: Of 1343 papers identified, 13 studies met the inclusion criteria. Nine out of 13 trials were classified as having an unclear risk of bias. The overall effects of yoga on mental health outcomes were beneficial, mainly on stress. Most of the cardiovascular endpoints showed no differences between yoga and controls. Other outcomes reported positive effects of yoga or no change. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study suggest that yoga has a positive effect on health in the workplace, particularly in reducing stress, and no negative effects were reported in any of the randomized controlled trials. Further larger studies are required to confirm this. ",
        "The Influence of Number and Timing of Pregnancies on Breast Cancer Risk for Women With BRCA1 or BRCA2 Mutations. Background: Full-term pregnancy (FTP) is associated with a reduced breast cancer (BC) risk over time, but women are at increased BC risk in the immediate years following an FTP. No large prospective studies, however, have examined whether the number and timing of pregnancies are associated with BC risk for BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers. Methods: Using weighted and time-varying Cox proportional hazards models, we investigated whether reproductive events are associated with BC risk for mutation carriers using a retrospective cohort (5707 BRCA1 and 3525 BRCA2 mutation carriers) and a prospective cohort (2276 BRCA1 and 1610 BRCA2 mutation carriers), separately for each cohort and the combined prospective and retrospective cohort. Results: For BRCA1 mutation carriers, there was no overall association with parity compared with nulliparity (combined hazard ratio [HRc]\u2009=\u20090.99, 95% confidence interval [CI]\u2009=\u20090.83 to 1.18). Relative to being uniparous, an increased number of FTPs was associated with decreased BC risk (HRc\u2009=\u20090.79, 95% CI\u2009=\u20090.69 to 0.91; HRc\u2009=\u20090.70, 95% CI\u2009=\u20090.59 to 0.82; HRc\u2009=\u20090.50, 95% CI\u2009=\u20090.40 to 0.63, for 2, 3, and \u22654 FTPs, respectively, Ptrend < .0001) and increasing duration of breastfeeding was associated with decreased BC risk (combined cohort Ptrend\u2009=\u2009.0003). Relative to being nulliparous, uniparous BRCA1 mutation carriers were at increased BC risk in the prospective analysis (prospective hazard ration [HRp]\u2009=\u20091.69, 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.09 to 2.62). For BRCA2 mutation carriers, being parous was associated with a 30% increase in BC risk (HRc\u2009=\u20091.33, 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.05 to 1.69), and there was\u00a0no apparent decrease in risk associated with multiparity except for having at least 4 FTPs vs. 1 FTP (HRc\u2009=\u20090.72, 95% CI\u2009=\u20090.54 to 0.98). Conclusions: These findings suggest differential associations with parity between BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers with higher risk for uniparous BRCA1 carriers and parous BRCA2 carriers. ",
        "Employment changes following breast cancer diagnosis: the effects of race and place. The financial implications of breast cancer diagnosis may be greater among rural and Black women. Women with incident breast cancer were recruited as part of the Carolina Breast Cancer Study. We compared unadjusted and adjusted prevalence of cancer-related job or income loss, and a composite measure of either outcome, by rural residence and stratified by race. 2,435 women were included, 11.7% were rural, 48.5% were Black, and 38.0% reported employment changes after diagnosis. Rural women more often reported employment effects, including reduced household income (43.6% vs. 35.4%, two-sided chi-square test p\u2009=\u20090.04). Rural White, rural Black, and urban Black women each more often reported income reduction (statistically significant vs. urban White women), although these groups did not meaningfully differ from each other. In multivariable regression, rural differences were mediated by socioeconomic factors but racial differences remained. Programs and policies to reduce financial toxicity in vulnerable patients should address indirect costs of cancer, including lost wages and employment. ",
        "Sustained weight loss and risk of breast cancer in women \u226550 years: a pooled analysis of prospective data. BACKGROUND: Excess body weight is an established cause of postmenopausal breast cancer, but it is unknown if weight loss reduces risk. METHODS: Associations between weight change and risk of breast cancer were examined among women aged \u226550 years in the Pooling Project of Prospective Studies of Diet and Cancer. In 10 cohorts, weight assessed on three surveys was used to examine weight change patterns over approximately 10 years (Interval 1 median= 5.2 years; Interval 2 median = 4.0 years). Sustained weight loss was defined as\u2009\u2265\u20092kg lost in Interval 1 that was not regained in Interval 2. Among 180,885 women, 6,930 invasive breast cancers were identified during follow-up. RESULTS: Compared with women with stable weight (\u00b1 2kg), women with sustained weight loss had a lower risk of breast cancer. This risk reduction was linear and specific to women not using postmenopausal hormones (>2-4.5kg lost: Hazard Ratio (HR)= 0.82, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.70-0.96; >4.5-<9kg lost: HR\u2009=\u20090.75, 95% CI: 0.63-0.90; \u22659kg lost: HR\u2009=\u20090.68, 95% CI: 0.50-0.93). Women who lost \u22659kg and gained some (but not all) of it back were also at a lower risk of breast cancer. Other patterns of weight loss and gain over the two intervals had a similar risk of breast cancer to women with stable weight. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that sustained weight loss, even modest amounts, is associated with lower breast cancer risk for women aged \u226550 years. Breast cancer prevention may be a strong weight loss motivator for the two-thirds of American women who are overweight or obese. ",
        "Randomized controlled trial investigating the effects of a breastfeeding relaxation intervention on maternal psychological state, breast milk outcomes, and infant behavior and growth. BACKGROUND: Biological signaling and communication between mothers and infants during breastfeeding may shape infant behavior and feeding. This signaling is complex and little explored in humans, although it is potentially relevant for initiatives to improve breastfeeding rates. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to investigate physiological and psychological aspects of mother-infant signaling during breastfeeding experimentally, testing the effects of a relaxation intervention on maternal psychological state, breast milk intake, milk cortisol levels, and infant behavior and growth. METHODS: Primiparous breastfeeding mothers and full-term infants were randomly assigned to receive relaxation therapy [intervention relaxation group; n\u00a0=\u00a033 (RG)] or to the control group [n\u00a0=\u00a031 (CG); no relaxation therapy] at 2 wk postpartum. Both groups received standard breastfeeding support. Home visits were conducted at 2 (HV1), 6 (HV2), 12 (HV3) and 14 (HV4) wk to measure maternal stress and anxiety, breast milk intake and milk cortisol, and infant behavior and growth. RESULTS: RG mothers had lower stress scores postintervention than the CG (HV3 \u2206\u00a0=\u00a0-3.13; 95% CI: -5.9, -0.3) and lower hindmilk cortisol at HV1 (\u2206\u00a0=\u00a0-44.5%; 95% CI: -76.1%, -12.9%) but not at HV2. RG infants had longer sleep duration (\u2206\u00a0=\u00a082 min/d; 95% CI: 16, 149 min/d) at HV2 and higher gains in weight and body mass index standardized deviation score than the CG infants (\u2206\u00a0=\u00a00.76; 95% CI: 0.3, 1.22; and \u2206\u00a0=\u00a00.59; 95% CI: 0.09, 1.1, respectively). RG infants had a mean milk intake at HV3 that was 227 g/d higher than that of the CG infants (P\u00a0=\u00a00.031) after controlling for gender and milk intake at HV1. CONCLUSIONS: The trial shows the effectiveness of a simple relaxation intervention for improving maternal and infant outcomes and identifies some potential signaling mechanisms for investigation in future and larger studies, especially in settings where mothers are more stressed, such as those with preterm or low birth weight infants. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT01971216. ",
        "A population-based study of cardiovascular disease mortality risk in US cancer patients. AIMS: This observational study characterized cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality risk for multiple cancer sites, with respect to the following: (i) continuous calendar year, (ii) age at diagnosis, and (iii) follow-up time after diagnosis. METHODS AND RESULTS: The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program was used to compare the US general population to 3 234 256 US cancer survivors (1973-2012). Standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) were calculated using coded cause of death from CVDs (heart disease, hypertension, cerebrovascular disease, atherosclerosis, and aortic aneurysm/dissection). Analyses were adjusted by age, race, and sex. Among 28 cancer types, 1 228 328 patients (38.0%) died from cancer and 365 689 patients (11.3%) died from CVDs. Among CVDs, 76.3% of deaths were due to heart disease. In eight cancer sites, CVD mortality risk surpassed index-cancer mortality risk in at least one calendar year. Cardiovascular disease mortality risk was highest in survivors diagnosed at <35\u2009years of age. Further, CVD mortality risk is highest (SMR 3.93, 95% confidence interval 3.89-3.97) within the first year after cancer diagnosis, and CVD mortality risk remains elevated throughout follow-up compared to the general population. CONCLUSION: The majority of deaths from CVD occur in patients diagnosed with breast, prostate, or bladder cancer. We observed that from the point of cancer diagnosis forward into survivorship cancer patients (all sites) are at elevated risk of dying from CVDs compared to the general US population. In endometrial cancer, the first year after diagnosis poses a very high risk of dying from CVDs, supporting early involvement of cardiologists in such patients. ",
        "Association of Arsenic Exposure With Cardiac Geometry and Left Ventricular Function in Young Adults. BACKGROUND: Arsenic exposure has been related to numerous adverse cardiovascular outcomes. The aim of this study was to investigate the cross-sectional and prospective association between arsenic exposure with echocardiographic measures of left ventricular (LV) geometry and functioning. METHODS: A total of 1337 young adult participants free of diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease were recruited from the SHFS (Strong Heart Family Study). The sum of inorganic and methylated arsenic concentrations in urine (\u03a3As) at baseline was used as a biomarker of arsenic exposure. LV geometry and functioning were assessed using transthoracic echocardiography at baseline and follow-up. RESULTS: Mean follow-up was 5.6 years, and median (interquartile range) of \u03a3As was 4.2 (2.8-6.9) \u00b5g/g creatinine. Increased arsenic exposure was associated with prevalent LV hypertrophy, with an odds ratio (95% CI) per a 2-fold increase in \u03a3As of 1.47 (1.05-2.08) in all participants and of 1.58 (1.04-2.41) among prehypertensive or hypertensive individuals. Measures of LV geometry, including LV mass index, left atrial systolic diameter, interventricular septum, and LV posterior wall thickness, were positively and significantly related to arsenic exposure. Among measures of LV functioning, stroke volume, and ejection fraction were associated with arsenic exposure. CONCLUSIONS: Arsenic exposure was related to an increase in LV wall thickness and LV hypertrophy in young American Indians with a low burden of cardiovascular risk factors. The relationship was stronger in participants with prehypertension or hypertension, suggesting that potential cardiotoxic effects of arsenic might be more pronounced in individuals already undergoing cardiovascular adaptive mechanisms following elevated systemic blood pressure.

        "Evidence for a Direct Harmful Effect of Alcohol on Myocardial Health: A Large Cross-Sectional Study of Consumption Patterns and Cardiovascular Disease Risk Biomarkers From Northwest Russia, 2015 to 2017. Background Alcohol drinking is an increasingly recognized risk factor for cardiovascular disease. However, there are few studies of the impact of harmful and hazardous drinking on biomarkers of myocardial health. We conducted a study in Russia to investigate the impact of heavy drinking on biomarkers of cardiac damage and inflammation. Methods and Results The Know Your Heart study recruited a random sample of 2479 participants from the population of northwest Russia (general population) plus 278 patients (narcology clinic subsample) with alcohol problems. The general population sample was categorized into harmful drinkers, hazardous drinkers, nonproblem drinkers, and nondrinkers, according to self-reported level of alcohol consumption, whereas the narcology clinic sample was treated as the separate group in the analysis. Measurements were made of the following: (1) high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T, (2) NT-proBNP (N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide), and (3) hsCRP (high-sensitivity C-reactive protein). The narcology clinic subsample had the most extreme drinking pattern and the highest levels of all 3 biomarkers relative to nonproblem drinkers in the general population: high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T was elevated by 10.3% (95% CI, 3.7%-17.4%), NT-proBNP by 46.7% (95% CI, 26.8%-69.8%), and hsCRP by 69.2% (95% CI, 43%-100%). In the general population sample, NT-proBNP was 31.5% (95% CI, 3.4%-67.2%) higher among harmful drinkers compared with nonproblem drinkers. Overall, NT-proBNP and hsCRP increased with increasing intensity of alcohol exposure (test of trend P<0.001). Conclusions These results support the hypothesis that heavy alcohol drinking has an adverse effect on cardiac structure and function that may not be driven by atherosclerosis. ",
        "Increased Physical Activity Post-Myocardial Infarction Is Related to Reduced Mortality: Results From the SWEDEHEART Registry. Background: With increasing survival rates among patients with myocardial infarction ( MI ), more demands are placed on secondary prevention. While physical activity ( PA ) efforts to obtain a sufficient PA level are part of secondary preventive recommendations, it is still underutilized. Importantly, the effect of changes in PA after MI is largely unknown. Therefore, we sought to investigate the effect on survival from changes in PA level, post- MI . . Methods and Results: Data from Swedish national registries were combined, totaling 22\u00a0227 patients with MI . PA level was self-reported at 6 to 10\u00a0weeks post- MI and 10 to 12\u00a0months post- MI . Patients were classified as constantly inactive, increased activity, reduced activity, and constantly active. Proportional hazard ratios were calculated. During 100\u00a0502\u00a0person-years of follow-up (mean follow-up time 4.2\u00a0years), a total of 1087 deaths were recorded. Controlling for important confounders (including left ventricular function, type of MI , medication, smoking, participation in cardiac rehabilitation program, quality of life, and estimated kidney function), we found lower mortality rates among constantly active (hazard ratio: 0.29, 95% confidence interval: 0.21-0.41), those with increased activity (0.41, 95% confidence interval: 0.31-0.55), and those with reduced activity (hazard ratio: 0.56, 95% confidence interval: 0.45-0.69) during the first year post- MI , compared with those being constantly inactive. Stratified analyses indicated strong effect of PA level among both sexes, across age, MI type, kidney function, medication, and smoking status. . Conclusions: The present article shows that increasing the PA level, compared with staying inactive the first year post- MI , was related to reduced mortality. ",
        "Tracking Cardiac Rehabilitation Participation and Completion Among Medicare Beneficiaries to Inform the Efforts of a National Initiative. BACKGROUND: Despite cardiac rehabilitation (CR) being shown to improve health outcomes among patients with heart disease, its use has been suboptimal. In response, the Million Hearts Cardiac Rehabilitation Collaborative developed a road map to improve CR use, including increasing participation rates to \u226570% by 2022. This observational study provides current estimates to measure progress and identifies the populations and regions most at risk for CR service underutilization. METHODS AND RESULTS: We identified Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries who were CR eligible in 2016, and assessed CR participation (\u22651 CR session attended), timely initiation (participation within 21 days of event), and completion (\u226536 sessions attended) through 2017. Measures were assessed overall, by beneficiary characteristics and geography, and by primary CR-qualifying event type (acute myocardial infarction hospitalization; coronary artery bypass surgery; heart valve repair/replacement; percutaneous coronary intervention; or heart/heart-lung transplant). Among 366 103 CR-eligible beneficiaries, 89 327 (24.4%) participated in CR, of whom 24.3% initiated within 21 days and 26.9% completed CR. Eligibility was highest in the East South Central Census Division (14.8 per 1000). Participation decreased with increasing age, was lower among women (18.9%) compared with men (28.6%; adjusted prevalence ratio: 0.91 [95% CI, 0.90-0.93]) was lower among Hispanics (13.2%) and non-Hispanic blacks (13.6%) compared with non-Hispanic whites (25.8%; adjusted prevalence ratio: 0.63 [0.61-0.66] and 0.70 [0.67-0.72], respectively), and varied by hospital referral region and Census Division (range: 18.6% [East South Central] to 39.1% [West North Central]) and by qualifying event type (range: 7.1% [acute myocardial infarction without procedure] to 55.3% [coronary artery bypass surgery only]). Timely initiation varied by geography and qualifying event type; completion varied by geography. CONCLUSIONS: Only 1 in 4 CR-eligible Medicare beneficiaries participated in CR and marked disparities were observed. Reinforcement of current effective strategies and development of new strategies will be critical to address the noted disparities and achieve the 70% participation goal. ",
        "Projected Changes in Maternal Heat Exposure During Early Pregnancy and the Associated Congenital Heart Defect Burden in the United States. Background: More intense and longer-lasting heat events are expected in the United States as a consequence of climate change. This study aimed to project the potential changes in maternal heat exposure during early pregnancy (3-8\u00a0weeks post conception) and the associated burden of congenital heart defects ( CHD s) in the future. . Methods and Results: This study expanded on a prior nationwide case-control study that evaluated the association between CHD s and maternal heat exposure during early pregnancy in summer and spring. We defined multiple indicators of heat exposure, and applied published odds ratios obtained for the matching season of the baseline (1995-2005) into the projection period (2025-2035) to estimate potential changes in CHD burden throughout the United States. Increases in maternal heat exposure were projected across the United States and to be larger in the summer. The Midwest will potentially have the highest increase in summer maternal exposure to excessively hot days (3.42; 95% CI, 2.99-3.88 per pregnancy), heat event frequency (0.52; 95% CI, 0.44-0.60) and heat event duration (1.73; 95% CI, 1.49-1.97). We also found large increases in specific CHD subtypes during spring, including a 34.0% (95% CI, 4.9%-70.8%) increase in conotruncal CHD in the South and a 38.6% (95% CI , 9.9%-75.1%) increase in atrial septal defect in the Northeast. . Conclusions: Projected increases in maternal heat exposure could result in an increased CHD burden in certain seasons and regions of the United States. ",
        "Dog Ownership and Survival: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis. BACKGROUND: Dog ownership has been associated with decreased cardiovascular risk. Recent reports have suggested an association of dog companionship with lower blood pressure levels, improved lipid profile, and diminished sympathetic responses to stress. However, it is unclear if dog ownership is associated with improved survival as previous studies have yielded inconsistent results. Thus, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the association of dog ownership with all-cause mortality, with and without prior cardiovascular disease, and cardiovascular mortality. METHODS AND RESULTS: Studies published between 1950 and May 24, 2019 were identified by searching Embase and PubMed. Observational studies that evaluated baseline dog ownership and subsequent all-cause mortality or cardiovascular mortality. Two independent reviewers extracted the data. We assessed pooled data using random-effects model. A possible limitation was that the analyses were not adjusted for confounders. Ten studies were included yielding data from 3\u2009837\u2009005 participants (530\u2009515 events; mean follow-up 10.1 years). Dog ownership was associated with a 24% risk reduction for all-cause mortality as compared to nonownership (relative risk, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.67-0.86) with 6 studies demonstrating significant reduction in the risk of death. Notably, in individuals with prior coronary events, living in a home with a dog was associated with an even more pronounced risk reduction for all-cause mortality (relative risk, 0.35; 95% CI, 0.17-0.69; I2, 0%). Moreover, when we restricted the analyses to studies evaluating cardiovascular mortality, dog ownership conferred a 31% risk reduction for cardiovascular death (relative risk, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.67-0.71; I2, 5.1%). CONCLUSIONS: Dog ownership is associated with lower risk of death over the long term, which is possibly driven by a reduction in cardiovascular mortality. Systematic Review Registration URL: http://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/. Unique identifier: CRD42018111048. Dog Ownership and Survival After a Major Cardiovascular Event: A Register-Based Prospective Study. BACKGROUND: Dog ownership is associated with increased physical activity levels and increased social support, both of which could improve the outcome after a major cardiovascular event. Dog ownership may be particularly important in single-occupancy households where ownership provides substitutive companionship and motivation for physical activity. METHODS AND RESULTS: We used the Swedish National Patient Register to identify all patients aged 40 to 85 presenting with an acute myocardial infarction (n=181\u2009696; 5.7% dog ownership) or ischemic stroke (n=154\u2009617; 4.8% dog ownership) between January 1, 2001 and December 31, 2012. Individual information was linked across registers for cause of death, sociodemographic, and dog ownership data. We evaluated all-cause mortality and risk of recurrent hospitalization for the same cause until December 31, 2012. Models were adjusted for socioeconomic, health, and demographic factors at study inclusion such as age, marital status, the presence of children in the home, area of residence, and income, as well as all registered comorbidities and hospitalization for cardiovascular disease in the past 5 years. Dog owners had a lower risk of death after hospitalization for acute myocardial infarction during the full follow-up period of 804\u2009137 person-years, with an adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of 0.67 (95% CI, 0.61 to 0.75) for those who lived alone, and HR of 0.85 (95% CI, 0.80 to 0.90) for those living with a partner or a child. Similarly, after an ischemic stroke, dog owners were at lower risk of death during the full follow-up of 638\u2009219 person-years adjusted HR of 0.73 (95% CI, 0.66 to 0.80) for those who lived alone and HR of 0.88 (95% CI, 0.83 to 0.93) for those living with a partner or a child. We further found an association of dog ownership with reduced risk of hospitalization for recurrent myocardial infarction (HR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.87 to 0.99). CONCLUSIONS: We found evidence of an association of dog ownership with a better outcome after a major cardiovascular event. Although our models are adjusted for many potential confounders, there are also unmeasured confounders such as smoking that prevent us from drawing conclusions regarding a possible causal effect. ",
        "Geographic Trends, Patient Characteristics, and Outcomes of Infective Endocarditis Associated With Drug Abuse in the United States From\u00a02002 to 2016. Background: There has been an increase in the prevalence of drug abuse (DA) in the national opioid epidemic. With increasing DA, there is an increased risk of infective endocarditis (IE). There are limited recent data evaluating national trends on the incidence and geographical distribution of DA-IE. We aim to investigate those numbers as well as the determinants of outcome in this patient population. . Methods and Results: Hospitalized patients with a primary or secondary diagnosis of IE based on the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth and Tenth Revisions (ICD-9, ICD-10) were included. We described the national and geographical trends in DA-IE. We also compared DA-IE patients' characteristics and outcomes to those with IE, but without associated drug abuse (non-DA-IE) using Poisson regression models. Incidence of DA-IE has nearly doubled between 2002 and 2016 All US regions were affected, and the Midwest had the highest increase in DA-IE hospitalizations (annual percent change=4.9%). Patients with DA-IE were younger, more commonly white males, poorer, had fewer comorbidities, and were more likely to have human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis C, concomitant alcohol abuse, and liver disease. Their length of stay was longer (9\u00a0versus 7\u00a0days; P<0.001) and were more likely to undergo cardiac surgery (7.8% versus 6.2%; P<0.001), but their inpatient mortality was lower (6.4% versus 9.1%; P<0.001). . Conclusions: DA-IE is rising at an alarming rate in the United States. All regions of the United States are affected, with the Midwest having the highest increase in rate. Young-adult, poor, white males were the most affected. ",
        "Cost-Related Medication Nonadherence in Adults With Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease in the United States, 2013 to 2017. BACKGROUND: Medication nonadherence is associated with worse outcomes in patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), a group who requires long-term therapy for secondary prevention. It is important to understand to what extent drug costs, which are potentially actionable factors, contribute to medication nonadherence. METHODS: In a nationally representative survey of US adults in the National Health Interview Survey (2013-2017), we identified individuals \u226518 years with a reported history of ASCVD. Participants were considered to have experienced cost-related nonadherence (CRN) if in the preceding 12 months they reported skipping doses to save money, taking less medication to save money, or delaying filling a prescription to save money. We used survey analysis to obtain national estimates. RESULTS: Of the 14\u2009279 surveyed individuals with ASCVD, a weighted 12.6% (or 2.2 million [95% CI, 2.1-2.4]) experienced CRN, including 8.6% or 1.5 million missing doses, 8.8% or 1.6 million taking lower than prescribed doses, and 10.5% or 1.9 million intentionally delaying a medication fill to save costs. Age <65 years, female sex, low family income, lack of health insurance, and high comorbidity burden were independently associated with CRN, with >1 in 5 reporting CRN in these subgroups. Survey respondents with CRN compared with those without CRN had 10.8-fold higher odds of requesting low-cost medications and 8.9-fold higher odds of using alternative, nonprescription, therapies. CONCLUSIONS: One in 8 patients with ASCVD reports nonadherence to medications because of cost. The removal of financial barriers to accessing medications, particularly among vulnerable patient groups, may help improve adherence to essential therapy to reduce ASCVD morbidity and mortality. ",
        "Identification of Racial Inequities in Access to Specialized Inpatient Heart Failure Care at an Academic Medical Center. BACKGROUND: Racial inequities for patients with heart failure (HF) have been widely documented. HF patients who receive cardiology care during a hospital admission have better outcomes. It is unknown whether there are differences in admission to a cardiology or general medicine service by race. This study examined the relationship between race and admission service, and its effect on 30-day readmission and mortality Methods: We performed a retrospective cohort study from September 2008 to November 2017 at a single large urban academic referral center of all patients self-referred to the emergency department and admitted to either the cardiology or general medicine service with a principal diagnosis of HF, who self-identified as white, black, or Latinx. We used multivariable generalized estimating equation models to assess the relationship between race and admission to the cardiology service. We used Cox regression to assess the association between race, admission service, and 30-day readmission and mortality. RESULTS: Among 1967 unique patients (66.7% white, 23.6% black, and 9.7% Latinx), black and Latinx patients had lower rates of admission to the cardiology service than white patients (adjusted rate ratio, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.84-0.98, for black; adjusted rate ratio, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.72-0.97 for Latinx). Female sex and age >75 years were also independently associated with lower rates of admission to the cardiology service. Admission to the cardiology service was independently associated with decreased readmission within 30 days, independent of race. CONCLUSIONS: Black and Latinx patients were less likely to be admitted to cardiology for HF care. This inequity may, in part, drive racial inequities in HF outcomes. ",
        "Cardio-Oncology Rehabilitation to Manage Cardiovascular Outcomes in Cancer Patients and Survivors: A Scientific Statement From the American Heart Association. Cardiovascular disease is a competing cause of death in patients with cancer with early-stage disease. This elevated cardiovascular disease risk is thought to derive from both the direct effects of cancer therapies and the accumulation of risk factors such as hypertension, weight gain, cigarette smoking, and loss of cardiorespiratory fitness. Effective and viable strategies are needed to mitigate cardiovascular disease risk in this population; a multimodal model such as cardiac rehabilitation may be a potential solution. This statement from the American Heart Association provides an overview of the existing knowledge and rationale for the use of cardiac rehabilitation to provide structured exercise and ancillary services to cancer patients and survivors. This document introduces the concept of cardio-oncology rehabilitation, which includes identification of patients with cancer at high risk for cardiac dysfunction and a description of the cardiac rehabilitation infrastructure needed to address the unique exposures and complications related to cancer care. In this statement, we also discuss the need for future research to fully implement a multimodal model of cardiac rehabilitation for patients with cancer and to determine whether reimbursement of these services is clinically warranted.

        "Fall Risk and Outcomes Among Patients Hospitalized With Cardiovascular Disease in the Community. Background: As the population with cardiovascular disease ages, geriatric conditions are of increasing relevance. A possible geriatric prognostic indicator may be a fall risk score, which is mandated by The Joint Commission to be measured on all hospitalized patients. The prognostic value of a fall risk score on outcomes after dismissal is not well known. Thus, we aimed to determine whether a fall risk score is associated with death and hospital readmissions in patients with a recent incident cardiovascular disease event. . Methods and Results: In this retrospective cohort study, Olmsted County, MN patients with incident heart failure, myocardial infarction, or atrial fibrillation between August 1, 2005, and December 31, 2011, who were hospitalized within 180 days after the event were studied. Fall risk was measured by the Hendrich II fall risk model. Patients were followed for death or readmission within 30 days or 1 year. Among 2456 hospitalized patients with recent incident cardiovascular disease (549 heart failure, 784 myocardial infarction, 1123 atrial fibrillation; mean [SD] age, 71 [15] years; 55% men), the fall risk score was high in 22% of patients and moderate in 38%. The risk of death was increased if the fall risk score was increased, independent of age and comorbidities (moderate hazard ratio, 1.51; 95% CI, 1.09-2.08; high hazard ratio, 3.49; 95% CI, 2.52-4.85). Similarly, the risk of 30-day readmissions was substantially increased with a greater fall risk score (moderate hazard ratio, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.03-1.62; high hazard ratio, 1.63; 95% CI, 1.23-2.15). Results were similar for readmissions within 1 year. . Conclusions: More than half of hospitalized patients with recent incident cardiovascular disease have an elevated fall risk score, which is associated with an increased risk in readmissions and death. These results delineate an approach for risk stratification and management that may prevent readmissions and improve survival. ",
        "County-Level Hispanic Ethnic Density and Cardiovascular Disease Mortality. Background: Hispanics are the fastest growing ethnic group in the United States, and little is known about how Hispanic ethnic population density impacts cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) mortality. . Methods and Results: We examined county-level deaths for Hispanics and non-Hispanic whites from 2003 to 2012 using data from the National Center for Health Statistics' Multiple Cause of Death mortality files. Counties with more than 20 Hispanic deaths (n=715) were included in the analyses. CVD deaths were identified using International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10), I00 to I78, and population estimates were calculated using linear interpolation from 2000 and 2010 census data. Multivariate linear regression was used to examine the association of Hispanic ethnic density with Hispanic and non-Hispanic white age-adjusted CVD mortality rates. County-level age-adjusted CVD mortality rates were adjusted for county-level demographic, socioeconomic, and healthcare factors. There were a total of 4\u00a0769\u00a0040 deaths among Hispanics (n=382\u00a0416) and non-Hispanic whites (n=4\u00a0386\u00a0624). Overall, cardiovascular age-adjusted mortality rates were higher among non-Hispanic whites compared with Hispanics (244.8 versus 189.0 per 100\u00a0000). Hispanic density ranged from 1% to 96% in each county. Counties in the highest compared with lowest category of Hispanic density had 60% higher Hispanic mortality (215.3 versus 134.2 per 100\u00a0000 population). In linear regression models, after adjusting for county-level demographic, socioeconomic, and healthcare factors, increasing Hispanic ethnic density remained strongly associated with mortality for Hispanics but not for non-Hispanic whites. . Conclusions: CVD mortality is higher in counties with higher Hispanic ethnic density.

As early and effective antiretroviral therapy has become more widespread, HIV has transitioned from a progressive, fatal disease to a chronic, manageable disease marked by elevated risk of chronic comorbid diseases, including cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). Rates of myocardial infarction, heart failure, stroke, and other CVD manifestations, including pulmonary hypertension and sudden cardiac death, are significantly higher for people living with HIV than for uninfected control subjects, even in the setting of HIV viral suppression with effective antiretroviral therapy. These elevated risks generally persist after demographic and clinical risk factors are accounted for and may be partly attributed to chronic inflammation and immune dysregulation. Data on long-term CVD outcomes in HIV are limited by the relatively recent epidemiological transition of HIV to a chronic disease. Therefore, our understanding of CVD pathogenesis, prevention, and treatment in HIV relies on large observational studies, randomized controlled trials of HIV therapies that are underpowered to detect CVD end points, and small interventional studies examining surrogate CVD end points. The purpose of this document is to provide a thorough review of the existing evidence on HIV-associated CVD, in particular atherosclerotic CVD (including myocardial infarction and stroke) and heart failure, as well as pragmatic recommendations on how to approach CVD prevention and treatment in HIV in the absence of large-scale randomized controlled trial data. This statement is intended for clinicians caring for people with HIV, individuals living with HIV, and clinical and translational researchers interested in HIV-associated CVD. ",
        "Associations of Income Volatility With Incident Cardiovascular Disease and All-Cause Mortality in a US Cohort. BACKGROUND: Income volatility is on the rise and presents a growing public health problem. Because in many epidemiological studies income is measured at a single point in time, the association of long-term income volatility with incident cardiovascular disease (CVD) and mortality has not been adequately explored. The goal of this study was to examine associations of income volatility from 1990 to 2005 with incident CVD and all-cause mortality in the subsequent 10 years. METHODS: The Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults Study is an ongoing prospective cohort study conducted within urban field centers in Birmingham, AL; Chicago, IL; Minneapolis, MN; and Oakland, CA. We studied 3937 black and white participants 23 to 35 years of age in 1990 (our study baseline). Income volatility was defined as the intraindividual SD of the percent change in income across 5 assessments from 1990 to 2005. An income drop was defined as a decrease of \u226525% from the previous visit and less than the participant's average income from 1990 to 2005. CVD events (fatal and nonfatal) and all-cause mortality between 2005 and 2015 were adjudicated with the use of medical records and death certificates. CVD included primarily acute events related to heart disease and stroke. RESULTS: A total of 106 CVD events and 164 deaths occurred between 2005 and 2015 (incident rate, 2.76 and 3.66 per 1000 person-years, respectively). From Cox models adjusted for sociodemographic, behavioral, and CVD risk factors, higher income volatility and more income drops were associated with greater CVD risk (high versus low volatility: hazard ratio, 2.07; 95% CI, 1.10-3.90; \u22652 versus 0 income drops: hazard ratio, 2.54; 95% CI, 1.24-5.19) and all-cause mortality (high versus low volatility: hazard ratio, 1.78; 95% CI,1.03-3.09; \u22652 versus 0 income drops: hazard ratio, 1.92; 95% CI, 1.07-3.44). CONCLUSIONS: In a cohort of relatively young adults, income volatility and drops during a 15-year period of formative earning years were independently associated with a nearly 2-fold risk of CVD and all-cause mortality.

        "Association Between Residential Greenness and Cardiovascular Disease Risk. Background: Exposure to green vegetation has been linked to positive health, but the pathophysiological processes affected by exposure to vegetation remain unclear. To study the relationship between greenness and cardiovascular disease, we examined the association between residential greenness and biomarkers of cardiovascular injury and disease risk in susceptible individuals. . Methods and Results: In this cross-sectional study of 408 individuals recruited from a preventive cardiology clinic, we measured biomarkers of cardiovascular injury and risk in participant blood and urine. We estimated greenness from satellite-derived normalized difference vegetation index ( NDVI ) in zones with radii of 250\u00a0m and 1\u00a0km surrounding the participants' residences. We used generalized estimating equations to examine associations between greenness and cardiovascular disease biomarkers. We adjusted for residential clustering, demographic, clinical, and environmental variables. In fully adjusted models, contemporaneous NDVI within 250\u00a0m of participant residence was inversely associated with urinary levels of epinephrine (-6.9%; 95% confidence interval, -11.5, -2.0/0.1 NDVI ) and F2-isoprostane (-9.0%; 95% confidence interval, -15.1, -2.5/0.1 NDVI ). We found stronger associations between NDVI and urinary epinephrine in women, those not on \u03b2-blockers, and those who had not previously experienced a myocardial infarction. Of the 15 subtypes of circulating angiogenic cells examined, 11 were inversely associated (8.0-15.6% decrease/0.1 NDVI ), whereas 2 were positively associated (37.6-45.8% increase/0.1 NDVI ) with contemporaneous NDVI . . Conclusions: Independent of age, sex, race, smoking status, neighborhood deprivation, statin use, and roadway exposure, residential greenness is associated with lower levels of sympathetic activation, reduced oxidative stress, and higher angiogenic capacity.

        "Effect of Access to Prescribed PCSK9 Inhibitors on Cardiovascular Outcomes. BACKGROUND: Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease remains a major cause of death and disability, especially for high-risk familial hypercholesterolemia individuals. PCSK9i (proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin type 9 inhibitors) reduce low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels and cardiovascular event rates. However, PCSK9i prescriptions are rejected at high rates by payers, and use is often delayed or eventually abandoned as a treatment option. We tested the hypothesis that acute coronary syndromes, coronary interventions, stroke, and cardiac arrest are more prevalent in patients with rejected or abandoned PCSK9i prescriptions than for those with paid PCSK9i prescriptions. METHODS AND RESULTS: We identified 139 036 individuals aged \u226518 years who met the following 3 criteria: prescribed PCSK9i between August 2015 and December 2017, had claims history, and had an established date of exposure for paid, rejected, or abandoned status. To compare the effects of rejected versus paid and abandoned versus paid status, propensity score matching was performed to minimize confounding because of baseline differences in patient groups. Cox regression analyses and incidence density rates for cardiovascular events were estimated on the propensity score-matched cohorts. Patients who received 168 or more days of paid PCSK9i medication within a 12-month period were defined as paid. The hazard ratios for composite cardiovascular events outcome in propensity score-matched analyses were 1.10 (95% CI, 1.01-1.19; P=0.02) for rejected versus paid and 1.12 (95% CI, 1.01-1.24; P=0.03) for abandoned versus paid. In a stricter analysis where paid patients were defined by receiving 338 or more days of therapy within 12-months, hazard ratio was 1.16 (95% CI, 1.02-1.30; P=0.04) for rejected versus paid and 1.21 (95% CI, 1.04-1.38; P=0.03) for the abandoned versus paid status. Higher PCSK9i rejection rates were observed with women, racial minorities, and lower-income groups. CONCLUSIONS: Individuals in the rejected and abandoned cohorts had significantly increased risk of cardiovascular events compared with those in the paid cohort. Rejection, abandonment, and disparities related to PCSK9i prescriptions are related to higher cardiovascular outcome rates. ",
        "Plant-Based Diets Are Associated With a Lower Risk of Incident Cardiovascular Disease, Cardiovascular Disease Mortality, and All-Cause Mortality in a General Population of Middle-Aged Adults. Background: Previous studies have documented the cardiometabolic health benefits of plant-based diets; however, these studies were conducted in selected study populations that had narrow generalizability. . Methods and Results: We used data from a community-based cohort of middle-aged adults (n=12\u00a0168) in the ARIC (Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities) study who were followed up from 1987 through 2016. Participants' diet was classified using 4 diet indexes. In the overall plant-based diet index and provegetarian diet index, higher intakes of all or selected plant foods received higher scores; in the healthy plant-based diet index, higher intakes of only the healthy plant foods received higher scores; in the less healthy plant-based diet index, higher intakes of only the less healthy plant foods received higher scores. In all indexes, higher intakes of animal foods received lower scores. Results from Cox proportional hazards models showed that participants in the highest versus lowest quintile for adherence to overall plant-based diet index or provegetarian diet had a 16%, 31% to 32%, and 18% to 25% lower risk of cardiovascular disease, cardiovascular disease mortality, and all-cause mortality, respectively, after adjusting for important confounders (all P<0.05 for trend). Higher adherence to a healthy plant-based diet index was associated with a 19% and 11% lower risk of cardiovascular disease mortality and all-cause mortality, respectively, but not incident cardiovascular disease (P<0.05 for trend). No associations were observed between the less healthy plant-based diet index and the outcomes. . Conclusions: Diets higher in plant foods and lower in animal foods were associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in a general population. ",
        "Home-Based Cardiac Rehabilitation: A Scientific Statement From the American Association of Cardiovascular and Pulmonary Rehabilitation, the American Heart Association, and the American College of Cardiology. Cardiac rehabilitation (CR) is an evidence-based intervention that uses patient education, health behavior modification, and exercise training to improve secondary prevention outcomes in patients with cardiovascular disease. CR programs reduce morbidity and mortality rates in adults with ischemic heart disease, heart failure, or cardiac surgery but are significantly underused, with only a minority of eligible patients participating in CR in the United States. New delivery strategies are urgently needed to improve participation. One potential strategy is home-based CR (HBCR). In contrast to center-based CR services, which are provided in a medically supervised facility, HBCR relies on remote coaching with indirect exercise supervision and is provided mostly or entirely outside of the traditional center-based setting. Although HBCR has been successfully deployed in the United Kingdom, Canada, and other countries, most US healthcare organizations have little to no experience with such programs. The purpose of this scientific statement is to identify the core components, efficacy, strengths, limitations, evidence gaps, and research necessary to guide the future delivery of HBCR in the United States. Previous randomized trials have generated low- to moderate-strength evidence that HBCR and center-based CR can achieve similar improvements in 3- to 12-month clinical outcomes. Although HBCR appears to hold promise in expanding the use of CR to eligible patients, additional research and demonstration projects are needed to clarify, strengthen, and extend the HBCR evidence base for key subgroups, including older adults, women, underrepresented minority groups, and other higher-risk and understudied groups. In the interim, we conclude that HBCR may be a reasonable option for selected clinically stable low- to moderate-risk patients who are eligible for CR but cannot attend a traditional center-based CR program.

        "Water Pipe (Hookah) Smoking and Cardiovascular Disease Risk: A Scientific Statement From the American Heart Association. Tobacco smoking with a water pipe or hookah is increasing globally. There are millions of water pipe tobacco smokers worldwide, and in the United States, water pipe use is more common among youth and young adults than among adults. The spread of water pipe tobacco smoking has been abetted by the marketing of flavored tobacco, a social media environment that promotes water pipe smoking, and misperceptions about the addictive potential and potential adverse health effects of this form of tobacco use. There is growing evidence that water pipe tobacco smoking affects heart rate, blood pressure regulation, baroreflex sensitivity, tissue oxygenation, and vascular function over the short term. Long-term water pipe use is associated with increased risk of coronary artery disease. Several harmful or potentially harmful substances present in cigarette smoke are also present in water pipe smoke, often at levels exceeding those found in cigarette smoke. Water pipe tobacco smokers have a higher risk of initiation of cigarette smoking than never smokers. Future studies that focus on the long-term adverse health effects of intermittent water pipe tobacco use are critical to strengthen the evidence base and to inform the regulation of water pipe products and use. The objectives of this statement are to describe the design and operation of water pipes and their use patterns, to identify harmful and potentially harmful constituents in water pipe smoke, to document the cardiovascular risks of water pipe use, to review current approaches to water pipe smoking cessation, and to offer guidance to healthcare providers for the identification and treatment of individuals who smoke tobacco using water pipes.

        "Association Between Occupational Exposure to Pesticides and Cardiovascular Disease Incidence: The Kuakini Honolulu Heart Program. Background Previously, Kuakini Honolulu Heart Program researchers reported that occupational exposure to pesticides was significantly associated with total mortality. The current study examines occupational exposure to pesticides in relation to incident cardiovascular disease, defined as coronary heart disease or cerebrovascular accident. Methods and Results With the Occupational Safety Health Administration exposure scale used as an estimate of exposure, statistical analyses were performed on a cohort of 7557 Japanese-American men from the Kuakini Honolulu Heart Program. Hazard ratios for cardiovascular disease incidence were calculated for various levels of pesticide exposure using Cox proportional hazards models. In the first 10\u00a0years of follow-up, a positive association was observed between age-adjusted cardiovascular disease incidence and high levels of pesticide exposure (hazard ratio=1.46, 95% CI=1.10-1.95, P=0.009). This relationship remained significant after adjustment for other cardiovascular disease risk factors (hazard ratio=1.42, 95% CI=1.05-1.92, P=0.021). No significant association for coronary heart disease or cerebrovascular accident incidence with pesticide exposure was observed when examined separately, possibly due to a smaller number of events. Conclusions These findings suggest that occupational exposure to pesticides may play a role in the development of cardiovascular diseases. The results are novel, as the association between occupational exposure to pesticides and cardiovascular disease incidence has not been examined previously in this unique cohort. ",
        "Effect of Morning Exercise With or Without Breaks in Prolonged Sitting on Blood Pressure in Older Overweight/Obese Adults. Both exercise and breaks in prolonged sitting can reduce blood pressure (BP) in older overweight/obese adults. We investigated whether there is an additive hypotensive effect when exercise is combined with subsequent breaks in sitting. Sex differences and changes in plasma catecholamines as a potential candidate mechanism underlying BP responses were also examined. Sedentary older adults (n=67; 67\u00b17 years; 31.2\u00b14.1 kg/m2) completed 3 conditions in random order-sitting (SIT): uninterrupted sitting (8 hours, control); exercise+sitting (EX+SIT): sitting (1 hour), moderate-intensity walking (30 minutes), uninterrupted sitting (6.5 hours); exercise+breaks (EX+BR): sitting (1 hour), moderate-intensity walking (30 minutes), sitting interrupted every 30 minutes with 3 minutes of light-intensity walking (6.5 hours). Serial BP and plasma epinephrine/norepinephrine measurements occurred during 8 hours. The 8-hour average systolic and diastolic BP (mm\u2009Hg 95% CI) was lower in EX+SIT -3.4 (-4.5 to -2.3), -0.8 (-1.6 to -0.04), and EX+BR -5.1 (-6.2 to -4.0), -1.1 (-1.8 to -0.3), respectively, relative to SIT (all P <0.05). There was an additional reduction in average systolic BP of -1.7 (-2.8 to -0.6) in EX+BR relative to EX+SIT ( P=0.003). This additional reduction in systolic BP was driven by women -3.2 (-4.7 to -1.7; P<0.001 EX+BR versus EX+SIT). Average epinephrine decreased in EX+SIT and EX+BR in women (-13% to -12%) but increased in men (+12% to +23%), respectively, relative to SIT ( P<0.05). No differences in average norepinephrine were observed. Morning exercise reduces BP during a period of 8 hours in older overweight/obese adults compared with prolonged sitting. Combining exercise with regular breaks in sitting may be of more benefit for lowering BP in women than in men. Clinical Trial Registration- URL: https://www.anzctr.org.au .

        "Cluster Randomized Clinical Trial of FAITH (Faith-Based Approaches in the Treatment of Hypertension) in Blacks. BACKGROUND: Therapeutic lifestyle change (TLC) is a recommended treatment for patients with hypertension, but its effectiveness in community-based settings remains untested, particularly in black churches-an influential institution for health promotion in black communities. METHODS AND RESULTS: The FAITH study (Faith-Based Approaches in the Treatment of Hypertension) evaluated the comparative effectiveness of a TLC intervention plus motivational interviewing (MINT) sessions versus health education (HE) alone, on blood pressure (BP) reduction among blacks with uncontrolled hypertension. Data were collected on 373 participants meeting eligibility criteria (self-identification as black, age \u226518 years, self-reported diagnosis of hypertension, and uncontrolled BP [BP \u2265140/90 or \u2265130/80 mm Hg with diabetes mellitus or chronic kidney disease]) from 32 New York City churches. The MINT-TLC intervention plus motivational interviewing treatment comprised 11 weekly group sessions on TLC plus 3 MINT sessions delivered monthly by lay health advisors. The HE control group received 1 TLC session plus 10 sessions on health topics delivered by local experts. The outcomes were BP reduction at 6 months (primary) and BP control and BP reduction at 9 months (secondary). The sample mean age was 63 years; 76% women, with mean BP of 153/87 mm Hg. Using linear mixed-effects regression models, the MINT-TLC intervention plus motivational interviewing group had a significantly greater systolic BP reduction of 5.79 mm Hg compared with the HE group at 6 months ( P=0.029). The treatment effect on systolic BP persisted at 9 months but had reduced significance (5.21 mm Hg; P=0.068). The between-group differences in diastolic BP reduction (0.41 mm Hg) and mean arterial pressure (2.24 mm Hg) at 6 months were not significant. Although the MINT-TLC intervention plus motivational interviewing group had greater BP control than the HE group at 9 months, the difference was not statistically significant (57.0% versus 48.8%; odds ratio, 1.43; 95% CI, 0.90-2.28). CONCLUSIONS: A community-based lifestyle intervention delivered in churches led to significantly greater reduction in systolic BP in hypertensive blacks compared with HE alone.

        "Long Working Hours and the Prevalence of Masked and Sustained Hypertension. Previous studies on the effect of long working hours on blood pressure have shown inconsistent results. Mixed findings could be attributable to limitations related to blood pressure measurement and the lack of consideration of masked hypertension. The objective was to determine whether individuals who work long hours have a higher prevalence of masked and sustained hypertension. Data were collected at 3-time points over 5 years from 3547 white-collar workers. Long working hours were self-reported, and blood pressure was measured using Spacelabs 90207. Workplace clinic blood pressure was defined as the mean of the first 3readings taken at rest at the workplace. Ambulatory blood pressure was defined as the mean of the next readings recorded every 15 minutes during daytime working hours. Masked hypertension was defined as clinic blood pressure < 140/90 mm Hg and ambulatory blood pressure \u2265135/85 mm Hg. Sustained hypertension was defined as clinic blood pressure \u2265140/90 mm Hg and ambulatory blood pressure \u2265135/85 mm Hg or being treated hypertension. Long working hours were associated with the prevalence of masked hypertension (prevalence ratio 49+=1.70 [95% CI, 1.09-2.64]), after adjustment for sociodemographics, lifestyle-related risk factors, diabetes mellitus, family history of cardiovascular disease, and job strain. The association with sustained hypertension was of a comparable magnitude (prevalence ratio 49+=1.66 [95% CI, 1.15-2.50]). Results suggest that long working hours are an independent risk factor for masked and sustained hypertension. Workplace strategies targeting long working hours could be effective in reducing the clinical and public health burden of hypertension. ",
        "Association Between High Perceived Stress Over Time and Incident Hypertension in Black Adults: Findings From the Jackson Heart Study. Background: Chronic psychological stress has been associated with hypertension, but few studies have examined this relationship in blacks. We examined the association between perceived stress levels assessed annually for up to 13\u00a0years and incident hypertension in the Jackson Heart Study, a community-based cohort of blacks. . Methods and Results: Analyses included 1829 participants without hypertension at baseline (Exam 1, 2000-2004). Incident hypertension was defined as blood pressure\u2265140/90\u00a0mm\u00a0Hg or antihypertensive medication use at Exam 2 (2005-2008) or Exam 3 (2009-2012). Each follow-up interval at risk of hypertension was categorized as low, moderate, or high perceived stress based on the number of annual assessments between exams in which participants reported \"a lot\" or \"extreme\" stress over the previous year (low, 0 high stress ratings; moderate, 1 high stress rating; high, \u22652 high stress ratings). During follow-up (median, 7.0\u00a0years), hypertension incidence was 48.5%. Hypertension developed in 30.6% of intervals with low perceived stress, 34.6% of intervals with moderate perceived stress, and 38.2% of intervals with high perceived stress. Age-, sex-, and time-adjusted risk ratios (95% CI) associated with moderate and high perceived stress versus low perceived stress were 1.19 (1.04-1.37) and 1.37 (1.20-1.57), respectively (P trend<0.001). The association was present after adjustment for demographic, clinical, and behavioral factors and baseline stress (P trend=0.001). . Conclusions: In a community-based cohort of blacks, higher perceived stress over time was associated with an increased risk of developing hypertension. Evaluating stress levels over time and intervening when high perceived stress is persistent may reduce hypertension risk. ",
        "Socioeconomic Mediators of Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Congenital Heart Disease Outcomes: A Population-Based Study in California. Background: Racial/ethnic and socioeconomic disparities exist in outcomes for children with congenital heart disease. We sought to determine the influence of race/ethnicity and mediating socioeconomic factors on 1-year outcomes for live-born infants with hypoplastic left heart syndrome and dextro-Transposition of the great arteries. . Methods and Results: The authors performed a population-based cohort study using the California Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development database. Live-born infants without chromosomal anomalies were included. The outcome was a composite measure of mortality or unexpected hospital readmissions within the first year of life defined as >3 (hypoplastic left heart syndrome) or >1 readmissions (dextro-Transposition of the great arteries). Hispanic ethnicity was compared with non-Hispanic white ethnicity. Mediation analyses determined the percent contribution to outcome for each mediator on the pathway between race/ethnicity and outcome. A total of 1796 patients comprised the cohort (n=964 [hypoplastic left heart syndrome], n=832 [dextro-Transposition of the great arteries]) and 1315 were included in the analysis (n=477 non-Hispanic white, n=838 Hispanic). Hispanic ethnicity was associated with a poor outcome (crude odds ratio, 1.72; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.37-2.17). Higher maternal education (crude odds ratio 0.5; 95% CI , 0.38-0.65) and private insurance (crude odds ratio, 0.65; 95% CI , 0.45-0.71) were protective. In the mediation analysis, maternal education and insurance status explained 33.2% (95% CI , 7-66.4) and 27.6% (95% CI , 6.5-63.1) of the relationship between race/ethnicity and poor outcome, while infant characteristics played a minimal role. . Conclusions: Socioeconomic factors explain a significant portion of the association between Hispanic ethnicity and poor outcome in neonates with critical congenital heart disease. These findings identify vulnerable populations that would benefit from resources to lessen health disparities. ",
        "2017 Pediatric Hypertension Guidelines Improve Prediction of Adult Cardiovascular Outcomes. We aimed to evaluate the consequences of the 2017 pediatric hypertension definitions, compared with the 2004 pediatric hypertension definitions on the prevalence of hypertension and to assess the performance of these 2 sets of guidelines in predicting adult hypertension, metabolic syndrome, and left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). This longitudinal study consisted of 3940 children (47% male; ages 3-18 years) who came from the Bogalusa Heart Study with 36-year follow-up since childhood. Hypertension was identified in 7% and 11% as defined in the 2004 and 2017 guidelines, respectively. The 2004 and 2017 guidelines demonstrated similar associations with adulthood hypertension, metabolic syndrome, and LVH. However, the proportion of children identified as having hypertension who developed adult LVH increased from 12% when defined by the 2004 guidelines to 19% when defined by the 2017 guidelines. Overall, the 329 (8%) children who were reclassified to higher blood pressure categories by the 2017 guidelines were more likely than their propensity score-matched normotensive counterparts to develop hypertension, metabolic syndrome, and LVH in later life, whereas 38 (1%) children who were reclassified to lower blood pressure categories by the 2017 guidelines had similar cardiometabolic outcomes to their propensity score-matched normotensive counterparts. Hence, children who were reclassified to higher blood pressure categories based on 2017 guidelines were at increased risk of developing hypertension, metabolic syndrome, and LVH in later life. The 2017 guidelines identified a group of children with adverse metabolic profile and cardiometabolic outcomes, whose cardiovascular risk seemed to be underestimated using the 2004 guidelines. ",
        "Underutilization of Evidence-Based Smoking Cessation Support Strategies Despite High Smoking Addiction Burden in Peripheral Artery Disease Specialty Care: Insights from the International PORTRAIT Registry. Background: Smoking is the most important risk factor for peripheral artery disease ( PAD ). Smoking cessation is key in PAD management. We aimed to examine smoking rates and smoking cessation interventions offered to patients with PAD consulting a vascular specialty clinic; and assess changes in smoking behavior over the year following initial visit. . Methods and Results: A total of 1272 patients with PAD and new or worsening claudication were enrolled at 16 vascular specialty clinics (2011-2015, PORTRAIT (Patient-Centered Outcomes Related to Treatment Practices in Peripheral Arterial Disease: Investigating Trajectories) registry). Interviews collected smoking status and cessation interventions at baseline, 3, 6, and 12\u00a0months. Among smokers, transition state models analyzed smoking transitions at each time point and identified factors associated with quitting and relapse. On presentation, 474 (37.3%) patients were active, 660 (51.9%) former, and 138 (10.8%) never smokers. Among active smokers, only 16% were referred to cessation counseling and 11% were prescribed pharmacologic treatment. At 3\u00a0months, the probability of quitting smoking was 21%; among those continuing to smoke at 3\u00a0months, the probability of quitting during the next 9\u00a0months varied between 11% and 12% ( P<0.001). The probability of relapse among initial quitters was 36%. At 12\u00a0months, 72% of all smokers continued to smoke. . Conclusions: More than one third of patients with claudication consulting a PAD provider are active smokers and few received evidence-based cessation interventions. Patients appear to be most likely to quit early in their treatment course, but many quickly relapse and 72% of all patients smoking at baseline are still smoking at 12\u00a0months. Better strategies are needed to provide continuous cessation support. Clinical Trial Registration URL : https://www.clinicaltrials.gov . Unique identifier: NCT 01419080. ",
        "Pro-Oxidative and Proinflammatory Effects After Traveling From Los Angeles to Beijing: A Biomarker-Based Natural Experiment. BACKGROUND: Exposure to air pollution increases cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Preventing chronic cardiovascular diseases caused by air pollution relies on detecting the early effects of pollutants on the risk of cardiovascular disease development, which is limited by the lack of sensitive biomarkers. We have previously identified promising biomarkers in experimental animals but comparable evidence in humans is lacking. METHODS: Air pollution is substantially worse in Beijing than in Los Angeles. We collected urine and blood samples from 26 nonsmoking, healthy adult residents of Los Angeles (mean age, 23.8 years; 14 women) before, during, and after spending 10 weeks in Beijing during the summers of 2014 and 2015. We assessed a panel of circulating biomarkers indicative of lipid peroxidation and inflammation. Personal exposure to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), a group of combustion-originated air pollutants, was assessed by urinary PAH metabolite levels. RESULTS: Urinary concentrations of 4 PAH metabolites were 176% (95% CI, 103% to 276%) to 800% (95% CI, 509% to 1780%) greater in Beijing than in Los Angeles. Concentrations of 6 lipid peroxidation biomarkers were also increased in Beijing, among which 5-, 12-, and 15-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid and 9- and 13-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid levels reached statistical significance (false discovery rate <5%), but not 8-isoprostane (20.8%; 95% CI, -5.0% to 53.6%). The antioxidative activities of paraoxonase (-9.8%; 95% CI, -14.0% to -5.3%) and arylesterase (-14.5%; 95% CI, -22.3% to -5.8%) were lower and proinflammatory C-reactive protein (101%; 95% CI, 3.3% to 291%) and fibrinogen (48.3%; 95% CI, 4.9% to 110%) concentrations were higher in Beijing. Changes in all these biomarkers were reversed, at least partially, after study participants returned to Los Angeles. Changes in most outcomes were associated with urinary PAH metabolites (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Traveling from a less-polluted to a more-polluted city induces systemic pro-oxidative and proinflammatory effects. Changes in the levels of 5-, 12-, and 15-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid and 9- and 13-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid as well as paraoxonase and arylesterase activities in the blood, in association with exposures to PAH metabolites, might have important implications in preventive medicine as indicators of increased cardiovascular risk caused by air pollution exposure.

        "Regional Variation in the Association of Poverty and Heart Failure Mortality in the 3135 Counties of the United States. Background There is significant geographical variation in heart failure (HF) mortality across the United States. County socioeconomic factors that influence these outcomes are unknown. We studied the association between county socioeconomic factors and HF mortality and compared it with coronary heart disease (CHD) mortality. Methods and Results This is a cross-sectional analysis of socioeconomic factors and mortality in HF and CHD across 3135 US counties from 2010 to 2015. County-level poverty, education, income, unemployment, health insurance status, and cause-specific mortality rates were collected from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and US Census Bureau databases. Poverty had the strongest correlation with both HF and CHD mortality, disproportionately higher for HF (r=0.48) than CHD (r=0.24). HF mortality increased by 5.2 deaths/100\u00a0000 for each percentage increase in county poverty prevalence in a frequency-weighted, demographic-adjusted, multivariate regression model. The greatest attenuation in the poverty regression coefficient (66.4%) was seen after adjustment for prevalence of diabetes mellitus and obesity. Subgroup analysis by census region showed that this relationship was the strongest in the South and weakest in the Northeast (6.1 versus 1.4 deaths/100\u00a0000 per 1% increase in county poverty in a demographics-adjusted model). Conclusions County poverty is the strongest socioeconomic factor associated with HF and CHD mortality, an association that is stronger with HF than with CHD and varied by census region. Over half of the association was explained by differences in the prevalence of diabetes mellitus and obesity across the counties. Health policies targeting improvement in these risk factors may address and possibly minimize health disparities caused by socioeconomic factors. ",
        "Changes in the Prevalence of Chronic Hypertension in Pregnancy, United States, 1970 to 2010. We estimated changes in the prevalence of chronic hypertension among pregnant women and evaluated the extent to which changes in obesity and smoking were associated with these trends. We designed a population-based cross-sectional analysis of over 151 million women with delivery-related hospitalizations in the United States, 1970 to 2010. Maternal age, year of delivery (period), and maternal year of birth (birth cohort), as well as race, were examined as risk factors for chronic hypertension. Prevalence rates and rate ratios with 95% CIs of chronic hypertension in relation to age, period, and birth cohort were derived through age-period-cohort models. We also examined how changes in obesity and smoking rates influenced age-period-cohort effects. The overall prevalence of chronic hypertension was 0.63%, with black women (1.24%) having more than a 2-fold higher rate than white women (0.53%; rate ratio, 2.31; 95% CI, 2.30-2.32). In the age-period-cohort analysis, the rate of chronic hypertension increased sharply with advancing age and period from 0.11% in 1970 to 1.52% in 2010 (rate ratio, 13.41; 95% CI, 13.22-13.61). The rate of hypertension increased, on average, by 6% (95% CI, 5-6) per year, with the increase being slightly higher among white (7%; 95% CI, 6%-7%) than black (4%; 95% CI, 3%-4%) women. Adjustments for changes in rates of obesity and smoking were not associated with age and period effects. We observed a substantial increase in chronic hypertension rates by age and period and an over 2-fold race disparity in chronic hypertension rates. ",
        "Race/Ethnicity and Neighborhood Characteristics Are Associated With Bystander Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation in Pediatric Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest in the United States: A Study From CARES. Background Whether racial and neighborhood characteristics are associated with bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation ( BCPR ) in pediatric out-of-hospital cardiac arrest ( OHCA ) is unknown. Methods and Results An analysis was conducted of CARES (Cardiac Arrest Registry to Enhance Survival) for pediatric nontraumatic OHCA s from 2013 to 2017. An index (range, 0-4) was created for each arrest based on neighborhood characteristics associated with low BCPR (>80% black; >10% unemployment; <80% high school; median income, <$50\u00a0000). The primary outcome was BCPR . BCPR occurred in 3399 of 7086 OHCA s (48%). Compared with white children, BCPR was less likely in other races/ethnicities (black: adjusted odds ratio [ aOR ], 0.59; 95% CI , 0.52-0.68; Hispanic: aOR , 0.78; 95% CI , 0.66-0.94; and other: aOR , 0.54; 95% CI , 0.40-0.72). Compared with arrests in neighborhoods with an index score of 0, BCPR occurred less commonly for arrests with an index score of 1 ( aOR , 0.80; 95% CI , 0.70-0.91), 2 ( aOR , 0.75; 95% CI , 0.65-0.86), 3 ( aOR , 0.52; 95% CI , 0.45-0.61), and 4 ( aOR , 0.46; 95% CI , 0.36-0.59). Black children had an incrementally lower likelihood of BCPR with increasing index score while white children had an overall similar likelihood at most scores. Black children with an index of 4 were approximately half as likely to receive BCPR compared with white children with a score of 0. Conclusions Racial and neighborhood characteristics are associated with BCPR in pediatric OHCA . Targeted CPR training for nonwhite, low-education, and low-income neighborhoods may increase BCPR and improve pediatric OHCA outcomes. ",
        "Receipt of American Heart Association-Recommended Preconception Health Care Among Privately Insured Women With Congenital Heart Defects, 2007-2013. Background: Our objective was to estimate receipt of preconception health care among women with congenital heart defects (CHD), according to 2017 American Heart Association recommendations, as a baseline for evaluating recommendation implementation. . Methods and Results: Using 2007 to 2013 IBM MarketScan Commercial Databases, we identified women with CHD diagnosis codes ages 15 to 44\u00a0years who became pregnant and were enrolled in health insurance for \u226511\u00a0months in the year before estimated conception. We assessed documentation of complete blood count, electrolytes, thyroid-stimulating hormone, liver function, ECG, comprehensive echocardiogram, and exercise stress test, using procedural codes, and outpatient prescription claims for US Food and Drug Administration category D and X cardiac-related medications. Differences were examined according to CHD severity, age, region of residence, year of conception, and documented encounters at obstetric and cardiology practices. We found 2524 pregnancies among 2003 women with CHD (14.4% severe CHD). In the 98.3% of women with a healthcare encounter in the year before conception, <1% received all and 22.6% received no American Heart Association-recommended tests or assessments (range: 54.4% for complete blood count to 3.1% for exercise stress test). Women with the highest prevalence of receipt of recommended care were 35 to 44\u00a0years old, pregnant in 2012 to 2013, or had a documented obstetric or cardiology encounter in the year before conception (P<0.05 for all). In 9.0% of pregnancies, \u22651 prescriptions for US Food and Drug Administration category D or X cardiac-related medications were filled in the year before conception. . Conclusions: A low percentage of women with CHD received American Heart Association-recommended preconception health care in the year before conception. ",
        "Blood Pressure and Heart Rate Variability in Preschool Children Exposed to Smokeless Tobacco in Fetal Life. Background Maternal smoking during pregnancy has been associated with higher blood pressure and autonomic imbalance in the offspring. However, it has been difficult to determine the selective prenatal and postnatal contributions as children frequently have been exposed to smoking both before and after birth. The specific role of nicotine is also unclear. We aimed to determine whether exclusive prenatal exposure to nicotine from maternal use of smokeless tobacco (Swedish snus) in pregnancy was associated with blood pressure and autonomic heart rate control in their children. Methods and Results We measured oscillometric blood pressures in forty 5- to 6-year-old children with snus exposure in fetal life (n=21) and in tobacco-free controls (n=19). Taking the child's age and height into account, snus-exposed children had 4.2 (95% CI, 0.2-8.1) mm\u00a0Hg higher systolic blood pressure than controls (P=0.038). The corresponding sex-, age-, and height-standardized systolic blood pressure centiles were 61 and 46 (95% CI of the difference, 2-28) (P=0.029). Heart rate variability was tested in 30 of the children. The spectral heart rate variability variable low-frequency/high-frequency ratio was higher (median, 0.69; interquartile range, 0.45-1.21) in snus-exposed children than in controls (median, 0.21; interquartile range, 0.32-0.57; P=0.034). Conclusions Prenatal snus exposure was associated with higher systolic blood pressure and altered heart rate variability at 6\u00a0years of age. These findings may indicate adverse prenatal programming of nicotine, but implications for cardiovascular health in later life remain to be studied. Meanwhile, women should be recommended to abstain from all types of tobacco and nicotine products during pregnancy. ",
        "Arrhythmias and Adaptations of the Cardiac Conduction System in Former National Football League Players. Background Habitual high-intensity endurance exercise is associated with increased atrial fibrillation (AF) risk and impaired cardiac conduction. It is unknown whether these observations extend to prior strength-type sports exposure. The primary aim of this study was to compare AF prevalence in former National Football League (NFL) athletes to population-based controls. The secondary aim was to characterize other conduction system parameters. Methods and Results This cross-sectional study compared former NFL athletes (n=460, age 56\u00b112\u00a0years, black 47%) with population-based controls of similar age and racial composition from the cardiovascular cohort Dallas Heart Study-2 (n=925, age 54\u00b19\u00a0years, black 53%). AF was present in 28 individuals (n=23 [5%] in the NFL group; n=5 [0.5%] in the control group). After controlling for other cardiovascular risk factors in multivariable regression analysis, former NFL participation remained associated with a 5.7 (95% CI: 2.1-15.9, P<0.001) higher odds ratio of AF. Older age, higher body mass index, and nonblack race were also independently associated with higher odds ratio of AF, while hypertension and diabetes mellitus were not. AF was previously undiagnosed in 15/23 of the former NFL players. Previously undiagnosed NFL players were rate controlled and asymptomatic, but 80% had a CHA2DS2-VASc score \u22651. Former NFL players also had an 8-fold higher prevalence of paced cardiac rhythms (2.0% versus 0.25%, P<0.01), compared with controls. Furthermore, former athletes had lower resting heart rates (62\u00b111 versus 66\u00b111\u00a0beats per minute, P<0.001), and a higher prevalence of first-degree atrioventricular block (18% versus 9%, P<0.001). Conclusions Former NFL participation was associated with an increased AF prevalence and slowed cardiac conduction when compared with a population-based control group. Former NFL athletes who screened positive for AF were generally rate controlled and asymptomatic, but 80% should have been considered for anticoagulation based on their stroke risk. ",
        "Posttraumatic Stress Disorder and Risk for Stroke in Young and Middle-Aged Adults: A 13-Year Cohort Study. Background and Purpose- In older populations, transient ischemic attack (TIA) and ischemic stroke have been linked to psychological factors, including posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Whether PTSD also increases risk for early incident stroke in young adults is unknown. Methods- We prospectively assessed the incidence of TIA and ischemic stroke in a cohort of 987\u2009855 young and middle-aged Veterans (mean age of 30.29\u00b19.19 years; 87.8% men, 64.4% white) who first accessed care through the Veterans Health Administration from October 2001 to November 2014 and were free of TIA and ischemic stroke at baseline. For each outcome, time-varying multivariate Cox models were constructed to examine the effect of PTSD on incident stroke. We also assessed for effect modification by sex. Additional sensitivity analyses controlled for healthcare utilization. Results- Over a 13-year period, TIA and ischemic stroke were diagnosed in 766 and 1877 patients, respectively. PTSD was diagnosed in 28.6% of the sample during follow-up. In unadjusted analyses, PTSD was significantly associated with new-onset TIA (hazard ratio [HR],\u20092.02; 95% CI,\u20091.62-2.52) and ischemic stroke (HR,\u20091.62; 95% CI,\u20091.47-1.79). In fully adjusted models, the association between PTSD and incident TIA (HR, 1.61; 95% CI,\u20091.27-2.04) and ischemic stroke (HR, 1.36; 95% CI,\u20091.22-1.52) remained significant. The effect of PTSD on ischemic stroke risk was stronger in men than in women (HR, 0.63; 95% CI,\u20090.47-0.86; P=0.003), but no effect of sex was found for TIA. Conclusions- PTSD is associated with a significant increase in risk of early incident TIA and ischemic stroke independent of established stroke risk factors, coexisting psychiatric disorders, and healthcare utilization. Sex moderated the relationship for adults with ischemic stroke but not TIA. These findings suggest that psychological factors, including PTSD, may be important targets for future age-specific prevention strategies for young adults. ",
        "Cigarette Smoking and Subclinical Peripheral Arterial Disease in Blacks of the Jackson Heart Study. Background Prevalence of peripheral artery disease ( PAD ) is significantly higher among blacks as compared with non-Hispanic whites, but the role of cigarette smoking in PAD is understudied in blacks. We aimed to evaluate the relationship between cigarette smoking and PAD in blacks in the (JHS) Jackson Heart Study. Methods and Results JHS participants (n=5306) were classified by self-reported baseline smoking status into current, past (smoked at least 400 cigarettes/life), or never smokers. We examined multivariable logistic and robust linear regression models to estimate the associations between baseline smoking status, smoking intensity, and measures of subclinical PAD (ankle-brachial index [visit 1] and aortic calcium by computed tomography [visit 2]) to yield odds ratios and \u03b2-coefficients (estimated adjusted difference) to compare each smoking status with never smokers (reference group). There were 3579 (68%) never smokers, 986 (19%) past smokers, and 693 (13%) current smokers self-identified at baseline. After adjustment for covariates, current smokers had increased risk of ankle-brachial index <1 (odds ratio, 2.2, 95% CI, 1.5-3.3) and increased risk of abdominal aortic (odds ratio, 8.4, 95% CI, 5.8-12.0) and aortoiliac calcium (odds ratio, 9.6, 95% CI, 6.7-13.7). When stratifying by smoking intensity, those smoking more than 20 cigarettes daily (1 pack) had higher likelihood of subclinical PAD by all of these measures compared with lower-intensity use, suggesting a dose-dependent relationship. Conclusions In a large black cohort, cigarette smoking was associated with measures of subclinical PAD in a dose-dependent manner. These findings highlight the association between smoking and PAD in blacks and support further research exploring the impact of interventions on smoking cessation to reduce PAD in this population. ",
        "Patient-Reported Reasons for Declining or Discontinuing Statin Therapy: Insights From the PALM Registry. Background: Many adults eligible for statin therapy for cardiovascular disease prevention are untreated. Our objective was to investigate patient-reported reasons for statin underutilization, including noninitiation, refusal, and discontinuation. . Methods and Results: This study included the 5693 adults recommended for statin therapy in the PALM (Patient and Provider Assessment of Lipid Management) registry. Patient surveys evaluated statin experience, reasons for declining or discontinuing statins, and beliefs about statins and cardiovascular disease risk. Overall, 1511 of 5693 adults (26.5%) were not on treatment. Of those not on a statin, 894 (59.2%) reported never being offered a statin, 153 (10.1%) declined a statin, and 464 (30.7%) had discontinued therapy. Women (relative risk: 1.22), black adults (relative risk: 1.48), and those without insurance (relative risk: 1.38) were most likely to report never being offered a statin. Fear of side effects and perceived side effects were the most common reasons cited for declining or discontinuing a statin. Compared with statin users, those who declined or discontinued statins were less likely to believe statins are safe (70.4% of current users vs. 36.9% of those who declined and 37.4% of those who discontinued) or effective (86.3%, 67.4%, and 69.1%, respectively). Willingness to take a statin was high; 67.7% of those never offered and 59.7% of patients who discontinued a statin would consider initiating or retrying a statin. . Conclusions: More than half of patients eligible for statin therapy but not on treatment reported never being offered one by their doctor. Concern about side effects was the leading reason for statin refusal or discontinuation. Many patients were willing to reconsider statin therapy if offered. ",
        "Geographic Analysis of Mobile Stroke Unit Treatment in a Dense Urban Area: The New York City METRONOME Registry. Background: Mobile stroke units (MSUs) reduce time to intravenous thrombolysis in acute ischemic stroke. Whether this advantage exists in densely populated urban areas with many proximate hospitals is unclear. . Methods and Results: We evaluated patients from the METRONOME (Metropolitan New York Mobile Stroke) registry with suspected acute ischemic stroke who were transported by a bi-institutional MSU operating in Manhattan, New York, from October 2016 to September 2017. The comparison group included patients transported to our hospitals via conventional ambulance for acute ischemic stroke during the same hours of MSU operation (Monday to Friday, 9\u00a0am to 5\u00a0pm). Our exposure was MSU care, and our primary outcome was dispatch-to-thrombolysis time. We estimated mean differences in the primary outcome between both groups, adjusting for clinical, demographic, and geographic factors, including numbers of nearby designated stroke centers and population density. We identified 66 patients treated or transported by MSU and 19 patients transported by conventional ambulance. Patients receiving MSU care had significantly shorter dispatch-to-thrombolysis time than patients receiving conventional care (mean: 61.2\u00a0versus 91.6\u00a0minutes; P=0.001). Compared with patients receiving conventional care, patients receiving MSU care were significantly more likely to be picked up closer to a higher mean number of designated stroke centers in a 2.0-mile radius (4.8 versus 2.7, P=0.002). In multivariable analysis, MSU care was associated with a mean decrease in dispatch-to-thrombolysis time of 29.7\u00a0minutes (95% CI, 6.9-52.5) compared with conventional care. . Conclusions: In a densely populated urban area with a high number of intermediary stroke centers, MSU care was associated with substantially quicker time to thrombolysis compared with conventional ambulance care.

        "Substitutions of Oatmeal and Breakfast Food Alternatives and the Rate of Stroke. Background and Purpose: Studies indicate that consuming breakfast every day, and particularly oatmeal, is associated with lower risk of stroke. However, few studies have considered replacement foods when considering foods usually consumed at breakfast. We, therefore, aimed to model substitutions between the breakfast food products oatmeal, eggs, yogurt, or white bread and subsequent risk of stroke. . Methods: Participants from the Danish cohort study (Diet, Cancer and Health; n=55\u2009095) were followed for 13.4 years, during which 2260 subjects experienced a first-ever stroke. Breakfast foods were assessed using a validated 192-item food-frequency questionnaire at baseline. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate adjusted hazard ratios and 95% CIs for associations between hypothetical substitutions of standard portion sizes of breakfast foods and stroke. . Results: Modeling replacement of white bread or eggs with oatmeal was associated with a lower rate of total stroke (hazard ratio [HR]=0.96 [95% CI, 0.95-0.98]; HR=0.96 [95% CI, 0.93-0.98], respectively), total ischemic stroke (HR=0.96 [95% CI, 0.94-0.98]; HR=0.96 [95% CI, 0.94-0.99], respectively), and ischemic stroke due to small-artery occlusion (HR=0.95 [95% CI, 0.93-0.98]; HR=0.95 [95% CI, 0.91-0.99], respectively). Furthermore, modeling replacement of eggs with oatmeal was associated with a lower rate of total hemorrhagic stroke (HR=0.94 [95% CI, 0.89-0.99]). Modeling replacement of yogurt with oatmeal was not associated with stroke. . Conclusions: Our findings suggest that a diet containing oatmeal instead of white bread or eggs may be associated with a lower rate of stroke. ",
        "Change in Cardiorespiratory Fitness and Risk of Stroke and Death. Background and Purpose: Low cardiorespiratory fitness is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease. The present study aims to assess whether change of fitness over time has any impact on long-term risk of stroke and death. . Methods: We recruited healthy men aged 40 to 59 years in 1972 to 1975, and followed them until 2007. Physical fitness was assessed with a bicycle ECG test at baseline and again at 7 years, by dividing the total exercise work by body weight. Participants were categorized as remained fit, became unfit, remained unfit, or became fit, depending on whether fitness remained or crossed the median values from baseline to the 7-year visit. Outcome data were collected up to 35 years, from study visits, hospital records, and the National Cause of Death Registry. Risks of stroke and death were estimated by Cox regression analyses and expressed as hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% CIs. . Results: Of 2 014 participants, 1\u2009403 were assessed both at baseline and again at 7 years, and were followed for a mean of 23.6 years. Compared with the became unfit group, risk of stroke was 0.85 (0.54-1.36) for the remained unfit, 0.43 (0.28-0.67) for the remained fit, and 0.34 (0.17-0.67) for the became fit group. For all-cause death, risks were 0.99 (0.76-1.29), 0.57 (0.45-0.74), and 0.65 (0.46-0.90), respectively. Among those with high fitness at baseline, the became unfit group had a significantly higher risk of stroke (HR, 2.35; CI, 1.49-3.63) and death (HR, 1.74; CI, 1.35-2.23) than those who remained fit. Among those who had low fitness at baseline, the became fit group had a significantly lower risk of stroke (HR, 0.40; CI, 0.21-0.72) and death (HR, 0.66; CI, 0.50-0.85) than participants in the remained unfit group. . Conclusions: Cardiorespiratory fitness at baseline and change in fitness was associated with large changes in long-term risk of stroke and death. These findings support the encouragement of regular exercise as a stroke prevention strategy. ",
        "Racial and Ethnic Disparities in the Utilization of Thrombectomy for Acute Stroke. Background and Purpose: Racial and ethnic disparities in the access to mechanical thrombectomy (MT) for treatment of acute ischemic stroke (AIS) secondary to large vessel occlusion have been previously described. The effect of recent randomized trials validating MT as an effective therapy for AIS secondary to large vessel occlusion on such disparities has not been investigated. . Methods: Information on admissions for AIS to endovascular centers occurring between January 2016 and September 2018 was obtained from a national database. The number of patients receiving IV-tPA (intravenous tissue-type plasminogen activator) and MT at each institution was determined, and patient demographics were characterized according to age, sex, race/ethnicity, and insurance status. Comparisons of patients who did and did not undergo MT and between patients of different racial and ethnic backgrounds were performed. Demographic variables independently associated with the utilization of MT were identified using multivariate linear regression analysis. . Results: There were 206\u2009853 admissions to 173 endovascular centers during the time period of interest. The overall utilization of MT was 8.4%. The utilization of MT for black/Hispanic patients was lower than that among white/non-Hispanic patients (7.0% versus 9.8%; P<0.001). Black/Hispanic patients were also less likely to receive IV-tPA (16.2% versus 20.5%; P<0.001) and to be admitted to the endovascular center after transfer from a different hospital (20.0% versus 30.1%; P<0.001). On multivariate linear regression analysis, increasing institutional proportions of patients with female sex (\u03b2=-0.601; P<0.001), insurance with Medicaid or uninsured status (\u03b2=-0.153; P=0.029), and black/Hispanic race/ethnicity (\u03b2=-0.062; P=0.046) were independently associated with lower institutional utilization of MT. . Conclusions: Despite the mainstream acceptance of MT for the treatment of AIS secondary to large vessel occlusion, racial and ethnic disparities in the utilization of MT persist. ",
        "Nut Consumption in Relation to Cardiovascular Disease Incidence and Mortality Among Patients With Diabetes Mellitus. RATIONALE: The evidence regarding the potential health benefits of nut consumption among individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus is limited. OBJECTIVE: To examine intake of total and specific types of nuts, including tree nuts and peanuts, in relation to subsequent risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD), including coronary heart disease and stroke, and all-cause and cause-specific mortality among individuals with diabetes mellitus. METHODS AND RESULTS: This prospective analysis included 16\u2009217 men and women with diabetes mellitus at baseline or diagnosed during follow-up (Nurses' Health Study: 1980-2014, Health Professionals Follow-Up Study: 1986-2014). Nut consumption was assessed using a validated food frequency questionnaire and updated every 2 to 4 years. During 223\u2009682 and 254\u2009923 person-years of follow-up, there were 3336 incident CVD cases and 5682 deaths, respectively. Higher total nut consumption was associated with a lower risk of CVD incidence and mortality. The multivariate-adjusted hazard ratios (95% CIs) for participants who consumed 5 or more servings of total nuts per week (1 serving=28 g), compared with those who consumed <1 serving per month, were 0.83 (0.71-0.98; P trend=0.01) for total CVD incidence, 0.80 (0.67-0.96; P trend=0.005) for coronary heart disease incidence, 0.66 (0.52-0.84; P trend <0.001) for CVD mortality, and 0.69 (0.61-0.77; P trend <0.001) for all-cause mortality. Total nut consumption was not significantly associated with risk of stroke incidence or cancer mortality. For specific types of nuts, higher tree nut consumption was associated with lower risk of total CVD, coronary heart disease incidence, and mortality because of CVD, cancer, and all causes, whereas peanut consumption was associated with lower all-cause mortality only (all P trend <0.001). In addition, compared with participants who did not change the consumption of total nuts from pre- to post-diabetes mellitus diagnosis, participants who increased consumption of total nuts after diabetes mellitus diagnosis had an 11% lower risk of CVD, a 15% lower coronary heart disease risk, a 25% lower CVD mortality, and a 27% lower all-cause mortality. The associations persisted in subgroup analyses stratified by sex/cohort, body mass index at diabetes mellitus diagnosis, smoking status, diabetes mellitus duration, nut consumption before diabetes mellitus diagnosis, or diet quality. CONCLUSIONS: Higher consumption of nuts, especially tree nuts, is associated with lower CVD incidence and mortality among participants with diabetes mellitus. These data provide novel evidence that supports the recommendation of incorporating nuts into healthy dietary patterns for the prevention of CVD complications and premature deaths among individuals with diabetes mellitus.

        "Diagnosing and Treating Sleep Apnea in Patients With Acute Cerebrovascular Disease. Background: Obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) is common among patients with acute ischemic stroke and transient ischemic attack. We evaluated whether continuous positive airway pressure for OSA among patients with recent ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack improved clinical outcomes. . Methods and Results: This randomized controlled trial among patients with ischemic stroke/transient ischemic attack compared 2 strategies (standard or enhanced) for the diagnosis and treatment of OSA versus usual care over 1 year. Primary outcomes were National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale and modified Rankin Scale scores. Among 252 patients (84, control; 86, standard; 82, enhanced), OSA prevalence was as follows: control, 69%; standard, 74%; and enhanced, 80%. Continuous positive airway pressure use occurred on average 50% of nights and was similar among standard (3.9\u00b12.1 mean hours/nights used) and enhanced (4.3\u00b12.4\u00a0hours/nights used; P=0.46) patients. In intention-to-treat analyses, changes in National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale and modified Rankin Scale scores were similar across groups. In as-treated analyses among patients with OSA, increasing continuous positive airway pressure use was associated with improved National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score (no/poor, -0.6\u00b12.9; some, -0.9\u00b11.4; good, -0.3\u00b11.0; P=0.0064) and improved modified Rankin Scale score (no/poor, -0.3\u00b11.5; some, -0.4\u00b11.0; good, -0.9\u00b11.2; P=0.0237). In shift analyses among patients with OSA, 59% of intervention patients had best neurological symptom severity (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score, 0-1) versus 38% of controls ( P=0.038); absolute risk reduction was 21% (number needed to treat, 4.8). . Conclusions: Although changes in neurological functioning and functional status were similar across the groups in the intention-to-treat analyses, continuous positive airway pressure use was associated with improved neurological functioning among patients with acute ischemic stroke/transient ischemic attack with OSA .

        "Smoking Status and Functional Outcomes After Acute Ischemic Stroke. Background and Purpose: Smoking is an established risk factor for stroke; however, it is uncertain whether prestroke smoking status affects clinical outcomes of acute ischemic stroke. This study aimed to elucidate the association between smoking status and functional outcomes after acute ischemic stroke. . Methods: Using a multicenter hospital-based stroke registry in Japan, we investigated 10 825 patients with acute ischemic stroke hospitalized between July 2007 and December 2017 who had been independent before stroke onset. Smoking status was categorized into those who had never smoked (nonsmokers), former smokers, and current smokers. Clinical outcomes included poor functional outcome (modified Rankin Scale score \u22652) and functional dependence (modified Rankin Scale score 2-5) at 3 months. We adjusted for potential confounding factors using a logistic regression analysis. . Results: The mean age of patients was 70.2\u00b112.2 years, and 37.0% were women. There were 4396 (42.7%) nonsmokers, 3328 (32.4%) former smokers, and 2561 (24.9%) current smokers. The odds ratio (95% CI) for poor functional outcome after adjusting for confounders increased in current smokers (1.29 [1.11-1.49] versus nonsmokers) but not in former smokers (1.05 [0.92-1.21] versus nonsmokers). However, among the former smokers, the odds ratio of poor functional outcome was higher in those who quit smoking within 2 years of stroke onset (1.75 [1.15-2.66] versus nonsmokers). The risk of poor functional outcome tended to increase as the number of daily cigarettes increased in current smokers (P for trend=0.002). All these associations were maintained for functional dependence. . Conclusions: Current and recent smoking is associated with an increased risk of unfavorable functional outcomes at 3 months after acute ischemic stroke. .

        "Impact of Smoking Status on Stroke Recurrence. Background: Smoking is a well-established risk factor of stroke and smoking cessation has been recommended for stroke prevention; however, the impact of smoking status on stroke recurrence has not been well studied to date. . Methods and Results: Patients with first-ever stroke were enrolled and followed in the NSRP (Nanjing Stroke Registry Program). Smoking status was assessed at baseline and reassessed at the first follow-up. The primary end point was defined as fatal or nonfatal recurrent stroke after 3\u00a0months of the index stroke. The association between smoking and the risk of stroke recurrence was analyzed with multivariate Cox regression model. At baseline, among 3069 patients included, 1331 (43.4%) were nonsmokers, 263 (8.6%) were former smokers, and 1475 (48.0%) were current smokers. At the first follow-up, 908 (61.6%) patients quit smoking. After a mean follow-up of 2.4\u00b11.2\u00a0years, 293 (9.5%) patients had stroke recurrence. With nonsmokers as the reference, the adjusted hazard ratios for stroke recurrence were 1.16 (95% CI , 0.75-1.79) in former smokers, 1.31 (95% CI , 0.99-1.75) in quitters, and 1.93 (95% CI , 1.43-2.61) in persistent smokers. Among persistent smokers, hazard ratios for stroke recurrence ranged from 1.68 (95% CI , 1.14-2.48) in those who smoked 1 to 20 cigarettes daily to 2.72 (95% CI , 1.36-5.43) in those who smoked more than 40 cigarettes daily ( P for trend <0.001). . Conclusions: After an initial stroke, persistent smoking increases the risk of stroke recurrence. There exists a dose-response relationship between smoking quantity and the risk of stroke recurrence.

        "Clinical and Genetic Determinants of Varicose Veins. BACKGROUND: Varicose veins are a common problem with no approved medical therapies. Although it is believed that varicose vein pathogenesis is multifactorial, there is limited understanding of the genetic and environmental factors that contribute to their formation. Large-scale studies of risk factors for varicose veins may highlight important aspects of pathophysiology and identify groups at increased risk for disease. METHODS: We applied machine learning to agnostically search for risk factors of varicose veins in 493\u2009519 individuals in the UK Biobank. Predictors were further studied with univariable and multivariable Cox regression analyses (2441 incident events). A genome-wide association study of varicose veins was also performed among 337\u2009536 unrelated individuals (9577 cases) of white British descent, followed by expression quantitative loci and pathway analyses. Because height emerged as a new candidate risk factor, we performed mendelian randomization analyses to assess a potential causal role for height in varicose vein development. RESULTS: Machine learning confirmed several known (age, sex, obesity, pregnancy, history of deep vein thrombosis) and identified several new risk factors for varicose vein disease, including height. After adjustment for traditional risk factors in Cox regression, greater height remained independently associated with varicose veins (hazard ratio for upper versus lower quartile, 1.74; 95% CI, 1.51-2.01; P<0.0001). A genome-wide association study identified 30 new genome-wide significant loci, identifying pathways involved in vascular development and skeletal/limb biology. Mendelian randomization analysis provided evidence that increased height is causally related to varicose veins (inverse-variance weighted: odds ratio, 1.26; P=2.07\u00d710-16). CONCLUSIONS: Using data from nearly a half-million individuals, we present a comprehensive genetic and epidemiological study of varicose veins. We identified novel clinical and genetic risk factors that provide pathophysiological insights and could help future improvements of treatment of varicose vein disease. ",
        "Higher Body Mass Index in Adolescence Predicts Cardiomyopathy Risk in Midlife. BACKGROUND: Modifiable lifestyle factors in relation to risk for cardiomyopathy, a common and increasing cause of heart failure in the young, have not been widely studied. We sought to investigate a potential link between obesity, a recognized predictor of early heart failure, in adolescence and being diagnosed with cardiomyopathy in adulthood. METHODS: This was a nationwide register-based prospective cohort study of 1\u2009668\u2009893 adolescent men (mean age, 18.3 years; SD, 0.7 years) who enlisted for compulsory military service from 1969 to 2005. At baseline, body mass index (BMI), blood pressure, and medical disorders were registered, along with test results for fitness and muscle strength. Cardiomyopathy diagnoses were identified from the National Hospital Register and Cause of Death Register during an up to 46-year follow-up and divided into categories: dilated, hypertrophic, alcohol/drug-induced, and other. Hazard ratios were calculated with Cox proportional hazards models. RESULTS: During follow-up (median, 27 years; Q1-Q3, 19-35 years), 4477 cases of cardiomyopathy were identified, of which 2631 (59%) were dilated, 673 (15%) were hypertrophic, and 480 (11%) were alcohol/drug-induced. Increasing BMI was strongly associated with elevated risk of cardiomyopathy, especially dilated, starting at levels considered normal (BMI, 22.5-<25 kg/m2; hazard ratio, 1.38 [95% CI, 1.22-1.57]), adjusted for age, year, center, and baseline comorbidities, and with a >8-fold increased risk at BMI \u226535 kg/m2 compared with BMI of 18.5 to <20 kg/m2. For each 1-unit increase in BMI, similarly adjusted hazard ratios were 1.15 (95% CI, 1.14-1.17) for dilated cardiomyopathy, 1.09 (95% CI, 1.06-1.12) for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and 1.10 (1.06-1.13) for alcohol/drug-induced cardiomyopathy. CONCLUSIONS: Even mildly elevated body weight in late adolescence may contribute to being diagnosed with cardiomyopathy in adulthood. The already marked importance of weight control in youth is further strengthened by these findings, as well as greater evidence for obesity as a potential important cause of adverse cardiac remodeling that is independent of clinically evident ischemic heart disease.

        "Comparison of Cardiovascular Health Between US Army and Civilians. Background: Cardiovascular conditions are common in US Army and civilian populations. The recently developed concept of ideal cardiovascular health provides a new approach to evaluating population cardiovascular status. . Methods and Results: We defined a cohort of 263\u00a0430 active duty Army personnel, aged 17 to 64\u00a0years, who completed a 2012 physical examination and a corresponding subset of the noninstitutionalized, civilian US population, who participated in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey ( NHANES ) 2011 to 2012 cycle. We compared 4 cardiovascular health metrics (current smoking, body mass index, blood pressure, and diabetic status) between Army and civilian groups overall, and separately by sex, race/ethnicity, and age. The Army population was younger, was less often women or Hispanic, and had less post-high school education than the NHANES population. Smoking rates were \u224820% in the Army and NHANES groups, but <15% among Army women and Hispanics. Overall, one third of the Army and NHANES groups and NHANES women, but nearly half of Army women, demonstrated ideal body mass index. Ideal blood pressure was strikingly less prevalent in the Army than NHANES participants (30% versus 55%). Diabetes mellitus was rare in both groups. . Conclusions: Ideal cardiovascular health was less prevalent in the Army than NHANES group, despite exclusion of the least healthy recruits. Prevalence of ideal body mass index and blood pressure was low in both the Army and NHANES groups, even at early adult ages. This finding reveals the need for policy changes to promote, preserve, and improve ideal cardiovascular health in both the Army and the US population as a whole. ",
        "Brachial and Radial Systolic Blood Pressure Are Not the Same. Radial intra-arterial blood pressure (BP) is sometimes used as the reference standard for validation of brachial cuff BP devices. Moreover, there is an emerging wearables market seeking to measure BP at the wrist. However, radial systolic BP may differ when compared with brachial; yet some authors have labeled these differences as a fictional Popeye phenomenon. Indeed, differences between brachial and radial systolic BP have never been accurately quantified, and this was the aim of this study. Intra-arterial BP was measured consecutively at the brachial and radial artery in 180 participants undergoing coronary angiography (aged 61\u00b110 years; 69% men). On average, radial systolic BP was 5.5 mm\u2009Hg higher than brachial systolic BP. Only 43% of participants had radial systolic BP within \u00b15 mm\u2009Hg of brachial. Additionally, 46%, 19%, and 13% of participants had radial systolic BP >5, between 5 and 10, and between 10 and 15 mm\u2009Hg higher than brachial respectively. A further 14% of participants had radial systolic BP >15 mm\u2009Hg higher than brachial, representing the so-called Popeye phenomenon. Finally, 11% of participants had radial systolic BP >5 mm\u2009Hg lower than brachial. In conclusion, radial systolic BP is not representative of brachial systolic BP, with most participants having a radial systolic BP >5 mm\u2009Hg higher than brachial and many with differences >15 mm\u2009Hg. Therefore, validation testing of BP devices utilizing intra-arterial BP as the reference standard should use intra-arterial BP measured at the same site as the brachial cuff or wearable device. ",
        "Association Between Secondary Prevention Medication Use and Outcomes in Frail Older Adults After Acute Myocardial Infarction. Background: Secondary prevention medications are often not prescribed to frail, older adults following acute myocardial infarction, potentially because of the absence of data to support use, perceived lack of benefit, and concern over possible harms. We examined the effect of using more guideline-recommended medications after myocardial infarction on mortality, rehospitalization, and functional decline in the frailest and oldest segment of the US population-long-stay nursing home residents. . Methods and Results: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of nursing home residents aged \u226565 years using 2007 to 2010 national US Minimum Data Set clinical assessment data and Medicare claims. Exposure was the number of secondary prevention medications (antiplatelets, \u03b2-blockers, statins, and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors) initiated after myocardial infarction. Outcomes were 90-day death, rehospitalization, and functional decline. We compared outcomes for new users of 2 versus 1 and 3 or 4 versus 1 medications using the inverse probability of treatment-weighted odds ratios with 95% CI. The cohort comprised 4787 residents, with a total of 509 death, 820 functional decline, and 1226 rehospitalization events. Compared with individuals who initiated 1 medication, mortality odds ratios were 0.98 (95% CI, 0.79-1.22) and 0.74 (95% CI, 0.57-0.97) for users of 2 and 3 or 4 medications, respectively. Rehospitalization odds ratios were 1.00 (95% CI, 0.85-1.17) for 2 and 0.97 (95% CI, 0.8-1.17) for 3 or 4 medications. Functional decline odds ratios were 1.04 (95% CI, 0.85-1.28) for 2 and 1.12 (95% CI, 0.89-1.40) for 3 or 4 medications. In a stability analysis excluding antiplatelet drugs from the exposure definition, more medication use was associated with functional decline. . Conclusions: Use of more guideline-recommended medications after myocardial infarction was associated with decreased mortality in older, predominantly frail adults, but no difference in rehospitalization. Results for functional decline from the main and stability analyses were discordant and did not rule out an increased risk associated with more medication use. ",
        "Pathoanatomic Findings Associated With Duty-Related Cardiac Death in US Firefighters: A Case-Control Study. Background: Sudden cardiac death accounts for the greatest proportion of duty-related deaths among US firefighters. Increased understanding of the pathoanatomic causes of sudden cardiac death and the risk associated with underlying cardiac pathologies is needed to develop evidence-based screening recommendations. . Methods and Results: Using autopsy data for duty-related firefighter fatalities occurring between 1999 and 2014, this retrospective case-control study compared cardiac findings of male firefighters aged 18 to 65\u00a0years who died on duty of cardiac-related causes with those who died of noncardiac trauma-related causes. Data from 276 cardiac cases and 351 noncardiac trauma controls were analyzed. Among cardiac cases, the most prevalent (82%) underlying pathoanatomic substrate was comorbid coronary heart disease and cardiomegaly/left ventricular hypertrophy. Cardiac cases had a higher prevalence of cardiomegaly (heart weight >450\u00a0g), left ventricular hypertrophy (left ventricular wall thickness \u22651.2\u00a0cm), and severe coronary artery stenosis (\u226575%) than trauma controls (all P<0.001). In multivariate analyses, heart weight >450\u00a0g, coronary artery stenosis \u226575%, and evidence of a prior myocardial infarction were strong independent predictors of cardiac death, with odds ratios of 6.1 (95% confidence interval, 3.6-10.4), 9.3 (95% confidence interval, 5.3-16.1), and 6.2 (95% confidence interval, 3.4-11.3), respectively. . Conclusions: The majority of cardiac fatalities had evidence of both coronary heart disease and increased heart mass, and each condition was independently associated with a markedly elevated risk of cardiac death. Targeted screening for coronary heart disease, increased heart mass, and evidence of prior myocardial infarction should be considered to reduce duty-related cardiac deaths among firefighters. ",
        "Posttraumatic stress, anxiety and depression following miscarriage and ectopic pregnancy: a multicenter, prospective, cohort study. BACKGROUND: Early pregnancy losses are common, but their psychologic sequelae are often overlooked. Previous studies have established links between miscarriage and early symptoms of anxiety and depression. However, the incidence of posttraumatic stress symptoms and the psychologic response specifically to ectopic pregnancies have not been investigated. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to investigate levels of posttraumatic stress, depression, and anxiety in women in the 9 months after early pregnancy loss, with a focus on miscarriage and ectopic pregnancy. Morbidity at 1 month was compared with a control group in healthy pregnancy. STUDY DESIGN: This was a prospective cohort study. Consecutive women were recruited from the early pregnancy and antenatal clinics at 3 London hospitals and received emailed surveys that contained standardized psychologic assessments that included the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and Posttraumatic stress Diagnostic Scale, at 1, 3, and 9 months after loss. Control subjects were assessed after a dating scan. We assessed the proportion of participants who met the screening criteria for posttraumatic stress and moderate/severe anxiety or depression. We used logistic regression to calculate adjusted odds ratios. RESULTS: Seven hundred thirty-seven of 1098 women (67%) with early pregnancy loss (including 537 miscarriages and 116 ectopic pregnancies) and 171 of 187 control subjects (91%) agreed to participate. Four hundred ninety-two of the women with losses (67%) completed the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale after 1 month; 426 women (58%) completed it after 3 months, and 338 women (46%) completed it after 9 months. Eighty-seven control subjects (51%) participated. Criteria for posttraumatic stress were met in 29% of women with early pregnancy loss after 1 month and in 18% after 9 months (odds ratio per month, 0.80; 95% confidence interval, 0.72-0.89). Moderate/severe anxiety was reported in 24% after 1 month and in 17% after 9 months (odds ratio per month, 0.69; 95% confidence interval, 0.50-0.94). Moderate/severe depression was reported in 11% of the women after 1 month and 6% of the women after 9 months (odds ratio per month, 0.87; 95% confidence interval, 0.53-1.44). After miscarriage, proportions after 9 months were 16% for posttraumatic stress, 17% for anxiety, and 5% for depression. Corresponding figures after ectopic pregnancy were 21%, 23%, and 11%, respectively. In contrast, among control women with viable pregnancies, 13% reported moderate-to-severe anxiety (odds ratio loss at 1 month vs controls: 2.14; 95% confidence interval, 1.14-4.36), and 2% reported moderate-to-severe depression (odds ratio loss at 1 month vs control subjects: 3.88; 95% confidence interval, 1.27-19.2). CONCLUSION: Women experience high levels of posttraumatic stress, anxiety, and depression after early pregnancy loss. Distress declines over time but remains at clinically important levels at 9 months. ",
        "Will children ever learn? Removal of nasal and aural foreign bodies: a study of hospital episode statistics. Introduction Foreign body removal is a common reason for children to attend the emergency department. Generally, aural and nasal foreign bodies are not associated with immediate morbidity unless they are button batteries. There can be consequences of migration and removal. Methods Hospital Episode Statistics for 2010-2016 were used to calculate the number of nasal and aural foreign bodies that have been removed in hospital. Data for adults and children have been compared. Results 8752 nasal and 17,325 aural foreign bodies have been removed from adults and children over the course of 6 years. Children were responsible for 95% of the 8353 nasal and 85% of the 14,875 aural foreign body presentations. Children aged 1-4 years are most at risk of injury. Conclusion Children are more likely to present to hospital than adults with a foreign body in the ear or nose. Aural bodies were more likely to need removal in hospital for both populations. Authors believe that these require identification and removal by an ear, nose and throat specialist to prevent morbidity. The overall number of procedures performed annually in children has not reduced over the study period; an average of 1218 nasal and 2479 aural foreign body removals are performed each year with an annual cost of \u00a32,880,148 to NHS England.

        "Bedtime hypertension treatment improves cardiovascular risk reduction: the Hygia Chronotherapy Trial. AIMS: The Hygia Chronotherapy Trial, conducted within the clinical primary care setting, was designed to test whether bedtime in comparison to usual upon awakening hypertension therapy exerts better cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk reduction. METHODS AND RESULTS: In this multicentre, controlled, prospective endpoint trial, 19 084 hypertensive patients (10 614 men/8470 women, 60.5\u2009\u00b1\u200913.7\u2009years of age) were assigned (1:1) to ingest the entire daily dose of \u22651 hypertension medications at bedtime (n\u2009=\u20099552) or all of them upon awakening (n\u2009=\u20099532). At inclusion and at every scheduled clinic visit (at least annually) throughout follow-up, ambulatory blood pressure (ABP) monitoring was performed for 48\u2009h. During the 6.3-year median patient follow-up, 1752 participants experienced the primary CVD outcome (CVD death, myocardial infarction, coronary revascularization, heart failure, or stroke). Patients of the bedtime, compared with the upon-waking, treatment-time regimen showed significantly lower hazard ratio-adjusted for significant influential characteristics of age, sex, type 2 diabetes, chronic kidney disease, smoking, HDL cholesterol, asleep systolic blood pressure (BP) mean, sleep-time relative systolic BP decline, and previous CVD event-of the primary CVD outcome [0.55 (95% CI 0.50-0.61), P\u2009<\u20090.001] and each of its single components (P\u2009<\u20090.001 in all cases), i.e. CVD death [0.44 (0.34-0.56)], myocardial infarction [0.66 (0.52-0.84)], coronary revascularization [0.60 (0.47-0.75)], heart failure [0.58 (0.49-0.70)], and stroke [0.51 (0.41-0.63)]. CONCLUSION: Routine ingestion by hypertensive patients of \u22651 prescribed BP-lowering medications at bedtime, as opposed to upon waking, results in improved ABP control (significantly enhanced decrease in asleep BP and increased sleep-time relative BP decline, i.e. BP dipping) and, most importantly, markedly diminished occurrence of major CVD events.

        "Social media use and adolescent sleep patterns: cross-sectional findings from the UK millennium cohort study. OBJECTIVES: This study examines associations between social media use and multiple sleep parameters in a large representative adolescent sample, controlling for a wide range of covariates. DESIGN: The authors used cross-sectional data from the Millennium Cohort Study, a large nationally representative UK birth cohort study. PARTICIPANTS: Data from 11\u2009872 adolescents (aged 13-15 years) were used in analyses. METHODS: Six self-reported sleep parameters captured sleep timing and quality: sleep onset and wake times (on school days and free days), sleep onset latency (time taken to fall asleep) and trouble falling back asleep after nighttime awakening. Binomial logistic regressions investigated associations between daily social media use and each sleep parameter, controlling for a range of relevant covariates. RESULTS: Average social media use was 1 to <3\u2009hours per day (31.6%, n=3720). 33.7% were classed as low users (<1\u2009hour; n=3986); 13.9% were high users (3 to <5\u2009hours; n=1602) and 20.8% were very high users (5+ hours; n=2203). Girls reported spending more time on social media than boys. Overall, heavier social media use was associated with poorer sleep patterns, controlling for covariates. For example, very high social media users were more likely than comparable average users to report late sleep onset (OR 2.14, 95%\u2009CI 1.83 to 2.50) and wake times (OR 1.97, 95%\u2009CI 1.32 to 2.93) on school days and trouble falling back asleep after nighttime awakening (OR 1.36, 95%\u2009CI 1.10 to 1.66). CONCLUSIONS: This study provides a normative profile of UK adolescent social media use and sleep. Results indicate statistically and practically significant associations between social media use and sleep patterns, particularly late sleep onset. Sleep education and interventions can focus on supporting young people to balance online interactions with an appropriate sleep schedule that allows sufficient sleep on school nights. ",
        "Human Olfaction without Apparent Olfactory Bulbs. The olfactory bulbs (OBs) are the first site of odor representation in the mammalian brain, and their unique ultrastructure is considered a necessary substrate for spatiotemporal coding of smell. Given this, we were struck by the serendipitous observation at MRI of two otherwise healthy young left-handed women, yet with no apparent OBs. Standardized tests revealed normal odor awareness, detection, discrimination, identification, and representation. Functional MRI of these women's brains revealed that odorant-induced activity in piriform cortex, the primary OB target, was similar in its extent to that of intact controls. Finally, review of a public brain-MRI database with 1,113 participants (606 women) also tested for olfactory performance, uncovered olfaction without anatomically defined OBs in \u223c0.6% of women and \u223c4.25% of left-handed women. Thus, humans can perform the basic facets of olfaction without canonical OBs, implying extreme plasticity in the functional neuroanatomy of this sensory system. ",
        "Application of non-HDL cholesterol for population-based cardiovascular risk stratification: results from the Multinational Cardiovascular Risk Consortium. BACKGROUND: The relevance of blood lipid concentrations to long-term incidence of cardiovascular disease and the relevance of lipid-lowering therapy for cardiovascular disease outcomes is unclear. We investigated the cardiovascular disease risk associated with the full spectrum of bloodstream non-HDL cholesterol concentrations. We also created an easy-to-use tool to estimate the long-term probabilities for a cardiovascular disease event associated with non-HDL cholesterol and modelled its risk reduction by lipid-lowering treatment. METHODS: In this risk-evaluation and risk-modelling study, we used Multinational Cardiovascular Risk Consortium data from 19 countries across Europe, Australia, and North America. Individuals without prevalent cardiovascular disease at baseline and with robust available data on cardiovascular disease outcomes were included. The primary composite endpoint of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease was defined as the occurrence of the coronary heart disease event or ischaemic stroke. Sex-specific multivariable analyses were computed using non-HDL cholesterol categories according to the European guideline thresholds, adjusted for age, sex, cohort, and classical modifiable cardiovascular risk factors. In a derivation and validation design, we created a tool to estimate the probabilities of a cardiovascular disease event by the age of 75 years, dependent on age, sex, and risk factors, and the associated modelled risk reduction, assuming a 50% reduction of non-HDL cholesterol. FINDINGS: Of the 524\u2008444 individuals in the 44 cohorts in the Consortium database, we identified 398\u2008846 individuals belonging to 38 cohorts (184\u2008055 [48\u00b77%] women; median age 51\u00b70 years [IQR 40\u00b77-59\u00b77]). 199\u2008415 individuals were included in the derivation cohort (91\u2008786 [48\u00b74%] women) and 199\u2008431 (92\u2008269 [49\u00b71%] women) in the validation cohort. During a maximum follow-up of 43\u00b76 years (median 13\u00b75 years, IQR 7\u00b70-20\u00b71), 54\u2008542 cardiovascular endpoints occurred. Incidence curve analyses showed progressively higher 30-year cardiovascular disease event-rates for increasing non-HDL cholesterol categories (from 7\u00b77% for non-HDL cholesterol <2\u00b76 mmol/L to 33\u00b77% for \u22655\u00b77 mmol/L in women and from 12\u00b78% to 43\u00b76% in men; p<0\u00b70001). Multivariable adjusted Cox models with non-HDL cholesterol lower than 2\u00b76 mmol/L as reference showed an increase in the association between non-HDL cholesterol concentration and cardiovascular disease for both sexes (from hazard ratio 1\u00b71, 95% CI 1\u00b70-1\u00b73 for non-HDL cholesterol 2\u00b76 to <3\u00b77 mmol/L to 1\u00b79, 1\u00b76-2\u00b72 for \u22655\u00b77 mmol/L in women and from 1\u00b71, 1\u00b70-1\u00b73 to 2\u00b73, 2\u00b70-2\u00b75 in men). The derived tool allowed the estimation of cardiovascular disease event probabilities specific for non-HDL cholesterol with high comparability between the derivation and validation cohorts as reflected by smooth calibration curves analyses and a root mean square error lower than 1% for the estimated probabilities of cardiovascular disease. A 50% reduction of non-HDL cholesterol concentrations was associated with reduced risk of a cardiovascular disease event by the age of 75 years, and this risk reduction was greater the earlier cholesterol concentrations were reduced. INTERPRETATION: Non-HDL cholesterol concentrations in blood are strongly associated with long-term risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. We provide a simple tool for individual long-term risk assessment and the potential benefit of early lipid-lowering intervention. These data could be useful for physician-patient communication about primary prevention strategies.

        "Use of anastrozole for breast cancer prevention (IBIS-II): long-term results of a randomised controlled trial. BACKGROUND: Two large clinical trials have shown a reduced rate of breast cancer development in high-risk women in the initial 5 years of follow-up after use of aromatase inhibitors (MAP.3 and International Breast Cancer Intervention Study II [IBIS-II]). Here, we report blinded long-term follow-up results for the IBIS-II trial, which compared anastrozole with placebo, with the objective of determining the efficacy of anastrozole for preventing breast cancer (both invasive and ductal carcinoma in situ) in the post-treatment period. METHODS: IBIS-II is an international, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Postmenopausal women at increased risk of developing breast cancer were recruited and were randomly assigned (1:1) to either anastrozole (1 mg per day, oral) or matching placebo daily for 5 years. After treatment completion, women were followed on a yearly basis to collect data on breast cancer incidence, death, other cancers, and major adverse events (cardiovascular events and fractures). The primary outcome was all breast cancer. FINDINGS: 3864 women were recruited between Feb 2, 2003, and Jan 31, 2012. 1920 women were randomly assigned to 5 years anastrozole and 1944 to placebo. After a median follow-up of 131 months (IQR 105-156), a 49% reduction in breast cancer was observed for anastrozole (85 vs 165 cases, hazard ratio [HR] 0\u00b751, 95% CI 0\u00b739-0\u00b766, p<0\u00b70001). The reduction was larger in the first 5 years (35 vs 89, 0\u00b739, 0\u00b727-0\u00b758, p<0\u00b70001), but still significant after 5 years (50 vs 76 new cases, 0\u00b764, 0\u00b745-0\u00b791, p=0\u00b7014), and not significantly different from the first 5 years (p=0\u00b7087). Invasive oestrogen receptor-positive breast cancer was reduced by 54% (HR 0\u00b746, 95% CI 0\u00b733-0\u00b765, p<0\u00b70001), with a continued significant effect in the period after treatment. A 59% reduction in ductal carcinoma in situ was observed (0\u00b741, 0\u00b722-0\u00b779, p=0\u00b70081), especially in participants known to be oestrogen receptor-positive (0\u00b722, 0\u00b778-0\u00b765, p<0\u00b70001). No significant difference in deaths was observed overall (69 vs 70, HR 0\u00b796, 95% CI 0\u00b769-1\u00b734, p=0\u00b782) or for breast cancer (two anastrozole vs three placebo). A significant decrease in non-breast cancers was observed for anastrozole (147 vs 200, odds ratio 0\u00b772, 95% CI 0\u00b757-0\u00b791, p=0\u00b70042), owing primarily to non-melanoma skin cancer. No excess of fractures or cardiovascular disease was observed. INTERPRETATION: This analysis has identified a significant continuing reduction in breast cancer with anastrozole in the post-treatment follow-up period, with no evidence of new late side-effects. Further follow-up is needed to assess the effect on breast cancer mortality.

        "Birth weight for gestational age and the risk of infertility: a Danish cohort study. STUDY QUESTION: Is birth weight for gestational age associated with infertility in adulthood among men and women?. SUMMARY ANSWER: Being born small for gestational age (SGA) was associated with infertility in adulthood among men. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Fetal growth restriction may affect fertility, but results from previous studies have been inconsistent. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: In this population-based cohort study, we used data from a Danish birth cohort, including 5594 men and 5342 women born between 1984 and 1987. Information on infertility was obtained from Danish health registers during the period from the participants' 18th birthday and up until 31 December 2017. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Participants were men and women born in two Danish municipalities, Aalborg and Odense. Information on birth weight and gestational age was obtained from birth records, and information on infertility diagnoses and fertility treatment was retrieved from the Danish National Patient Registry (NPR) and the Danish In Vitro Fertilisation (IVF) registry. Information on potential maternal confounders was obtained from questionnaires during pregnancy and was included in adjusted analyses. Logistic regression analysis was used to estimate crude and adjusted odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for infertility according to birth weight for gestational age. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: Men born SGA had a 55% higher risk of being diagnosed with or treated for infertility compared to men born appropriate for gestational age (AGA) (adjusted OR\u2009=\u20091.55, 95% CI: 1.09-2.21). The association attenuated after exclusion of men born with hypospadias or cryptorchidism (OR\u2009=\u20091.37, 95% CI: 0.93-2.01). No association was found between women's birth weight for gestational age and risk of infertility (adjusted OR\u2009=\u20091.00, 95% CI: 0.73-1.37). LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: Estimation of gestational age is associated with some uncertainty and might have caused non-differential misclassification. The study design implicitly assumed similar distribution of reproductive and health-seeking behaviour across the groups that were compared. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: Men born SGA had a higher risk of infertility. Genital malformations may account for part of the observed association, but this must be explored further. STUDY FUNDING/COMPETING INTEREST(S): This study was supported by Health, Aarhus University. No competing interests are declared. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: N/A. ",
        "Lipid metabolic pathways converge in motor neuron degenerative diseases. Motor neuron diseases (MNDs) encompass an extensive and heterogeneous group of upper and/or lower motor neuron degenerative disorders, in which the particular clinical outcomes stem from the specific neuronal component involved in each condition. While mutations in a large number of molecules associated with lipid metabolism are known to be implicated in MNDs, there remains a lack of clarity regarding the key functional pathways involved, and their inter-relationships. This review highlights evidence that defines defects within two specific lipid (cholesterol/oxysterol and phosphatidylethanolamine) biosynthetic cascades as being centrally involved in MND, particularly hereditary spastic paraplegia. We also identify how other MND-associated molecules may impact these cascades, in particular through impaired organellar interfacing, to propose 'subcellular lipidome imbalance' as a likely common pathomolecular theme in MND. Further exploration of this mechanism has the potential to identify new therapeutic targets and management strategies for modulation of disease progression in hereditary spastic paraplegias and other MNDs.

        "International evaluation of an AI system for breast cancer screening. Screening mammography aims to identify breast cancer at earlier stages of the disease, when treatment can be more successful1. Despite the existence of screening programmes worldwide, the interpretation of mammograms is affected by high rates of false positives and false negatives2. Here we present an artificial intelligence (AI) system that is capable of surpassing human experts in breast cancer prediction. To assess its performance in the clinical setting, we curated a large representative dataset from the UK and a large enriched dataset from the USA. We show an absolute reduction of 5.7%\u00a0and 1.2% (USA and UK) in false positives and 9.4%\u00a0and 2.7% in false negatives. We provide evidence of the ability of the system to generalize from the UK to the USA. In an independent study of six radiologists, the AI system outperformed all of the human readers: the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC) for the AI system was greater than the AUC-ROC for the average radiologist by an absolute margin of 11.5%. We ran a simulation in which the AI system participated in the double-reading process that is used in the UK, and found that the AI system maintained non-inferior performance and reduced the workload of the second reader by 88%. This robust assessment of the AI system paves the way for clinical trials to improve the accuracy and efficiency of breast cancer screening. ",
        "Training for a First-Time Marathon Reverses Age-Related Aortic Stiffening. BACKGROUND: Aging increases aortic stiffness, contributing to cardiovascular risk even in healthy individuals. Aortic stiffness is reduced through supervised training programs, but these are not easily generalizable. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to determine whether real-world exercise training for a first-time marathon can reverse age-related aortic stiffening. METHODS: Untrained healthy individuals underwent 6\u00a0months of training for the London Marathon. Assessment pre-training and 2\u00a0weeks post-marathon included central (aortic) blood pressure and aortic stiffness using cardiovascular magnetic resonance distensibility. Biological \"aortic age\" was calculated from the baseline chronological age-stiffness relationship. Change in stiffness was assessed at the ascending (Ao-A) and descending aorta at the pulmonary artery bifurcation (Ao-P) and diaphragm (Ao-D). Data are mean changes (95% confidence intervals [CIs]). RESULTS: A total of 138 first-time marathon completers (age 21 to 69 years, 49% male) were assessed, with an estimated training schedule of 6 to 13 miles/week. At baseline, a decade of chronological aging correlated with a decrease in Ao-A, Ao-P, and Ao-D distensibility by 2.3, 1.9, and 3.1\u00a0\u00d7 10-3 mm\u00a0Hg-1, respectively (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05 for all). Training decreased systolic and diastolic central (aortic) blood pressure by 4\u00a0mm\u00a0Hg (95%\u00a0CI: 2.8 to 5.5\u00a0mm\u00a0Hg) and 3\u00a0mm\u00a0Hg (95%\u00a0CI: 1.6 to 3.5\u00a0mm\u00a0Hg). Descending aortic distensibility increased (Ao-P: 9%; p\u00a0=\u00a00.009; Ao-D: 16%; p\u00a0=\u00a00.002), while remaining unchanged in the Ao-A. These translated to a reduction in \"aortic age\" by 3.9 years (95%\u00a0CI: 1.1 to 7.6 years) and 4.0 years (95%\u00a0CI: 1.7 to 8.0 years) (Ao-P and Ao-D, respectively). Benefit was greater in older, male participants with slower running times (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05 for all). CONCLUSIONS: Training for and completing a marathon even at relatively low exercise intensity reduces central blood pressure and aortic stiffness-equivalent to a \u223c4-year reduction in vascular age. Greater rejuvenation was observed in older, slower individuals. ",
        "Cigarette butts have adverse effects on initial growth of perennial ryegrass (gramineae: Lolium perenne L.) and white clover (leguminosae: Trifolium repens L.). Cigarette filters (butts) are currently the most abundant form of anthropogenic litter on the planet, yet we know very little about their environmental impacts on terrestrial ecosystems, including plant germination and primary production. When discarded, filters contain a myriad of chemicals resulting from smoking tobacco and some still contain unsmoked remnants. A greenhouse experiment was used to assess the impacts of discarded filters of regular or menthol cigarette, either from unsmoked, smoked, or smoked cigarettes with remnant tobacco, on the growth and development of Lolium perenne (perennial ryegrass) and Trifolium repens (white clover). After 21 days, shoot length and germination success were significantly reduced by exposure to any type of cigarette filter for the grass and clover. Although total grass biomass was not measurably affected, the root biomass and root:shoot ratio were less in the clover when exposed to filters from smoked regular cigarettes and those with remnant tobacco. Cigarette filters caused an increase in chlorophyll-a in clover shoots and an increase in chlorophyll-b in grass shoots. Accordingly, whilst the chlorophyll a:b ratio was increased in the clover exposed to cigarette filters, it was decreased in grass. This study indicates the potential for littered cigarette filters to reduce growth and alter short-term primary productivity of terrestrial plants. ",
        "Early childhood deprivation is associated with alterations in adult brain structure despite subsequent environmental enrichment. Early childhood deprivation is associated with higher rates of neurodevelopmental and mental disorders in adulthood. The impact of childhood deprivation on the adult brain and the extent to which structural changes underpin these effects are currently unknown. To investigate these questions, we utilized MRI data collected from young adults who were exposed to severe deprivation in early childhood in the Romanian orphanages of the Ceau\u0219escu era and then, subsequently adopted by UK families; 67 Romanian adoptees (with between 3 and 41 mo of deprivation) were compared with 21 nondeprived UK adoptees. Romanian adoptees had substantially smaller total brain volumes (TBVs) than nondeprived adoptees (8.6% reduction), and TBV was strongly negatively associated with deprivation duration. This effect persisted after covarying for potential environmental and genetic confounds. In whole-brain analyses, deprived adoptees showed lower right inferior frontal surface area and volume but greater right inferior temporal lobe thickness, surface area, and volume than the nondeprived adoptees. Right medial prefrontal volume and surface area were positively associated with deprivation duration. No deprivation-related effects were observed in limbic regions. Global reductions in TBV statistically mediated the observed relationship between institutionalization and both lower intelligence quotient (IQ) and higher levels of attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder symptoms. The deprivation-related increase in right inferior temporal volume seemed to be compensatory, as it was associated with lower levels of attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder symptoms. We provide compelling evidence that time-limited severe deprivation in the first years of life is related to alterations in adult brain structure, despite extended enrichment in adoptive homes in the intervening years.

        "Healthy lifestyle and life expectancy free of cancer, cardiovascular disease, and type 2 diabetes: prospective cohort study. OBJECTIVE: To examine how a healthy lifestyle is related to life expectancy that is free from major chronic diseases. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: The Nurses' Health Study (1980-2014; n=73\u2009196) and the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study (1986-2014; n=38\u2009366). MAIN EXPOSURES: Five low risk lifestyle factors: never smoking, body mass index 18.5-24.9, moderate to vigorous physical activity (\u226530 minutes/day), moderate alcohol intake (women: 5-15 g/day; men 5-30 g/day), and a higher diet quality score (upper 40%). MAIN OUTCOME: Life expectancy free of diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and cancer. RESULTS: The life expectancy free of diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and cancer at age 50 was 23.7 years (95% confidence interval 22.6 to 24.7) for women who adopted no low risk lifestyle factors, in contrast to 34.4 years (33.1 to 35.5) for women who adopted four or five low risk factors. At age 50, the life expectancy free of any of these chronic diseases was 23.5 (22.3 to 24.7) years among men who adopted no low risk lifestyle factors and 31.1 (29.5 to 32.5) years in men who adopted four or five low risk lifestyle factors. For current male smokers who smoked heavily (\u226515 cigarettes/day) or obese men and women (body mass index \u226530), their disease-free life expectancies accounted for the lowest proportion (\u226475%) of total life expectancy at age 50. CONCLUSION: Adherence to a healthy lifestyle at mid-life is associated with a longer life expectancy free of major chronic diseases. ",
        "Impact of London's low emission zone on air quality and children's respiratory health: a sequential annual cross-sectional study. BACKGROUND: Low emission zones (LEZ) are an increasingly common, but unevaluated, intervention aimed at improving urban air quality and public health. We investigated the impact of London's LEZ on air quality and children's respiratory health. METHODS: We did a sequential annual cross-sectional study of 2164 children aged 8-9 years attending primary schools between 2009-10 and 2013-14 in central London, UK, following the introduction of London's LEZ in February, 2008. We examined the association between modelled pollutant exposures of nitrogen oxides (including nitrogen dioxide [NO2]) and particulate matter with a diameter of less than 2\u00b75 \u03bcm (PM2\u00b75) and less than 10 \u03bcm (PM10) and lung function: postbronchodilator forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1, primary outcome), forced vital capacity (FVC), and respiratory or allergic symptoms. We assigned annual exposures by each child's home and school address, as well as spatially resolved estimates for the 3 h (0600-0900 h), 24 h, and 7 days before each child's assessment, to isolate long-term from short-term effects. FINDINGS: The percentage of children living at addresses exceeding the EU limit value for annual NO2 (40 \u03bcg/m3) fell from 99% (444/450) in 2009 to 34% (150/441) in 2013. Over this period, we identified a reduction in NO2 at both roadside (median -1\u00b735 \u03bcg/m3 per year; 95% CI -2\u00b709 to -0\u00b761; p=0\u00b70004) and background locations (-0\u00b797; -1\u00b756 to -0\u00b738; p=0\u00b70013), but not for PM10. The effect on PM2\u00b75 was equivocal. We found no association between postbronchodilator FEV1 and annual residential pollutant attributions. By contrast, FVC was inversely correlated with annual NO2 (-0\u00b70023 L/\u03bcg per m3; -0\u00b70044 to -0\u00b70002; p=0\u00b7033) and PM10 (-0\u00b70090 L/\u03bcg per m3; -0\u00b70175 to -0\u00b70005; p=0\u00b7038). INTERPRETATION: Within London's LEZ, a smaller lung volume in children was associated with higher annual air pollutant exposures. We found no evidence of a reduction in the proportion of children with small lungs over this period, despite small improvements in air quality in highly polluted urban areas during the implementation of London's LEZ. Interventions that deliver larger reductions in emissions might yield improvements in children's health.

        "Association of BMI category with change in children's physical activity between ages 6 and 11 years: a longitudinal study. BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: To examine the association of body mass index (BMI) with change in children's physical activity and sedentary time between ages 6 and 11. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 2132 children participated from 57 schools in Southwest England, from the B-PROACT1V study. METHODS: Mean minutes of MVPA and sedentary time per day were derived from accelerometer-based measurements at ages 6, 9 and 11. Linear multilevel models examined the association of BMI categories with MVPA and sedentary time between 6 and 11, adjusting for seasonality, wear time, gender and household education. Differences in change over time were examined using interaction terms. RESULTS: Average weekday MVPA decreased between ages 6 and 11 by 2.2\u2009min/day/year (95% CI: 1.9 to 2.5), with a steeper decline at weekends. Average sedentary time increased at a rate of 12.9\u2009min/day/year (95% CI: 12.2 to 13.6). There were no differences in mean levels of MVPA by BMI categories at age 6, but differences emerged as children aged, with the gap between children who were healthy weight and overweight increasing by 1.7\u2009min/day (95% CI: 0.8-2.6) every year, and between healthy and obese by 2.0\u2009min/day (95% CI: 0.9-3.1) each year. Children who were overweight/obese engaged in less average weekday sedentary time at age 6 than those of healthy weight, but the gap closed by age 11. CONCLUSION: MVPA declines and sedentary time increases on average for all children between ages 6 and 11. While there are no differences in activity levels by BMI category at age 6, differences in MVPA emerge over time for those who are overweight and obese. Developing interventions that support children to retain activity levels as they approach older childhood, particularly those who are overweight/obese could improve public health. ",
        "The fraction of cancer attributable to modifiable risk factors in England, Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland, and the United Kingdom in 2015. BACKGROUND: Changing population-level exposure to modifiable risk factors is a key driver of changing cancer incidence. Understanding these changes is therefore vital when prioritising risk-reduction policies, in order to have the biggest impact on reducing cancer incidence. UK figures on the number of risk factor-attributable cancers are updated here to reflect changing behaviour as assessed in representative national surveys, and new epidemiological evidence. Figures are also presented by UK constituent country because prevalence of risk factor exposure varies between them. METHODS: Population attributable fractions (PAFs) were calculated for combinations of risk factor and cancer type with sufficient/convincing evidence of a causal association. Relative risks (RRs) were drawn from meta-analyses of cohort studies where possible. Prevalence of exposure to risk factors was obtained from nationally representative population surveys. Cancer incidence data for 2015 were sourced from national data releases and, where needed, personal communications. PAF calculations were stratified by age, sex and risk factor exposure level and then combined to create summary PAFs by cancer type, sex and country. RESULTS: Nearly four in ten (37.7%) cancer cases in 2015 in the UK were attributable to known risk factors. The proportion was around two percentage points higher in UK males (38.6%) than in UK females (36.8%). Comparing UK countries, the attributable proportion was highest in Scotland (41.5% for persons) and lowest in England (37.3% for persons). Tobacco smoking contributed by far the largest proportion of attributable cancer cases, followed by overweight/obesity, accounting for 15.1% and 6.3%, respectively, of all cases in the UK in 2015. For 10 cancer types, including two of the five most common cancer types in the UK (lung cancer and melanoma skin cancer), more than 70% of UK cancer cases were attributable to known risk factors. CONCLUSION: Tobacco and overweight/obesity remain the top contributors of attributable cancer cases. Tobacco smoking has the highest PAF because it greatly increases cancer risk and has a large number of cancer types associated with it. Overweight/obesity has the second-highest PAF because it affects a high proportion of the UK population and is also linked with many cancer types. Public health policy may seek to mitigate the level of harm associated with exposure or reduce exposure levels-both approaches may effectively impact cancer incidence. Differences in PAFs between countries and sexes are primarily due to varying prevalence of exposure to risk factors and varying proportions of specific cancer types. This variation in turn is affected by socio-demographic differences which drive differences in exposure to theoretically avoidable 'lifestyle' factors. PAFs at UK country level have not been available previously and they should be used by policymakers in devolved nations. PAFs are estimates based on the best available data, limitations in those data would generally bias toward underestimation of PAFs. Regular collection of risk factor exposure prevalence data which corresponds with epidemiological evidence is vital for analyses like this and should remain a priority for the UK Government and devolved Administrations.

        "Metaviromics Reveals Unknown Viral Diversity in the Biting Midge Culicoides impunctatus. Biting midges (Culicoides species) are vectors of arboviruses and were responsible for the emergence and spread of Schmallenberg virus (SBV) in Europe in 2011 and are likely to be involved in the emergence of other arboviruses in Europe. Improved surveillance and better understanding of risks require a better understanding of the circulating viral diversity in these biting insects. In this study, we expand the sequence space of RNA viruses by identifying a number of novel RNA viruses from Culicoides impunctatus (biting midge) using a meta-transcriptomic approach. A novel metaviromic pipeline called MetaViC was developed specifically to identify novel virus sequence signatures from high throughput sequencing (HTS) datasets in the absence of a known host genome. MetaViC is a protein centric pipeline that looks for specific protein signatures in the reads and contigs generated as part of the pipeline. Several novel viruses, including an alphanodavirus with both segments, a novel relative of the Hubei sobemo-like virus 49, two rhabdo-like viruses and a chuvirus, were identified in the Scottish midge samples. The newly identified viruses were found to be phylogenetically distinct to those previous known. These findings expand our current knowledge of viral diversity in arthropods and especially in these understudied disease vectors. ",
        "Comparison of branded rugby headguards on their effectiveness in reducing impact on the head. Aim: To compare the available brands of rugby headguards and evaluate their impact attenuation properties at various locations on the cranium, with regard to concussion prevention. Methods: Seven different branded headguards were fitted onto a rigid headform and drop-tested in three different positions. An accelerometer measured the linear acceleration the headform experienced on impact with the ground. Each test involved dropping the headform from a height that generated 103.8 g on average when bare, which is the closest acceleration to the upper limit of the concussion threshold of 100 g. A mean peak acceleration for each drop position was calculated and compared with the bare baseline measurement. Results: Each headguard demonstrated a significant decrease in the mean peak acceleration from the baseline value (all p\u22640.01). Overall the Canterbury Ventilator was the most effective headguard, decreasing the impact force on average by 47%. The least effective was the XBlades Elite headguard, averaging a force reduction of 27%. In five of the seven headguards, the right side of the headwear was the most effective at reducing impact force. Conclusion: Overall, the results indicate that it would be beneficial to wear a headguard during rugby in order to reduce the impact forces involved in head collisions. There was also a clear difference in performance between the tested brands, establishing the Canterbury headguard as the most effective. However, only one model of headguard from each brand was tested, so further research evaluating all other models should be considered. ",
        "Smoking during pregnancy, stigma and secrets: Visual methods exploration in the UK. BACKGROUND: Moral judgements are commonly directed towards mothers through reference to health behaviour in pregnancy, and working-class mothers are particularly subject to this moral gaze. AIM: To gain an in-depth understanding of the health issues affecting 10 low income pregnant women from deprived areas of south Wales, UK. METHODS: Participants completed visual activities (timelines, collaging or thought bubbles and dyad sandboxing) prior to each interview. Participants' visual representations were used in place of a topic guide, to direct the interview. Guided by feminist principles, 28 interviews were completed with 10 women. Data were analysed thematically. FINDINGS: Smoking was discussed at length during interviews, and this paper focuses on this issue alone. Five of the participants had smoked during pregnancy. Negative reactions were directed towards pregnant women who smoked in public, resulting in maternal smoking being undertaken in private. Participants also reported awkward relationships with midwives and other health professionals, including receipt of public health advice in a judgemental tone. DISCUSSION: Smoking during pregnancy is a particularly demonised and stigmatised activity. This stigma is not always related to the level of risk to the foetus, and instead can be seen as a moral judgement about women. We urgently need to move from individualised neo-liberal discourses about the failure of individual smokers, to a more socio-ecological view which avoids victim blaming. CONCLUSION: Stigma from friends, family, strangers and health professionals may lead to hidden smoking. This is a barrier to women obtaining evidence based stop smoking support. ",
        "Return to Employment After Stroke in Young Adults: How Important Is the Speed and Energy Cost of Walking?. Background and Purpose- A quarter of individuals who experience a stroke are under the age of 65 years (defined as young adults), and up to 44% will be unable to return to work poststroke, predominantly because of walking difficulties. No research study has comprehensively analyzed walking performance in young adult's poststroke. The primary aim of this study is to investigate how a stroke in young adults affects walking performance (eg, walking speed and metabolic cost) compared with healthy age-matched controls. The secondary aim is to determine the predictive ability of walking performance parameters for return to employment poststroke. Methods- Forty-six individuals (18-40 years: n=6, 41-54 years: n=21, 55-65 years: n=19) who have had a stroke and 15 healthy age-matched able-bodied controls were recruited from 6 hospital sites in Wales, United Kingdom. Type, location, cause of stroke, and demographic factors (eg, employment status) were recorded. Temporal and spatial walking parameters were measured using 3-dimensional gait analysis. Metabolic energy expenditure and metabolic cost of walking were captured during 3 minutes of walking at self-selected speed from measurements of oxygen consumption. Results- Stroke participants walked slower (P<0.004) and less efficiently (P<0.002) than the controls. Only 23% of stroke participants returned to employment poststroke. Walking speed was the strongest predictor (sensitivity, 0.90; specificity, 0.82) for return to work (P=0.004) with a threshold of 0.93 m/s identified: individuals able to walk faster than 0.93 m/s were significantly more likely to return to work poststroke than those who walked slower than this threshold. Conclusions- This study is the first to capture walking performance parameters of young adults who have had a stroke and identifies slower and less efficient walking. Walking speed emerged as the strongest predictor for return to employment. It is recommended that walking speed be used as a simple but sensitive clinical indicator of functional performance to guide rehabilitation and inform readiness for return to work poststroke. ",
        "Genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screening reveals ubiquitous T cell cancer targeting via the monomorphic MHC class I-related protein MR1. Human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-independent, T cell-mediated targeting of cancer cells would allow immune destruction of malignancies in all individuals. Here, we use genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screening to establish that a T cell receptor (TCR) recognized and killed most human cancer types via the monomorphic MHC class I-related protein, MR1, while remaining inert to noncancerous cells. Unlike mucosal-associated invariant T cells, recognition of target cells by the TCR was independent of bacterial loading. Furthermore, concentration-dependent addition of vitamin B-related metabolite ligands of MR1 reduced TCR recognition of cancer cells, suggesting that recognition occurred via sensing of the cancer metabolome. An MR1-restricted T cell clone mediated in vivo regression of leukemia and conferred enhanced survival of NSG mice. TCR transfer to T cells of patients enabled killing of autologous and nonautologous melanoma. These findings offer opportunities for HLA-independent, pan-cancer, pan-population immunotherapies. ",
        "Healthy dietary indices and risk of depressive outcomes: a systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies. With depression being the psychiatric disorder incurring the largest societal costs in developed countries, there is a need to gather evidence on the role of nutrition in depression, to help develop recommendations and guide future psychiatric health care. The aim of this systematic review was to synthesize the link between diet quality, measured using a range of predefined indices, and depressive outcomes. Medline, Embase and PsychInfo were searched up to 31st May 2018 for studies that examined adherence to a healthy diet in relation to depressive symptoms or clinical depression. Where possible, estimates were pooled using random effect meta-analysis with stratification by observational study design and dietary score. A total of 20 longitudinal and 21 cross-sectional studies were included. These studies utilized an array of dietary measures, including: different measures of adherence to the Mediterranean diet, the Healthy Eating Index (HEI) and Alternative HEI (AHEI), the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension, and the Dietary Inflammatory Index. The most compelling evidence was found for the Mediterranean diet and incident depression, with a combined relative risk estimate of highest vs. lowest adherence category from four longitudinal studies of 0.67 (95% CI 0.55-0.82). A lower Dietary Inflammatory Index was also associated with lower depression incidence in four longitudinal studies (relative risk 0.76; 95% CI: 0.63-0.92). There were fewer longitudinal studies using other indices, but they and cross-sectional evidence also suggest an inverse association between healthy diet and depression (e.g., relative risk 0.65; 95% CI 0.50-0.84 for HEI/AHEI). To conclude, adhering to a healthy diet, in particular a traditional Mediterranean diet, or avoiding a pro-inflammatory diet appears to confer some protection against depression in observational studies. This provides a reasonable evidence base to assess the role of dietary interventions to prevent depression. This systematic review was registered in the PROSPERO International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews under the number CRD42017080579. ",
        "Doctor Referral of Overweight People to Low Energy total diet replacement Treatment (DROPLET): pragmatic randomised controlled trial. OBJECTIVE: To test the effectiveness and safety of a total diet replacement (TDR) programme for routine treatment of obesity in a primary care setting. DESIGN: Pragmatic, two arm, parallel group, open label, individually randomised controlled trial. SETTING: 10 primary care practices in Oxfordshire, UK. PARTICIPANTS: 278 adults who were obese and seeking support to lose weight: 138 were assigned to the TDR programme and 140 to usual care. 73% of participants were re-measured at 12 months. INTERVENTIONS: The TDR programme comprised weekly behavioural support for 12 weeks and monthly support for three months, with formula food products providing 810 kcal/day (3389 kJ/day) as the sole food during the first eight weeks followed by reintroduction of food. Usual care comprised behavioural support for weight loss from a practice nurse and a diet programme with modest energy restriction. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was weight change at 12 months analysed as intention to treat with mixed effects models. Secondary outcomes included biomarkers of cardiovascular and metabolic risk. Adverse events were recorded. RESULTS: Participants in the TDR group lost more weight (-10.7 kg) than those in the usual care group (-3.1 kg): adjusted mean difference -7.2 kg (95% confidence interval -9.4 to -4.9 kg). 45% of participants in the TDR group and 15% in the usual care group experienced weight losses of 10% or more. The TDR group showed greater improvements in biomarkers of cardiovascular and metabolic risk than the usual care group. 11% of participants in the TDR group and 12% in the usual care group experienced adverse events of moderate or greater severity. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with regular weight loss support from a practice nurse, a programme of weekly behavioural support and total diet replacement providing 810 kcal/day seems to be tolerable, and leads to substantially greater weight loss and greater improvements in the risk of cardiometabolic disease.

        "Cannabis resin in the region of Madrid: Adulteration and contamination. The aim of this study is to analyze the adulteration and contamination of cannabis resin obtained on the streets of Madrid, in order to establish whether it is suitable for human consumption. A total of 90 samples obtained through street vending in the Region of Madrid (CAM) were analyzed. Our results showed a direct relationship between the shape of the samples (acorn or ingot) and the presence of foreign elements, adulterants and microbiological contamination. Foreign elements were found in 64.7% of the ingot-shaped samples and in 30.2% of the acorn-shaped samples (p\u2009<\u20090.01); 25% of the samples were deliberately adulterated, 66.7% of which had an ingot shape. With regard to microbiological contamination, 93% of acorns were contaminated by E. coli, compared to 29.4% of ingots (p\u2009<\u20090.0001). In addition, all samples with fecal odor were acorns and were contaminated by E. coli. Ten per cent of the samples were contaminated by Aspergillus; of these, 66.7% had the shape of an acorn. Overall, our results showed that most (88.3%) of the hashish samples were not suitable for consumption. This percentage was significantly higher (p\u2009<\u20090.0001) in acorn than in ingot samples (100% vs. 58.8%). Hence, illegal street vending of hashish constitutes a public health issue. ",
        "Thermal asymmetry of the human scrotum. BACKGROUND: Scrotal temperatures in men have been reported to be either similar on both sides or higher on the left than the right scrotum. We aimed to clarify this discrepancy from new data. METHODS: Retrospective analyses of scrotal temperatures in men aged 20-52 years measured every 2 min with probes connected to a data collector in three experiments. In Experiment I, eight men have been submitted to four successive body positions for 15 min each, first naked then clothed. Experiment II involved 11 postal employees working in a standing position for 90 min continuously. Experiment III involved 11 bus drivers and a 90 min period of continuous driving. Outcome parameters were left and right scrotal temperatures. RESULTS: In Experiment I, mean values and kinetics of scrotal temperature differed significantly in the naked and clothed state. In all three experiments, left scrotal temperature in the clothed state was higher than right scrotal temperature in terms of mean values and temperature kinetics. CONCLUSIONS: Lack of thermal symmetry was seen in the right and left scrotum, whether naked or clothed, and this applied regardless of position or activity when clothed. This thermal difference between right and left scrotum could contribute to the asymmetry in the male external genital organs. ",
        "Maternal age at menarche and pubertal development in sons and daughters: a Nationwide Cohort Study. STUDY QUESTION: Is maternal age at menarche associated with pubertal development in sons and daughters?. SUMMARY ANSWER: Maternal age at menarche was associated with pubertal development in both sons and daughters. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Studies have shown that age at menarche is greatly inherited from mother to daughter, but it remains largely unknown to what extent age at menarche in mothers is associated with timing of puberty in sons. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: In this population-based study we used data from the Puberty Cohort nested within the Danish National Birth Cohort. Live-born singletons aged 11 were followed from 2012 to 2016. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: In total, 15 822 children (7697 sons and 8125 daughters) gave half-yearly information on puberty from the age of 11 years until full sexual maturity or 18 years of age through self-administrated questionnaires (participation rate 71%). Information on maternal age at menarche was reported by the mothers during pregnancy. Maternal age at menarche was used both as a continuous and as a categorical variable (earlier, same time or later than peers). A multivariable regression model for interval-censored data was used. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: Maternal age at menarche was positively associated with timing of genital development, pubic hair development, first ejaculation of semen, voice break, axillary hair development and acne in sons, and with timing of breast development, pubic hair development, menarche, axillary hair development and acne in daughters. In sons, the associations were of similar strength for all pubertal markers, whereas in daughters, the associations were strongest for breast development and menarche. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: Age at menarche was recalled during pregnancy. However, studies indicate that age at menarche is recalled moderately in adulthood. Information on puberty was self-reported, but inaccuracy of data would probably cause non-differential misclassification. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: Early maternal age at menarche was associated with earlier pubertal development, and late maternal age at menarche was associated with later pubertal development in both sons and daughters. The largest effect-estimates were for the associations between maternal age at menarche and the daughters' age at menarche and age at breast development. STUDY FUNDING/COMPETING INTEREST(S): The study was funded by the Danish Council for Independent Research (4183-00152). There are no competing interests. TRIAL REGISTERATION NUMBER: N/A. ",
        "Results on sports-related injuries in children from NHS emergency care dataset Oxfordshire pilot: an ecological study. OBJECTIVES: To analyse and report on sports-related injuries using enhanced injury data collected by the testbed for the NHS emergency care injury data set and admissions data collected from inpatients. DESIGN: Ecological study design. SETTING: Two Oxfordshire NHS England hospitals. PARTICIPANTS: Emergency department attendees and inpatients aged 0-19 years with sports injuries. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Data were analysed from 1 January 2012 to 30 March 2014 by age, gender sport, injury location, injury mechanism and diagnosis including concussion/post-concussion, bone fractures and ligament damage. Admissions data were analysed from 1 January 2012 to 24 January 2015. RESULTS: Children and adolescents aged 0-19 years accounted for almost half (47.4%) of sports injury-related emergency department attendances and almost one-quarter (23.5%) of sports injury-related admissions for all ages. The highest rates of attendance occurred at 14 years for boys (68.22 per 1000 person-years) and 12 years for girls (33.72 per 1000 person-years). For male 0-19-year-olds the three main sports were (in order) football (soccer), rugby union and rugby league and for females, trampoline, netball and horse-riding. The largest gender differences were in netball where injuries were predominantly in females and in wheeled motorsports where injuries were predominantly in males. Almost one-quarter of emergency department sports-related injuries recorded were fractures, the highest percentage to the upper limbs. CONCLUSIONS: Public health departments in local authorities and schools should consider target sports injury prevention at children in the first four years of secondary school. For younger age groups, trampolines in the home warrant improved safety. Rugby and horse-riding should also be a focus for interventions. ",
        "Universal protection against influenza infection by a multidomain antibody to influenza hemagglutinin. Broadly neutralizing antibodies against highly variable pathogens have stimulated the design of vaccines and therapeutics. We report the use of diverse camelid single-domain antibodies to influenza virus hemagglutinin to generate multidomain antibodies with impressive breadth and potency. Multidomain antibody MD3606 protects mice against influenza A and B infection when administered intravenously or expressed locally from a recombinant adeno-associated virus vector. Crystal and single-particle electron microscopy structures of these antibodies with hemagglutinins from influenza A and B viruses reveal binding to highly conserved epitopes. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that multidomain antibodies targeting multiple epitopes exhibit enhanced virus cross-reactivity and potency. In combination with adeno-associated virus-mediated gene delivery, they may provide an effective strategy to prevent infection with influenza virus and other highly variable pathogens. ",
        "Sex differences in risk factors for myocardial infarction: cohort study of UK Biobank participants. OBJECTIVES: To investigate sex differences in risk factors for incident myocardial infarction (MI) and whether they vary with age. DESIGN: Prospective population based study. SETTING: UK Biobank. PARTICIPANTS: 471\u2009998 participants (56% women; mean age 56.2) with no history of cardiovascular disease. . MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Incident (fatal and non-fatal) MI. RESULTS: 5081 participants (1463 (28.8%) of whom were women) had MI over seven years' mean follow-up, resulting in an incidence per 10\u2009000 person years of 7.76 (95% confidence interval 7.37 to 8.16) for women and 24.35 (23.57 to 25.16) for men. Higher blood pressure indices, smoking intensity, body mass index, and the presence of diabetes were associated with an increased risk of MI in men and women, but associations were attenuated with age. In women, systolic blood pressure and hypertension, smoking status and intensity, and diabetes were associated with higher hazard ratios for MI compared with men: ratio of hazard ratios 1.09 (95% confidence interval 1.02 to 1.16) for systolic blood pressure, 1.55 (1.32 to 1.83) for current smoking, 2.91 (1.56 to 5.45) for type 1 diabetes, and 1.47 (1.16 to 1.87) for type 2 diabetes. There was no evidence that any of these ratios of hazard ratios decreased with age (P>0.2). With the exception of type 1 diabetes, the incidence of MI was higher in men than in women for all risk factors. CONCLUSIONS: Although the incidence of MI was higher in men than in women, several risk factors were more strongly associated with MI in women compared with men. Sex specific associations between risk factors and MI declined with age, but, where it occurred, the higher relative risk in women remained. As the population ages and the prevalence of lifestyle associated risk factors increase, the incidence of MI in women will likely become more similar to that in men. ",
        "Supermarket policies on less-healthy food at checkouts: Natural experimental evaluation using interrupted time series analyses of purchases. BACKGROUND: In response to public concerns and campaigns, some United Kingdom supermarkets have implemented policies to reduce less-healthy food at checkouts. We explored the effects of these policies on purchases of less-healthy foods commonly displayed at checkouts. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We used a natural experimental design and two data sources providing complementary and unique information. We analysed data on purchases of small packages of common, less-healthy, checkout foods (sugary confectionary, chocolate, and potato crisps) from 2013 to 2017 from nine UK supermarkets (Aldi, Asda, Co-op, Lidl, M&S, Morrisons, Sainsbury's, Tesco, and Waitrose). Six supermarkets implemented a checkout food policy between 2013 and 2017 and were considered intervention stores; the remainder were comparators. Firstly, we studied the longitudinal association between implementation of checkout policies and purchases taken home. We used data from a large (n \u2248 30,000) household purchase panel of food brought home to conduct controlled interrupted time series analyses of purchases of less-healthy common checkout foods from 12 months before to 12 months after implementation. We conducted separate analyses for each intervention supermarket, using others as comparators. We synthesised results across supermarkets using random effects meta-analyses. Implementation of a checkout food policy was associated with an immediate reduction in four-weekly purchases of common checkout foods of 157,000 (72,700-242,800) packages per percentage market share-equivalent to a 17.3% reduction. This decrease was sustained at 1 year with 185,100 (121,700-248,500) fewer packages purchased per 4 weeks per percentage market share-equivalent to a 15.5% reduction. The immediate, but not sustained, effect was robust to sensitivity analysis. Secondly, we studied the cross-sectional association between checkout food policies and purchases eaten without being taken home. We used data from a smaller (n \u2248 7,500) individual purchase panel of food bought and eaten 'on the go'. We conducted cross-sectional analyses comparing purchases of common checkout foods in 2016-2017 from supermarkets with and without checkout food policies. There were 76.4% (95% confidence interval 48.6%-89.1%) fewer annual purchases of less-healthy common checkout foods from supermarkets with versus without checkout food policies. The main limitations of the study are that we do not know where in the store purchases were selected and cannot determine the effect of changes in purchases on consumption. Other interventions may also have been responsible for the results seen. CONCLUSIONS: There is a potential impact of checkout food polices on purchases. Voluntary supermarket-led activities may have public health benefits. ",
        "A CRISPR-Cas9 gene drive targeting doublesex causes complete population suppression in caged Anopheles gambiae mosquitoes. In the human malaria vector Anopheles gambiae, the gene doublesex (Agdsx) encodes two alternatively spliced transcripts, dsx-female (AgdsxF) and dsx-male (AgdsxM), that control differentiation of the two sexes. The female transcript, unlike the male, contains an exon (exon 5) whose sequence is highly conserved in all Anopheles mosquitoes so far analyzed. We found that CRISPR-Cas9-targeted disruption of the intron 4-exon 5 boundary aimed at blocking the formation of functional AgdsxF did not affect male development or fertility, whereas females homozygous for the disrupted allele showed an intersex phenotype and complete sterility. A CRISPR-Cas9 gene drive construct targeting this same sequence spread rapidly in caged mosquitoes, reaching 100% prevalence within 7-11 generations while progressively reducing egg production to the point of total population collapse. Owing to functional constraint of the target sequence, no selection of alleles resistant to the gene drive occurred in these laboratory experiments. Cas9-resistant variants arose in each generation at the target site but did not block the spread of the drive. ",
        "Stroking modulates noxious-evoked brain activity in human infants. A subclass of C fibre sensory neurons found in hairy skin are activated by gentle touch [1] and respond optimally to stroking at \u223c1-10 cm/s, serving a protective function by promoting affiliative behaviours. In adult humans, stimulation of these C-tactile (CT) afferents is pleasant, and can reduce pain perception [2]. Touch-based techniques, such as infant massage and kangaroo care, are designed to comfort infants during procedures, and a modest reduction in pain-related behavioural and physiological responses has been observed in some studies [3]. Here, we investigated whether touch can reduce noxious-evoked brain activity. We demonstrate that stroking (at 3 cm/s) prior to an experimental noxious stimulus or clinical heel lance can attenuate noxious-evoked brain activity in infants. CT fibres may represent a biological target for non-pharmacological interventions that modulate pain in early life. ",
        "Use of hormone replacement therapy and risk of venous thromboembolism: nested case-control studies using the QResearch and CPRD databases. OBJECTIVE: To assess the association between risk of venous thromboembolism and use of different types of hormone replacement therapy. DESIGN: Two nested case-control studies. SETTING: UK general practices contributing to the QResearch or Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) databases, and linked to hospital, mortality, and social deprivation data. PARTICIPANTS: 80\u2009396 women aged 40-79 with a primary diagnosis of venous thromboembolism between 1998 and 2017, matched by age, general practice, and index date to 391\u2009494 female controls. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Venous thromboembolism recorded on general practice, mortality, or hospital records. Odds ratios were adjusted for demographics, smoking status, alcohol consumption, comorbidities, recent medical events, and other prescribed drugs. RESULTS: Overall, 5795 (7.2%) women who had venous thromboembolism and 21\u2009670 (5.5%) controls had been exposed to hormone replacement therapy within 90 days before the index date. Of these two groups, 4915 (85%)and 16\u2009938 (78%) women used oral therapy, respectively, which was associated with a significantly increased risk of venous thromboembolism compared with no exposure (adjusted odds ratio 1.58, 95% confidence interval 1.52 to 1.64), for both oestrogen only preparations (1.40, 1.32 to 1.48) and combined preparations (1.73, 1.65 to 1.81). Estradiol had a lower risk than conjugated equine oestrogen for oestrogen only preparations (0.85, 0.76 to 0.95) and combined preparations (0.83, 0.76 to 0.91). Compared with no exposure, conjugated equine oestrogen with medroxyprogesterone acetate had the highest risk (2.10, 1.92 to 2.31), and estradiol with dydrogesterone had the lowest risk (1.18, 0.98 to 1.42). Transdermal preparations were not associated with risk of venous thromboembolism, which was consistent for different regimens (overall adjusted odds ratio 0.93, 95% confidence interval 0.87 to 1.01). CONCLUSIONS: In the present study, transdermal treatment was the safest type of hormone replacement therapy when risk of venous thromboembolism was assessed. Transdermal treatment appears to be underused, with the overwhelming preference still for oral preparations. ",
        "A Randomized Trial of E-Cigarettes versus Nicotine-Replacement Therapy. BACKGROUND: E-cigarettes are commonly used in attempts to stop smoking, but evidence is limited regarding their effectiveness as compared with that of nicotine products approved as smoking-cessation treatments. METHODS: We randomly assigned adults attending U.K. National Health Service stop-smoking services to either nicotine-replacement products of their choice, including product combinations, provided for up to 3 months, or an e-cigarette starter pack (a second-generation refillable e-cigarette with one bottle of nicotine e-liquid [18 mg per milliliter]), with a recommendation to purchase further e-liquids of the flavor and strength of their choice. Treatment included weekly behavioral support for at least 4 weeks. The primary outcome was sustained abstinence for 1 year, which was validated biochemically at the final visit. Participants who were lost to follow-up or did not provide biochemical validation were considered to not be abstinent. Secondary outcomes included participant-reported treatment usage and respiratory symptoms. RESULTS: A total of 886 participants underwent randomization. The 1-year abstinence rate was 18.0% in the e-cigarette group, as compared with 9.9% in the nicotine-replacement group (relative risk, 1.83; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.30 to 2.58; P<0.001). Among participants with 1-year abstinence, those in the e-cigarette group were more likely than those in the nicotine-replacement group to use their assigned product at 52 weeks (80% [63 of 79 participants] vs. 9% [4 of 44 participants]). Overall, throat or mouth irritation was reported more frequently in the e-cigarette group (65.3%, vs. 51.2% in the nicotine-replacement group) and nausea more frequently in the nicotine-replacement group (37.9%, vs. 31.3% in the e-cigarette group). The e-cigarette group reported greater declines in the incidence of cough and phlegm production from baseline to 52 weeks than did the nicotine-replacement group (relative risk for cough, 0.8; 95% CI, 0.6 to 0.9; relative risk for phlegm, 0.7; 95% CI, 0.6 to 0.9). There were no significant between-group differences in the incidence of wheezing or shortness of breath. CONCLUSIONS: E-cigarettes were more effective for smoking cessation than nicotine-replacement therapy, when both products were accompanied by behavioral support.

        "Ingestible hydrogel device. Devices that interact with living organisms are typically made of metals, silicon, ceramics, and plastics. Implantation of such devices for long-term monitoring or treatment generally requires invasive procedures. Hydrogels offer new opportunities for human-machine interactions due to their superior mechanical compliance and biocompatibility. Additionally, oral administration, coupled with gastric residency, serves as a non-invasive alternative to implantation. Achieving gastric residency with hydrogels requires the hydrogels to swell very rapidly and to withstand gastric mechanical forces over time. However, high swelling ratio, high swelling speed, and long-term robustness do not coexist in existing hydrogels. Here, we introduce a hydrogel device that can be ingested as a standard-sized pill, swell rapidly into a large soft sphere, and maintain robustness under repeated mechanical loads in the stomach for up to one month. Large animal tests support the exceptional performance of the ingestible hydrogel device for long-term gastric retention and physiological monitoring. ",
        "Small-Molecule Agonists of Ae. aegypti Neuropeptide Y Receptor Block Mosquito Biting. Female Aedes aegypti mosquitoes bite humans to obtain blood to develop their eggs. Remarkably, their strong attraction to humans is suppressed for days after the blood meal by an unknown mechanism. We investigated a role for neuropeptide Y (NPY)-related signaling in long-term behavioral suppression and discovered that drugs targeting human NPY receptors modulate mosquito host-seeking. In a screen of all 49 predicted Ae. aegypti peptide receptors, we identified NPY-like receptor 7 (NPYLR7) as the sole target of these drugs. To obtain small-molecule agonists selective for NPYLR7, we performed a high-throughput cell-based assay of 265,211 compounds and isolated six highly selective NPYLR7 agonists that inhibit mosquito attraction to humans. NPYLR7 CRISPR-Cas9 null mutants are defective in behavioral suppression and resistant to these drugs. Finally, we show that these drugs can inhibit biting and blood-feeding on a live host, suggesting a novel approach to control infectious disease transmission by controlling mosquito behavior.

        "How long does a hip replacement last? A systematic review and meta-analysis of case series and national registry reports with more than 15 years of follow-up. BACKGROUND: Total hip replacement is a common and highly effective operation. All hip replacements would eventually fail if in situ long enough and it is important that patients understand when this might happen. We aimed to answer the question: how long does a hip replacement last?. METHODS: We did a systematic review and meta-analysis with a search of MEDLINE and Embase from the start of records to Sept 12, 2017. We included articles reporting 15-year survival of primary, conventional total hip replacement constructs in patients with osteoarthritis. We extracted survival and implant data and used all-cause construct survival as the primary outcome. We also reviewed reports of national joint replacement registries, and extracted data for a separate analysis. In the meta-analyses, we weighted each series and calculated a pooled survival estimate for each source of data. This study was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42018085642). FINDINGS: We identified 140 eligible articles reporting 150 series, and included 44 of these series (13\u2008212 total hip placements). National joint replacement registries from Australia and Finland provided data for 92 series (215\u2008676 total hip replacements). The 25-year pooled survival of hip replacements from case series was 77\u00b76% (95% CI 76\u00b70-79\u00b72) and from joint replacement registries was 57\u00b79% (95% CI 57\u00b71-58\u00b77). INTERPRETATION: Assuming that estimates from national registries are less likely to be biased, patients and surgeons can expect a hip replacement to last 25 years in around 58% of patients.

        "Options for keeping the food system within environmental limits. The food system is a major driver of climate change, changes in land use, depletion of freshwater resources, and pollution of aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems through excessive nitrogen and phosphorus inputs. Here we show that between 2010 and 2050, as a result of expected changes in population and income levels, the environmental effects of the food system could increase by 50-90% in the absence of technological changes and dedicated mitigation measures, reaching levels that are beyond\u00a0the planetary boundaries that define a safe operating space for humanity. We analyse several options for reducing the environmental effects of the food system, including dietary changes towards healthier, more plant-based diets, improvements in technologies and management, and reductions in food loss and waste. We find that no single measure is enough to keep these effects within all planetary boundaries simultaneously, and that a synergistic combination of measures will be needed to sufficiently mitigate the projected increase in environmental pressures.

        "Is interval training the magic bullet for fat loss? A systematic review and meta-analysis comparing moderate-intensity continuous training with high-intensity interval training (HIIT). OBJECTIVES: To compare the effects of interval training and moderate-intensity continuous training (MOD) on body adiposity in humans, and to perform subgroup analyses that consider the type and duration of interval training in different groups. DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis. DATA SOURCES: English-language, Spanish-language and Portuguese-language searches of the electronic databases PubMed and Scopus were conducted from inception to 11 December 2017. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR SELECTING STUDIES: Studies that met the following criteria were included: (1) original articles, (2) human trials, (3) minimum exercise training duration of 4 weeks, and (4) directly or indirectly compared interval training with MOD as the primary or secondary aim. RESULTS: Of the 786 studies found, 41 and 36 were included in the qualitative analysis and meta-analysis, respectively. Within-group analyses showed significant reductions in total body fat percentage (%) (interval training: -1.50 [95% CI -2.14 to -0.86, p<0.00001] and MOD: -1.44 [95% CI -2.00 to -0.89, p<0.00001]) and in total absolute fat mass (kg) (interval training: -1.58 [95% CI -2.74 to -0.43, p=0.007] and MOD: -1.13 [95% CI -2.18 to -0.08, p=0.04]), with no significant differences between interval training and MOD for total body fat percentage reduction (-0.23 [95% CI -1.43 to 0.97], p=0.705). However, there was a significant difference between the groups in total absolute fat mass (kg) reduction (-2.28 [95% CI -4.00 to -0.56], p=0.0094). Subgroup analyses comparing sprint interval training (SIT) with MOD protocols favour SIT for loss of total absolute fat mass (kg) (-3.22 [95% CI -5.71 to -0.73], p=0.01). Supervised training, walking/running/jogging, age (<30 years), study quality and intervention duration (<12 weeks) favourably influence the decreases in total absolute fat mass (kg) observed from interval training programmes; however, no significant effect was found on total body fat percentage (%). No effect of sex or body mass index was observed on total absolute fat mass (kg) or total body fat percentage (%). CONCLUSION: Interval training and MOD both reduce body fat percentage (%). Interval training provided 28.5% greater reductions in total absolute fat mass (kg) than MOD. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: CRD42018089427. ",
        "The epidemiology of trauma and post-traumatic stress disorder in a representative cohort of young people in England and Wales. BACKGROUND: Despite the emphasis placed on childhood trauma in psychiatry, comparatively little is known about the epidemiology of trauma and trauma-related psychopathology in young people. We therefore aimed to evaluate the prevalence, clinical features, and risk factors associated with trauma exposure and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in young people. METHODS: We carried out a comprehensive epidemiological study based on participants from the Environmental Risk Longitudinal Twin Study, a population-representative birth-cohort of 2232 children born in England and Wales in 1994-95. At the follow-up home visit at age 18 years, participants were assessed with structured interviews for trauma exposure, PTSD, other psychopathology, risk events, functional impairment, and service use. Risk factors for PTSD were measured prospectively over four previous assessments between age 5 and 12 years. The key outcomes were the prevalence, clinical features, and risk factors associated with trauma exposure and PTSD. We also derived and tested the internal validity of a PTSD risk calculator. FINDINGS: We found that 642 (31\u00b71%) of 2064 participants reported trauma exposure and 160 (7\u00b78%) of 2063 experienced PTSD by age 18 years. Trauma-exposed participants had high rates of psychopathology (187 [29\u00b72%] of 641 for major depressive episode, 146 [22\u00b79%] of 638 for conduct disorder, and 102 [15\u00b79%] of 641 for alcohol dependence), risk events (160 [25\u00b70%] of 641 for self-harm, 53 [8\u00b73%] of 640 for suicide attempt, and 42 [6\u00b76%] of 640 for violent offence), and functional impairment. Participants with lifetime PTSD had even higher rates of psychopathology (87 [54\u00b77%] of 159 for major depressive episode, 43 [27\u00b70%] of 159 for conduct disorder, and 41 [25\u00b76%] of 160 for alcohol dependence), risk events (78 [48\u00b78%] of 160 for self-harm, 32 [20\u00b71%] of 159 for suicide attempt, and 19 [11\u00b79%] of 159 for violent offence), and functional impairment. However, only 33 (20\u00b76%) of 160 participants with PTSD received help from mental health professionals. The PTSD risk calculator had an internally validated area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0\u00b774, indicating adequate discrimination of trauma-exposed participants with and without PTSD, and internally validated calibration-in-the-large of -0\u00b710 and calibration slope of 0\u00b790, indicating adequate calibration. INTERPRETATION: Trauma exposure and PTSD are associated with complex psychiatric presentations, high risk, and significant impairment in young people. Improved screening, reduced barriers to care provision, and comprehensive clinical assessment are needed to ensure that trauma-exposed young people and those with PTSD receive appropriate treatment.

        "Use of postmenopausal hormone therapy and risk of Alzheimer's disease in Finland: nationwide case-control study. OBJECTIVES: To compare the use of hormone therapy between Finnish postmenopausal women with and without a diagnosis for Alzheimer's disease. DESIGN: Nationwide case-control study. SETTING: Finnish national population and drug register, between 1999 and 2013. PARTICIPANTS: All postmenopausal women (n=84\u2009739) in Finland who, between 1999 and 2013, received a diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease from a neurologist or geriatrician, and who were identified from a national drug register. Control women without a diagnosis (n=84\u2009739), matched by age and hospital district, were traced from the Finnish national population register. INTERVENTIONS: Data on hormone therapy use were obtained from the Finnish national drug reimbursement register. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for Alzheimer's disease, calculated with conditional logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: In 83 688 (98.8%) women, a diagnosis for Alzheimer's disease was made at the age of 60 years or older, and 47 239 (55.7%) women had been over 80 years of age at diagnosis. Use of systemic hormone therapy was associated with a 9-17% increased risk of Alzheimer's disease. The risk of the disease did not differ significantly between users of estradiol only (odds ratio 1.09, 95% confidence interval 1.05 to 1.14) and those of oestrogen-progestogen (1.17, 1.13 to 1.21). The risk increases in users of oestrogen-progestogen therapy were not related to different progestogens (norethisterone acetate, medroxyprogesterone acetate, or other progestogens); but in women younger than 60 at hormone therapy initiation, these risk increases were associated with hormone therapy exposure over 10 years. Furthermore, the age at initiation of systemic hormone therapy was not a decisive determinant for the increase in risk of Alzheimer's disease. The exclusive use of vaginal estradiol did not affect the risk of the disease (0.99, 0.96 to 1.01). CONCLUSIONS: Long term use of systemic hormone therapy might be accompanied with an overall increased risk of Alzheimer's disease, which is not related to the type of progestogen or the age at initiation of systemic hormone therapy. By contrast, use of vaginal estradiol shows no such risk. Even though the absolute risk increase for Alzheimer's disease is small, our data should be implemented into information for present and future users of hormone therapy. ",
        "Autologous grafting of cryopreserved prepubertal rhesus testis produces sperm and offspring. Testicular tissue cryopreservation is an experimental method to preserve the fertility of prepubertal patients before they initiate gonadotoxic therapies for cancer or other conditions. Here we provide the proof of principle that cryopreserved prepubertal testicular tissues can be autologously grafted under the back skin or scrotal skin of castrated pubertal rhesus macaques and matured to produce functional sperm. During the 8- to 12-month observation period, grafts grew and produced testosterone. Complete spermatogenesis was confirmed in all grafts at the time of recovery. Graft-derived sperm were competent to fertilize rhesus oocytes, leading to preimplantation embryo development, pregnancy, and the birth of a healthy female baby. Pending the demonstration that similar results are obtained in noncastrated recipients, testicular tissue grafting may be applied in the clinic. ",
        "Three-dimensional visualisation of the fetal heart using prenatal MRI with motion-corrected slice-volume registration: a prospective, single-centre cohort study. BACKGROUND: Two-dimensional (2D) ultrasound echocardiography is the primary technique used to diagnose congenital heart disease before birth. There is, however, a longstanding need for a reliable form of secondary imaging, particularly in cases when more detailed three-dimensional (3D) vascular imaging is required, or when ultrasound windows are of poor diagnostic quality. Fetal MRI, which is well established for other organ systems, is highly susceptible to fetal movement, particularly for 3D imaging. The objective of this study was to investigate the combination of prenatal MRI with novel, motion-corrected 3D image registration software, as an adjunct to fetal echocardiography in the diagnosis of congenital heart disease. METHODS: Pregnant women carrying a fetus with known or suspected congenital heart disease were recruited via a tertiary fetal cardiology unit. After initial validation experiments to assess the general reliability of the approach, MRI data were acquired in 85 consecutive fetuses, as overlapping stacks of 2D images. These images were then processed with a bespoke open-source reconstruction algorithm to produce a super-resolution 3D volume of the fetal thorax. These datasets were assessed with measurement comparison with paired 2D ultrasound, structured anatomical assessment of the 2D and 3D data, and contemporaneous, archived clinical fetal MRI reports, which were compared with postnatal findings after delivery. FINDINGS: Between Oct 8, 2015, and June 30, 2017, 101 patients were referred for MRI, of whom 85 were eligible and had fetal MRI. The mean gestational age at the time of MRI was 32 weeks (range 24-36). High-resolution (0\u00b750-0\u00b775 mm isotropic) 3D datasets of the fetal thorax were generated in all 85 cases. Vascular measurements showed good overall agreement with 2D echocardiography in 51 cases with paired data (intra-class correlation coefficient 0\u00b778, 95% CI 0\u00b768-0\u00b784), with fetal vascular structures more effectively visualised with 3D MRI than with uncorrected 2D MRI (657 [97%] of 680 anatomical areas identified vs 358 [53%] of 680 areas; p<0\u00b70001). When a structure of interest was visualised in both 2D and 3D data (n=358), observers gave a higher diagnostic quality score for 3D data in 321 (90%) of cases, with 37 (10%) scores tied with 2D data, and no lower scores than for 2D data (Wilcoxon signed rank test p<0\u00b70001). Additional anatomical features were described in ten cases, of which all were confirmed postnatally. INTERPRETATION: Standard fetal MRI with open-source image processing software is a reliable method of generating high-resolution 3D imaging of the fetal vasculature. The 3D volumes produced show good spatial agreement with ultrasound, and significantly improved visualisation and diagnostic quality compared with source 2D MRI data. This freely available combination requires minimal infrastructure, and provides safe, powerful, and highly complementary imaging of the fetal cardiovascular system.

        "Adult hippocampal neurogenesis is abundant in neurologically healthy subjects and drops sharply in patients with Alzheimer's disease. The hippocampus is one of the most affected areas in Alzheimer's disease (AD)1. Moreover, this structure hosts one of the most unique phenomena of the adult mammalian brain, namely, the addition of new neurons throughout life2. This process, called adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN), confers an unparalleled degree of plasticity to the entire hippocampal circuitry3,4. Nonetheless, direct evidence of AHN in humans has remained elusive. Thus, determining whether new neurons are continuously incorporated into the human dentate gyrus (DG) during physiological and pathological aging is a crucial question with outstanding therapeutic potential. By combining human brain samples obtained under tightly controlled conditions and state-of-the-art tissue processing methods, we identified thousands of immature neurons in the DG of neurologically healthy human subjects up to the ninth decade of life. These neurons exhibited variable degrees of maturation along differentiation stages of AHN. In sharp contrast, the number and maturation of these neurons progressively declined as AD advanced. These results demonstrate the persistence of AHN during both physiological and pathological aging in humans and provide evidence for impaired neurogenesis as a potentially relevant mechanism underlying memory deficits in AD that might be amenable to novel therapeutic strategies.

        "Health effects of dietary risks in 195 countries, 1990-2017: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2017. BACKGROUND: Suboptimal diet is an important preventable risk factor for non-communicable diseases (NCDs); however, its impact on the burden of NCDs has not been systematically evaluated. This study aimed to evaluate the consumption of major foods and nutrients across 195 countries and to quantify the impact of their suboptimal intake on NCD mortality and morbidity. METHODS: By use of a comparative risk assessment approach, we estimated the proportion of disease-specific burden attributable to each dietary risk factor (also referred to as population attributable fraction) among adults aged 25 years or older. The main inputs to this analysis included the intake of each dietary factor, the effect size of the dietary factor on disease endpoint, and the level of intake associated with the lowest risk of mortality. Then, by use of disease-specific population attributable fractions, mortality, and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), we calculated the number of deaths and DALYs attributable to diet for each disease outcome. FINDINGS: In 2017, 11 million (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 10-12) deaths and 255 million (234-274) DALYs were attributable to dietary risk factors. High intake of sodium (3 million [1-5] deaths and 70 million [34-118] DALYs), low intake of whole grains (3 million [2-4] deaths and 82 million [59-109] DALYs), and low intake of fruits (2 million [1-4] deaths and 65 million [41-92] DALYs) were the leading dietary risk factors for deaths and DALYs globally and in many countries. Dietary data were from mixed sources and were not available for all countries, increasing the statistical uncertainty of our estimates. INTERPRETATION: This study provides a comprehensive picture of the potential impact of suboptimal diet on NCD mortality and morbidity, highlighting the need for improving diet across nations. Our findings will inform implementation of evidence-based dietary interventions and provide a platform for evaluation of their impact on human health annually.

        "Application of SPF moisturisers is inferior to sunscreens in coverage of facial and eyelid regions. Many moisturisers contain sun protection factors (SPF) equivalent to those found in sunscreens. However, there is a lack of research into how SPF moisturiser application compares to sunscreens in terms of coverage achieved and protection afforded. Previously we demonstrated that users incompletely covered their eyelid regions during routine sunscreen application. Here, we aimed to determine if SPF moisturiser users also displayed these tendencies. A study population of 84 participants (22 males, 62 females, age 18-57) were exposed to UV radiation and photographed using a tripod mounted UV sensitive DSLR camera on two separate visits. At visit one, images were acquired before and after applying either SPF30 sunscreen or moisturiser, then at visit two the study was repeated with the other formulation. Images were processed for facial landmark identification followed by segmentation mapping of hue saturation values to identify areas of the face that were/were not covered. Analyses revealed that application of moisturiser was significantly worse than sunscreen in terms area of the whole face missed (11.1% missed with sunscreen compared to 16.6% for SPF moisturiser p<0.001 paired t-test). This difference was primarily due to decreased coverage of the eyelid regions (14.0% missed with sunscreen, 20.9% moisturiser, p<0.001). Analysis of a post-study questionnaire revealed participants to be unaware of their incomplete coverage. Secondary analyses revealed improved coverage in males (p = 0.05), and, with moisturiser only, in participants with darker skin tones (p = 0.02). Together these data indicate that, despite potential advantages in terms of increased frequency of application of moisturiser, the areas of the face that are at higher cancer risk are likely not being protected, and that participants are unaware that they are at risk. As such, alternative sun-protection strategies should be promoted. ",
        "Synthetic glycolate metabolism pathways stimulate crop growth and productivity in the field. Photorespiration is required in C3 plants to metabolize toxic glycolate formed when ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase-oxygenase oxygenates rather than carboxylates ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate. Depending on growing temperatures, photorespiration can reduce yields by 20 to 50% in C3 crops. Inspired by earlier work, we installed into tobacco chloroplasts synthetic glycolate metabolic pathways that are thought to be more efficient than the native pathway. Flux through the synthetic pathways was maximized by inhibiting glycolate export from the chloroplast. The synthetic pathways tested improved photosynthetic quantum yield by 20%. Numerous homozygous transgenic lines increased biomass productivity by >40% in replicated field trials. These results show that engineering alternative glycolate metabolic pathways into crop chloroplasts while inhibiting glycolate export into the native pathway can drive increases in C3 crop yield under agricultural field conditions.

        "Conventional and genetic evidence on alcohol and vascular disease aetiology: a prospective study of 500\u2008000 men and women in China. BACKGROUND: Moderate alcohol intake has been associated with reduced cardiovascular risk in many studies, in comparison with abstinence or with heavier drinking. Studies in east Asia can help determine whether these associations are causal, since two common genetic variants greatly affect alcohol drinking patterns. We used these two variants to assess the relationships between cardiovascular risk and genotype-predicted mean alcohol intake in men, contrasting the findings in men with those in women (few of whom drink). METHODS: The prospective China Kadoorie Biobank enrolled 512\u2008715 adults between June 25, 2004, and July 15, 2008, from ten areas of China, recording alcohol use and other characteristics. It followed them for about 10 years (until Jan 1, 2017), monitoring cardiovascular disease (including ischaemic stroke, intracerebral haemorrhage, and myocardial infarction) by linkage with morbidity and mortality registries and electronic hospital records. 161\u2008498 participants were genotyped for two variants that alter alcohol metabolism, ALDH2-rs671 and ADH1B-rs1229984. Adjusted Cox regression was used to obtain the relative risks associating disease incidence with self-reported drinking patterns (conventional epidemiology) or with genotype-predicted mean male alcohol intake (genetic epidemiology-ie, Mendelian randomisation), with stratification by study area to control for variation between areas in disease rates and in genotype-predicted intake. FINDINGS: 33% (69\u2008897/210\u2008205) of men reported drinking alcohol in most weeks, mainly as spirits, compared with only 2% (6245/302\u2008510) of women. Among men, conventional epidemiology showed that self-reported alcohol intake had U-shaped associations with the incidence of ischaemic stroke (n=14\u2008930), intracerebral haemorrhage (n=3496), and acute myocardial infarction (n=2958); men who reported drinking about 100 g of alcohol per week (one to two drinks per day) had lower risks of all three diseases than non-drinkers or heavier drinkers. In contrast, although genotype-predicted mean male alcohol intake varied widely (from 4 to 256 g per week-ie, near zero to about four drinks per day), it did not have any U-shaped associations with risk. For stroke, genotype-predicted mean alcohol intake had a continuously positive log-linear association with risk, which was stronger for intracerebral haemorrhage (relative risk [RR] per 280 g per week 1\u00b758, 95% CI 1\u00b736-1\u00b784, p<0\u00b70001) than for ischaemic stroke (1\u00b727, 1\u00b713-1\u00b743, p=0\u00b70001). For myocardial infarction, however, genotype-predicted mean alcohol intake was not significantly associated with risk (RR per 280 g per week 0\u00b796, 95% CI 0\u00b778-1\u00b718, p=0\u00b769). Usual alcohol intake in current drinkers and genotype-predicted alcohol intake in all men had similarly strong positive associations with systolic blood pressure (each p<0\u00b70001). Among women, few drank and the studied genotypes did not predict high mean alcohol intake and were not positively associated with blood pressure, stroke, or myocardial infarction. INTERPRETATION: Genetic epidemiology shows that the apparently protective effects of moderate alcohol intake against stroke are largely non-causal. Alcohol consumption uniformly increases blood pressure and stroke risk, and appears in this one study to have little net effect on the risk of myocardial infarction.

        "Sub-optimal cholesterol response to initiation of statins and future risk of cardiovascular disease. OBJECTIVE: To assess low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) response in patients after initiation of statins, and future risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). METHODS: Prospective cohort study of 165\u2009411 primary care patients, from the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink, who were free of CVD before statin initiation, and had at least one pre-treatment LDL-C within 12 months before, and one post-treatment LDL-C within 24 months after, statin initiation. Based on current national guidelines, <40% reduction in baseline LDL-C within 24 months was classified as a sub-optimal statin response. Cox proportional regression and competing-risks survival regression models were used to determine adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and sub-HRs for incident CVD outcomes for LDL-C response to statins. RESULTS: 84\u2009609 (51.2%) patients had a sub-optimal LDL-C response to initiated statin therapy within 24 months. During 1 077 299 person-years of follow-up (median follow-up 6.2 years), there were 22 798 CVD events (12\u2009142 in sub-optimal responders and 10\u2009656 in optimal responders). In sub-optimal responders, compared with optimal responders, the HR for incident CVD was 1.17 (95% CI 1.13 to 1.20) and 1.22 (95% CI 1.19 to 1.25) after adjusting for age and baseline untreated LDL-C. Considering competing risks resulted in lower but similar sub-HRs for both unadjusted (1.13, 95% CI 1.10 to 1.16) and adjusted (1.19, 95% CI 1.16 to 1.23) cumulative incidence function of CVD. CONCLUSIONS: Optimal lowering of LDL-C is not achieved within 2\u2009years in over half of patients in the general population initiated on statin therapy, and these patients will experience significantly increased risk of future CVD.

        "Screening for breech presentation using universal late-pregnancy ultrasonography: A prospective cohort study and cost effectiveness analysis. BACKGROUND: Despite the relative ease with which breech presentation can be identified through ultrasound screening, the assessment of foetal presentation at term is often based on clinical examination only. Due to limitations in this approach, many women present in labour with an undiagnosed breech presentation, with increased risk of foetal morbidity and mortality. This study sought to determine the cost effectiveness of universal ultrasound scanning for breech presentation near term (36 weeks of gestational age [wkGA]) in nulliparous women. METHODS AND FINDINGS: The Pregnancy Outcome Prediction (POP) study was a prospective cohort study between January 14, 2008 and July 31, 2012, including 3,879 nulliparous women who attended for a research screening ultrasound examination at 36 wkGA. Foetal presentation was assessed and compared for the groups with and without a clinically indicated ultrasound. Where breech presentation was detected, an external cephalic version (ECV) was routinely offered. If the ECV was unsuccessful or not performed, the women were offered either planned cesarean section at 39 weeks or attempted vaginal breech delivery. To compare the likelihood of different mode of deliveries and associated long-term health outcomes for universal ultrasound to current practice, a probabilistic economic simulation model was constructed. Parameter values were obtained from the POP study, and costs were mainly obtained from the English National Health Service (NHS). One hundred seventy-nine out of 3,879 women (4.6%) were diagnosed with breech presentation at 36 weeks. For most women (96), there had been no prior suspicion of noncephalic presentation. ECV was attempted for 84 (46.9%) women and was successful in 12 (success rate: 14.3%). Overall, 19 of the 179 women delivered vaginally (10.6%), 110 delivered by elective cesarean section (ELCS) (61.5%) and 50 delivered by emergency cesarean section (EMCS) (27.9%). There were no women with undiagnosed breech presentation in labour in the entire cohort. On average, 40 scans were needed per detection of a previously undiagnosed breech presentation. The economic analysis indicated that, compared to current practice, universal late-pregnancy ultrasound would identify around 14,826 otherwise undiagnosed breech presentations across England annually. It would also reduce EMCS and vaginal breech deliveries by 0.7 and 1.0 percentage points, respectively: around 4,196 and 6,061 deliveries across England annually. Universal ultrasound would also prevent 7.89 neonatal mortalities annually. The strategy would be cost effective if foetal presentation could be assessed for \u00a319.80 or less per woman. Limitations to this study included that foetal presentation was revealed to all women and that the health economic analysis may be altered by parity. CONCLUSIONS: According to our estimates, universal late pregnancy ultrasound in nulliparous women (1) would virtually eliminate undiagnosed breech presentation, (2) would be expected to reduce foetal mortality in breech presentation, and (3) would be cost effective if foetal presentation could be assessed for less than \u00a319.80 per woman.

        "Restoration of brain circulation and cellular functions hours post-mortem. The brains of humans and other mammals are highly vulnerable to interruptions in blood flow and decreases in oxygen levels. Here we describe the restoration and maintenance of microcirculation and molecular and cellular functions of the intact pig brain under ex vivo normothermic conditions up to four hours post-mortem. We have developed an extracorporeal pulsatile-perfusion system and a haemoglobin-based, acellular, non-coagulative, echogenic, and cytoprotective perfusate that promotes recovery from anoxia, reduces reperfusion injury, prevents oedema, and metabolically supports the energy requirements of the brain. With this system, we observed preservation of cytoarchitecture; attenuation of cell death; and restoration of vascular dilatory and glial inflammatory responses, spontaneous synaptic activity, and active cerebral metabolism in the absence of global electrocorticographic activity. These findings demonstrate that under appropriate conditions the isolated, intact large mammalian brain possesses an underappreciated capacity for restoration of microcirculation and molecular and cellular activity after a prolonged post-mortem interval.

        "Speech synthesis from neural decoding of spoken sentences. Technology that translates neural activity into speech would be transformative for people who are unable to communicate as a result of neurological impairments. Decoding speech from neural activity is challenging because speaking requires very precise and rapid multi-dimensional control of vocal tract articulators. Here we designed a neural decoder that explicitly leverages kinematic and sound representations encoded in human cortical activity to synthesize audible speech. Recurrent neural networks first decoded directly recorded cortical activity into representations of articulatory movement, and then transformed these representations into speech acoustics. In closed vocabulary tests, listeners could readily identify and transcribe speech synthesized from cortical activity. Intermediate articulatory dynamics enhanced performance even with limited data. Decoded articulatory representations were highly conserved across speakers, enabling a component of the decoder to be transferrable across participants. Furthermore, the decoder could synthesize speech when a participant silently mimed sentences. These findings advance the clinical viability of using speech neuroprosthetic technology to restore spoken communication. ",
        "Association of habitual glucosamine use with risk of cardiovascular disease: prospective study in UK Biobank. OBJECTIVE: To prospectively assess the association of habitual glucosamine use with risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) events. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: UK Biobank. PARTICIPANTS: 466\u2009039 participants without CVD at baseline who completed a questionnaire on supplement use, which included glucosamine. These participants were enrolled from 2006 to 2010 and were followed up to 2016. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Incident CVD events, including CVD death, coronary heart disease, and stroke. RESULTS: During a median follow-up of seven years, there were 10\u2009204 incident CVD events, 3060 CVD deaths, 5745 coronary heart disease events, and 3263 stroke events. After adjustment for age, sex, body mass index, race, lifestyle factors, dietary intakes, drug use, and other supplement use, glucosamine use was associated with a significantly lower risk of total CVD events (hazard ratio 0.85, 95% confidence interval 0.80 to 0.90), CVD death (0.78, 0.70 to 0.87), coronary heart disease (0.82, 0.76 to 0.88), and stroke (0.91, 0.83 to 1.00). CONCLUSION: Habitual use of glucosamine supplement to relieve osteoarthritis pain might also be related to lower risks of CVD events. ",
        "Simultaneous production of fresh water and electricity via multistage solar photovoltaic membrane distillation. The energy shortage and clean water scarcity are two key challenges for global sustainable development. Near half of the total global water withdrawals is consumed by power generation plants while water desalination consumes lots of electricity. Here, we demonstrate a photovoltaics-membrane distillation (PV-MD) device that can stably produce clean water (>1.64\u2009kg\u00b7m-2\u00b7h-1) from seawater while simultaneously having uncompromised electricity generation performance (>11%) under one Sun irradiation. Its high clean water production rate is realized by constructing multi stage membrane distillation (MSMD) device at the backside of the solar cell to recycle the latent heat of water vapor condensation in each distillation stage. This composite device can significantly reduce capital investment costs by sharing the same land and the same mounting system and thus represents a potential possibility to transform an electricity power plant from otherwise a water consumer to a fresh water producer.

        "Transgenic Metarhizium rapidly kills mosquitoes in a malaria-endemic region of Burkina Faso. Malaria control efforts require implementation of new technologies that manage insecticide resistance. Metarhizium pingshaense provides an effective, mosquito-specific delivery system for potent insect-selective toxins. A semifield trial in a MosquitoSphere (a contained, near-natural environment) in Soumousso, a region of Burkina Faso where malaria is endemic, confirmed that the expression of an insect-specific toxin (Hybrid) increased fungal lethality and the likelihood that insecticide-resistant mosquitoes would be eliminated from a site. Also, as Hybrid-expressing M. pingshaense is effective at very low spore doses, its efficacy lasted longer than that of the unmodified Metarhizium Deployment of transgenic Metarhizium against mosquitoes could (subject to appropriate registration) be rapid, with products that could synergistically integrate with existing chemical control strategies to avert insecticide resistance.

        "C-Type Natriuretic Peptide Analogue Therapy in Children with Achondroplasia. BACKGROUND: Achondroplasia is a genetic disorder that inhibits endochondral ossification, resulting in disproportionate short stature and clinically significant medical complications. Vosoritide is a biologic analogue of C-type natriuretic peptide, a potent stimulator of endochondral ossification. METHODS: In a multinational, phase 2, dose-finding study and extension study, we evaluated the safety and side-effect profile of vosoritide in children (5 to 14 years of age) with achondroplasia. A total of 35 children were enrolled in four sequential cohorts to receive vosoritide at a once-daily subcutaneous dose of 2.5 \u03bcg per kilogram of body weight (8 patients in cohort 1), 7.5 \u03bcg per kilogram (8 patients in cohort 2), 15.0 \u03bcg per kilogram (10 patients in cohort 3), or 30.0 \u03bcg per kilogram (9 patients in cohort 4). After 6 months, the dose in cohort 1 was increased to 7.5 \u03bcg per kilogram and then to 15.0 \u03bcg per kilogram, and in cohort 2, the dose was increased to 15.0 \u03bcg per kilogram; the patients in cohorts 3 and 4 continued to receive their initial doses. At the time of data cutoff, the 24-month dose-finding study had been completed, and 30 patients had been enrolled in an ongoing long-term extension study; the median duration of follow-up across both studies was 42 months. RESULTS: During the treatment periods in the dose-finding and extension studies, adverse events occurred in 35 of 35 patients (100%), and serious adverse events occurred in 4 of 35 patients (11%). Therapy was discontinued in 6 patients (in 1 because of an adverse event). During the first 6 months of treatment, a dose-dependent increase in the annualized growth velocity was observed with vosoritide up to a dose of 15.0 \u03bcg per kilogram, and a sustained increase in the annualized growth velocity was observed at doses of 15.0 and 30.0 \u03bcg per kilogram for up to 42 months. CONCLUSIONS: In children with achondroplasia, once-daily subcutaneous administration of vosoritide was associated with a side-effect profile that appeared generally mild. Treatment resulted in a sustained increase in the annualized growth velocity for up to 42 months.

        "The acceptability of addressing alcohol consumption as a modifiable risk factor for breast cancer: a mixed method study within breast screening services and symptomatic breast clinics. OBJECTIVES: Potentially modifiable risk factors account for approximately 23% of breast cancers, with obesity and alcohol being the two greatest. Breast screening and symptomatic clinical attendances provide opportunities ('teachable moments') to link health promotion and breast cancer-prevention advice within established clinical pathways. This study explored knowledge and attitudes towards alcohol as a risk factor for breast cancer, and potential challenges inherent in incorporating advice about alcohol health risks into breast clinics and screening appointments. DESIGN: A mixed-method study including a survey on risk factors for breast cancer and understanding of alcohol content. Survey results were explored in a series of five focus groups with women and eight semi-structured interviews with health professionals. SETTING: Women attending NHS Breast Screening Programme (NHSBSP) mammograms, symptomatic breast clinics and healthcare professionals in those settings. PARTICIPANTS: 205 women were recruited (102 NHSBSP attenders and 103 symptomatic breast clinic attenders) and 33 NHS Staff. RESULTS: Alcohol was identified as a breast cancer risk factor by 40/205 (19.5%) of attenders and 16/33 (48.5%) of staff. Overall 66.5% of attenders drank alcohol, and 56.6% could not estimate correctly the alcohol content of any of four commonly consumed alcoholic drinks. All women agreed that including a prevention-focussed intervention would not reduce the likelihood of their attendance at screening mammograms or breast clinics. Qualitative data highlighted concerns in both women and staff of how to talk about alcohol and risk factors for breast cancer in a non-stigmatising way, as well as ambivalence from specialist staff as to their role in health promotion. CONCLUSIONS: Levels of alcohol health literacy and numeracy were low. Adding prevention interventions to screening and/or\u2009symptomatic clinics appears acceptable to attendees, highlighting the potential for using these opportunities as 'teachable moments'. However, there are substantial cultural and systemic challenges to overcome if this is to be implemented successfully. ",
        "Association Between Reported Long Working Hours and History of Stroke in the CONSTANCES Cohort. Background and Purpose- Long working hours (LWHs) are a potential risk factor for stroke. The aim of this study was to investigate this association in a large general population cohort. Methods- We used the French population-based cohort, CONSTANCES (Cohorte des Consultants des Centres d'Examens de Sant\u00e9), to retrieve information on age, sex, smoking, and working hours from the baseline, self-administered questionnaire. Other cardiovascular risk factors and previous occurrence of stroke were taken from a parallel medical interview. We defined LWH as working time >10 hours daily for at least 50 days per year. Participants with primarily part-time jobs were excluded as were those with stroke before LWH exposure. We used logistic models to estimate the association between LWH and stroke, stratified by age, sex, and occupation. In additional modeling, we excluded subjects whose stroke occurred within 5 years of the first reported work exposure. Results- Among the 143\u2009592 participants in the analyses, there were 1224 (0.9%) strokes, 42\u2009542 (29.6%) reported LWH, and 14\u2009481 (10.1%) reported LWH for 10 years or more. LWH was associated with an increased risk of stroke: adjusted odds ratio of 1.29 (95% CI, 1.11-1.49). Being exposed to LWH for 10 years or more was more strongly associated with stroke, adjusted odds ratio of 1.45 (95% CI, 1.21-1.74). The association showed no differences between men and women but was stronger in white-collar workers under 50 years of age. Conclusions- This large analysis reveals a significant association between stroke and exposure to LWH for 10 years or more. The findings are relevant for individual and global prevention. ",
        "The prevalence of wholly attributable alcohol conditions in the United Kingdom hospital system: a systematic review, meta-analysis and meta-regression. BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The prevalence of alcohol-related conditions is often reported as higher in hospital in-patients compared with the general population. However, formal prevalence estimates are commonly derived from small studies which report highly varied results. This systematic review and meta-analysis, within the UK hospital system, aimed to estimate the pooled prevalence of the 26 ICD-10 conditions that are wholly attributable to alcohol in in-patient settings. METHODS: We searched Medline, Embase, PsychINFO and CENTRAL from database inception until 1\u00a0May 2018. We included studies of any design that reported the prevalence of one of 26 wholly attributable alcohol conditions defined by the ICD-10. Studies were required to be conducted in one or more of the constituent nations of the United Kingdom and in an in-patient setting (general wards, intensive care units, accident and emergency departments or mental health in-patient units). Estimates were pooled using random-effects meta-analysis, and meta-regression tested study and patient factors contributing to variation. Quality was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment Development and Evaluation (GRADE) framework. RESULTS: A total of 124 studies were included, reporting on a total of 1\u2009657\u2009614 patients. The majority of studies reported on harmful use of alcohol and alcohol dependence, for which the pooled prevalence was 19.76% [95% confidence interval (CI)\u00a0=\u00a015.61-24.26%] and 10.25% (95% CI\u00a0=\u00a07.06-13.96%), respectively. Mean patient age and type of in-patient setting were identified as the main sources of variation in prevalence estimates, but not date of data collection. Both estimates were deemed very low quality according to GRADE. CONCLUSIONS: An estimated one in five patients in the UK hospital system use alcohol harmfully, and one in 10 are alcohol-dependent. ",
        "Effects of microbiota-directed foods in gnotobiotic animals and undernourished children. To examine the contributions of impaired gut microbial community development to childhood undernutrition, we combined metabolomic and proteomic analyses of plasma samples with metagenomic analyses of fecal samples to characterize the biological state of Bangladeshi children with severe acute malnutrition (SAM) as they transitioned, after standard treatment, to moderate acute malnutrition (MAM) with persistent microbiota immaturity. Host and microbial effects of microbiota-directed complementary food (MDCF) prototypes targeting weaning-phase bacterial taxa underrepresented in SAM and MAM microbiota were characterized in gnotobiotic mice and gnotobiotic piglets colonized with age- and growth-discriminatory bacteria. A randomized, double-blind controlled feeding study identified a lead MDCF that changes the abundances of targeted bacteria and increases plasma biomarkers and mediators of growth, bone formation, neurodevelopment, and immune function in children with MAM.

        "Menstrual cup use, leakage, acceptability, safety, and availability: a systematic review and meta-analysis. BACKGROUND: Girls and women need effective, safe, and affordable menstrual products. Single-use products are regularly selected by agencies for resource-poor settings; the menstrual cup is a less known alternative. We reviewed international studies on menstrual cup leakage, acceptability, and safety and explored menstrual cup availability to inform programmes. METHODS: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched PubMed, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Popline, Cinahl, Global Health database, Emerald, Google Scholar, Science.gov, and WorldWideScience from database inception to May 14, 2019, for quantitative or qualitative studies published in English on experiences and leakage associated with menstrual cups, and adverse event reports. We also screened the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience database from the US Food and Drug Administration for events related to menstrual cups. To be eligible for inclusion, the material needed to have information on leakage, acceptability, or safety of menstrual cups. The main outcome of interest was menstrual blood leakage when using a menstrual cup. Safety outcomes of interest included serious adverse events; vaginal abrasions and effects on vaginal microflora; effects on the reproductive, digestive, or urinary tract; and safety in poor sanitary conditions. Findings were tabulated or combined by use of forest plots (random-effects meta-analysis). We also did preliminary estimates on costs and environmental savings potentially associated with cups. This systematic review is registered on PROSPERO, number CRD42016047845. FINDINGS: Of 436 records identified, 43 studies were eligible for analysis (3319 participants). Most studies reported on vaginal cups (27 [63%] vaginal cups, five [12%] cervical cups, and 11 [25%] mixed types of cups or unknown) and 15 were from low-income and middle-income countries. 22 studies were included in qualitative or quantitative syntheses, of which only three were of moderate-to-high quality. Four studies made a direct comparison between menstrual cups and usual products for the main outcome of leakage and reported leakage was similar or lower for menstrual cups than for disposable pads or tampons (n=293). In all qualitative studies, the adoption of the menstrual cup required a familiarisation phase over several menstrual cycles and peer support improved uptake (two studies in developing countries). In 13 studies, 73% (pooled estimate: n=1144; 95% CI 59-84, I2=96%) of participants wished to continue use of the menstrual cup at study completion. Use of the menstrual cup showed no adverse effects on the vaginal flora (four studies, 507 women). We identified five women who reported severe pain or vaginal wounds, six reports of allergies or rashes, nine of urinary tract complaints (three with hydronephrosis), and five of toxic shock syndrome after use of the menstrual cup. Dislodgement of an intrauterine device was reported in 13 women who used the menstrual cup (eight in case reports, and five in one study) between 1 week and 13 months of insertion of the intrauterine device. Professional assistance to aid removal of menstrual cup was reported among 47 cervical cup users and two vaginal cup users. We identified 199 brands of menstrual cup, and availability in 99 countries with prices ranging US$0\u00b772-46\u00b772 (median $23\u00b73, 145 brands). INTERPRETATION: Our review indicates that menstrual cups are a safe option for menstruation management and are being used internationally. Good quality studies in this field are needed. Further studies are needed on cost-effectiveness and environmental effect comparing different menstrual products.

        "Using remote sensing to detect whale strandings in remote areas: The case of sei whales mass mortality in Chilean Patagonia. We test the ability of Very High Resolution satellite (VHR) imagery to detect stranded whales using both manual and automated methods. We use the 2015 mass mortality event in the Gulf of Penas locality, central Patagonia, Chile, as an initial case study. This event was the largest known mass mortality of baleen whales, with at least 343 whales, mainly sei whales (Balaenoptera borealis), documented as stranding. However, even with such a large number of whales, due to the remote location of the gulf the strandings went unrecorded for several weeks. Aerial and boat surveys of the area were conducted two to four months after the mortality event. In this study we use 50cm resolution WorldView2 imagery to identify and count strandings from two archival images acquired just after the stranding event and two months before the aerial and ground surveys, and to test manual and automated methods of detecting stranded whales. Our findings show that whales are easily detected manually in the images but due to the heterogeneous colouration of decomposing whales, spectral indices are unsuitable for automatic detection. Our satellite counts suggest that, at the time the satellite images were taken, more whales were stranded than recorded in the aerial survey, possibly due to the non-comprehensive coverage of the aerial survey or movement of the carcases between survey acquisition. With even higher resolution imagery now available, satellite imagery may be a cost effective alternative to aerial surveys for future assessment of the extent of mass whale stranding events, especially in remote and inaccessible areas.

        "Genome-wide association study identifies eight risk loci and implicates metabo-psychiatric origins for anorexia nervosa. Characterized primarily by a low body-mass index, anorexia nervosa is a complex and serious illness1, affecting 0.9-4% of women and 0.3% of men2-4, with twin-based heritability estimates of 50-60%5. Mortality rates are higher than those in other psychiatric disorders6, and outcomes are unacceptably poor7. Here we combine data from the Anorexia Nervosa Genetics Initiative (ANGI)8,9 and the Eating Disorders Working Group of the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC-ED) and conduct a genome-wide association study of 16,992\u2009cases of anorexia nervosa and 55,525\u2009controls, identifying eight significant loci. The genetic architecture of anorexia nervosa mirrors its clinical presentation, showing significant genetic correlations with psychiatric disorders, physical activity, and metabolic (including glycemic), lipid and anthropometric traits, independent of the effects of common variants associated with body-mass index. These results further encourage a reconceptualization of anorexia nervosa as a metabo-psychiatric disorder. Elucidating the metabolic component is a critical direction for future research, and paying attention to both psychiatric and metabolic components may be key to improving outcomes. ",
        "Music versus midazolam during preoperative nerve block placements: a prospective randomized controlled study. BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Music medicine is a non-pharmacologic intervention that is virtually harm-free, relatively inexpensive and has been shown to significantly decrease preoperative anxiety. In this study we aim to compare the use of music to midazolam as a preoperative anxiolytic prior to the administration of an ultrasound-guided single-injection peripheral nerve block. METHODS: In this randomized controlled study we compared the anxiolytic effects of intravenous midazolam (1-2 mg) with noise-canceling headphone-delivered music medicine. All patients received a preoperative ultrasound-guided single-injection peripheral nerve block indicated for a primary regional anesthetic or postoperative analgesia. RESULTS: The change in the State Trait Anxiety Inventory-6 (STAI-6) anxiety scores from after to before the procedure were similar in both groups (music group -1.6 (SD 10.7); midazolam group -4.2 (SD 11); p=0.14; mean difference between groups -2.5 (95% CI -5.9 to 0.9), p=0.1). Patient satisfaction scores with their procedure experience were higher in the midazolam group (p=0.01); however, there were no differences in physician satisfaction scores of their procedure experience between groups (p=0.07). Both patient and physician perceptions on difficulties in communication were higher in the music group than in the midazolam group (p=0.005 and p=0.0007, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Music medicine may be offered as an alternative to midazolam administration prior to peripheral regional anesthesia. However, further studies are warranted to evaluate whether or not the type of music, as well as how it is delivered, offers advantages over midazolam that outweigh the increase in communication barriers.

        "Early imaging predictors of long-term outcomes in relapse-onset multiple sclerosis. The clinical course of relapse-onset multiple sclerosis is highly variable. Demographic factors, clinical features and global brain T2 lesion load have limited value in counselling individual patients. We investigated early MRI predictors of key long-term outcomes including secondary progressive multiple sclerosis, physical disability and cognitive performance, 15 years after a clinically isolated syndrome. A cohort of patients with clinically isolated syndrome (n = 178) was prospectively recruited within 3 months of clinical disease onset and studied with MRI scans of the brain and spinal cord at study entry (baseline) and after 1 and 3 years. MRI measures at each time point included: supratentorial, infratentorial, spinal cord and gadolinium-enhancing lesion number, brain and spinal cord volumetric measures. The patients were followed-up clinically after \u223c15 years to determine disease course, and disability was assessed using the Expanded Disability Status Scale, Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test and Symbol Digit Modalities Test. Multivariable logistic regression and multivariable linear regression models identified independent MRI predictors of secondary progressive multiple sclerosis and Expanded Disability Status Scale, Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test and Symbol Digit Modalities Test, respectively. After 15 years, 166 (93%) patients were assessed clinically: 119 (72%) had multiple sclerosis [94 (57%) relapsing-remitting, 25 (15%) secondary progressive], 45 (27%) remained clinically isolated syndrome and two (1%) developed other disorders. Physical disability was overall low in the multiple sclerosis patients (median Expanded Disability Status Scale 2, range 0-10); 71% were untreated. Baseline gadolinium-enhancing (odds ratio 3.16, P < 0.01) and spinal cord lesions (odds ratio 4.71, P < 0.01) were independently associated with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis at 15 years. When considering 1- and 3-year MRI variables, baseline gadolinium-enhancing lesions remained significant and new spinal cord lesions over time were associated with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis. Baseline gadolinium-enhancing (\u03b2 = 1.32, P < 0.01) and spinal cord lesions (\u03b2 = 1.53, P < 0.01) showed a consistent association with Expanded Disability Status Scale at 15 years. Baseline gadolinium-enhancing lesions was also associated with performance on the Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test (\u03b2 = - 0.79, P < 0.01) and Symbol Digit Modalities Test (\u03b2 = -0.70, P = 0.02) at 15 years. Our findings suggest that early focal inflammatory disease activity and spinal cord lesions are predictors of very long-term disease outcomes in relapse-onset multiple sclerosis. Established MRI measures, available in routine clinical practice, may be useful in counselling patients with early multiple sclerosis about long-term prognosis, and personalizing treatment plans. ",
        "Effects of transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation in individuals aged 55 years or above: potential benefits of daily stimulation. Ageing is associated with attenuated autonomic function. Transcutaneous vagal nerve stimulation (tVNS) improved autonomic function in healthy young participants. We therefore investigated the effects of a single session of tVNS (studies 1 and 2) and tVNS administered daily for two weeks (study 3) in volunteers aged \u2265 55 years. tVNS was performed using modified surface electrodes on the tragus and connected to a transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) machine. Study 1: participants (n=14) received a single session of tVNS and sham. Study 2: all participants (n=51) underwent a single session of tVNS. Study 3: participants (n=29) received daily tVNS for two weeks. Heart rate variability and baroreflex sensitivity were derived. Quality of life (QoL), mood and sleep were assessed in study 3. tVNS promoted increases in measures of vagal tone and was associated with greater increases in baroreflex sensitivity than sham. Two weeks of daily tVNS improved measures of autonomic function, and some aspects of QoL, mood and sleep. Importantly, findings showed that improvements in measures of autonomic balance were more pronounced in participants with greater baseline sympathetic prevalence. This suggests it may be possible to identify individuals who are likely to encounter significant benefits from tVNS. ",
        "High-precision plasma \u03b2-amyloid 42/40 predicts current and future brain amyloidosis. OBJECTIVE: We examined whether plasma \u03b2-amyloid (A\u03b2)42/A\u03b240, as measured by a high-precision assay, accurately diagnosed brain amyloidosis using amyloid PET or CSF p-tau181/A\u03b242 as reference standards. METHODS: Using an immunoprecipitation and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry assay, we measured A\u03b242/A\u03b240 in plasma and CSF samples from 158 mostly cognitively normal individuals that were collected within 18 months of an amyloid PET scan. RESULTS: Plasma A\u03b242/A\u03b240 had a high correspondence with amyloid PET status (receiver operating characteristic area under the curve [AUC] 0.88, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.82-0.93) and CSF p-tau181/A\u03b242 (AUC 0.85, 95% CI 0.79-0.92). The combination of plasma A\u03b242/A\u03b240, age, and APOE \u03b54 status had a very high correspondence with amyloid PET (AUC 0.94, 95% CI 0.90-0.97). Individuals with a negative amyloid PET scan at baseline and a positive plasma A\u03b242/A\u03b240 (<0.1218) had a 15-fold greater risk of conversion to amyloid PET-positive compared to individuals with a negative plasma A\u03b242/A\u03b240 (p = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Plasma A\u03b242/A\u03b240, especially when combined with age and APOE \u03b54 status, accurately diagnoses brain amyloidosis and can be used to screen cognitively normal individuals for brain amyloidosis. Individuals with a negative amyloid PET scan and positive plasma A\u03b242/A\u03b240 are at increased risk for converting to amyloid PET-positive. Plasma A\u03b242/A\u03b240 could be used in prevention trials to screen for individuals likely to be amyloid PET-positive and at risk for Alzheimer disease dementia. CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE: This study provides Class II evidence that plasma A\u03b242/A\u03b240 levels accurately determine amyloid PET status in cognitively normal research participants. ",
        "Associations between blood pressure across adulthood and late-life brain structure and pathology in the neuroscience substudy of the 1946 British birth cohort (Insight 46): an epidemiological study. BACKGROUND: Midlife hypertension confers increased risk for cognitive impairment in late life. The sensitive period for risk exposure and extent that risk is mediated through amyloid or vascular-related mechanisms are poorly understood. We aimed to identify if, and when, blood pressure or change in blood pressure during adulthood were associated with late-life brain structure, pathology, and cognition. METHODS: Participants were from Insight 46, a neuroscience substudy of the ongoing longitudinal Medical Research Council National Survey of Health and Development, a birth cohort that initially comprised 5362 individuals born throughout mainland Britain in one week in 1946. Participants aged 69-71 years received T1 and FLAIR volumetric MRI, florbetapir amyloid-PET imaging, and cognitive assessment at University College London (London, UK); all participants were dementia-free. Blood pressure measurements had been collected at ages 36, 43, 53, 60-64, and 69 years. We also calculated blood pressure change variables between ages. Primary outcome measures were white matter hyperintensity volume (WMHV) quantified from multimodal MRI using an automated method, amyloid-\u03b2 positivity or negativity using a standardised uptake value ratio approach, whole-brain and hippocampal volumes quantified from 3D-T1 MRI, and a composite cognitive score-the Preclinical Alzheimer Cognitive Composite (PACC). We investigated associations between blood pressure and blood pressure changes at and between 36, 43, 53, 60-64, and 69 years of age with WMHV using generalised linear models with a gamma distribution and log link function, amyloid-\u03b2 status using logistic regression, whole-brain volume and hippocampal volumes using linear regression, and PACC score using linear regression, with adjustment for potential confounders. FINDINGS: Between May 28, 2015, and Jan 10, 2018, 502 individuals were assessed as part of Insight 46. 465 participants (238 [51%] men; mean age 70\u00b77 years [SD 0\u00b77]; 83 [18%] amyloid-\u03b2-positive) were included in imaging analyses. Higher systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) at age 53 years and greater increases in SBP and DBP between 43 and 53 years were positively associated with WMHV at 69-71 years of age (increase in mean WMHV per 10 mm Hg greater SBP 7%, 95% CI 1-14, p=0\u00b7024; increase in mean WMHV per 10 mm Hg greater DBP 15%, 4-27, p=0\u00b70057; increase in mean WMHV per one SD change in SBP 15%, 3-29, p=0\u00b7012; increase in mean WMHV per 1 SD change in DBP 15%, 3-30, p=0\u00b7017). Higher DBP at 43 years of age was associated with smaller whole-brain volume at 69-71 years of age (-6\u00b79 mL per 10 mm Hg greater DBP, -11\u00b79 to -1\u00b79, p=0\u00b70068), as were greater increases in DBP between 36 and 43 years of age (-6\u00b75 mL per 1 SD change, -11\u00b71 to -1\u00b79, p=0\u00b70054). Greater increases in SBP between 36 and 43 years of age were associated with smaller hippocampal volumes at 69-71 years of age (-0\u00b703 mL per 1 SD change, -0\u00b706 to -0\u00b7001, p=0\u00b7043). Neither absolute blood pressure nor change in blood pressure predicted amyloid-\u03b2 status or PACC score at 69-71 years of age. INTERPRETATION: High and increasing blood pressure from early adulthood into midlife seems to be associated with increased WMHV and smaller brain volumes at 69-71 years of age. We found no evidence that blood pressure affected cognition or cerebral amyloid-\u03b2 load at this age. Blood pressure monitoring and interventions might need to start around 40 years of age to maximise late-life brain health.

        "Omega-3, omega-6, and total dietary polyunsaturated fat for prevention and treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials. OBJECTIVE: To assess effects of increasing omega-3, omega-6, and total polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) on diabetes diagnosis and glucose metabolism. DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analyses. DATA SOURCES: Medline, Embase, Cochrane CENTRAL, WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, Clinicaltrials.gov, and trials in relevant systematic reviews. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials of at least 24 weeks' duration assessing effects of increasing \u03b1-linolenic acid, long chain omega-3, omega-6, or total PUFA, which collected data on diabetes diagnoses, fasting glucose or insulin, glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c), and/or homoeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR). DATA SYNTHESIS: Statistical analysis included random effects meta-analyses using relative risk and mean difference, and sensitivity analyses. Funnel plots were examined and subgrouping assessed effects of intervention type, replacement, baseline risk of diabetes and use of antidiabetes drugs, trial duration, and dose. Risk of bias was assessed with the Cochrane tool and quality of evidence with GRADE. RESULTS: 83 randomised controlled trials (mainly assessing effects of supplementary long chain omega-3) were included; 10 were at low summary risk of bias. Long chain omega-3 had little or no effect on likelihood of diagnosis of diabetes (relative risk 1.00, 95% confidence interval 0.85 to 1.17; 58\u2009643 participants, 3.7% developed diabetes) or measures of glucose metabolism (HbA1c mean difference -0.02%, 95% confidence interval -0.07% to 0.04%; plasma glucose 0.04, 0.02 to 0.07, mmol/L; fasting insulin 1.02, -4.34 to 6.37, pmol/L; HOMA-IR 0.06, -0.21 to 0.33). A suggestion of negative outcomes was observed when dose of supplemental long chain omega-3 was above 4.4 g/d. Effects of \u03b1-linolenic acid, omega-6, and total PUFA on diagnosis of diabetes were unclear (as the evidence was of very low quality), but little or no effect on measures of glucose metabolism was seen, except that increasing \u03b1-linolenic acid may increase fasting insulin (by about 7%). No evidence was found that the omega-3/omega-6 ratio is important for diabetes or glucose metabolism. CONCLUSIONS: This is the most extensive systematic review of trials to date to assess effects of polyunsaturated fats on newly diagnosed diabetes and glucose metabolism, including previously unpublished data following contact with authors. Evidence suggests that increasing omega-3, omega-6, or total PUFA has little or no effect on prevention and treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus.

        "Postreproductive killer whale grandmothers improve the survival of their grandoffspring. Understanding why females of some mammalian species cease ovulation prior to the end of life is a long-standing interdisciplinary and evolutionary challenge. In humans and some species of toothed whales, females can live for decades after stopping reproduction. This unusual life history trait is thought to have evolved, in part, due to the inclusive fitness benefits that postreproductive females gain by helping kin. In humans, grandmothers gain inclusive fitness benefits by increasing their number of surviving grandoffspring, referred to as the grandmother effect. Among toothed whales, the grandmother effect has not been rigorously tested. Here, we test for the grandmother effect in killer whales, by quantifying grandoffspring survival with living or recently deceased reproductive and postreproductive grandmothers, and show that postreproductive grandmothers provide significant survival benefits to their grandoffspring above that provided by reproductive grandmothers. This provides evidence of the grandmother effect in a nonhuman menopausal species. By stopping reproduction, grandmothers avoid reproductive conflict with their daughters, and offer increased benefits to their grandoffspring. The benefits postreproductive grandmothers provide to their grandoffspring are shown to be most important in difficult times where the salmon abundance is low to moderate. The postreproductive grandmother effect we report, together with the known costs of late-life reproduction in killer whales, can help explain the long postreproductive life spans of resident killer whales.

        "Oral health and performance impacts in elite and professional athletes. OBJECTIVES: To measure dental caries, erosive tooth wear (ETW), periodontal health, self-reported oral health problems and performance impacts in a representative sample of UK elite athletes from different sports using standardized conditions clearly defined clinical indices and a measure of impact on performance with evidence of validity in sport. METHODS: Cross-sectional study, with single, calibrated examiner, conducted in the local facilities of elite and professional UK athletes (UCL ethics number 6388/001). Main oral measures: dental caries (ICDAS), erosive tooth wear (BEWE), periodontal health (BPE) and athlete-reported performance impacts. RESULTS: We recruited 352 athletes from eleven sports. The mean age was 25\u00a0years (range 18-39), and 67.0% were male. We found caries (ICDAS code \u22653) in 49.1% of athletes, ETW (BEWE score of \u22657) in 41.4%, gingival bleeding on probing/presence of calculus (BPE score 1 or 2) in 77.0% and pocket probing depths of at least 4\u00a0mm (BPE score 3 or 4) in a further 21.6%. One in five athletes reported previous wisdom teeth problems. The odds of having caries were 2.4 times greater in team sport than endurance sport (95% CI 1.3-3.2). The odds of having erosion were 2.0 times greater in team sport than endurance sport (95% CI 1.3-3.1). Overall, 32.0% athletes reported an oral health-related impact on sport performance: oral pain (29.9%), difficulty participating in normal training and competition (9.0%), performance affected (5.8%) and reduction in training volume (3.8%). Other impacts were difficulty with eating (34.6%), relaxing (15.1%) and smiling (17.2%). Several oral health problems were associated with performance impacts. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first large representative sample study of oral health in athletes from different sports at elite level. Although experience of oral disease differs by sport, the prevalence, in UK elite and professional athletes, is substantial, with common self-reported performance impacts. Regular screening and use of effective oral health promotion strategies may minimize performance impacts from poor oral health. ",
        "Type and timing of menopausal hormone therapy and breast cancer risk: individual participant meta-analysis of the worldwide epidemiological evidence. BACKGROUND: Published findings on breast cancer risk associated with different types of menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) are inconsistent, with limited information on long-term effects. We bring together the epidemiological evidence, published and unpublished, on these associations, and review the relevant randomised evidence. METHODS: Principal analyses used individual participant data from all eligible prospective studies that had sought information on the type and timing of MHT use; the main analyses are of individuals with complete information on this. Studies were identified by searching many formal and informal sources regularly from Jan 1, 1992, to Jan 1, 2018. Current users were included up to 5 years (mean 1\u00b74 years) after last-reported MHT use. Logistic regression yielded adjusted risk ratios (RRs) comparing particular groups of MHT users versus never users. FINDINGS: During prospective follow-up, 108\u2008647 postmenopausal women developed breast cancer at mean age 65 years (SD 7); 55\u2008575 (51%) had used MHT. Among women with complete information, mean MHT duration was 10 years (SD 6) in current users and 7 years (SD 6) in past users, and mean age was 50 years (SD 5) at menopause and 50 years (SD 6) at starting MHT. Every MHT type, except vaginal oestrogens, was associated with excess breast cancer risks, which increased steadily with duration of use and were greater for oestrogen-progestagen than oestrogen-only preparations. Among current users, these excess risks were definite even during years 1-4 (oestrogen-progestagen RR 1\u00b760, 95% CI 1\u00b752-1\u00b769; oestrogen-only RR 1\u00b717, 1\u00b710-1\u00b726), and were twice as great during years 5-14 (oestrogen-progestagen RR 2\u00b708, 2\u00b702-2\u00b715; oestrogen-only RR 1\u00b733, 1\u00b728-1\u00b737). The oestrogen-progestagen risks during years 5-14 were greater with daily than with less frequent progestagen use (RR 2\u00b730, 2\u00b721-2\u00b740 vs 1\u00b793, 1\u00b784-2\u00b701; heterogeneity p<0\u00b70001). For a given preparation, the RRs during years 5-14 of current use were much greater for oestrogen-receptor-positive tumours than for oestrogen-receptor-negative tumours, were similar for women starting MHT at ages 40-44, 45-49, 50-54, and 55-59 years, and were attenuated by starting after age 60 years or by adiposity (with little risk from oestrogen-only MHT in women who were obese). After ceasing MHT, some excess risk persisted for more than 10 years; its magnitude depended on the duration of previous use, with little excess following less than 1 year of MHT use. INTERPRETATION: If these associations are largely causal, then for women of average weight in developed countries, 5 years of MHT, starting at age 50 years, would increase breast cancer incidence at ages 50-69 years by about one in every 50 users of oestrogen plus daily progestagen preparations; one in every 70 users of oestrogen plus intermittent progestagen preparations; and one in every 200 users of oestrogen-only preparations. The corresponding excesses from 10 years of MHT would be about twice as great. FUNDING: Cancer Research UK and the Medical Research Council. ",
        "Risks of ischaemic heart disease and stroke in meat eaters, fish eaters, and vegetarians over 18 years of follow-up: results from the prospective EPIC-Oxford study. OBJECTIVE: To examine the associations of vegetarianism with risks of ischaemic heart disease and stroke. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: The EPIC-Oxford study, a cohort in the United Kingdom with a large proportion of non-meat eaters, recruited across the country between 1993 and 2001. PARTICIPANTS: 48 188 participants with no history of ischaemic heart disease, stroke, or angina (or cardiovascular disease) were classified into three distinct diet groups: meat eaters (participants who consumed meat, regardless of whether they consumed fish, dairy, or eggs; n=24 428), fish eaters (consumed fish but no meat; n=7506), and vegetarians including vegans (n=16 254), based on dietary information collected at baseline, and subsequently around 2010 (n=28 364). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Incident cases of ischaemic heart disease and stroke (including ischaemic and haemorrhagic types) identified through record linkage until 2016. RESULTS: Over 18.1 years of follow-up, 2820 cases of ischaemic heart disease and 1072 cases of total stroke (519 ischaemic stroke and 300 haemorrhagic stroke) were recorded. After adjusting for sociodemographic and lifestyle confounders, fish eaters and vegetarians had 13% (hazard ratio 0.87, 95% confidence interval 0.77 to 0.99) and 22% (0.78, 0.70 to 0.87) lower rates of ischaemic heart disease than meat eaters, respectively (P<0.001 for heterogeneity). This difference was equivalent to 10 fewer cases of ischaemic heart disease (95% confidence interval 6.7 to 13.1 fewer) in vegetarians than in meat eaters per 1000 population over 10 years. The associations for ischaemic heart disease were partly attenuated after adjustment for self reported high blood cholesterol, high blood pressure, diabetes, and body mass index (hazard ratio 0.90, 95% confidence interval 0.81 to 1.00 in vegetarians with all adjustments). By contrast, vegetarians had 20% higher rates of total stroke (hazard ratio 1.20, 95% confidence interval 1.02 to 1.40) than meat eaters, equivalent to three more cases of total stroke (95% confidence interval 0.8 to 5.4 more) per 1000 population over 10 years, mostly due to a higher rate of haemorrhagic stroke. The associations for stroke did not attenuate after further adjustment of disease risk factors. CONCLUSIONS: In this prospective cohort in the UK, fish eaters and vegetarians had lower rates of ischaemic heart disease than meat eaters, although vegetarians had higher rates of haemorrhagic and total stroke.

        "Emergence of dominant toxigenic M1T1 Streptococcus pyogenes clone during increased scarlet fever activity in England: a population-based molecular epidemiological study. BACKGROUND: Since 2014, England has seen increased scarlet fever activity unprecedented in modern times. In 2016, England's scarlet fever seasonal rise coincided with an unexpected elevation in invasive Streptococcus pyogenes infections. We describe the molecular epidemiological investigation of these events. METHODS: We analysed changes in S pyogenes emm genotypes, and notifications of scarlet fever and invasive disease in 2014-16 using regional (northwest London) and national (England and Wales) data. Genomes of 135 non-invasive and 552 invasive emm1 isolates from 2009-16 were analysed and compared with 2800 global emm1 sequences. Transcript and protein expression of streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin A (SpeA; also known as scarlet fever or erythrogenic toxin A) in sequenced, non-invasive emm1 isolates was quantified by real-time PCR and western blot analyses. FINDINGS: Coincident with national increases in scarlet fever and invasive disease notifications, emm1 S pyogenes upper respiratory tract isolates increased significantly in northwest London in the March to May period, from five (5%) of 96 isolates in 2014, to 28 (19%) of 147 isolates in 2015 (p=0\u00b70021 vs 2014 values), to 47 (33%) of 144 in 2016 (p=0\u00b70080 vs 2015 values). Similarly, invasive emm1 isolates collected nationally in the same period increased from 183 (31%) of 587 in 2015 to 267 (42%) of 637 in 2016 (p<0\u00b70001). Sequences of emm1 isolates from 2009-16 showed emergence of a new emm1 lineage (designated M1UK)-with overlap of pharyngitis, scarlet fever, and invasive M1UK strains-which could be genotypically distinguished from pandemic emm1 isolates (M1global) by 27 single-nucleotide polymorphisms. Median SpeA protein concentration in supernatant was nine-times higher among M1UK isolates (190\u00b72 ng/mL [IQR 168\u00b79-200\u00b74]; n=10) than M1global isolates (20\u00b79 ng/mL [0\u00b70-27\u00b73]; n=10; p<0\u00b70001). M1UK expanded nationally to represent 252 (84%) of all 299 emm1 genomes in 2016. Phylogenetic analysis of published datasets identified single M1UK isolates in Denmark and the USA. INTERPRETATION: A dominant new emm1 S pyogenes lineage characterised by increased SpeA production has emerged during increased S pyogenes activity in England. The expanded reservoir of M1UK and recognised invasive potential of emm1 S pyogenes provide plausible explanation for the increased incidence of invasive disease, and rationale for global surveillance.

        "Trends in incidence of total or type 2 diabetes: systematic review. OBJECTIVE: To assess what proportions of studies reported increasing, stable, or declining trends in the incidence of diagnosed diabetes. DESIGN: Systematic review of studies reporting trends of diabetes incidence in adults from 1980 to 2017 according to PRISMA guidelines. DATA SOURCES: Medline, Embase, CINAHL, and reference lists of relevant publications. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Studies of open population based cohorts, diabetes registries, and administrative and health insurance databases on secular trends in the incidence of total diabetes or type 2 diabetes in adults were included. Poisson regression was used to model data by age group and year. RESULTS: Among the 22\u2009833 screened abstracts, 47 studies were included, providing data on 121 separate sex specific or ethnicity specific populations; 42 (89%) of the included studies reported on diagnosed diabetes. In 1960-89, 36% (8/22) of the populations studied had increasing trends in incidence of diabetes, 55% (12/22) had stable trends, and 9% (2/22) had decreasing trends. In 1990-2005, diabetes incidence increased in 66% (33/50) of populations, was stable in 32% (16/50), and decreased in 2% (1/50). In 2006-14, increasing trends were reported in only 33% (11/33) of populations, whereas 30% (10/33) and 36% (12/33) had stable or declining incidence, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of clinically diagnosed diabetes has continued to rise in only a minority of populations studied since 2006, with over a third of populations having a fall in incidence in this time period. Preventive strategies could have contributed to the fall in diabetes incidence in recent years. Data are limited in low and middle income countries, where trends in diabetes incidence could be different. SYSTEMATIC REVIEW REGISTRATION: Prospero CRD42018092287. ",
        "Progress in cancer survival, mortality, and incidence in seven high-income countries 1995-2014 (ICBP SURVMARK-2): a population-based study. BACKGROUND: Population-based cancer survival estimates provide valuable insights into the effectiveness of cancer services and can reflect the prospects of cure. As part of the second phase of the International Cancer Benchmarking Partnership (ICBP), the Cancer Survival in High-Income Countries (SURVMARK-2) project aims to provide a comprehensive overview of cancer survival across seven high-income countries and a comparative assessment of corresponding incidence and mortality trends. METHODS: In this longitudinal, population-based study, we collected patient-level data on 3\u00b79 million patients with cancer from population-based cancer registries in 21 jurisdictions in seven countries (Australia, Canada, Denmark, Ireland, New Zealand, Norway, and the UK) for seven sites of cancer (oesophagus, stomach, colon, rectum, pancreas, lung, and ovary) diagnosed between 1995 and 2014, and followed up until Dec 31, 2015. We calculated age-standardised net survival at 1 year and 5 years after diagnosis by site, age group, and period of diagnosis. We mapped changes in incidence and mortality to changes in survival to assess progress in cancer control. FINDINGS: In 19 eligible jurisdictions, 3\u2008764\u2008543 cases of cancer were eligible for inclusion in the study. In the 19 included jurisdictions, over 1995-2014, 1-year and 5-year net survival increased in each country across almost all cancer types, with, for example, 5-year rectal cancer survival increasing more than 13 percentage points in Denmark, Ireland, and the UK. For 2010-14, survival was generally higher in Australia, Canada, and Norway than in New Zealand, Denmark, Ireland, and the UK. Over the study period, larger survival improvements were observed for patients younger than 75 years at diagnosis than those aged 75 years and older, and notably for cancers with a poor prognosis (ie, oesophagus, stomach, pancreas, and lung). Progress in cancer control (ie, increased survival, decreased mortality and incidence) over the study period was evident for stomach, colon, lung (in males), and ovarian cancer. INTERPRETATION: The joint evaluation of trends in incidence, mortality, and survival indicated progress in four of the seven studied cancers. Cancer survival continues to increase across high-income countries; however, international disparities persist. While truly valid comparisons require differences in registration practice, classification, and coding to be minimal, stage of disease at diagnosis, timely access to effective treatment, and the extent of comorbidity are likely the main determinants of patient outcomes. Future studies are needed to assess the impact of these factors to further our understanding of international disparities in cancer survival.

        "Laparoscopic supracervical hysterectomy versus endometrial ablation for women with heavy menstrual bleeding (HEALTH): a parallel-group, open-label, randomised controlled trial. BACKGROUND: Heavy menstrual bleeding affects 25% of women in the UK, many of whom require surgery to treat it. Hysterectomy is effective but has more complications than endometrial ablation, which is less invasive but ultimately leads to hysterectomy in 20% of women. We compared laparoscopic supracervical hysterectomy with endometrial ablation in women seeking surgical treatment for heavy menstrual bleeding. METHODS: In this parallel-group, multicentre, open-label, randomised controlled trial in 31 hospitals in the UK, women younger than 50 years who were referred to a gynaecologist for surgical treatment of heavy menstrual bleeding and who were eligible for endometrial ablation were randomly allocated (1:1) to either laparoscopic supracervical hysterectomy or second generation endometrial ablation. Women were randomly assigned by either an interactive voice response telephone system or an internet-based application with a minimisation algorithm based on centre and age group (<40 years vs \u226540 years). Laparoscopic supracervical hysterectomy involves laparoscopic (keyhole) surgery to remove the upper part of the uterus (the body) containing the endometrium. Endometrial ablation aims to treat heavy menstrual bleeding by destroying the endometrium, which is responsible for heavy periods. The co-primary clinical outcomes were patient satisfaction and condition-specific quality of life, measured with the menorrhagia multi-attribute quality of life scale (MMAS), assessed at 15 months after randomisation. Our analysis was based on the intention-to-treat principle. The trial was registered with the ISRCTN registry, number ISRCTN49013893. FINDINGS: Between May 21, 2014, and March 28, 2017, we enrolled and randomly assigned 660 women (330 in each group). 616 (93%) of 660 women were operated on within the study period, 588 (95%) of whom received the allocated procedure and 28 (5%) of whom had an alternative surgery. At 15 months after randomisation, more women allocated to laparoscopic supracervical hysterectomy were satisfied with their operation compared with those in the endometrial ablation group (270 [97%] of 278 women vs 244 [87%] of 280 women; adjusted percentage difference 9\u00b78, 95% CI 5\u00b71-14\u00b75; adjusted odds ratio [OR] 2\u00b753, 95% CI 1\u00b783-3\u00b748; p<0\u00b70001). Women randomly assigned to laparoscopic supracervical hysterectomy were also more likely to have the best possible MMAS score of 100 than women assigned to endometrial ablation (180 [69%] of 262 women vs 146 [54%] of 268 women; adjusted percentage difference 13\u00b73, 95% CI 3\u00b78-22\u00b78; adjusted OR 1\u00b787, 95% CI 1\u00b731-2\u00b767; p=0\u00b700058). 14 (5%) of 309 women in the laparoscopic supracervical hysterectomy group and 11 (4%) of 307 women in the endometrial ablation group had at least one serious adverse event (adjusted OR 1\u00b730, 95% CI 0\u00b756-3\u00b702; p=0\u00b754). INTERPRETATION: Laparoscopic supracervical hysterectomy is superior to endometrial ablation in terms of clinical effectiveness and has a similar proportion of complications, but takes longer to perform and is associated with a longer recovery.

        "Enterovirus pathogenesis requires the host methyltransferase SETD3. Enteroviruses (EVs) comprise a large genus of positive-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses whose members cause a number of important and widespread human diseases, including poliomyelitis, myocarditis, acute flaccid myelitis and the common cold. How EVs co-opt cellular functions to promote replication and spread is incompletely understood. Here, using genome-scale CRISPR screens, we identify the actin histidine methyltransferase SET domain containing 3 (SETD3) as critically important for viral infection by a broad panel of EVs, including rhinoviruses and non-polio EVs increasingly linked to severe neurological disease such as acute flaccid myelitis (EV-D68) and viral encephalitis (EV-A71). We show that cytosolic SETD3, independent of its methylation activity, is required for the RNA replication step in the viral life cycle. Using quantitative affinity purification-mass spectrometry, we show that SETD3 specifically interacts with the viral 2A protease of multiple enteroviral species, and we map the residues in 2A that mediate this interaction. 2A mutants that retain protease activity but are unable to interact with SETD3 are severely compromised in RNA replication. These data suggest a role of the viral 2A protein in RNA replication beyond facilitating proteolytic cleavage. Finally, we show that SETD3 is essential for in vivo replication and pathogenesis in multiple mouse models for EV infection, including CV-A10, EV-A71 and EV-D68. Our results reveal a crucial role of a host protein in viral pathogenesis, and suggest targeting SETD3 as a potential mechanism for controlling viral infections. ",
        "Longitudinal Relationship Between Time-Out and Child Emotional and Behavioral Functioning. OBJECTIVE: Time-out is a widely used child discipline strategy and one of the only strategies currently recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics. Despite its widespread use and significant evidence to support its effectiveness in decreasing problem behavior, time-out is often suggested to be harmful or ineffective by the popular media and select professional organizations. Empirical evidence regarding possible side effects of time-out is limited. The present study examined the relationship between reported use of time-out and child emotional and behavioral functioning and parent-child relationships using longitudinal, archival data. METHODS: The study used archival, longitudinal data from the Early Head Start Research and Evaluation study. This study tracked families with children in Early Head Start at 3 different time points as follows: baseline (aged 0-3 years), pre-kindergarten, and fifth grade. Parent interviews, including questions on the use of time-out, were conducted when the children were 36 months old. Indicators of child emotional and behavioral health were measured at 36 months, pre-K, and fifth grade. Statistical analyses were completed to assess for potential side effects of time-out on child behavioral and emotional functioning and parent-child relationships. RESULTS: Analyses for all outcome variables suggest no significant difference for children whose parents reported using time-out versus those who did not. CONCLUSION: Parental reported use of time-out was not associated with long-term negative outcomes. Further research in this area is necessary to continue to address the multitude of concerns related to time-out that are presented by the media. ",
        "Digital Screen Time and Pediatric Sleep: Evidence from a Preregistered Cohort Study. OBJECTIVES: To determine the extent to which time spent with digital devices predicts meaningful variability in pediatric sleep. STUDY DESIGN: Following a preregistered analysis plan, data from a sample of American children (n\u2009=\u200950 212) derived from the 2016 National Survey of Children's Health were analyzed. Models adjusted for child-, caregiver-, household-, and community-level covariates to estimate the potential effects of digital screen use. RESULTS: Each hour devoted to digital screens was associated with 3-8 fewer minutes of nightly sleep and significantly lower levels of sleep consistency. Furthermore, those children who complied with 2010 and 2016 American Academy of Pediatrics guidance on screen time limits reported between 20 and 26 more minutes, respectively, of nightly sleep. However, links between digital screen time and pediatric sleep outcomes were modest, accounting for less than 1.9% of observed variability in sleep outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Digital screen time, on its own, has little practical effect on pediatric sleep. Contextual factors surrounding screen time exert a more pronounced influence on pediatric sleep compared to screen time itself. These findings provide an empirically robust template for those investigating the digital displacement hypothesis as well as informing policy-making. ",
        "Enhancing glycolysis attenuates Parkinson's disease progression in models and clinical databases. Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disease that lacks therapies to prevent progressive neurodegeneration. Impaired energy metabolism and reduced ATP levels are common features of PD. Previous studies revealed that terazosin (TZ) enhances the activity of phosphoglycerate kinase 1 (PGK1), thereby stimulating glycolysis and increasing cellular ATP levels. Therefore, we asked whether enhancement of PGK1 activity would change the course of PD. In toxin-induced and genetic PD models in mice, rats, flies, and induced pluripotent stem cells, TZ increased brain ATP levels and slowed or prevented neuron loss. The drug increased dopamine levels and partially restored motor function. Because TZ is prescribed clinically, we also interrogated 2 distinct human databases. We found slower disease progression, decreased PD-related complications, and a reduced frequency of PD diagnoses in individuals taking TZ and related drugs. These findings suggest that enhancing PGK1 activity and increasing glycolysis may slow neurodegeneration in PD. ",
        "Ambient black carbon particles reach the fetal side of human placenta. Particle transfer across the placenta has been suggested but to date, no direct evidence in real-life, human context exists. Here we report the presence of black carbon (BC) particles as part of combustion-derived particulate matter in human placentae using white-light generation under femtosecond pulsed illumination. BC is identified in all screened placentae, with an average (SD) particle count of 0.95\u2009\u00d7\u2009104 (0.66\u2009\u00d7\u2009104) and 2.09\u2009\u00d7\u2009104 (0.9\u2009\u00d7\u2009104) particles per mm3 for low and high exposed mothers, respectively. Furthermore, the placental BC load is positively associated with mothers' residential BC exposure during pregnancy (0.63-2.42\u2009\u00b5g per m3). Our finding that BC particles accumulate on the fetal side of the placenta suggests that ambient particulates could be transported towards the fetus and represents a potential mechanism explaining the detrimental health effects of pollution from early life onwards.

        "Stunted microbiota and opportunistic pathogen colonization in caesarean-section birth. Immediately after birth, newborn babies experience rapid colonization by microorganisms from their mothers and the surrounding environment1. Diseases in childhood and later in life are potentially mediated by the perturbation of the colonization of the infant gut microbiota2. However, the effects of delivery via caesarean section on the earliest stages of the acquisition and development of the gut microbiota, during the neonatal period (\u22641\u00a0month), remain controversial3,4. Here we report the disrupted transmission of maternal Bacteroides strains, and high-level colonization by opportunistic pathogens associated with the hospital\u00a0environment (including Enterococcus, Enterobacter and Klebsiella species), in babies delivered by caesarean section. These effects were also seen, to a lesser extent, in vaginally delivered babies whose mothers underwent antibiotic prophylaxis and in babies who were not breastfed during the neonatal period. We applied longitudinal sampling and whole-genome shotgun metagenomic analysis to 1,679\u00a0gut microbiota\u00a0samples (taken at several time points during the neonatal period, and in infancy) from 596\u00a0full-term babies born in UK hospitals; for a subset of these babies, we collected additional matched samples from mothers (175\u00a0mothers paired with 178\u00a0babies). This analysis demonstrates that the mode of delivery is a significant factor that affects the composition of the\u00a0gut microbiota throughout the\u00a0neonatal period, and into infancy. Matched large-scale culturing and whole-genome sequencing of over 800\u00a0bacterial strains from these babies identified virulence factors and clinically relevant antimicrobial resistance in opportunistic pathogens that may predispose individuals to opportunistic infections. Our findings highlight the critical role of the local environment in establishing the gut microbiota in very early life, and identify colonization with antimicrobial-resistance-containing opportunistic pathogens as a previously underappreciated risk factor in hospital births.

        "The clinical effectiveness of sertraline in primary care and the role of depression severity and duration (PANDA): a pragmatic, double-blind, placebo-controlled randomised trial. BACKGROUND: Depression is usually managed in primary care, but most antidepressant trials are of patients from secondary care mental health services, with eligibility criteria based on diagnosis and severity of depressive symptoms. Antidepressants are now used in a much wider group of people than in previous regulatory trials. We investigated the clinical effectiveness of sertraline in patients in primary care with depressive symptoms ranging from mild to severe and tested the role of severity and duration in treatment response. METHODS: The PANDA study was a pragmatic, multicentre, double-blind, placebo-controlled randomised trial of patients from 179 primary care surgeries in four UK cities (Bristol, Liverpool, London, and York). We included patients aged 18 to 74 years who had depressive symptoms of any severity or duration in the past 2 years, where there was clinical uncertainty about the benefit of an antidepressant. This strategy was designed to improve the generalisability of our sample to current use of antidepressants within primary care. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) with a remote computer-generated code to sertraline or placebo, and were stratified by severity, duration, and site with random block length. Patients received one capsule (sertraline 50 mg or placebo orally) daily for one week then two capsules daily for up to 11 weeks, consistent with evidence on optimal dosages for efficacy and acceptability. The primary outcome was depressive symptoms 6 weeks after randomisation, measured by Patient Health Questionnaire, 9-item version (PHQ-9) scores. Secondary outcomes at 2, 6 and 12 weeks were depressive symptoms and remission (PHQ-9 and Beck Depression Inventory-II), generalised anxiety symptoms (Generalised Anxiety Disorder Assessment 7-item version), mental and physical health-related quality of life (12-item Short-Form Health Survey), and self-reported improvement. All analyses compared groups as randomised (intention-to-treat). The study is registered with EudraCT, 2013-003440-22 (protocol number 13/0413; version 6.1) and ISRCTN, ISRCTN84544741, and is closed to new participants. FINDINGS: Between Jan 1, 2015, and Aug 31, 2017, we recruited and randomly assigned 655 patients-326 (50%) to sertraline and 329 (50%) to placebo. Two patients in the sertraline group did not complete a substantial proportion of the baseline assessment and were excluded, leaving 653 patients in total. Due to attrition, primary outcome analyses were of 550 patients (266 in the sertraline group and 284 in the placebo group; 85% follow-up that did not differ by treatment allocation). We found no evidence that sertraline led to a clinically meaningful reduction in depressive symptoms at 6 weeks. The mean 6-week PHQ-9 score was 7\u00b798 (SD 5\u00b763) in the sertraline group and 8\u00b776 (5\u00b786) in the placebo group (adjusted proportional difference 0\u00b795, 95% CI 0\u00b785-1\u00b707; p=0\u00b741). However, for secondary outcomes, we found evidence that sertraline led to reduced anxiety symptoms, better mental (but not physical) health-related quality of life, and self-reported improvements in mental health. We observed weak evidence that depressive symptoms were reduced by sertraline at 12 weeks. We recorded seven adverse events-four for sertraline and three for placebo, and adverse events did not differ by treatment allocation. Three adverse events were classified as serious-two in the sertraline group and one in the placebo group. One serious adverse event in the sertraline group was classified as possibly related to study medication. INTERPRETATION: Sertraline is unlikely to reduce depressive symptoms within 6 weeks in primary care but we observed improvements in anxiety, quality of life, and self-rated mental health, which are likely to be clinically important. Our findings support the prescription of SSRI antidepressants in a wider group of participants than previously thought, including those with mild to moderate symptoms who do not meet diagnostic criteria for depression or generalised anxiety disorder.

        "Planned mode of delivery after previous cesarean section and short-term maternal and perinatal outcomes: A population-based record linkage cohort study in Scotland. BACKGROUND: Policy consensus in high-income countries supports offering pregnant women with previous cesarean section a choice between planning an elective repeat cesarean section (ERCS) or attempting a vaginal birth, known as a planned vaginal birth after previous cesarean (VBAC), provided they do not have contraindications to planned VBAC. However, robust comprehensive information on the associated outcomes to counsel eligible women about this choice is lacking. This study investigated the short-term maternal and perinatal outcomes associated with planned mode of delivery after previous cesarean section among women delivering a term singleton and considered eligible to have a planned VBAC. METHODS AND FINDINGS: A population-based cohort of 74,043 term singleton births in Scotland between 2002 and 2015 to women with one or more previous cesarean sections was conducted using linked Scottish national datasets. Logistic or modified Poisson regression, as appropriate, was used to estimate the effect of planned mode of delivery on maternal and perinatal outcomes adjusted for sociodemographic, maternal medical, and obstetric-related characteristics. A total of 45,579 women gave birth by ERCS, and 28,464 had a planned VBAC, 28.4% of whom went on to have an in-labor nonelective repeat cesarean section. Compared to women delivering by ERCS, those who had a planned VBAC were significantly more likely to have uterine rupture (0.24%, n = 69 versus 0.04%, n = 17, adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 7.3, 95% confidence interval [CI] 3.9-13.9, p < 0.001), a blood transfusion (1.14%, n = 324 versus 0.50%, n = 226, aOR 2.3, 95% CI 1.9-2.8, p < 0.001), puerperal sepsis (0.27%, n = 76 versus 0.17%, n = 78, aOR 1.8, 95% CI 1.3-2.7, p = 0.002), and surgical injury (0.17% versus 0.09%, n = 40, aOR 3.0, 95% CI 1.8-4.8, p < 0.001) and experience adverse perinatal outcomes including perinatal death, admission to a neonatal unit, resuscitation requiring drugs and/or intubation, and an Apgar score < 7 at 5 minutes (7.99%, n = 2,049 versus 6.37%, n = 2,570, aOR 1.6, 95% CI 1.5-1.7, p < 0.001). However, women who had a planned VBAC were more likely than those delivering by ERCS to breastfeed at birth or hospital discharge (63.6%, n = 14,906 versus 54.5%, n = 21,403, adjusted risk ratio [aRR] 1.2, 95% CI 1.1-1.2, p < 0.001) and were more likely to breastfeed at 6-8 weeks postpartum (43.6%, n = 10,496 versus 34.5%, n = 13,556, aRR 1.2, 95% CI 1.2-1.3, p < 0.001). The effect of planned mode of delivery on the mother's risk of having a postnatal stay greater than 5 days, an overnight readmission to hospital within 42 days of birth, and other puerperal infection varied according to whether she had any prior vaginal deliveries and, in the case of length of postnatal stay, also varied according to the number of prior cesarean sections. The study is mainly limited by the potential for residual confounding and misclassification bias. CONCLUSIONS: Among women considered eligible to have a planned VBAC, planned VBAC compared to ERCS is associated with an increased risk of the mother having serious birth-related maternal and perinatal complications. Conversely, planned VBAC is associated with an increased likelihood of breastfeeding, whereas the effect on other maternal outcomes differs according to whether a woman has any prior vaginal deliveries and the number of prior cesarean sections she has had. However, the absolute risk of adverse outcomes is small for either delivery approach. This information can be used to counsel and manage the increasing number of women with previous cesarean section, but more research is needed on longer-term outcomes. ",
        "Risk of prostate cancer for men fathering through assisted reproduction: nationwide population based register study. OBJECTIVE: To compare the risk and severity of prostate cancer between men achieving fatherhood by assisted reproduction and men conceiving naturally. DESIGN: National register based cohort study. SETTING: Sweden from January 1994 to December 2014. PARTICIPANTS: 1\u2009181\u2009490 children born alive in Sweden during 1994-2014 to the same number of fathers. Fathers were grouped according to fertility status by mode of conception: 20\u2009618 by in vitro fertilisation (IVF), 14\u2009882 by intra-cytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI), and 1\u2009145\u2009990 by natural conception. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Prostate cancer diagnosis, age of onset, and androgen deprivation therapy (serving as proxy for advanced or metastatic malignancy). RESULTS: Among men achieving fatherhood by IVF, by ICSI, and by non-assisted means, 77 (0.37%), 63 (0.42%), and 3244 (0.28%), respectively, were diagnosed as having prostate cancer. Mean age at onset was 55.9, 55.1, and 57.1 years, respectively. Men who became fathers through assisted reproduction had a statistically significantly increased risk of prostate cancer compared with men who conceived naturally (hazard ratio 1.64, 95% confidence interval 1.25 to 2.15, for ICSI; 1.33, 1.06 to 1.66, for IVF). They also had an increased risk of early onset disease (that is, diagnosis before age 55 years) (hazard ratio 1.86, 1.25 to 2.77, for ICSI; 1.51, 1.09 to 2.08, for IVF). Fathers who conceived through ICSI and developed prostate cancer received androgen deprivation therapy to at least the same extent as the reference group (odds ratio 1.91; P=0.07). CONCLUSIONS: Men who achieved fatherhood through assisted reproduction techniques, particularly through ICSI, are at increased risk for early onset prostate cancer and thus constitute a risk group in which testing and careful long term follow-up for prostate cancer may be beneficial.

        "Resurrection of the ancestral RH5 invasion ligand provides a molecular explanation for the origin of P. falciparum malaria in humans. Many important infectious diseases are the result of zoonoses, in which pathogens that normally infect animals acquire mutations that enable the breaching of species barriers to permit the infection of humans. Our understanding of the molecular events that enable host switching are often limited, and yet this is a fundamentally important question. Plasmodium falciparum, the etiological agent of severe human malaria, evolved following a zoonotic transfer of parasites from gorillas. One gene-rh5-which encodes an essential ligand for the invasion of host erythrocytes, is suspected to have played a critical role in this host switch. Genome comparisons revealed an introgressed sequence in the ancestor of P. falciparum containing rh5, which likely allowed the ancestral parasites to infect both gorilla and human erythrocytes. To test this hypothesis, we resurrected the ancestral introgressed reticulocyte-binding protein homologue 5 (RH5) sequence and used quantitative protein interaction assays to demonstrate that this ancestral protein could bind the basigin receptor from both humans and gorillas. We also showed that this promiscuous receptor binding phenotype of RH5 was shared with the parasite clade that transferred its genome segment to the ancestor of P. falciparum, while the other lineages exhibit host-specific receptor binding, confirming the central importance of this introgression event for Plasmodium host switching. Finally, since its transfer to humans, P. falciparum, and also the RH5 ligand, have evolved a strong human specificity. We show that this subsequent restriction to humans can be attributed to a single amino acid mutation in the RH5 sequence. Our findings reveal a molecular pathway for the origin and evolution of human P. falciparum malaria and may inform molecular surveillance to predict future zoonoses. ",
        "Short term exposure to fine particulate matter and hospital admission risks and costs in the Medicare population: time stratified, case crossover study. OBJECTIVE: To assess risks and costs of hospital admission associated with short term exposure to fine particulate matter with diameter less than 2.5 \u00b5m (PM2.5) for 214 mutually exclusive disease groups. DESIGN: Time stratified, case crossover analyses with conditional logistic regressions adjusted for non-linear confounding effects of meteorological variables. SETTING: Medicare inpatient hospital claims in the United States, 2000-12 (n=95\u2009277\u2009169). PARTICIPANTS: All Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries aged 65 or older admitted to hospital. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Risk of hospital admission, number of admissions, days in hospital, inpatient and post-acute care costs, and value of statistical life (that is, the economic value used to measure the cost of avoiding a death) due to the lives lost at discharge for 214 disease groups. RESULTS: Positive associations between short term exposure to PM2.5 and risk of hospital admission were found for several prevalent but rarely studied diseases, such as septicemia, fluid and electrolyte disorders, and acute and unspecified renal failure. Positive associations were also found between risk of hospital admission and cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, Parkinson's disease, diabetes, phlebitis, thrombophlebitis, and thromboembolism, confirming previously published results. These associations remained consistent when restricted to days with a daily PM2.5 concentration below the WHO air quality guideline for the 24 hour average exposure to PM2.5. For the rarely studied diseases, each 1 \u00b5g/m3 increase in short term PM2.5 was associated with an annual increase of 2050 hospital admissions (95% confidence interval 1914 to 2187 admissions), 12\u2009216 days in hospital (11\u2009358 to 13\u2009075), US$31m (\u00a324m, \u20ac28m; $29m to $34m) in inpatient and post-acute care costs, and $2.5bn ($2.0bn to $2.9bn) in value of statistical life. For diseases with a previously known association, each 1 \u00b5g/m3 increase in short term exposure to PM2.5 was associated with an annual increase of 3642 hospital admissions (3434 to 3851), 20\u2009098 days in hospital (18\u2009950 to 21\u2009247), $69m ($65m to $73m) in inpatient and post-acute care costs, and $4.1bn ($3.5bn to $4.7bn) in value of statistical life. CONCLUSIONS: New causes and previously identified causes of hospital admission associated with short term exposure to PM2.5 were found. These associations remained even at a daily PM2.5 concentration below the WHO 24 hour guideline. Substantial economic costs were linked to a small increase in short term PM2.5. ",
        "Association of fried food consumption with all cause, cardiovascular, and cancer mortality: prospective cohort study. OBJECTIVE: To examine the prospective association of total and individual fried food consumption with all cause and cause specific mortality in women in the United States. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: Women's Health Initiative conducted in 40 clinical centers in the US. PARTICIPANTS: 106\u2009966 postmenopausal women aged 50-79 at study entry who were enrolled between September 1993 and 1998 in the Women's Health Initiative and followed until February 2017. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: All cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, and cancer mortality. RESULTS: 31\u2009558 deaths occurred during 1\u2009914\u2009691 person years of follow-up. For total fried food consumption, when comparing at least one serving per day with no consumption, the multivariable adjusted hazard ratio was 1.08 (95% confidence interval 1.01 to 1.16) for all cause mortality and 1.08 (0.96 to 1.22) for cardiovascular mortality. When comparing at least one serving per week of fried chicken with no consumption, the hazard ratio was 1.13 (1.07 to 1.19) for all cause mortality and 1.12 (1.02 to 1.23) for cardiovascular mortality. For fried fish/shellfish, the corresponding hazard ratios were 1.07 (1.03 to 1.12) for all cause mortality and 1.13 (1.04 to 1.22) for cardiovascular mortality. Total or individual fried food consumption was not generally associated with cancer mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Frequent consumption of fried foods, especially fried chicken and fried fish/shellfish, was associated with a higher risk of all cause and cardiovascular mortality in women in the US. ",
        "Association of changes in red meat consumption with total and cause specific mortality among US women and men: two prospective cohort studies. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association of changes in red meat consumption with total and cause specific mortality in women and men. DESIGN: Two prospective cohort studies with repeated measures of diet and lifestyle factors. SETTING: Nurses' Health Study and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study, United States. PARTICIPANTS: 53\u2009553 women and 27\u2009916 men without cardiovascular disease or cancer at baseline. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Death confirmed by state vital statistics records, the national death index, or reported by families and the postal system. RESULTS: 14\u2009019 deaths occurred during 1.2 million person years of follow-up. Increases in red meat consumption over eight years were associated with a higher mortality risk in the subsequent eight years among women and men (both P for trend<0.05, P for heterogeneity=0.97). An increase in total red meat consumption of at least half a serving per day was associated with a 10% higher mortality risk (pooled hazard ratio 1.10, 95% confidence interval 1.04 to 1.17). For processed and unprocessed red meat consumption, an increase of at least half a serving per day was associated with a 13% higher mortality risk (1.13, 1.04 to 1.23) and a 9% higher mortality risk (1.09, 1.02 to 1.17), respectively. A decrease in consumption of processed or unprocessed red meat of at least half a serving per day was not associated with mortality risk. The association between increased red meat consumption and mortality risk was consistent across subgroups defined by age, physical activity, dietary quality, smoking status, or alcohol consumption. CONCLUSION: Increases in red meat consumption, especially processed meat, were associated with higher overall mortality rates. ",
        "Serial circulating omega 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids and healthy ageing among older adults in the Cardiovascular Health Study: prospective cohort study. OBJECTIVE: To determine the longitudinal association between serial biomarker measures of circulating omega 3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (n3-PUFA) levels and healthy ageing. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: Four communities in the United States (Cardiovascular Health Study) from 1992 to 2015. PARTICIPANTS: 2622 adults with a mean (SD) age of 74.4 (4.8) and with successful healthy ageing at baseline in 1992-93. EXPOSURE: Cumulative levels of plasma phospholipid n3-PUFAs were measured using gas chromatography in 1992-93, 1998-99, and 2005-06, expressed as percentage of total fatty acids, including \u03b1-linolenic acid from plants and eicosapentaenoic acid, docosapentaenoic acid, and docosahexaenoic acid from seafoood. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Healthy ageing defined as survival without chronic diseases (ie, cardiovascular disease, cancer, lung disease, and severe chronic kidney disease), the absence of cognitive and physical dysfunction, or death from other causes not part of the healthy ageing outcome after age 65. Events were centrally adjudicated or determined from medical records and diagnostic tests. RESULTS: Higher levels of long chain n3-PUFAs were associated with an 18% lower risk (95% confidence interval 7% to 28%) of unhealthy ageing per interquintile range after multivariable adjustments with time-varying exposure and covariates. Individually, higher eicosapentaenoic acid and docosapentaenoic acid (but not docosahexaenoic acid) levels were associated with a lower risk: 15% (6% to 23%) and 16% (6% to 25%), respectively. \u03b1-linolenic acid from plants was not noticeably associated with unhealthy ageing (hazard ratio 0.92, 95% confidence interval 0.83 to 1.02). CONCLUSIONS: In older adults, a higher cumulative level of serially measured circulating n3-PUFAs from seafood (eicosapentaenoic acid, docosapentaenoic acid, and docosahexaenoic acid), eicosapentaenoic acid, and docosapentaenoic acid (but not docosahexaenoic acid from seafood or \u03b1-linolenic acid from plants) was associated with a higher likelihood of healthy ageing. These findings support guidelines for increased dietary consumption of n3-PUFAs in older adults. ",
        "Association between consumption of ultra-processed foods and all cause mortality: SUN prospective cohort study. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association between consumption of ultra-processed foods and all cause mortality. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: Seguimiento Universidad de Navarra (SUN) cohort of university graduates, Spain 1999-2018. PARTICIPANTS: 19\u2009899 participants (12\u2009113 women and 7786 men) aged 20-91 years followed-up every two years between December 1999 and February 2014 for food and drink consumption, classified according to the degree of processing by the NOVA classification, and evaluated through a validated 136 item food frequency questionnaire. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Association between consumption of energy adjusted ultra-processed foods categorised into quarters (low, low-medium, medium-high, and high consumption) and all cause mortality, using multivariable Cox proportional hazard models. RESULTS: 335 deaths occurred during 200\u2009432 persons years of follow-up. Participants in the highest quarter (high consumption) of ultra-processed foods consumption had a higher hazard for all cause mortality compared with those in the lowest quarter (multivariable adjusted hazard ratio 1.62, 95% confidence interval 1.13 to 2.33) with a significant dose-response relation (P for linear trend=0.005). For each additional serving of ultra-processed foods, all cause mortality relatively increased by 18% (adjusted hazard ratio 1.18, 95% confidence interval 1.05 to 1.33). CONCLUSIONS: A higher consumption of ultra-processed foods (>4 servings daily) was independently associated with a 62% relatively increased hazard for all cause mortality. For each additional serving of ultra-processed food, all cause mortality increased by 18%. STUDY REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02669602. Ultra-processed food intake and risk of cardiovascular disease: prospective cohort study (NutriNet-Sant\u00e9). OBJECTIVE: To assess the prospective associations between consumption of ultra-processed foods and risk of cardiovascular diseases. DESIGN: Population based cohort study. SETTING: NutriNet-Sant\u00e9 cohort, France 2009-18. PARTICIPANTS: 105\u2009159 participants aged at least 18 years. Dietary intakes were collected using repeated 24 hour dietary records (5.7 for each participant on average), designed to register participants' usual consumption of 3300 food items. These foods were categorised using the NOVA classification according to degree of processing. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Associations between intake of ultra-processed food and overall risk of cardiovascular, coronary heart, and cerebrovascular diseases assessed by multivariable Cox proportional hazard models adjusted for known risk factors. RESULTS: During a median follow-up of 5.2 years, intake of ultra-processed food was associated with a higher risk of overall cardiovascular disease (1409 cases; hazard ratio for an absolute increment of 10 in the percentage of ultra-processed foods in the diet 1.12 (95% confidence interval 1.05 to 1.20); P<0.001, 518\u2009208 person years, incidence rates in high consumers of ultra-processed foods (fourth quarter) 277 per 100\u2009000 person years, and in low consumers (first quarter) 242 per 100\u2009000 person years), coronary heart disease risk (665 cases; hazard ratio 1.13 (1.02 to 1.24); P=0.02, 520\u2009319 person years, incidence rates 124 and 109 per 100\u2009000 person years, in the high and low consumers, respectively), and cerebrovascular disease risk (829 cases; hazard ratio 1.11 (1.01 to 1.21); P=0.02, 520\u2009023 person years, incidence rates 163 and 144 per 100\u2009000 person years, in high and low consumers, respectively). These results remained statistically significant after adjustment for several markers of the nutritional quality of the diet (saturated fatty acids, sodium and sugar intakes, dietary fibre, or a healthy dietary pattern derived by principal component analysis) and after a large range of sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSIONS: In this large observational prospective study, higher consumption of ultra-processed foods was associated with higher risks of cardiovascular, coronary heart, and cerebrovascular diseases. These results need to be confirmed in other populations and settings, and causality remains to be established. Various factors in processing, such as nutritional composition of the final product, additives, contact materials, and neoformed contaminants might play a role in these associations, and further studies are needed to understand better the relative contributions. Meanwhile, public health authorities in several countries have recently started to promote unprocessed or minimally processed foods and to recommend limiting the consumption of ultra-processed foods.

        "Risks of ischaemic heart disease and stroke in meat eaters, fish eaters, and vegetarians over 18 years of follow-up: results from the prospective EPIC-Oxford study. OBJECTIVE: To examine the associations of vegetarianism with risks of ischaemic heart disease and stroke. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: The EPIC-Oxford study, a cohort in the United Kingdom with a large proportion of non-meat eaters, recruited across the country between 1993 and 2001. PARTICIPANTS: 48 188 participants with no history of ischaemic heart disease, stroke, or angina (or cardiovascular disease) were classified into three distinct diet groups: meat eaters (participants who consumed meat, regardless of whether they consumed fish, dairy, or eggs; n=24 428), fish eaters (consumed fish but no meat; n=7506), and vegetarians including vegans (n=16 254), based on dietary information collected at baseline, and subsequently around 2010 (n=28 364). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Incident cases of ischaemic heart disease and stroke (including ischaemic and haemorrhagic types) identified through record linkage until 2016. RESULTS: Over 18.1 years of follow-up, 2820 cases of ischaemic heart disease and 1072 cases of total stroke (519 ischaemic stroke and 300 haemorrhagic stroke) were recorded. After adjusting for sociodemographic and lifestyle confounders, fish eaters and vegetarians had 13% (hazard ratio 0.87, 95% confidence interval 0.77 to 0.99) and 22% (0.78, 0.70 to 0.87) lower rates of ischaemic heart disease than meat eaters, respectively (P<0.001 for heterogeneity). This difference was equivalent to 10 fewer cases of ischaemic heart disease (95% confidence interval 6.7 to 13.1 fewer) in vegetarians than in meat eaters per 1000 population over 10 years. The associations for ischaemic heart disease were partly attenuated after adjustment for self reported high blood cholesterol, high blood pressure, diabetes, and body mass index (hazard ratio 0.90, 95% confidence interval 0.81 to 1.00 in vegetarians with all adjustments). By contrast, vegetarians had 20% higher rates of total stroke (hazard ratio 1.20, 95% confidence interval 1.02 to 1.40) than meat eaters, equivalent to three more cases of total stroke (95% confidence interval 0.8 to 5.4 more) per 1000 population over 10 years, mostly due to a higher rate of haemorrhagic stroke. The associations for stroke did not attenuate after further adjustment of disease risk factors. CONCLUSIONS: In this prospective cohort in the UK, fish eaters and vegetarians had lower rates of ischaemic heart disease than meat eaters, although vegetarians had higher rates of haemorrhagic and total stroke.

        "Intensification of older adults' outpatient blood pressure treatment at hospital discharge: national retrospective cohort study. OBJECTIVES: To assess how often older adults admitted to hospital for common non-cardiac conditions were discharged with intensified antihypertensive treatment, and to identify markers of appropriateness for these intensifications. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: US Veterans Administration Health System. PARTICIPANTS: Patients aged 65 years or over with hypertension admitted to hospital with non-cardiac conditions between 2011 and 2013. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Intensification of antihypertensive treatment, defined as receiving a new or higher dose antihypertensive agent at discharge compared with drugs used before admission. Hierarchical logistic regression analyses were used to control for characteristics of patients and hospitals. RESULTS: Among 14\u2009915 older adults (median age 76, interquartile range 69-84), 9636 (65%) had well controlled outpatient blood pressure before hospital admission. Overall, 2074 (14%) patients were discharged with intensified antihypertensive treatment, more than half of whom (1082) had well controlled blood pressure before admission. After adjustment for potential confounders, elevated inpatient blood pressure was strongly associated with being discharged on intensified antihypertensive regimens. Among patients with previously well controlled outpatient blood pressure, 8% (95% confidence interval 7% to 9%) of patients without elevated inpatient blood pressure, 24% (21% to 26%) of patients with moderately elevated inpatient blood pressure, and 40% (34% to 46%) of patients with severely elevated inpatient blood pressure were discharged with intensified antihypertensive regimens. No differences were seen in rates of intensification among patients least likely to benefit from tight blood pressure control (limited life expectancy, dementia, or metastatic malignancy), nor in those most likely to benefit (history of myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular disease, or renal disease). CONCLUSIONS: One in seven older adults admitted to hospital for common non-cardiac conditions were discharged with intensified antihypertensive treatment. More than half of intensifications occurred in patients with previously well controlled outpatient blood pressure. More attention is needed to reduce potentially harmful overtreatment of blood pressure as older adults transition from hospital to home. ",
        "Physical activity trajectories and mortality: population based cohort study. OBJECTIVE: To assess the prospective associations of baseline and long term trajectories of physical activity on mortality from all causes, cardiovascular disease, and cancer. DESIGN: Population based cohort study. SETTING: Adults from the general population in the UK. PARTICIPANTS: 14\u2009599 men and women (aged 40 to 79) from the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition-Norfolk cohort, assessed at baseline (1993 to 1997) up to 2004 for lifestyle and other risk factors; then followed to 2016 for mortality (median of 12.5 years of follow-up, after the last exposure assessment). MAIN EXPOSURE: Physical activity energy expenditure (PAEE) derived from questionnaires, calibrated against combined movement and heart rate monitoring. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Mortality from all causes, cardiovascular disease, and cancer. Multivariable proportional hazards regression models were adjusted for age, sex, sociodemographics, and changes in medical history, overall diet quality, body mass index, blood pressure, triglycerides, and cholesterol levels. RESULTS: During 171\u2009277 person years of follow-up, 3148 deaths occurred. Long term increases in PAEE were inversely associated with mortality, independent of baseline PAEE. For each 1 kJ/kg/day per year increase in PAEE (equivalent to a trajectory of being inactive at baseline and gradually, over five years, meeting the World Health Organization minimum physical activity guidelines of 150 minutes/week of moderate-intensity physical activity), hazard ratios were: 0.76 (95% confidence interval 0.71 to 0.82) for all cause mortality, 0.71 (0.62 to 0.82) for cardiovascular disease mortality, and 0.89 (0.79 to 0.99) for cancer mortality, adjusted for baseline PAEE, and established risk factors. Similar results were observed when analyses were stratified by medical history of cardiovascular disease and cancer. Joint analyses with baseline and trajectories of physical activity show that, compared with consistently inactive individuals, those with increasing physical activity trajectories over time experienced lower risks of mortality from all causes, with hazard ratios of 0.76 (0.65 to 0.88), 0.62 (0.53 to 0.72), and 0.58 (0.43 to 0.78) at low, medium, and high baseline physical activity, respectively. At the population level, meeting and maintaining at least the minimum physical activity recommendations would potentially prevent 46% of deaths associated with physical inactivity. CONCLUSIONS: Middle aged and older adults, including those with cardiovascular disease and cancer, can gain substantial longevity benefits by becoming more physically active, irrespective of past physical activity levels and established risk factors. Considerable population health impacts can be attained with consistent engagement in physical activity during mid to late life. ",
        "Hospital revisits within 30 days after discharge for medical conditions targeted by the Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program in the United States: national retrospective analysis. OBJECTIVE: To determine any changes in total hospital revisits within 30 days of discharge after a hospital stay for medical conditions targeted by the Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program (HRRP). DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Hospital stays among Medicare patients for heart failure, acute myocardial infarction, or pneumonia between 1 January 2012 and 1 October 2015. PARTICIPANTS: Medicare fee-for-service patients aged 65 or over. MAIN OUTCOMES: Total hospital revisits within 30 days of discharge after hospital stays for medical conditions targeted by the HRRP, and by type of revisit: treat-and-discharge visit to an emergency department, observation stay (not leading to inpatient readmission), and inpatient readmission. Patient subgroups (age, sex, race) were also evaluated for each type of revisit. RESULTS: Our study cohort included 3\u2009038\u2009740 total index hospital stays from January 2012 to September 2015: 1\u2009357\u2009620 for heart failure, 634\u2009795 for acute myocardial infarction, and 1\u2009046\u2009325 for pneumonia. Counting all revisits after discharge, the total number of hospital revisits per 100 patient discharges for target conditions increased across the study period (monthly increase 0.023 visits per 100 patient discharges (95% confidence interval 0.010 to 0.035)). This change was due to monthly increases in treat-and-discharge visits to an emergency department (0.023 (0.015 to 0.032) and observation stays (0.022 (0.020 to 0.025)), which were only partly offset by declines in readmissions (-0.023 (-0.035 to -0.012)). Increases in observation stay use were more pronounced among non-white patients than white patients. No significant change was seen in mortality within 30 days of discharge for target conditions (-0.0034 (-0.012 to 0.0054)). CONCLUSIONS: In the United States, total hospital revisits within 30 days of discharge for conditions targeted by the HRRP increased across the study period. This increase was due to a rise in post-discharge emergency department visits and observation stays, which exceeded the decline in readmissions. Although reductions in readmissions have been attributed to improvements in discharge planning and care transitions, our findings suggest that these declines could instead be because hospitals and clinicians have intensified efforts to treat patients who return to a hospital within 30 days of discharge in emergency departments and as observation stays.

        "Association between patient outcomes and accreditation in US hospitals: observational study. OBJECTIVES: To determine whether patients admitted to US hospitals that are accredited have better outcomes than those admitted to hospitals reviewed through state surveys, and whether accreditation by The Joint Commission (the largest and most well known accrediting body with an international presence) confers any additional benefits for patients compared with other independent accrediting organizations. DESIGN: Observational study. SETTING: 4400 hospitals in the United States, of which 3337 were accredited (2847 by The Joint Commission) and 1063 underwent state based review between 2014 and 2017. PARTICIPANTS: 4\u2009242\u2009684 patients aged 65 years and older admitted for 15 common medical and six common surgical conditions and survey respondents of the Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Provider and Systems (HCAHPS). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Risk adjusted mortality and readmission rates at 30 days and HCAHPS patient experience scores. Hospital admissions were identified from Medicare inpatient files for 2014, and accreditation information was obtained from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and The Joint Commission. RESULTS: Patients treated at accredited hospitals had lower 30 day mortality rates (although not statistically significant lower rates, based on the prespecified P value threshold) than those at hospitals that were reviewed by a state survey agency (10.2% v 10.6%, difference 0.4% (95% confidence interval 0.1% to 0.8%), P=0.03), but nearly identical rates of mortality for the six surgical conditions (2.4% v 2.4%, 0.0% (-0.3% to 0.3%), P=0.99). Readmissions for the 15 medical conditions at 30 days were significantly lower at accredited hospitals than at state survey hospitals (22.4% v 23.2%, 0.8% (0.4% to 1.3%), P<0.001) but did not differ for the surgical conditions (15.9% v 15.6%, 0.3% (-1.2% to 1.6%), P=0.75). No statistically significant differences were seen in 30 day mortality or readmission rates (for both the medical or surgical conditions) between hospitals accredited by The Joint Commission and those accredited by other independent organizations. Patient experience scores were modestly better at state survey hospitals than at accredited hospitals (summary star rating 3.4 v 3.2, 0.2 (0.1 to 0.3), P<0.001). Among accredited hospitals, The Joint Commission did not have significantly different patient experience scores compared to other independent organizations (3.1 v 3.2, 0.1 (-0.003 to 0.2), P=0.06). CONCLUSIONS: US hospital accreditation by independent organizations is not associated with lower mortality, and is only slightly associated with reduced readmission rates for the 15 common medical conditions selected in this study. There was no evidence in this study to indicate that patients choosing a hospital accredited by The Joint Commission confer any healthcare benefits over choosing a hospital accredited by another independent accrediting organization.

        "Alcohol consumption and risk of dementia: 23 year follow-up of Whitehall II cohort study. OBJECTIVE: To examine the association between alcohol consumption and risk of dementia. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: Civil service departments in London (Whitehall II study). PARTICIPANTS: 9087 participants aged 35-55 years at study inception (1985/88). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Incident dementia, identified through linkage to hospital, mental health services, and mortality registers until 2017. Measures of alcohol consumption were the mean from three assessments between 1985/88 and 1991/93 (midlife), categorised as abstinence, 1-14 units/week, and >14 units/week; 17 year trajectories of alcohol consumption based on five assessments of alcohol consumption between 1985/88 and 2002/04; CAGE questionnaire for alcohol dependence assessed in 1991/93; and hospital admission for alcohol related chronic diseases between 1991 and 2017. RESULTS: 397 cases of dementia were recorded over a mean follow-up of 23 years. Abstinence in midlife was associated with a higher risk of dementia (hazard ratio 1.47, 95% confidence interval 1.15 to 1.89) compared with consumption of 1-14 units/week. Among those drinking >14 units/week, a 7 unit increase in alcohol consumption was associated with a 17% (95% confidence interval 4% to 32%) increase in risk of dementia. CAGE score >2 (hazard ratio 2.19, 1.29 to 3.71) and alcohol related hospital admission (4.28, 2.72 to 6.73) were also associated with an increased risk of dementia. Alcohol consumption trajectories from midlife to early old age showed long term abstinence (1.74, 1.31 to 2.30), decrease in consumption (1.55, 1.08 to 2.22), and long term consumption >14 units/week (1.40, 1.02 to 1.93) to be associated with a higher risk of dementia compared with long term consumption of 1-14 units/week. Analysis using multistate models suggested that the excess risk of dementia associated with abstinence in midlife was partly explained by cardiometabolic disease over the follow-up as the hazard ratio of dementia in abstainers without cardiometabolic disease was 1.33 (0.88 to 2.02) compared with 1.47 (1.15 to 1.89) in the entire population. CONCLUSION: The risk of dementia was increased in people who abstained from alcohol in midlife or consumed >14 units/week. In several countries, guidelines define thresholds for harmful alcohol consumption much higher than 14 units/week. The present findings encourage the downward revision of such guidelines to promote cognitive health at older ages. ",
        "Changes in hospital safety following penalties in the US Hospital Acquired Condition Reduction Program: retrospective cohort study. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association between hospital penalization in the US Hospital Acquired Condition Reduction Program (HACRP) and subsequent changes in clinical outcomes. DESIGN: Regression discontinuity design applied to a retrospective cohort from inpatient Medicare claims. SETTING: 3238 acute care hospitals in the United States. PARTICIPANTS: Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries discharged from acute care hospitals between 23 July 2014 and 30 November 2016 and eligible for at least one targeted hospital acquired condition (n=15\u2009470\u2009334). INTERVENTION: Hospital receipt of a penalty in the first year of the HACRP. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Episode level count of targeted hospital acquired conditions per 1000 episodes, 30 day readmissions, and 30 day mortality. RESULTS: Of 724 hospitals penalized under the HACRP in fiscal year 2015, 708 were represented in the study. Mean counts of hospital acquired conditions were 2.72 per 1000 episodes for penalized hospitals and 2.06 per 1000 episodes for non-penalized hospitals; 30 day readmissions were 14.4% and 14.0%, respectively, and 30 day mortality was 9.0% for both hospital groups. Penalized hospitals were more likely to be large, teaching institutions, and have a greater share of patients with low socioeconomic status than non-penalized hospitals. HACRP penalties were associated with a non-significant change of -0.16 hospital acquired conditions per 1000 episodes (95% confidence interval -0.53 to 0.20), -0.36 percentage points in 30 day readmission (-1.06 to 0.33), and -0.04 percentage points in 30 day mortality (-0.59 to 0.52). No clear patterns of clinical improvement were observed across hospital characteristics. CONCLUSIONS: Penalization was not associated with significant changes in rates of hospital acquired conditions, 30 day readmission, or 30 day mortality, and does not appear to drive meaningful clinical improvements. By disproportionately penalizing hospitals caring for more disadvantaged patients, the HACRP could exacerbate inequities in care. ",
        "Use of postmenopausal hormone therapy and risk of Alzheimer's disease in Finland: nationwide case-control study. OBJECTIVES: To compare the use of hormone therapy between Finnish postmenopausal women with and without a diagnosis for Alzheimer's disease. DESIGN: Nationwide case-control study. SETTING: Finnish national population and drug register, between 1999 and 2013. PARTICIPANTS: All postmenopausal women (n=84\u2009739) in Finland who, between 1999 and 2013, received a diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease from a neurologist or geriatrician, and who were identified from a national drug register. Control women without a diagnosis (n=84\u2009739), matched by age and hospital district, were traced from the Finnish national population register. INTERVENTIONS: Data on hormone therapy use were obtained from the Finnish national drug reimbursement register. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for Alzheimer's disease, calculated with conditional logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: In 83 688 (98.8%) women, a diagnosis for Alzheimer's disease was made at the age of 60 years or older, and 47 239 (55.7%) women had been over 80 years of age at diagnosis. Use of systemic hormone therapy was associated with a 9-17% increased risk of Alzheimer's disease. The risk of the disease did not differ significantly between users of estradiol only (odds ratio 1.09, 95% confidence interval 1.05 to 1.14) and those of oestrogen-progestogen (1.17, 1.13 to 1.21). The risk increases in users of oestrogen-progestogen therapy were not related to different progestogens (norethisterone acetate, medroxyprogesterone acetate, or other progestogens); but in women younger than 60 at hormone therapy initiation, these risk increases were associated with hormone therapy exposure over 10 years. Furthermore, the age at initiation of systemic hormone therapy was not a decisive determinant for the increase in risk of Alzheimer's disease. The exclusive use of vaginal estradiol did not affect the risk of the disease (0.99, 0.96 to 1.01). CONCLUSIONS: Long term use of systemic hormone therapy might be accompanied with an overall increased risk of Alzheimer's disease, which is not related to the type of progestogen or the age at initiation of systemic hormone therapy. By contrast, use of vaginal estradiol shows no such risk. Even though the absolute risk increase for Alzheimer's disease is small, our data should be implemented into information for present and future users of hormone therapy. ",
        "Stress related disorders and subsequent risk of life threatening infections: population based sibling controlled cohort study. OBJECTIVE: To assess whether severe psychiatric reactions to trauma and other adversities are associated with subsequent risk of life threatening infections. DESIGN: Population and sibling matched cohort study. SETTING: Swedish population. PARTICIPANTS: 144\u2009919 individuals with stress related disorders (post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), acute stress reaction, adjustment disorder, and other stress reactions) identified from 1987 to 2013 compared with 184\u2009612 full siblings of individuals with a diagnosed stress related disorder and 1\u2009449\u2009190 matched individuals without such a diagnosis from the general population. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: A first inpatient or outpatient visit with a primary diagnosis of severe infections with high mortality rates (ie, sepsis, endocarditis, and meningitis or other central nervous system infections) from the Swedish National Patient Register, and deaths from these infections or infections of any origin from the Cause of Death Register. After controlling for multiple confounders, Cox models were used to estimate hazard ratios of these life threatening infections. RESULTS: The average age at diagnosis of a stress related disorder was 37 years (55\u2009541, 38.3% men). During a mean follow-up of eight years, the incidence of life threatening infections per 1000 person years was 2.9 in individuals with a stress related disorder, 1.7 in siblings without a diagnosis, and 1.3 in matched individuals without a diagnosis. Compared with full siblings without a diagnosis of a stress related disorder, individuals with such a diagnosis were at increased risk of life threatening infections (hazard ratio for any stress related disorder was 1.47 (95% confidence intervals1.37 to 1.58) and for PTSD was 1.92 (1.46 to 2.52)). Corresponding estimates in the population based analysis were similar (1.58 (1.51 to 1.65) for any stress related disorder, P=0.09 for difference between sibling and population based comparison, and 1.95 (1.66 to 2.28) for PTSD, P=0.92 for difference). Stress related disorders were associated with all studied life threatening infections, with the highest relative risk observed for meningitis (sibling based analysis 1.63 (1.23 to 2.16)) and endocarditis (1.57 (1.08 to 2.30)). Younger age at diagnosis of a stress related disorder and the presence of psychiatric comorbidity, especially substance use disorders, were associated with higher hazard ratios, whereas use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors in the first year after diagnosis of a stress related disorder was associated with attenuated hazard ratios. CONCLUSION: In the Swedish population, stress related disorders were associated with a subsequent risk of life threatening infections, after controlling for familial background and physical or psychiatric comorbidities.

        "Risk of prostate cancer for men fathering through assisted reproduction: nationwide population based register study. OBJECTIVE: To compare the risk and severity of prostate cancer between men achieving fatherhood by assisted reproduction and men conceiving naturally. DESIGN: National register based cohort study. SETTING: Sweden from January 1994 to December 2014. PARTICIPANTS: 1\u2009181\u2009490 children born alive in Sweden during 1994-2014 to the same number of fathers. Fathers were grouped according to fertility status by mode of conception: 20\u2009618 by in vitro fertilisation (IVF), 14\u2009882 by intra-cytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI), and 1\u2009145\u2009990 by natural conception. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Prostate cancer diagnosis, age of onset, and androgen deprivation therapy (serving as proxy for advanced or metastatic malignancy). RESULTS: Among men achieving fatherhood by IVF, by ICSI, and by non-assisted means, 77 (0.37%), 63 (0.42%), and 3244 (0.28%), respectively, were diagnosed as having prostate cancer. Mean age at onset was 55.9, 55.1, and 57.1 years, respectively. Men who became fathers through assisted reproduction had a statistically significantly increased risk of prostate cancer compared with men who conceived naturally (hazard ratio 1.64, 95% confidence interval 1.25 to 2.15, for ICSI; 1.33, 1.06 to 1.66, for IVF). They also had an increased risk of early onset disease (that is, diagnosis before age 55 years) (hazard ratio 1.86, 1.25 to 2.77, for ICSI; 1.51, 1.09 to 2.08, for IVF). Fathers who conceived through ICSI and developed prostate cancer received androgen deprivation therapy to at least the same extent as the reference group (odds ratio 1.91; P=0.07). CONCLUSIONS: Men who achieved fatherhood through assisted reproduction techniques, particularly through ICSI, are at increased risk for early onset prostate cancer and thus constitute a risk group in which testing and careful long term follow-up for prostate cancer may be beneficial.

        "Adiposity and risk of decline in glomerular filtration rate: meta-analysis of individual participant data in a global consortium. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the associations between adiposity measures (body mass index, waist circumference, and waist-to-height ratio) with decline in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and with all cause mortality. DESIGN: Individual participant data meta-analysis. SETTING: Cohorts from 40 countries with data collected between 1970 and 2017. PARTICIPANTS: Adults in 39 general population cohorts (n=5\u2009459\u2009014), of which 21 (n=594\u2009496) had data on waist circumference; six cohorts with high cardiovascular risk (n=84\u2009417); and 18 cohorts with chronic kidney disease (n=91\u2009607). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: GFR decline (estimated GFR decline \u226540%, initiation of kidney replacement therapy or estimated GFR <10 mL/min/1.73 m2) and all cause mortality. RESULTS: Over a mean follow-up of eight years, 246\u2009607 (5.6%) individuals in the general population cohorts had GFR decline (18\u2009118 (0.4%) end stage kidney disease events) and 782\u2009329 (14.7%) died. Adjusting for age, sex, race, and current smoking, the hazard ratios for GFR decline comparing body mass indices 30, 35, and 40 with body mass index 25 were 1.18 (95% confidence interval 1.09 to 1.27), 1.69 (1.51 to 1.89), and 2.02 (1.80 to 2.27), respectively. Results were similar in all subgroups of estimated GFR. Associations weakened after adjustment for additional comorbidities, with respective hazard ratios of 1.03 (0.95 to 1.11), 1.28 (1.14 to 1.44), and 1.46 (1.28 to 1.67). The association between body mass index and death was J shaped, with the lowest risk at body mass index of 25. In the cohorts with high cardiovascular risk and chronic kidney disease (mean follow-up of six and four years, respectively), risk associations between higher body mass index and GFR decline were weaker than in the general population, and the association between body mass index and death was also J shaped, with the lowest risk between body mass index 25 and 30. In all cohort types, associations between higher waist circumference and higher waist-to-height ratio with GFR decline were similar to that of body mass index; however, increased risk of death was not associated with lower waist circumference or waist-to-height ratio, as was seen with body mass index. CONCLUSIONS: Elevated body mass index, waist circumference, and waist-to-height ratio are independent risk factors for GFR decline and death in individuals who have normal or reduced levels of estimated GFR.

        "Associations between gabapentinoids and suicidal behaviour, unintentional overdoses, injuries, road traffic incidents, and violent crime: population based cohort study in Sweden. OBJECTIVE: To examine associations between gabapentinoids and adverse outcomes related to coordination disturbances (head or body injuries, or both and road traffic incidents or offences), mental health (suicidal behaviour, unintentional overdoses), and criminality. DESIGN: Population based cohort study. SETTING: High quality prescription, patient, death, and crime registers, Sweden. PARTICIPANTS: 191\u2009973 people from the Swedish Prescribed Drug Register who collected prescriptions for gabapentinoids (pregabalin or gabapentin) during 2006 to 2013. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcomes were suicidal behaviour, unintentional overdoses, head/body injuries, road traffic incidents and offences, and arrests for violent crime. Stratified Cox proportional hazards regression was conducted comparing treatment periods with non-treatment periods within an individual. Participants served as their own control, thus accounting for time invariant factors (eg, genetic and historical factors), and reducing confounding by indication. Additional adjustments were made by age, sex, comorbidities, substance use, and use of other antiepileptics. RESULTS: During the study period, 10\u2009026 (5.2%) participants were treated for suicidal behaviour or died from suicide, 17\u2009144 (8.9%) experienced an unintentional overdose, 12\u2009070 (6.3%) had a road traffic incident or offence, 70\u2009522 (36.7%) presented with head/body injuries, and 7984 (4.1%) were arrested for a violent crime. In within-individual analyses, gabapentinoid treatment was associated with increased hazards of suicidal behaviour and deaths from suicide (age adjusted hazard ratio 1.26, 95% confidence interval 1.20 to 1.32), unintentional overdoses (1.24, 1.19 to 1.28), head/body injuries (1.22, 1.19 to 1.25), and road traffic incidents and offences (1.13, 1.06 to 1.20). Associations with arrests for violent crime were less clear (1.04, 0.98 to 1.11). When the drugs were examined separately, pregabalin was associated with increased hazards of all outcomes, whereas gabapentin was associated with decreased or no statistically significant hazards. When stratifying on age, increased hazards of all outcomes were associated with participants aged 15 to 24 years. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that gabapentinoids are associated with an increased risk of suicidal behaviour, unintentional overdoses, head/body injuries, and road traffic incidents and offences. Pregabalin was associated with higher hazards of these outcomes than gabapentin. ",
        "Physician mothers' experience of workplace discrimination: a qualitative analysis. OBJECTIVES: To report woman physicians' experiences, in their own words, of discrimination based on their role as a mother. DESIGN: Qualitative analysis of physician mothers' free-text responses to the open question: \"We want to hear your story and experience. Please share\" included in questions about workplace discrimination. Three analysts iteratively formulated a structured codebook, then applied codes after inter-coder reliability scores indicated high concordance. The relationships among themes and sub-themes were organized into a conceptual model illustrated by exemplary quotes. PARTICIPANTS: Respondents to an anonymous, voluntary online survey about the health and wellbeing of physician mothers posted on a Facebook group, the Physician Moms Group, an online community of US physicians who identify as mothers. RESULTS: We analyzed 947 free-text responses. Participants provide diverse and vivid descriptions of experiences of maternal discrimination. Gendered job expectations, financial inequalities (including lower pay than equally qualified colleagues and more unpaid work), limited opportunities for advancement, lack of support during the pregnancy and postpartum period, and challenging work-life balance are some of the key themes identified. In addition, participants' quotes show several potential structural drivers of maternal discrimination and describe the downstream consequences of maternal discrimination on the physician herself, her career, family, and the healthcare system. CONCLUSIONS: These findings provide a view of maternal discrimination directly from the perspective of those who experience it. Women physicians report a range of previously uncharacterized ways in which they experience maternal discrimination. While certain aspects of these experiences are consistent with those reported by women across other professions, there are unique aspects of medical training and the medical profession that perpetuate maternal discrimination.

        "Association of residency work hour reform with long term quality and costs of care of US physicians: observational study. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether 30 day mortality, 30 day readmissions, and inpatient spending vary according to whether physicians were exposed to work hour reforms during their residency. DESIGN: Retrospective observational study. SETTING: US Medicare. PARTICIPANTS: 20% random sample (n=485\u2009685) of Medicare beneficiaries aged 65 years or more admitted to hospital and treated by a general internist during 2000-12. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: 30 day mortality, 30 day readmissions, and inpatient Medicare Part B spending among patients treated by first year internists who were fully exposed to the 2003 Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) work hour reforms during their residency (completed residency after 2006) compared with first year internists with partial or no exposure to reforms (completed residency before 2006). Senior internists not exposed to reforms during their residency served as a control group (10th year internists) for general trends in hospital care: a difference-in-difference analysis. RESULTS: Exposure of physicians to work hour reforms during their residency was not associated with statistically significant differences in 30 day mortality, 30 day readmissions, or inpatient spending. Among 485\u2009685 hospital admissions, 30 day mortality rates during 2000-06 and 2007-12 for patients of first year internists were 10.6% (12\u2009567 deaths/118\u2009014 hospital admissions) and 9.6% (13\u2009521/140\u2009529), respectively, and for 10th year internists were 11.2% (11\u2009018/98\u2009811) and 10.6% (13\u2009602/128\u2009331), for an adjusted difference-in-difference effect of -0.1 percentage points (95% confidence interval -0.8% to 0.6%, P=0.68). 30 day readmission rates for first year internists during 2000-06 and 2007-12 were 20.4% (24\u2009074/118\u2009014) and 20.4% (28\u2009689/140\u2009529), respectively, and for 10th year internists were 20.1% (19\u2009840/98\u2009811) and 20.5% (26\u2009277/128\u2009331), for an adjusted difference-in-difference effect of 0.1 percentage points (-0.9% to 1.1%, P=0.87). Medicare Part B inpatient spending for first year internists during 2000-06 and 2007-12 was $1161 (\u00a3911; \u20ac1024) and $1267 per hospital admission, respectively, and for 10th year internists was $1331 and $1599, for an adjusted difference-in-difference effect of -$46 (95% confidence interval -$94 to $2, P=0.06). CONCLUSIONS: Exposure of internists to work hour reforms during their residency was not associated with post-training differences in patient mortality, readmissions, or costs of care. ",
        "Political events and mood among young physicians: a prospective cohort study. OBJECTIVE: To study the effects of recent political events on mood among young physicians. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: United States medical centres. PARTICIPANTS: 2345 medical interns provided longitudinal mood data as part of the Intern Health Study between 2016 and 2018. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Mean mood score during the week following influential political and non-political events as compared with mean mood during the preceding four week control period. RESULTS: We identified nine political events and eight non-political events for analysis. With the start of internship duties in July, the mean decline in mood for interns was -0.30 (95% confidence interval -0.33 to -0.27, t=-17.45, P<0.001). The decline in mood was of similar magnitude following the 2016 presidential election (mean mood change -0.32, 95% confidence interval -0.45 to -0.19, t=-4.73, P<0.001) and subsequent inauguration (mean mood change -0.25, 95% confidence interval -0.37 to -0.12, t=-3.93, P<0.001). Further, compared with men, women reported greater mood declines after both the 2016 election (mean gender difference 0.31, 95% confidence interval 0.05 to 0.58, t=2.33, P=0.02) and the inauguration (mean gender difference 0.25, 95% confidence interval 0.01 to 0.49, t=2.05, P=0.04). Overall, there were statistically significant changes in mood following 66.7% (6/9) of political events assessed. In contrast, none of the non-political events included in the analysis were statistically significantly associated with a change in mood. CONCLUSIONS: Macro level factors such as politics may be correlated with the mood of young doctors. This finding signals the need for further evaluation of the consequences of increasing entanglement between politics and medicine moving forward for young physicians and their patients. ",
        "Data sharing practices of medicines related apps and the mobile ecosystem: traffic, content, and network analysis. OBJECTIVES: To investigate whether and how user data are shared by top rated medicines related mobile applications (apps) and to characterise privacy risks to app users, both clinicians and consumers. DESIGN: Traffic, content, and network analysis. SETTING: Top rated medicines related apps for the Android mobile platform available in the Medical store category of Google Play in the United Kingdom, United States, Canada, and Australia. PARTICIPANTS: 24 of 821 apps identified by an app store crawling program. Included apps pertained to medicines information, dispensing, administration, prescribing, or use, and were interactive. INTERVENTIONS: Laboratory based traffic analysis of each app downloaded onto a smartphone, simulating real world use with four dummy scripts. The app's baseline traffic related to 28 different types of user data was observed. To identify privacy leaks, one source of user data was modified and deviations in the resulting traffic observed. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Identities and characterisation of entities directly receiving user data from sampled apps. Secondary content analysis of company websites and privacy policies identified data recipients' main activities; network analysis characterised their data sharing relations. RESULTS: 19/24 (79%) of sampled apps shared user data. 55 unique entities, owned by 46 parent companies, received or processed app user data, including developers and parent companies (first parties) and service providers (third parties). 18 (33%) provided infrastructure related services such as cloud services. 37 (67%) provided services related to the collection and analysis of user data, including analytics or advertising, suggesting heightened privacy risks. Network analysis revealed that first and third parties received a median of 3 (interquartile range 1-6, range 1-24) unique transmissions of user data. Third parties advertised the ability to share user data with 216 \"fourth parties\"; within this network (n=237), entities had access to a median of 3 (interquartile range 1-11, range 1-140) unique transmissions of user data. Several companies occupied central positions within the network with the ability to aggregate and re-identify user data. CONCLUSIONS: Sharing of user data is routine, yet far from transparent. Clinicians should be conscious of privacy risks in their own use of apps and, when recommending apps, explain the potential for loss of privacy as part of informed consent. Privacy regulation should emphasise the accountabilities of those who control and process user data. Developers should disclose all data sharing practices and allow users to choose precisely what data are shared and with whom. ",
        "Association of early postnatal transfer and birth outside a tertiary hospital with mortality and severe brain injury in extremely preterm infants: observational cohort study with propensity score matching. OBJECTIVE: To determine if postnatal transfer or birth in a non-tertiary hospital is associated with adverse outcomes. DESIGN: Observational cohort study with propensity score matching. SETTING: National health service neonatal care in England; population data held in the National Neonatal Research Database. PARTICIPANTS: Extremely preterm infants born at less than 28 gestational weeks between 2008 and 2015 (n=17\u2009577) grouped based on birth hospital and transfer within 48 hours of birth: upward transfer (non-tertiary to tertiary hospital, n=2158), non-tertiary care (born in non-tertiary hospital; not transferred, n=2668), and controls (born in tertiary hospital; not transferred, n=10\u2009866). Infants were matched on propensity scores and predefined background variables to form subgroups with near identical distributions of confounders. Infants transferred between tertiary hospitals (horizontal transfer) were separately matched to controls in a 1:5 ratio. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Death, severe brain injury, and survival without severe brain injury. RESULTS: 2181 infants, 727 from each group (upward transfer, non-tertiary care, and control) were well matched. Compared with controls, infants in the upward transfer group had no significant difference in the odds of death before discharge (odds ratio 1.22, 95% confidence interval 0.92 to 1.61) but significantly higher odds of severe brain injury (2.32, 1.78 to 3.06; number needed to treat (NNT) 8) and significantly lower odds of survival without severe brain injury (0.60, 0.47 to 0.76; NNT 9). Compared with controls, infants in the non-tertiary care group had significantly higher odds of death (1.34, 1.02 to 1.77; NNT 20) but no significant difference in the odds of severe brain injury (0.95, 0.70 to 1.30) or survival without severe brain injury (0.82, 0.64 to 1.05). Compared with infants in the upward transfer group, infants in the non-tertiary care group had no significant difference in death before discharge (1.10, 0.84 to 1.44) but significantly lower odds of severe brain injury (0.41, 0.31 to 0.53; NNT 8) and significantly higher odds of survival without severe brain injury (1.37, 1.09 to 1.73; NNT 14). No significant differences were found in outcomes between the horizontal transfer group (n=305) and controls (n=1525). CONCLUSIONS: In extremely preterm infants, birth in a non-tertiary hospital and transfer within 48 hours are associated with poor outcomes when compared with birth in a tertiary setting. We recommend perinatal services promote pathways that facilitate delivery of extremely preterm infants in tertiary hospitals in preference to postnatal transfer. ",
        "Induction of labour at 41 weeks versus expectant management until 42 weeks (INDEX): multicentre, randomised non-inferiority trial. OBJECTIVE: To compare induction of labour at 41 weeks with expectant management until 42 weeks in low risk women. DESIGN: Open label, randomised controlled non-inferiority trial. SETTING: 123 primary care midwifery practices and 45 hospitals (secondary care) in the Netherlands, 2012-16. PARTICIPANTS: 1801 low risk women with an uncomplicated singleton pregnancy: randomised to induction (n=900) or to expectant management until 42 weeks (n=901). INTERVENTIONS: Induction at 41 weeks or expectant management until 42 weeks with induction if necessary. PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcome was a composite of perinatal mortality and neonatal morbidity (Apgar score <7 at five minutes, arterial pH <7.05, meconium aspiration syndrome, plexus brachialis injury, intracranial haemorrhage, and admission to a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Secondary outcomes included maternal outcomes and mode of delivery. The null hypothesis that expectant management is inferior to induction was tested with a non-inferiority margin of 2%. RESULTS: Median gestational age at delivery was 41 weeks+0 days (interquartile range 41 weeks+0 days-41 weeks+1 day) for the induction group and 41 weeks+2 days (41 weeks+0 days-41 weeks+5 days) for the expectant management group. The primary outcome was analysed for both the intention-to-treat population and the per protocol population. In the induction group, 15/900 (1.7%) women had an adverse perinatal outcome versus 28/901 (3.1%) in the expectant management group (absolute risk difference -1.4%, 95% confidence interval -2.9% to 0.0%, P=0.22 for non-inferiority). 11 (1.2%) infants in the induction group and 23 (2.6%) in the expectant management group had an Apgar score <7 at five minutes (relative risk (RR) 0.48, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.98). No infants in the induction group and three (0.3%) in the expectant management group had an Apgar score <4 at five minutes. One fetal death (0.1%) occurred in the induction group and two (0.2%) in the expectant management group. No neonatal deaths occurred. 3 (0.3%) neonates in the induction group versus 8 (0.9%) in the expectant management group were admitted to an NICU (RR 0.38, 95% CI 0.10 to 1.41). No significant difference was found in composite adverse maternal outcomes (induction n=122 (13.6%) v expectant management n=102 (11.3%)) or in caesarean section rate (both groups n=97 (10.8%)). CONCLUSIONS: This study could not show non-inferiority of expectant management compared with induction of labour in women with uncomplicated pregnancies at 41 weeks; instead a significant difference of 1.4% was found for risk of adverse perinatal outcomes in favour of induction, although the chances of a good perinatal outcome were high with both strategies and the incidence of perinatal mortality, Apgar score <4 at five minutes, and NICU admission low.

        "Pre-eclampsia and risk of dementia later in life: nationwide cohort study. OBJECTIVE: To explore associations between pre-eclampsia and later dementia, overall and by dementia subtype and timing of onset. DESIGN: Nationwide register based cohort study. SETTING: Denmark. POPULATION: All women with at least one live birth or stillbirth between 1978 and 2015. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Hazard ratios comparing dementia rates among women with and without a history of pre-eclampsia, estimated using Cox regression. RESULTS: The cohort consisted of 1\u2009178\u2009005 women with 20\u2009352\u2009695 person years of follow-up. Women with a history of pre-eclampsia had more than three times the risk of vascular dementia (hazard ratio 3.46, 95% confidence interval 1.97 to 6.10) later in life, compared with women with no history of pre-eclampsia. The association with vascular dementia seemed to be stronger for late onset disease (hazard ratio 6.53, 2.82 to 15.1) than for early onset disease (2.32, 1.06 to 5.06) (P=0.08). Adjustment for diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease attenuated the hazard ratios only moderately; sensitivity analyses suggested that body mass index was unlikely to explain the association with vascular dementia. In contrast, only modest associations were observed for Alzheimer's disease (hazard ratio 1.45, 1.05 to 1.99) and other/unspecified dementia (1.40, 1.08 to 1.83). CONCLUSIONS: Pre-eclampsia was associated with an increased risk of dementia, particularly vascular dementia. Cardiovascular disease, hypertension, and diabetes were unlikely to mediate the associations substantially, suggesting that pre-eclampsia and vascular dementia may share underlying mechanisms or susceptibility pathways. Asking about a history of pre-eclampsia could help physicians to identify women who might benefit from screening for early signs of disease, allowing for early clinical intervention. ",
        "Maternal diabetes during pregnancy and early onset of cardiovascular disease in offspring: population based cohort study with 40 years of follow-up. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the associations between maternal diabetes diagnosed before or during pregnancy and early onset cardiovascular disease (CVD) in offspring during their first four decades of life. DESIGN: Population based cohort study. SETTING: Danish national health registries. PARTICIPANTS: All 2 432 000 liveborn children without congenital heart disease in Denmark during 1977-2016. Follow-up began at birth and continued until first time diagnosis of CVD, death, emigration, or 31 December 2016, whichever came first. EXPOSURES FOR OBSERVATIONAL STUDIES: Pregestational diabetes, including type 1 diabetes (n=22 055) and type 2 diabetes (n=6537), and gestational diabetes (n=26 272). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was early onset CVD (excluding congenital heart diseases) defined by hospital diagnosis. Associations between maternal diabetes and risks of early onset CVD in offspring were studied. Cox regression was used to assess whether a maternal history of CVD or maternal diabetic complications affected these associations. Adjustments were made for calendar year, sex, singleton status, maternal factors (parity, age, smoking, education, cohabitation, residence at childbirth, history of CVD before childbirth), and paternal history of CVD before childbirth. The cumulative incidence was averaged across all individuals, and factors were adjusted while treating deaths from causes other than CVD as competing events. RESULTS: During up to 40 years of follow-up, 1153 offspring of mothers with diabetes and 91 311 offspring of mothers who did not have diabetes were diagnosed with CVD. Offspring of mothers with diabetes had a 29% increased overall rate of early onset CVD (hazard ratio 1.29 (95% confidence interval 1.21 to 1.37); cumulative incidence among offspring unexposed to maternal diabetes at 40 years of age 13.07% (12.92% to 13.21%), difference in cumulative incidence between exposed and unexposed offspring 4.72% (2.37% to 7.06%)). The sibship design yielded results similar to those of the unpaired design based on the whole cohort. Both pregestational diabetes (1.34 (1.25 to 1.43)) and gestational diabetes (1.19 (1.07 to 1.32)) were associated with increased rates of CVD in offspring. We also observed varied increased rates of specific early onset CVDs, particularly heart failure (1.45 (0.89 to 2.35)), hypertensive disease (1.78 (1.50 to 2.11)), deep vein thrombosis (1.82 (1.38 to 2.41)), and pulmonary embolism (1.91 (1.31 to 2.80)). Increased rates of CVD were seen in different age groups from childhood to early adulthood until age 40 years. The increased rates were more pronounced among offspring of mothers with diabetic complications (1.60 (1.25 to 2.05)). A higher incidence of early onset CVD in offspring of mothers with diabetes and comorbid CVD (1.73 (1.36 to 2.20)) was associated with the added influence of comorbid CVD but not due to the interaction between diabetes and CVD on the multiplicative scale (P value for interaction 0.94). CONCLUSIONS: Children of mothers with diabetes, especially those mothers with a history of CVD or diabetic complications, have increased rates of early onset CVD from childhood to early adulthood. If maternal diabetes does have a causal association with increased CVD rate in offspring, the prevention, screening, and treatment of diabetes in women of childbearing age could help to reduce the risk of CVD in the next generation.

        "Induction of labour at 41 weeks versus expectant management and induction of labour at 42 weeks (SWEdish Post-term Induction Study, SWEPIS): multicentre, open label, randomised, superiority trial. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate if induction of labour at 41 weeks improves perinatal and maternal outcomes in women with a low risk pregnancy compared with expectant management and induction of labour at 42 weeks. DESIGN: Multicentre, open label, randomised controlled superiority trial. SETTING: 14 hospitals in Sweden, 2016-18. PARTICIPANTS: 2760 women with a low risk uncomplicated singleton pregnancy randomised (1:1) by the Swedish Pregnancy Register. 1381 women were assigned to the induction group and 1379 were assigned to the expectant management group. INTERVENTIONS: Induction of labour at 41 weeks and expectant management and induction of labour at 42 weeks. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was a composite perinatal outcome including one or more of stillbirth, neonatal mortality, Apgar score less than 7 at five minutes, pH less than 7.00 or metabolic acidosis (pH <7.05 and base deficit >12 mmol/L) in the umbilical artery, hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy, intracranial haemorrhage, convulsions, meconium aspiration syndrome, mechanical ventilation within 72 hours, or obstetric brachial plexus injury. Primary analysis was by intention to treat. RESULTS: The study was stopped early owing to a significantly higher rate of perinatal mortality in the expectant management group. The composite primary perinatal outcome did not differ between the groups: 2.4% (33/1381) in the induction group and 2.2% (31/1379) in the expectant management group (relative risk 1.06, 95% confidence interval 0.65 to 1.73; P=0.90). No perinatal deaths occurred in the induction group but six (five stillbirths and one early neonatal death) occurred in the expectant management group (P=0.03). The proportion of caesarean delivery, instrumental vaginal delivery, or any major maternal morbidity did not differ between the groups. CONCLUSIONS: This study comparing induction of labour at 41 weeks with expectant management and induction at 42 weeks does not show any significant difference in the primary composite adverse perinatal outcome. However, a reduction of the secondary outcome perinatal mortality is observed without increasing adverse maternal outcomes. Although these results should be interpreted cautiously, induction of labour ought to be offered to women no later than at 41 weeks and could be one (of few) interventions that reduces the rate of stillbirths.

        "Bend it like Beckham or fix them like Florence-proportional representation of healthcare in New Year honours: an observational study. OBJECTIVES: To compare the proportional representation of healthcare workers in receipt of New Year honours (NYHs) with workers in other industries and to determine whether the NYH system has gender or geographical biases. DESIGN: Observational study of the UK honours system with a comparative analysis of proportional representation of the UK workforce and subgroup analyses of gender and geographical representations. PARTICIPANTS: Recipients of NYHs from 2009 to 2018. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Absolute risk of receiving an NYH based on industry, gender, or region of the UK. Relative risk of receiving an NYH for services to healthcare compared with other industries. RESULTS: 10\u2009989 NYHs were bestowed from 2009 to 2018, 47% of which were awarded to women. 832 awards (7.6%) were for services to healthcare. People working in sport and in the arts and media were more likely to receive NYHs than those working in healthcare (relative risks of 22.01 (95% confidence interval 19.91 to 24.34) and 5.84 (5.31 to 6.44), respectively). There was no significant difference between the rate of receiving honours for healthcare and for science and technology (P=0.22). 34% (3741) of awards were issued to people living in London and in the southeast of England, and only 496 of 1447 (34%) higher order awards (knighthoods, damehoods, companions of honour, and commanders of the order of the British empire) were received by women. CONCLUSIONS: In relation to the size of its workforce, a career in healthcare is not as \"honourable\" as careers in certain other industries. Geographical and gender biases might exist in the honours system. ",
        "Subacromial decompression surgery for adults with shoulder pain: a clinical practice guideline. CLINICAL QUESTION: Do adults with atraumatic shoulder pain for more than 3 months diagnosed as subacromial pain syndrome (SAPS), also labelled as rotator cuff disease, benefit from subacromial decompression surgery? This guideline builds on to two recent high quality trials of shoulder surgery. CURRENT PRACTICE: SAPS is the common diagnosis for shoulder pain with several first line treatment options, including analgesia, exercises, and injections. Surgeons frequently perform arthroscopic subacromial decompression for prolonged symptoms, with guidelines providing conflicting recommendations. RECOMMENDATION: The guideline panel makes a strong recommendation against surgery. HOW THIS GUIDELINE WAS CREATED: A guideline panel including patients, clinicians, and methodologists produced this recommendation in adherence with standards for trustworthy guidelines and the GRADE system. The recommendation is based on two linked systematic reviews on (a) the benefits and harms of subacromial decompression surgery and (b) the minimally important differences for patient reported outcome measures. Recommendations are made actionable for clinicians and their patients through visual overviews. These provide the relative and absolute benefits and harms of surgery in multilayered evidence summaries and decision aids available in MAGIC (www.magicapp.org) to support shared decisions and adaptation. THE EVIDENCE: Surgery did not provide important improvements in pain, function, or quality of life compared with placebo surgery or other options. Frozen shoulder may be more common with surgery. UNDERSTANDING THE RECOMMENDATION: The panel concluded that almost all informed patients would choose to avoid surgery because there is no benefit but there are harms and it is burdensome. Subacromial decompression surgery should not be offered to patients with SAPS. However, there is substantial uncertainty in what alternative treatment is best. ",
        "Dose-response associations between accelerometry measured physical activity and sedentary time and all cause mortality: systematic review and harmonised meta-analysis. OBJECTIVE: To examine the dose-response associations between accelerometer assessed total physical activity, different intensities of physical activity, and sedentary time and all cause mortality. DESIGN: Systematic review and harmonised meta-analysis. DATA SOURCES: PubMed, PsycINFO, Embase, Web of Science, Sport Discus from inception to 31 July 2018. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Prospective cohort studies assessing physical activity and sedentary time by accelerometry and associations with all cause mortality and reported effect estimates as hazard ratios, odds ratios, or relative risks with 95% confidence intervals. DATA EXTRACTION AND ANALYSIS: Guidelines for meta-analyses and systematic reviews for observational studies and PRISMA guidelines were followed. Two authors independently screened the titles and abstracts. One author performed a full text review and another extracted the data. Two authors independently assessed the risk of bias. Individual level participant data were harmonised and analysed at study level. Data on physical activity were categorised by quarters at study level, and study specific associations with all cause mortality were analysed using Cox proportional hazards regression analyses. Study specific results were summarised using random effects meta-analysis. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: All cause mortality. RESULTS: 39 studies were retrieved for full text review; 10 were eligible for inclusion, three were excluded owing to harmonisation challenges (eg, wrist placement of the accelerometer), and one study did not participate. Two additional studies with unpublished mortality data were also included. Thus, individual level data from eight studies (n=36\u2009383; mean age 62.6 years; 72.8% women), with median follow-up of 5.8 years (range 3.0-14.5 years) and 2149 (5.9%) deaths were analysed. Any physical activity, regardless of intensity, was associated with lower risk of mortality, with a non-linear dose-response. Hazards ratios for mortality were 1.00 (referent) in the first quarter (least active), 0.48 (95% confidence interval 0.43 to 0.54) in the second quarter, 0.34 (0.26 to 0.45) in the third quarter, and 0.27 (0.23 to 0.32) in the fourth quarter (most active). Corresponding hazards ratios for light physical activity were 1.00, 0.60 (0.54 to 0.68), 0.44 (0.38 to 0.51), and 0.38 (0.28 to 0.51), and for moderate-to-vigorous physical activity were 1.00, 0.64 (0.55 to 0.74), 0.55 (0.40 to 0.74), and 0.52 (0.43 to 0.61). For sedentary time, hazards ratios were 1.00 (referent; least sedentary), 1.28 (1.09 to 1.51), 1.71 (1.36 to 2.15), and 2.63 (1.94 to 3.56). CONCLUSION: Higher levels of total physical activity, at any intensity, and less time spent sedentary, are associated with substantially reduced risk for premature mortality, with evidence of a non-linear dose-response pattern in middle aged and older adults.

        "Operative treatment versus nonoperative treatment of Achilles tendon ruptures: systematic review and meta-analysis. OBJECTIVES: To compare re-rupture rate, complication rate, and functional outcome after operative versus nonoperative treatment of Achilles tendon ruptures; to compare re-rupture rate after early and late full weight bearing; to evaluate re-rupture rate after functional rehabilitation with early range of motion; and to compare effect estimates from randomised controlled trials and observational studies. DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis. DATA SOURCES: PubMed/Medline, Embase, CENTRAL, and CINAHL databases were last searched on 25 April 2018 for studies comparing operative versus nonoperative treatment of Achilles tendon ruptures. STUDY SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials and observational studies reporting on comparison of operative versus nonoperative treatment of acute Achilles tendon ruptures. DATA EXTRACTION: Data extraction was performed independently in pairs, by four reviewers, with the use of a predefined data extraction file. Outcomes were pooled using random effects models and presented as risk difference, risk ratio, or mean difference, with 95% confidence interval. RESULTS: 29 studies were included-10 randomised controlled trials and 19 observational studies. The 10 trials included 944 (6%) patients, and the 19 observational studies included 14\u2009918 (94%) patients. A significant reduction in re-ruptures was seen after operative treatment (2.3%) compared with nonoperative treatment (3.9%) (risk difference 1.6%; risk ratio 0.43, 95% confidence interval 0.31 to 0.60; P<0.001; I2=22%). Operative treatment resulted in a significantly higher complication rate than nonoperative treatment (4.9% v 1.6%; risk difference 3.3%; risk ratio 2.76, 1.84 to 4.13; P<0.001; I2=45%). The main difference in complication rate was attributable to the incidence of infection (2.8%) in the operative group. A similar reduction in re-rupture rate in favour of operative treatment was seen after both early and late full weight bearing. No significant difference in re-rupture rate was seen between operative and nonoperative treatment in studies that used accelerated functional rehabilitation with early range of motion (risk ratio 0.60, 0.26 to 1.37; P=0.23; I2=0%). No difference in effect estimates was seen between randomised controlled trials and observational studies. CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis shows that operative treatment of Achilles tendon ruptures reduces the risk of re-rupture compared with nonoperative treatment. However, re-rupture rates are low and differences between treatment groups are small (risk difference 1.6%). Operative treatment results in a higher risk of other complications (risk difference 3.3%). The final decision on the management of acute Achilles tendon ruptures should be based on patient specific factors and shared decision making. This review emphasises the potential benefits of adding high quality observational studies in meta-analyses for the evaluation of objective outcome measures after surgical treatment. ",
        "Association between intake of non-sugar sweeteners and health outcomes: systematic review and meta-analyses of randomised and non-randomised controlled trials and observational studies. OBJECTIVE: To assess the association between intake of non-sugar sweeteners (NSS) and important health outcomes in generally healthy or overweight/obese adults and children. DESIGN: Systematic review following standard Cochrane review methodology. DATA SOURCES: Medline (Ovid), Embase, Cochrane CENTRAL, WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, Clinicaltrials.gov, and reference lists of relevant publications. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR SELECTING STUDIES: Studies including generally healthy adults or children with or without overweight or obesity were eligible. Included study designs allowed for a direct comparison of no intake or lower intake of NSS with higher NSS intake. NSSs had to be clearly named, the dose had to be within the acceptable daily intake, and the intervention duration had to be at least seven days. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Body weight or body mass index, glycaemic control, oral health, eating behaviour, preference for sweet taste, cancer, cardiovascular disease, kidney disease, mood, behaviour, neurocognition, and adverse effects. RESULTS: The search resulted in 13\u2009941 unique records. Of 56 individual studies that provided data for this review, 35 were observational studies. In adults, evidence of very low and low certainty from a limited number of small studies indicated a small beneficial effect of NSSs on body mass index (mean difference -0.6, 95% confidence interval -1.19 to -0.01; two studies, n=174) and fasting blood glucose (-0.16 mmol/L, -0.26 to -0.06; two, n=52). Lower doses of NSSs were associated with lower weight gain (-0.09 kg, -0.13 to -0.05; one, n=17\u2009934) compared with higher doses of NSSs (very low certainty of evidence). For all other outcomes, no differences were detected between the use and non-use of NSSs, or between different doses of NSSs. No evidence of any effect of NSSs was seen on overweight or obese adults or children actively trying to lose weight (very low to moderate certainty). In children, a smaller increase in body mass index z score was observed with NSS intake compared with sugar intake (-0.15, -0.17 to -0.12; two, n=528, moderate certainty of evidence), but no significant differences were observed in body weight (-0.60 kg, -1.33 to 0.14; two, n=467, low certainty of evidence), or between different doses of NSSs (very low to moderate certainty). CONCLUSIONS: Most health outcomes did not seem to have differences between the NSS exposed and unexposed groups. Of the few studies identified for each outcome, most had few participants, were of short duration, and their methodological and reporting quality was limited; therefore, confidence in the reported results is limited. Future studies should assess the effects of NSSs with an appropriate intervention duration. Detailed descriptions of interventions, comparators, and outcomes should be included in all reports.

        "The art of life and death: 14 year follow-up analyses of associations between arts engagement and mortality in the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing. OBJECTIVE: To explore associations between different frequencies of arts engagement and mortality over a 14 year follow-up period. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. PARTICIPANTS: English Longitudinal Study of Ageing cohort of 6710 community dwelling adults aged 50 years and older (53.6% women, average age 65.9 years, standard deviation 9.4) who provided baseline data in 2004-05. INTERVENTION: Self reported receptive arts engagement (going to museums, art galleries, exhibitions, the theatre, concerts, or the opera). MEASUREMENT: Mortality measured through data linkage to the National Health Service central register. RESULTS: People who engaged with receptive arts activities on an infrequent basis (once or twice a year) had a 14% lower risk of dying at any point during the follow-up (809/3042 deaths, hazard ratio 0.86, 95% confidence interval 0.77 to 0.96) compared with those who never engaged (837/1762 deaths). People who engaged with receptive arts activities on a frequent basis (every few months or more) had a 31% lower risk of dying (355/1906 deaths, 0.69, 0.59 to 0.80), independent of demographic, socioeconomic, health related, behavioural, and social factors. Results were robust to a range of sensitivity analyses with no evidence of moderation by sex, socioeconomic status, or social factors. This study was observational and so causality cannot be assumed. CONCLUSIONS: Receptive arts engagement could have a protective association with longevity in older adults. This association might be partly explained by differences in cognition, mental health, and physical activity among those who do and do not engage in the arts, but remains even when the model is adjusted for these factors.

        "Prevalence of vaping and smoking among adolescents in Canada, England, and the United States: repeat national cross sectional surveys. OBJECTIVE: To examine differences in vaping and smoking prevalence among adolescents in Canada, England, and the United States. DESIGN: Repeat cross sectional surveys. SETTING: Online surveys in Canada, England, and the US. PARTICIPANTS: National samples of 16 to 19 year olds in 2017 and 2018, recruited from commercial panels in Canada (n=7891), England (n=7897), and the US (n=8140). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Prevalence of vaping and smoking was assessed for use ever, in the past 30 days, in the past week, and on 15 days or more in the past month. Use of JUUL (a nicotine salt based electronic cigarette with high nicotine concentration) and usual vaping brands were also assessed. Logistic regression models examined differences in vaping and smoking between countries and over time. RESULTS: The prevalence of vaping in the past 30 days, in the past week, and on 15 days or more in the past month increased in Canada and the US between 2017 and 2018 (P<0.001 for all), including among non-smokers and experimental smokers, with no changes in England. Smoking prevalence increased in Canada (P<0.001 for all measures), with modest increases in England, and no changes in the US. The percentage of ever vapers who reported more frequent vaping increased in Canada and the US (P<0.01 for all), but not in England. The use of JUUL increased in all countries, particularly the US and Canada-for example, the proportion of current vapers in the US citing JUUL as their usual brand increased threefold between 2017 and 2018. CONCLUSIONS: Between 2017 and 2018, among 16 to 19 year olds the prevalence of vaping increased in Canada and the US, as did smoking in Canada, with little change in England. The rapidly evolving vaping market and emergence of nicotine salt based products warrant close monitoring. ",
        "Prevalence of cervical disease at age 20 after immunisation with bivalent HPV vaccine at age 12-13 in Scotland: retrospective population study. OBJECTIVE: To quantify the effect on cervical disease at age 20 years of immunisation with bivalent human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine at age 12-13 years. DESIGN: Retrospective population study, 1988-96. SETTING: National vaccination and cervical screening programmes in Scotland. PARTICIPANTS: 138\u2009692 women born between 1 January 1988 and 5 June 1996 and who had a smear test result recorded at age 20. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Effect of vaccination on cytology results and associated histological diagnoses from first year of screening (while aged 20), calculated using logistic regression. RESULTS: 138\u2009692 records were retrieved. Compared with unvaccinated women born in 1988, vaccinated women born in 1995 and 1996 showed an 89% reduction (95% confidence interval 81% to 94%) in prevalent cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) grade 3 or worse (from 0.59% (0.48% to 0.71%) to 0.06% (0.04% to 0.11%)), an 88% reduction (83% to 92%) in CIN grade 2 or worse (from 1.44% (1.28% to 1.63%) to 0.17% (0.12% to 0.24%)), and a 79% reduction (69% to 86%) in CIN grade 1 (from 0.69% (0.58% to 0.63%) to 0.15% (0.10% to 0.21%)). Younger age at immunisation was associated with increasing vaccine effectiveness: 86% (75% to 92%) for CIN grade 3 or worse for women vaccinated at age 12-13 compared with 51% (28% to 66%) for women vaccinated at age 17. Evidence of herd protection against high grade cervical disease was found in unvaccinated girls in the 1995 and 1996 cohorts. CONCLUSIONS: Routine vaccination of girls aged 12-13 years with the bivalent HPV vaccine in Scotland has led to a dramatic reduction in preinvasive cervical disease. Evidence of clinically relevant herd protection is apparent in unvaccinated women. These data are consistent with the reduced prevalence of high risk HPV in Scotland. The bivalent vaccine is confirmed as being highly effective vaccine and should greatly reduce the incidence of cervical cancer. The findings will need to be considered by cervical cancer prevention programmes worldwide. ",

OBJECTIVES: To compare the effectiveness and safety of surgical interventions for women with stress urinary incontinence. DESIGN: Systematic review and network meta-analysis. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR SELECTING STUDIES: Randomised controlled trials evaluating surgical interventions for the treatment of stress urinary incontinence in women. METHODS: Identification of relevant randomised controlled trials from Cochrane reviews and the Cochrane Incontinence Specialised Register (searched May 2017), which contains trials identified from the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Medline, Medline In-Process, Medline Epub Ahead of Print, CINAHL, ClinicalTrials.gov, and WHO ICTRP. The reference lists of relevant articles were also searched. Primary outcomes were \"cure\" and \"improvement\" at 12 months, analysed by means of network meta-analyses, with results presented as the surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA). Adverse events were analysed using pairwise meta-analyses. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. The quality of evidence for network meta-analysis was assessed using the GRADE approach. RESULTS: 175 randomised controlled trials assessing a total of 21\u2009598 women were included. Most studies had high or unclear risk across all risk of bias domains. Network meta-analyses were based on data from 105 trials that reported cure and 120 trials that reported improvement of incontinence symptoms. Results showed that the interventions with highest cure rates were traditional sling, retropubic midurethral sling (MUS), open colposuspension, and transobturator MUS, with rankings of 89.4%, 89.1%, 76.7%, and 64.1%, respectively. Compared with retropubic MUS, the odds ratio of cure for traditional sling was 1.06 (95% credible interval 0.62 to 1.85), for open colposuspension was 0.85 (0.54 to 1.33), and for transobtrurator MUS was 0.74 (0.59 to 0.92). Women were also more likely to experience an improvement in their incontinence symptoms after receiving retropubic MUS or transobturator MUS compared with other surgical procedures. In particular, compared with retropubic MUS, the odds ratio of improvement for transobturator MUS was 0.76 (95% credible interval 0.59 to 0.98), for traditional sling was 0.69 (0.39 to 1.26), and for open colposuspension was 0.65 (0.41 to 1.02). Quality of evidence was moderate for retropubic MUS versus transobturator MUS and low or very low for retropubic MUS versus the other two interventions. Data on adverse events were available mainly for mesh procedures, indicating a higher rate of repeat surgery and groin pain but a lower rate of suprapubic pain, vascular complications, bladder or urethral perforation, and voiding difficulties after transobturator MUS compared with retropubic MUS. Data on adverse events for non-MUS procedures were sparse and showed wide confidence intervals. Long term data were limited. CONCLUSIONS: Retropubic MUS, transobturator MUS, traditional sling, and open colposuspension are more effective than other procedures for stress urinary incontinence in the short to medium term. Data on long term effectiveness and adverse events are, however, limited, especially around the comparative adverse events profiles of MUS and non-MUS procedures. A better understanding of complications after surgery for stress urinary incontinence is imperative. SYSTEMATIC REVIEW REGISTRATION: PROSPERO CRD42016049339. ",
        "Effectiveness of the Stand More AT (SMArT) Work intervention: cluster randomised controlled trial. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the impact of a multicomponent intervention (Stand More AT (SMArT) Work) designed to reduce sitting time on short (three months), medium (six months), and longer term (12 months) changes in occupational, daily, and prolonged sitting, standing, and physical activity, and physical, psychological, and work related health. DESIGN: Cluster two arm randomised controlled trial. SETTING: National Health Service trust, England. PARTICIPANTS: 37 office clusters (146 participants) of desk based workers: 19 clusters (77 participants) were randomised to the intervention and 18 (69 participants) to control. INTERVENTIONS: The intervention group received a height adjustable workstation, a brief seminar with supporting leaflet, workstation instructions with sitting and standing targets, feedback on sitting and physical activity at three time points, posters, action planning and goal setting booklet, self monitoring and prompt tool, and coaching sessions (month 1 and every three months thereafter). The control group continued with usual practice. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was occupational sitting time (thigh worn accelerometer). Secondary outcomes were objectively measured daily sitting, prolonged sitting (\u226530 minutes), and standing time, physical activity, musculoskeletal problems, self reported work related health (job performance, job satisfaction, work engagement, occupational fatigue, sickness presenteeism, and sickness absenteeism), cognitive function, and self reported psychological measures (mood and affective states, quality of life) assessed at 3, 6, and 12 months. Data were analysed using generalised estimating equation models, accounting for clustering. RESULTS: A significant difference between groups (in favour of the intervention group) was found in occupational sitting time at 12 months (-83.28 min/workday, 95% confidence interval -116.57 to -49.98, P=0.001). Differences between groups (in favour of the intervention group compared with control) were observed for occupational sitting time at three months (-50.62 min/workday, -78.71 to -22.54, P<0.001) and six months (-64.40 min/workday, -97.31 to -31.50, P<0.001) and daily sitting time at six months (-59.32 min/day, -88.40 to -30.25, P<0.001) and 12 months (-82.39 min/day, -114.54 to -50.26, P=0.001). Group differences (in favour of the intervention group compared with control) were found for prolonged sitting time, standing time, job performance, work engagement, occupational fatigue, sickness presenteeism, daily anxiety, and quality of life. No differences were seen for sickness absenteeism. CONCLUSIONS: SMArT Work successfully reduced sitting time over the short, medium, and longer term, and positive changes were observed in work related and psychological health.

        "Benefits and harms of spinal manipulative therapy for the treatment of chronic low back pain: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials. OBJECTIVE: To assess the benefits and harms of spinal manipulative therapy (SMT) for the treatment of chronic low back pain. DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials. DATA SOURCES: Medline, PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), CINAHL, Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro), Index to Chiropractic Literature, and trial registries up to 4 May 2018, including reference lists of eligible trials and related reviews. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR SELECTING STUDIES: Randomised controlled trials examining the effect of spinal manipulation or mobilisation in adults (\u226518 years) with chronic low back pain with or without referred pain. Studies that exclusively examined sciatica were excluded, as was grey literature. No restrictions were applied to language or setting. REVIEW METHODS: Two reviewers independently selected studies, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias and quality of the evidence. The effect of SMT was compared with recommended therapies, non-recommended therapies, sham (placebo) SMT, and SMT as an adjuvant therapy. Main outcomes were pain and back specific functional status, examined as mean differences and standardised mean differences (SMD), respectively. Outcomes were examined at 1, 6, and 12 months. Quality of evidence was assessed using GRADE. A random effects model was used and statistical heterogeneity explored. RESULTS: 47 randomised controlled trials including a total of 9211 participants were identified, who were on average middle aged (35-60 years). Most trials compared SMT with recommended therapies. Moderate quality evidence suggested that SMT has similar effects to other recommended therapies for short term pain relief (mean difference -3.17, 95% confidence interval -7.85 to 1.51) and a small, clinically better improvement in function (SMD -0.25, 95% confidence interval -0.41 to -0.09). High quality evidence suggested that compared with non-recommended therapies SMT results in small, not clinically better effects for short term pain relief (mean difference -7.48, -11.50 to -3.47) and small to moderate clinically better improvement in function (SMD -0.41, -0.67 to -0.15). In general, these results were similar for the intermediate and long term outcomes as were the effects of SMT as an adjuvant therapy. Evidence for sham SMT was low to very low quality; therefore these effects should be considered uncertain. Statistical heterogeneity could not be explained. About half of the studies examined adverse and serious adverse events, but in most of these it was unclear how and whether these events were registered systematically. Most of the observed adverse events were musculoskeletal related, transient in nature, and of mild to moderate severity. One study with a low risk of selection bias and powered to examine risk (n=183) found no increased risk of an adverse event (relative risk 1.24, 95% confidence interval 0.85 to 1.81) or duration of the event (1.13, 0.59 to 2.18) compared with sham SMT. In one study, the Data Safety Monitoring Board judged one serious adverse event to be possibly related to SMT. CONCLUSION: SMT produces similar effects to recommended therapies for chronic low back pain, whereas SMT seems to be better than non-recommended interventions for improvement in function in the short term. Clinicians should inform their patients of the potential risks of adverse events associated with SMT. ",
        "Effect of breakfast on weight and energy intake: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials. OBJECTIVE: To examine the effect of regular breakfast consumption on weight change and energy intake in people living in high income countries. DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis. DATA SOURCES: PubMed, Ovid Medline, and CINAHL were searched for randomised controlled trials published between January 1990 and January 2018 investigating the effect of breakfast on weight or energy intake. ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization's International Clinical Trials Registry Platform search portal were also searched in October 2018 to identify any registered yet unpublished or ongoing trials. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR SELECTING STUDIES: Randomised controlled trials from high income countries in adults comparing breakfast consumption with no breakfast consumption that included a measure of body weight or energy intake. Two independent reviewers extracted the data and assessed the risk of bias of included studies. Random effects meta-analyses of the effect of breakfast consumption on weight and daily energy intake were performed. RESULTS: Of 13 included trials, seven examined the effect of eating breakfast on weight change, and 10 examined the effect on energy intake. Meta-analysis of the results found a small difference in weight favouring participants who skipped breakfast (mean difference 0.44 kg, 95% confidence interval 0.07 to 0.82), but there was some inconsistency across trial results (I2=43%). Participants assigned to breakfast had a higher total daily energy intake than those assigned to skip breakfast (mean difference 259.79 kcal/day, 78.87 to 440.71; 1 kcal=4.18 kJ), despite substantial inconsistency across trial results (I2=80%). All of the included trials were at high or unclear risk of bias in at least one domain and had only short term follow-ups (mean period seven weeks for weight, two weeks for energy intake). As the quality of the included studies was mostly low, the findings should be interpreted with caution. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that the addition of breakfast might not be a good strategy for weight loss, regardless of established breakfast habit. Caution is needed when recommending breakfast for weight loss in adults, as it could have the opposite effect. Further randomised controlled trials of high quality are needed to examine the role of breakfast eating in the approach to weight management.

        "Investigating causal relations between sleep traits and risk of breast cancer in women: mendelian randomisation study. OBJECTIVE: To examine whether sleep traits have a causal effect on risk of breast cancer. DESIGN: Mendelian randomisation study. SETTING: UK Biobank prospective cohort study and Breast Cancer Association Consortium (BCAC) case-control genome-wide association study. PARTICIPANTS: 156\u2009848 women in the multivariable regression and one sample mendelian randomisation (MR) analysis in UK Biobank (7784 with a breast cancer diagnosis) and 122\u2009977 breast cancer cases and 105\u2009974 controls from BCAC in the two sample MR analysis. EXPOSURES: Self reported chronotype (morning or evening preference), insomnia symptoms, and sleep duration in multivariable regression, and genetic variants robustly associated with these sleep traits. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Breast cancer diagnosis. RESULTS: In multivariable regression analysis using UK Biobank data on breast cancer incidence, morning preference was inversely associated with breast cancer (hazard ratio 0.95, 95% confidence interval 0.93 to 0.98 per category increase), whereas there was little evidence for an association between sleep duration and insomnia symptoms. Using 341 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with chronotype, 91 SNPs associated with sleep duration, and 57 SNPs associated with insomnia symptoms, one sample MR analysis in UK Biobank provided some supportive evidence for a protective effect of morning preference on breast cancer risk (0.85, 0.70, 1.03 per category increase) but imprecise estimates for sleep duration and insomnia symptoms. Two sample MR using data from BCAC supported findings for a protective effect of morning preference (inverse variance weighted odds ratio 0.88, 95% confidence interval 0.82 to 0.93 per category increase) and adverse effect of increased sleep duration (1.19, 1.02 to 1.39 per hour increase) on breast cancer risk (both oestrogen receptor positive and oestrogen receptor negative), whereas evidence for insomnia symptoms was inconsistent. Results were largely robust to sensitivity analyses accounting for horizontal pleiotropy. CONCLUSIONS: Findings showed consistent evidence for a protective effect of morning preference and suggestive evidence for an adverse effect of increased sleep duration on breast cancer risk. ",
        "Familial colorectal cancer risk in half siblings and siblings: nationwide cohort study. OBJECTIVE: To explore the risk of colorectal cancer in family members of patients with colorectal cancer, with an emphasis on subtypes of second degree relatives, especially half siblings, which were lacking in the literature. DESIGN: Ambidirectional cohort study. SETTING: Nationwide Swedish Family Cancer Data (record linkage). PARTICIPANTS: All people residing in Sweden and born after 1931, with their biological parents, totalling >16 million individuals (follow-up: 1958-2015); of those with clear genealogy, 173\u2009796 developed colorectal cancer. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Lifetime (0-79 years) cumulative risk and standardised incidence ratio of colorectal cancer among first degree relatives and second degree relatives. RESULTS: The overall lifetime cumulative risk of colorectal cancer in siblings of patients was 7%, which represents a 1.7-fold (95% confidence interval 1.6 to 1.7; n=2089) increase over the risk in those without any family history of colorectal cancer. A similarly increased lifetime cumulative risk (6%) was found among half siblings (standardised incidence ratio 1.5, 95% confidence interval 1.3 to 1.8; n=140). The risk in people with colorectal cancer in both a parent and a half sibling (standardised incidence ratio 3.6, 2.4 to 5.0; n=32) was close to the risk in those with both an affected parent and an affected sibling (2.7, 2.4 to 3.0; n=396). Family history of colorectal cancer in only one second degree relative other than a half sibling (without any affected first degree relatives), such as a grandparent, uncle, or aunt, showed minor association with the risk of colorectal cancer. CONCLUSION: Family history of colorectal cancer in half siblings is similarly associated with colorectal cancer risk to that in siblings. The increase in risk of colorectal cancer among people with one affected second degree relative was negligible, except for half siblings, but the risk was substantially increased for a combination of family history in one affected second degree relative and an affected first degree relative (or even another second degree relative). These evidence based findings provide novel information to help to identify people at high risk with a family history of colorectal cancer that can potentially be used for risk adapted screening. ",
        "Associations of dairy intake with risk of mortality in women and men: three prospective cohort studies. OBJECTIVE: To examine the association of consumption of dairy foods with risk of total and cause specific mortality in women and men. DESIGN: Three prospective cohort studies with repeated measures of diet and lifestyle factors. SETTING: Nurses' Health Study, Nurses' Health Study II, and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study, in the United States. PARTICIPANTS: 168\u2009153 women and 49\u2009602 men without cardiovascular disease or cancer at baseline. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Death confirmed by state vital records, the national death index, or reported by families and the postal system. During up to 32 years of follow-up, 51\u2009438 deaths were documented, including 12\u2009143 cardiovascular deaths and 15\u2009120 cancer deaths. Multivariable analysis further adjusted for family history of cardiovascular disease and cancer, physical activity, overall dietary pattern (alternate healthy eating index 2010), total energy intake, smoking status, alcohol consumption, menopausal status (women only), and postmenopausal hormone use (women only). RESULTS: Compared to the lowest category of total dairy consumption (average 0.8 servings/day), the multivariate pooled hazard ratio for total mortality was 0.98 (95% confidence interval 0.96 to 1.01) for the second category of dairy consumption (average 1.5 servings/day), 1.00 (0.97 to 1.03) for the third (average 2.0 servings/day), 1.02 (0.99 to 1.05) for the fourth (average 2.8 servings/day), and 1.07 (1.04 to 1.10) for highest category (average 4.2 servings/day; P for trend <0.001). For the highest compared to the lowest category of total dairy consumption, the hazard ratio was 1.02 (0.95 to 1.08) for cardiovascular mortality and 1.05 (0.99 to 1.11) for cancer mortality. For subtypes of dairy products, whole milk intake was significantly associated with higher risks of total mortality (hazard ratio per 0.5 additional serving/day 1.11, 1.09 to 1.14), cardiovascular mortality (1.09, 1.03 to 1.15), and cancer mortality (1.11, 1.06 to 1.17). In food substitution analyses, consumption of nuts, legumes, or whole grains instead of dairy foods was associated with a lower mortality, whereas consumption of red and processed meat instead of dairy foods was associated with higher mortality. CONCLUSION: These data from large cohorts do not support an inverse association between high amount of total dairy consumption and risk of mortality. The health effects of dairy could depend on the comparison foods used to replace dairy. Slightly higher cancer mortality was non-significantly associated with dairy consumption, but warrants further investigation. ",
        "Receiving a hug is associated with the attenuation of negative mood that occurs on days with interpersonal conflict. Interpersonal touch is emerging as an important topic in the study of adult relationships, with recent research showing that such behaviors can promote better relationship functioning and individual well-being. This investigation considers whether being hugged is associated with reduced conflict-related decreases in positive affect and increases in negative affect as well as whether these associations differ between women and men. A sample of 404 adults were interviewed every night for 14 consecutive days about their conflicts, hug receipt, and positive and negative affect. Results indicated that there was an interaction between hug receipt and conflict exposure such that receiving a hug was associated with a smaller conflict-related decrease in positive affect and a smaller conflict-related increase in negative affect when assessed concurrently. Hug receipt was also prospectively associated with a smaller conflict-related increase in next day negative affect but was not associated with next day positive affect. Associations between hug receipt and conflict-related changes in affect did not differ between women and men, between individuals who were married or in a marital-like relationship and those who were not, or as a function of individual differences in baseline perceived social support. While correlational, these results are consistent with the hypothesis that hugs buffer against deleterious changes in affect associated with experiencing interpersonal conflict. Possible mechanisms through which hugs facilitate positive adaptation to conflict are discussed. ",
        "The NASA Twins Study: A multidimensional analysis of a year-long human spaceflight. To understand the health impact of long-duration spaceflight, one identical twin astronaut was monitored before, during, and after a 1-year mission onboard the International Space Station; his twin served as a genetically matched ground control. Longitudinal assessments identified spaceflight-specific changes, including decreased body mass, telomere elongation, genome instability, carotid artery distension and increased intima-media thickness, altered ocular structure, transcriptional and metabolic changes, DNA methylation changes in immune and oxidative stress-related pathways, gastrointestinal microbiota alterations, and some cognitive decline postflight. Although average telomere length, global gene expression, and microbiome changes returned to near preflight levels within 6 months after return to Earth, increased numbers of short telomeres were observed and expression of some genes was still disrupted. These multiomic, molecular, physiological, and behavioral datasets provide a valuable roadmap of the putative health risks for future human spaceflight. ",
        "Sub-optimal cholesterol response to initiation of statins and future risk of cardiovascular disease. OBJECTIVE: To assess low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) response in patients after initiation of statins, and future risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). METHODS: Prospective cohort study of 165\u2009411 primary care patients, from the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink, who were free of CVD before statin initiation, and had at least one pre-treatment LDL-C within 12 months before, and one post-treatment LDL-C within 24 months after, statin initiation. Based on current national guidelines, <40% reduction in baseline LDL-C within 24 months was classified as a sub-optimal statin response. Cox proportional regression and competing-risks survival regression models were used to determine adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and sub-HRs for incident CVD outcomes for LDL-C response to statins. RESULTS: 84\u2009609 (51.2%) patients had a sub-optimal LDL-C response to initiated statin therapy within 24 months. During 1 077 299 person-years of follow-up (median follow-up 6.2 years), there were 22 798 CVD events (12\u2009142 in sub-optimal responders and 10\u2009656 in optimal responders). In sub-optimal responders, compared with optimal responders, the HR for incident CVD was 1.17 (95% CI 1.13 to 1.20) and 1.22 (95% CI 1.19 to 1.25) after adjusting for age and baseline untreated LDL-C. Considering competing risks resulted in lower but similar sub-HRs for both unadjusted (1.13, 95% CI 1.10 to 1.16) and adjusted (1.19, 95% CI 1.16 to 1.23) cumulative incidence function of CVD. CONCLUSIONS: Optimal lowering of LDL-C is not achieved within 2\u2009years in over half of patients in the general population initiated on statin therapy, and these patients will experience significantly increased risk of future CVD.

        "Marine DNA Viral Macro- and Microdiversity from Pole to Pole. Microbes drive most ecosystems and are modulated by viruses that impact their lifespan, gene flow, and metabolic outputs. However, ecosystem-level impacts of viral community diversity remain difficult to assess due to classification issues and few reference genomes. Here, we establish an \u223c12-fold expanded global ocean DNA virome dataset of 195,728 viral populations, now including the Arctic Ocean, and validate that these populations form discrete genotypic clusters. Meta-community analyses revealed five ecological zones throughout the global ocean, including two distinct Arctic regions. Across the zones, local and global patterns and drivers in viral community diversity were established for both macrodiversity (inter-population diversity) and microdiversity (intra-population genetic variation). These patterns sometimes, but not always, paralleled those from macro-organisms and revealed temperate and tropical surface waters and the Arctic as biodiversity hotspots and mechanistic hypotheses to explain them. Such further understanding of ocean viruses is critical for broader inclusion in ecosystem models. ",
        "Toward personalized cognitive diagnostics of at-genetic-risk Alzheimer's disease. Spatial navigation is emerging as a critical factor in identifying preclinical Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the impact of interindividual navigation ability and demographic risk factors (e.g., APOE, age, and sex) on spatial navigation make it difficult to identify persons \"at high risk\" of AD in the preclinical stages. In the current study, we use spatial navigation big data (n = 27,108) from the Sea Hero Quest (SHQ) game to overcome these challenges by investigating whether big data can be used to benchmark a highly phenotyped healthy aging laboratory cohort into high- vs. low-risk persons based on their genetic (APOE) and demographic (sex, age, and educational attainment) risk factors. Our results replicate previous findings in APOE \u03b54 carriers, indicative of grid cell coding errors in the entorhinal cortex, the initial brain region affected by AD pathophysiology. We also show that although baseline navigation ability differs between men and women, sex does not interact with the APOE genotype to influence the manifestation of AD-related spatial disturbance. Most importantly, we demonstrate that such high-risk preclinical cases can be reliably distinguished from low-risk participants using big-data spatial navigation benchmarks. By contrast, participants were undistinguishable on neuropsychological episodic memory tests. Taken together, we present evidence to suggest that, in the future, SHQ normative benchmark data can be used to more accurately classify spatial impairments in at-high-risk of AD healthy participants at a more individual level, therefore providing the steppingstone for individualized diagnostics and outcome measures of cognitive symptoms in preclinical AD.

        "Evaluation of the Diagnostic Stability of the Early Autism Spectrum Disorder Phenotype in the General Population Starting at 12 Months. Importance:  Universal early screening for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in primary care is becoming increasingly common and is believed to be a pivotal step toward early treatment. However, the diagnostic stability of ASD in large cohorts from the general population, particularly in those younger than 18 months, is unknown. Changes in the phenotypic expression of ASD across early development compared with toddlers with other delays are also unknown. . Objectives:  To examine the diagnostic stability of ASD in a large cohort of toddlers starting at 12 months of age and to compare this stability with that of toddlers with other disorders, such as developmental delay. . Design, Setting, and Participants:  In this prospective cohort study performed from January 1, 2006, to December 31, 2018, a total of 2241 toddlers were referred from the general population through a universal screening program in primary care or community referral. Eligible toddlers received their first diagnostic evaluation between 12 and 36 months of age and had at least 1 subsequent evaluation. . Exposures:  Diagnosis was denoted after each evaluation visit as ASD, ASD features, language delay, developmental delay, other developmental issue, typical sibling of an ASD proband, or typical development. . Main Outcomes and Measures:  Diagnostic stability coefficients were calculated within 2-month age bands, and logistic regression models were used to explore the associations of sex, age, diagnosis at first visit, and interval between first and last diagnosis with stability. Toddlers with a non-ASD diagnosis at their first visit diagnosed with ASD at their last were designated as having late-identified ASD. . Results:  Among the 1269 toddlers included in the study (918 [72.3%] male; median age at first evaluation, 17.6 months [interquartile range, 14.0-24.4 months]; median age at final evaluation, 36.2 months [interquartile range, 33.4-40.9 months]), the overall diagnostic stability for ASD was 0.84 (95% CI, 0.80-0.87), which was higher than any other diagnostic group. Only 7 toddlers (1.8%) initially considered to have ASD transitioned into a final diagnosis of typical development. Diagnostic stability of ASD within the youngest age band (12-13 months) was lowest at 0.50 (95% CI, 0.32-0.69) but increased to 0.79 by 14 months and 0.83 by 16 months (age bands of 12 vs 14 and 16 months; odds ratio, 4.25; 95% CI, 1.59-11.74). A total of 105 toddlers (23.8%) were not designated as having ASD at their first visit but were identified at a later visit. . Conclusions and Relevance:  The findings suggest that an ASD diagnosis becomes stable starting at 14 months of age and overall is more stable than other diagnostic categories, including language or developmental delay. After a toddler is identified as having ASD, there may be a low chance that he or she will test within typical levels at 3 years of age. This finding opens the opportunity to test the impact of very early-age treatment of ASD. ",
        "Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors in Child and Adolescent Health, 1990 to 2017: Findings From the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors 2017 Study. Importance: Understanding causes and correlates of health loss among children and adolescents can identify areas of success, stagnation, and emerging threats and thereby facilitate effective improvement strategies. Objective: To estimate mortality and morbidity in children and adolescents from 1990 to 2017 by age and sex in 195 countries and territories. Design, Setting, and Participants: This study examined levels, trends, and spatiotemporal patterns of cause-specific mortality and nonfatal health outcomes using standardized approaches to data processing and statistical analysis. It also describes epidemiologic transitions by evaluating historical associations between disease indicators and the Socio-Demographic Index (SDI), a composite indicator of income, educational attainment, and fertility. Data collected from 1990 to 2017 on children and adolescents from birth through 19 years of age in 195 countries and territories were assessed. Data analysis occurred from January 2018 to August 2018. Exposures: Being under the age of 20 years between 1990 and 2017. Main Outcomes and Measures: Death and disability. All-cause and cause-specific deaths, disability-adjusted life years, years of life lost, and years of life lived with disability. Results: Child and adolescent deaths decreased 51.7% from 13.77 million (95% uncertainty interval [UI], 13.60-13.93 million) in 1990 to 6.64 million (95% UI, 6.44-6.87 million) in 2017, but in 2017, aggregate disability increased 4.7% to a total of 145 million (95% UI, 107-190 million) years lived with disability globally. Progress was uneven, and inequity increased, with low-SDI and low-middle-SDI locations experiencing 82.2% (95% UI, 81.6%-82.9%) of deaths, up from 70.9% (95% UI, 70.4%-71.4%) in 1990. The leading disaggregated causes of disability-adjusted life years in 2017 in the low-SDI quintile were neonatal disorders, lower respiratory infections, diarrhea, malaria, and congenital birth defects, whereas neonatal disorders, congenital birth defects, headache, dermatitis, and anxiety were highest-ranked in the high-SDI quintile. Conclusions and Relevance: Mortality reductions over this 27-year period mean that children are more likely than ever to reach their 20th birthdays. The concomitant expansion of nonfatal health loss and epidemiological transition in children and adolescents, especially in low-SDI and middle-SDI countries, has the potential to increase already overburdened health systems, will affect the human capital potential of societies, and may influence the trajectory of socioeconomic development. Continued monitoring of child and adolescent health loss is crucial to sustain the progress of the past 27 years. ",
        "Effect of Sunscreen Application on Plasma Concentration of Sunscreen Active Ingredients: A Randomized Clinical Trial. IMPORTANCE: A prior pilot study demonstrated the systemic absorption of 4 sunscreen active ingredients; additional studies are needed to determine the systemic absorption of additional active ingredients and how quickly systemic exposure exceeds 0.5 ng/mL as recommended by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). OBJECTIVE: To assess the systemic absorption and pharmacokinetics of the 6 active ingredients (avobenzone, oxybenzone, octocrylene, homosalate, octisalate, and octinoxate) in 4 sunscreen products under single- and maximal-use conditions. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Randomized clinical trial at a clinical pharmacology unit (West Bend, Wisconsin) was conducted in 48 healthy participants. The study was conducted between January and February 2019. INTERVENTIONS: Participants were randomized to 1 of 4 sunscreen products, formulated as lotion (n\u2009=\u200912), aerosol spray (n\u2009=\u200912), nonaerosol spray (n\u2009=\u200912), and pump spray (n\u2009=\u200912). Sunscreen product was applied at 2 mg/cm2 to 75% of body surface area at 0 hours on day 1 and 4 times on day 2 through day 4 at 2-hour intervals, and 34 blood samples were collected over 21 days from each participant. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES:The primary outcome was the maximum plasma concentration of avobenzone over days 1 through 21. Secondary outcomes were the maximum plasma concentrations of oxybenzone, octocrylene, homosalate, octisalate, and octinoxate over days 1 through 21. RESULTS: Among 48 randomized participants (mean [SD] age, 38.7 [13.2] years; 24 women [50%]; 23 white [48%], 23 African American [48%], 1 Asian [2%], and 1 of unknown race/ethnicity [2%]), 44 (92%) completed the trial. Geometric mean maximum plasma concentrations of all 6 active ingredients were greater than 0.5 ng/mL, and this threshold was surpassed on day 1 after a single application for all active ingredients. For avobenzone, the overall maximum plasma concentrations were 7.1 ng/mL (coefficient of variation [CV], 73.9%) for lotion, 3.5 ng/mL (CV, 70.9%) for aerosol spray, 3.5 ng/mL (CV, 73.0%) for nonaerosol spray, and 3.3 ng/mL (CV, 47.8%) for pump spray. For oxybenzone, the concentrations were 258.1 ng/mL (CV, 53.0%) for lotion and 180.1 ng/mL (CV, 57.3%) for aerosol spray. For octocrylene, the concentrations were 7.8 ng/mL (CV, 87.1%) for lotion, 6.6 ng/mL (CV, 78.1%) for aerosol spray, and 6.6 ng/mL (CV, 103.9%) for nonaerosol spray. For homosalate, concentrations were 23.1 ng/mL (CV, 68.0%) for aerosol spray, 17.9 ng/mL (CV, 61.7%) for nonaerosol spray, and 13.9 ng/mL (CV, 70.2%) for pump spray. For octisalate, concentrations were 5.1 ng/mL (CV, 81.6%) for aerosol spray, 5.8 ng/mL (CV, 77.4%) for nonaerosol spray, and 4.6 ng/mL (CV, 97.6%) for pump spray. For octinoxate, concentrations were 7.9 ng/mL (CV, 86.5%) for nonaerosol spray and 5.2 ng/mL (CV, 68.2%) for pump spray. The most common adverse event was rash, which developed in 14 participants. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this study conducted in a clinical pharmacology unit and examining sunscreen application among healthy participants, all 6 of the tested active ingredients administered in 4 different sunscreen formulations were systemically absorbed and had plasma concentrations that surpassed the FDA threshold for potentially waiving some of the additional safety studies for sunscreens. These findings do not indicate that individuals should refrain from the use of sunscreen. ",
        "National, regional, and worldwide estimates of low birthweight in 2015, with trends from 2000: a systematic analysis. BACKGROUND: Low birthweight (LBW) of less than 2500 g is an important marker of maternal and fetal health, predicting mortality, stunting, and adult-onset chronic conditions. Global nutrition targets set at the World Health Assembly in 2012 include an ambitious 30% reduction in LBW prevalence between 2012 and 2025. Estimates to track progress towards this target are lacking; with this analysis, we aim to assist in setting a baseline against which to assess progress towards the achievement of the World Health Assembly targets. METHODS: We sought to identify all available LBW input data for livebirths for the years 2000-16. We considered population-based national or nationally representative datasets for inclusion if they contained information on birthweight or LBW prevalence for livebirths. A new method for survey adjustment was developed and used. For 57 countries with higher quality time-series data, we smoothed country-reported trends in birthweight data by use of B-spline regression. For all other countries, we estimated LBW prevalence and trends by use of a restricted maximum likelihood approach with country-level random effects. Uncertainty ranges were obtained through bootstrapping. Results were summed at the regional and worldwide level. FINDINGS: We collated 1447 country-years of birthweight data (281 million births) for 148 countries of 195 UN member states (47 countries had no data meeting inclusion criteria). The estimated worldwide LBW prevalence in 2015 was 14\u00b76% (uncertainty range [UR] 12\u00b74-17\u00b71) compared with 17\u00b75% (14\u00b71-21\u00b73) in 2000 (average annual reduction rate [AARR] 1\u00b723%). In 2015, an estimated 20\u00b75 million (UR 17\u00b74-24\u00b70 million) livebirths were LBW, 91% from low-and-middle income countries, mainly southern Asia (48%) and sub-Saharan Africa (24%). INTERPRETATION: Although these estimates suggest some progress in reducing LBW between 2000 and 2015, achieving the 2\u00b774% AARR required between 2012 and 2025 to meet the global nutrition target will require more than doubling progress, involving both improved measurement and programme investments to address the causes of LBW throughout the lifecycle.

        "Trends in Suicide Among Youth Aged 10 to 19 Years in the United States, 1975 to 2016. Importance: Suicide is a leading cause of death among youth aged 10 to 19 years in the United States, with rates traditionally higher in male than in female youth. Recent national mortality data suggest this gap may be narrowing, which warrants investigation. Objective: To investigate trends in suicide rates among US youth aged 10 to 19 years by age group, sex, race/ethnicity, and method of suicide. Design, Setting, and Participants: Cross-sectional study using period trend analysis of US suicide decedents aged 10 to 19 years from January 1, 1975, to December 31, 2016. Data were analyzed for periods defined by statistically significant changes in suicide rate trends. Suicide rates were calculated using population estimates. Main Outcomes and Measures: Period trends in suicide rates by sex and age group were assessed using joinpoint regression. Incidence rate ratios (IRRs) were estimated using negative binomial regression comparing male and female suicide rates within periods. Results: From 1975 to 2016, we identified 85\u202f051 youth suicide deaths in the United States (68\u202f085 male [80.1%] and 16\u202f966 female [19.9%]) with a male to female IRR of 3.82 (95% CI, 3.35-4.35). Following a downward trend until 2007, suicide rates for female youth showed the largest significant percentage increase compared with male youth (12.7% vs 7.1% for individuals aged 10-14 years; 7.9% vs 3.5% for individuals aged 15-19 years). The male to female IRR decreased significantly across the study period for youth aged 10 to 14 years (3.14 [95% CI, 2.74-3.61] to 1.80 [95% CI, 1.53-2.12]) and 15 to 19 years (4.15 [95% CI, 3.79-4.54] to 3.31 [95% CI, 2.96-3.69]). Significant declining trends in the male to female IRR were found in non-Hispanic white youth aged 10 to 14 years (3.27 [95% CI, 2.68-4.00] to 2.04 [95% CI, 1.45-2.89]) and non-Hispanic youth of other races aged 15 to 19 years (4.02 [95% CI, 3.29-4.92] to 2.35 [95% CI, 2.00-2.76]). The male to female IRR for firearms increased significantly for youth aged 15 to 19 years (\u03c72\u2009=\u20097.74; P\u2009=\u2009.02 for sex \u00d7 period interaction). The male to female IRR of suicide by hanging or suffocation decreased significantly for both age groups (10-14 years: \u03c72\u2009=\u200988.83; P\u2009<\u2009.001 for sex \u00d7 period interaction and 15-19 years: \u03c72\u2009=\u200982.15; P\u2009<\u2009.001 for sex \u00d7 period interaction). No significant change was found in the male to female IRR of suicide by poisoning across the study period. Conclusions and Relevance: A significant reduction in the historically large gap in youth suicide rates between male and female individuals underscores the importance of interventions that consider unique differences by sex. Future research examining sex-specific factors associated with youth suicide is warranted. ",
        "Ice sheet contributions to future sea-level rise from structured expert judgment. Despite considerable advances in process understanding, numerical modeling, and the observational record of ice sheet contributions to global mean sea-level rise (SLR) since the Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, severe limitations remain in the predictive capability of ice sheet models. As a consequence, the potential contributions of ice sheets remain the largest source of uncertainty in projecting future SLR. Here, we report the findings of a structured expert judgement study, using unique techniques for modeling correlations between inter- and intra-ice sheet processes and their tail dependences. We find that since the AR5, expert uncertainty has grown, in particular because of uncertain ice dynamic effects. For a +2 \u00b0C temperature scenario consistent with the Paris Agreement, we obtain a median estimate of a 26 cm SLR contribution by 2100, with a 95th percentile value of 81 cm. For a +5 \u00b0C temperature scenario more consistent with unchecked emissions growth, the corresponding values are 51 and 178 cm, respectively. Inclusion of thermal expansion and glacier contributions results in a global total SLR estimate that exceeds 2 m at the 95th percentile. Our findings support the use of scenarios of 21st century global total SLR exceeding 2 m for planning purposes. Beyond 2100, uncertainty and projected SLR increase rapidly. The 95th percentile ice sheet contribution by 2200, for the +5 \u00b0C scenario, is 7.5 m as a result of instabilities coming into play in both West and East Antarctica. Introducing process correlations and tail dependences increases estimates by roughly 15%. ",
        "An Injectable Implant to Stimulate the Sphenopalatine Ganglion for Treatment of Acute Ischaemic Stroke Up to 24 H From Onset (ImpACT-24B): An International, Randomised, Double-Blind, Sham-Controlled, Pivotal Trial. Background: Sphenopalatine ganglion stimulation increased cerebral collateral blood flow, stabilised the blood-brain barrier, and reduced infarct size, in preclinical models of acute ischaemic stroke, and showed potential benefit in a pilot randomised trial in humans. The pivotal ImpACT-24B trial aimed to determine whether sphenopalatine ganglion stimulation 8-24 h after acute ischaemic stroke improved functional outcome. . Methods: ImpACT-24B is a randomised, double-blind, sham-controlled, pivotal trial done at 73 centres in 18 countries. It included patients (men aged 40-80 years and women aged 40-85 years) with anterior-circulation acute ischaemic stroke, not undergoing reperfusion therapy. Enrolled patients were randomly assigned via web-based randomisation to receive active sphenopalatine ganglion stimulation (intervention group) or sham stimulation (sham-control group) 8-24 h after stroke onset. Patients, clinical care providers, and all outcome assessors were masked to treatment allocation. The primary efficacy endpoint was the difference between active and sham groups in the proportion of patients whose 3-month level of disability improved above expectations. This endpoint was evaluated in the modified intention-to-treat (mITT) population (defined as all patients who received one active or sham treatment session) and the population with confirmed cortical involvement (CCI) and was analysed using the Hochberg multi-step procedure (significance in both populations if p<0\u00b705 in both, and in one population if p<0\u00b7025 in that one). Safety endpoints at 3 months were all serious adverse events (SAEs), SAEs related to implant placement or removal, SAEs related to stimulation, neurological deterioration, and mortality. All patients who underwent an attempted sphenopalatine ganglion stimulator or sham stimulator placement procedure were included in the safety analysis. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00826059. . Findings: Between June 10, 2011, and March 7, 2018, 1078 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to either the intervention or the sham-control group. 1000 patients received at least one session of sphenopalatine ganglion stimulation or sham stimulation and entered the mITT population (481 [48%] received sphenopalatine ganglion stimulation, 519 [52%] were sham controls), among whom 520 (52%) patients had CCI on imaging. The proportion of patients in the mITT population whose 3-month disability level was better than expected was 49% (234/481) in the intervention group versus 45% (236/519) in the sham-control group (odds ratio 1\u00b714, 95% CI 0\u00b789-1\u00b746; p=0\u00b731). In the CCI population, the proportion was 50% (121/244) in the intervention group versus 40% (110/276) in the sham-control group (1\u00b748, 1\u00b705-2\u00b710; p=0\u00b70258). There was an inverse U-shaped dose-response relationship between attained sphenopalatine ganglion stimulation intensity and the primary outcome in the CCI population: the proportion with favourable outcome increased from 40% to 70% at low-midrange intensity and decreased back to 40% at high intensity stimulation (p=0\u00b70034). There were no differences in mortality or SAEs between the intervention group (n=536) and the sham-control group (n=519) in the safety population. . Interpretation: Sphenopalatine ganglion stimulation is safe for patients with acute ischaemic stroke 8-24 h after onset, who are ineligible for thrombolytic therapy. Although not reaching significance, the trial's results support that, among patients with imaging evidence of cortical involvement at presentation, sphenopalatine ganglion stimulation is likely to improve functional outcome.

        "Characterising JUUL-related posts on Instagram. BACKGROUND: JUUL, a high-tech, popular vaping device, was the first major electronic cigarette (e-cigarette) brand to incorporate social media into its marketing strategy. There is growing concern around the increasing use of JUUL and other electronic nicotine delivery devices among youth, and their potential to addict a new generation to nicotine. The current study analysed the amount and characteristics of JUUL-related posts on Instagram, a social media platform used frequently among youth and young adults. METHODS: Hashtag-based keyword queries (n=50) were used to collect JUUL-related posts from the Instagram application programming interface, March 2018-May 2018. Using a combination of machine learning methods, keyword algorithms and human coding, posts were characterised as featuring content related to product promotion, nicotine and addiction, youth culture and lifestyle. RESULTS: Keyword queries captured 14 838 JUUL-relevant posts by 5201 unique users. Over one-third of posts were promotional (eg, linked to commercial website) and 11% contained nicotine and addiction-related information. Approximately half of posts featured content related to youth (55%) or lifestyle (57%). Youth-related content or lifestyle appeals were also notably present within promotional posts and nicotine and addiction-related posts, respectively. Nicotine and addiction-related posts featured memes, hashtags (eg, #nichead, #juulbuzz) and tag lines (eg, 'more flavor, more buzz'). CONCLUSIONS: Findings reveal a proliferation of JUUL-related content on Instagram, which focused on product promotion and nicotine and addiction that included youth culture and lifestyle appeals. Regulatory actions should focus on restricting promotional efforts for e-cigarette products, particularly on social media platforms where young people are a primary audience. ",
        "Genome-wide association study identifies eight risk loci and implicates metabo-psychiatric origins for anorexia nervosa. Characterized primarily by a low body-mass index, anorexia nervosa is a complex and serious illness1, affecting 0.9-4% of women and 0.3% of men2-4, with twin-based heritability estimates of 50-60%5. Mortality rates are higher than those in other psychiatric disorders6, and outcomes are unacceptably poor7. Here we combine data from the Anorexia Nervosa Genetics Initiative (ANGI)8,9 and the Eating Disorders Working Group of the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC-ED) and conduct a genome-wide association study of 16,992\u2009cases of anorexia nervosa and 55,525\u2009controls, identifying eight significant loci. The genetic architecture of anorexia nervosa mirrors its clinical presentation, showing significant genetic correlations with psychiatric disorders, physical activity, and metabolic (including glycemic), lipid and anthropometric traits, independent of the effects of common variants associated with body-mass index. These results further encourage a reconceptualization of anorexia nervosa as a metabo-psychiatric disorder. Elucidating the metabolic component is a critical direction for future research, and paying attention to both psychiatric and metabolic components may be key to improving outcomes. ",
        "Association Between Electronic Cigarette Use and Smoking Reduction in France. Importance: The electronic cigarette (EC) has become popular among smokers who wish to reduce their tobacco use levels or quit smoking, but its effectiveness as a cessation aid is uncertain. Objective: To examine the association of regular EC use with the number of cigarettes smoked per day, smoking cessation among current smokers, and smoking relapse among former smokers. Design, Setting, and Participants: The CONSTANCES (Consultants des Centres d'Examens de Sant\u00e9) cohort study, based in France, began recruiting participants January 6, 2012, and is currently ongoing. Participants were enrolled in CONSTANCES through 2015, and included 5400 smokers (mean [SD] follow-up of 23.4 [9.3] months) and 2025 former smokers (mean [SD] follow-up of 22.1 [8.6] months) at baseline who quit smoking in 2010, the year in which ECs were introduced in France, or afterward. Analyses were performed from February 8, 2017, to October 15, 2018. Main Outcomes and Measures: The association between EC use and the number of cigarettes smoked during follow-up was studied using mixed regression models. The likelihood of smoking cessation was studied using Poisson regression models with robust sandwich variance estimators. The association between EC use and smoking relapse among former smokers was studied using Cox proportional hazards regression models. All statistical analyses were adjusted for sociodemographic characteristics, duration of follow-up, and smoking characteristics. Results: Among the 5400 daily smokers (2906 women and 2494 men; mean [SD] age, 44.9 [12.4] years), regular EC use was associated with a significantly higher decrease in the number of cigarettes smoked per day compared with daily smokers who did not use ECs (-4.4 [95% CI, -4.8 to -3.9] vs -2.7 [95% CI, -3.1 to -2.4]), as well as a higher adjusted relative risk of smoking cessation (1.67; 95% CI, 1.51-1.84]). At the same time, among the 2025 former smokers (1004 women and 1021 men; mean [SD] age, 43.6 [12.1] years), EC use was associated with an increase in the rate of smoking relapse among former smokers (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.70; 95% CI, 1.25-2.30). Conclusions and Relevance: This study's findings suggest that, among adult smokers, EC use appears to be associated with a decrease in smoking level and an increase in smoking cessation attempts but also with an increase in the level of smoking relapse in the general population after approximately 2 years of follow-up.

        "Association of Screen Time and Depression in Adolescence. Importance: Increases in screen time have been found to be associated with increases in depressive symptoms. However, longitudinal studies are lacking. Objective: To repeatedly measure the association between screen time and depression to test 3 explanatory hypotheses: displacement, upward social comparison, and reinforcing spirals. Design, Setting, and Participants: This secondary analysis used data from a randomized clinical trial assessing the 4-year efficacy of a personality-targeted drug and alcohol prevention intervention. This study assessed screen time and depression throughout 4 years, using an annual survey in a sample of adolescents who entered the seventh grade in 31 schools in the Greater Montreal area. Data were collected from September 2012 to September 2018. Analysis began and ended in December 2018. Main Outcomes and Measures: Independent variables were social media, television, video gaming, and computer use. Symptoms of depression was the outcome, measured using the Brief Symptoms Inventory. Exercise and self-esteem were assessed to test displacement and upward social comparison hypothesis. Results: A total of 3826 adolescents (1798 girls [47%]; mean [SD] age, 12.7 [0.5] years) were included. In general, depression symptoms increased yearly (year 1 mean [SD], 4.29 [5.10] points; year 4 mean [SD], 5.45 [5.93] points). Multilevel models, which included random intercepts at the school and individual level estimated between-person and within-person associations between screen time and depression. Significant between-person associations showed that for every increased hour spent using social media, adolescents showed a 0.64-unit increase in depressive symptoms (95% CI, 0.32-0.51). Similar between-level associations were reported for computer use (0.69; 95% CI, 0.47-0.91). Significant within-person associations revealed that a further 1-hour increase in social media use in a given year was associated with a further 0.41-unit increase in depressive symptoms in that same year. A similar within-person association was found for television (0.18; 95% CI, 0.09-0.27). Significant between-person and within-person associations between screen time and exercise and self-esteem supported upward social comparison and not displacement hypothesis. Furthermore, a significant interaction between the between-person and within-person associations concerning social media and self-esteem supported reinforcing spirals hypothesis. Conclusions and Relevance: Time-varying associations between social media, television, and depression were found, which appeared to be more explained by upward social comparison and reinforcing spirals hypotheses than by the displacement hypothesis. Both screen time modes should be taken into account when developing preventive measures and when advising parents. ",
        "Incompatible and sterile insect techniques combined eliminate mosquitoes. The radiation-based sterile insect technique (SIT) has successfully suppressed field populations of several insect pest species, but its effect on mosquito vector control has been limited. The related incompatible insect technique (IIT)-which uses sterilization caused by the maternally inherited endosymbiotic bacteria Wolbachia-is a promising alternative, but can be undermined by accidental release of females infected with the same Wolbachia strain as the released males. Here we show that combining incompatible and sterile insect techniques (IIT-SIT) enables near elimination of field populations of the world's most invasive mosquito species, Aedes albopictus. Millions of factory-reared adult males with an artificial triple-Wolbachia infection were released, with prior pupal irradiation of the released mosquitoes to prevent unintentionally released triply infected females from successfully reproducing in the field. This successful field trial demonstrates the feasibility of area-wide application of combined IIT-SIT for mosquito vector control. ",
        "Secular Trends in Pubertal Growth Acceleration in Swedish Boys Born From 1947 to 1996. Importance: A secular trend for earlier menarcheal age has been established in girls but there are few studies of pubertal timing for boys. Objective: To determine if there is a secular trend for earlier pubertal timing among boys. Design, Setting, and Participants: For this population-based retrospective cohort study conducted in Gothenburg, Sweden, we collected heights and weights from school health records for boys born consecutively from January 1 and onwards in 1947 and every 5 years from 1951 to 1996 (n\u2009=\u2009375 for each birth cohort from 1947-1991, n\u2009=\u2009340 for the birth cohort in 1996, and n\u2009=\u20094090 for the total cohort). We estimated age at the peak height velocity (PHV), the maximum growth velocity during puberty, and childhood body mass index (BMI) at age 8 years for all study participants. The data were analyzed during 2018 and 2019. Boys were eligible if they had a complete personal identity number and data to calculate their age at PHV and childhood BMI. Approximately 2.4% of the original study population was excluded because they lacked a personal identity number, and in the remaining study population, 4090 (69%) had sufficient data to calculate childhood BMI and age at PHV. Exposures: The exposure was birth year and a potential confounding factor was childhood BMI. Main Outcomes and Measures: The outcome was age at PHV. Results: Of the 4090 participants, most were white and the mean (SD) age at PHV was 13.9 (1.1) years. A linear regression model revealed a significant association between year of birth and age at PHV. Age at PHV was 1.5 months earlier for every decade increase in birth year (95% CI, -1.72 to -1.19; P\u2009<\u2009.001). After adjusting for childhood BMI, age at PHV was 1.2 months earlier per decade increase in birth year (95% CI, -1.41 to -0.89). All analyses were repeated in the subgroup of boys born in Sweden and with parents born in Sweden with similar results, indicating that the secular trend was not explained by demographic changes in the population between 1947 and 1996. Conclusions and Relevance: We provide evidence of a secular trend for earlier pubertal timing in boys that is partially explained by an increased childhood BMI, but other factors that are unknown contribute.

        "Plant-Based Diets Are Associated With a Lower Risk of Incident Cardiovascular Disease, Cardiovascular Disease Mortality, and All-Cause Mortality in a General Population of Middle-Aged Adults. Background: Previous studies have documented the cardiometabolic health benefits of plant-based diets; however, these studies were conducted in selected study populations that had narrow generalizability. . Methods and Results: We used data from a community-based cohort of middle-aged adults (n=12\u00a0168) in the ARIC (Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities) study who were followed up from 1987 through 2016. Participants' diet was classified using 4 diet indexes. In the overall plant-based diet index and provegetarian diet index, higher intakes of all or selected plant foods received higher scores; in the healthy plant-based diet index, higher intakes of only the healthy plant foods received higher scores; in the less healthy plant-based diet index, higher intakes of only the less healthy plant foods received higher scores. In all indexes, higher intakes of animal foods received lower scores. Results from Cox proportional hazards models showed that participants in the highest versus lowest quintile for adherence to overall plant-based diet index or provegetarian diet had a 16%, 31% to 32%, and 18% to 25% lower risk of cardiovascular disease, cardiovascular disease mortality, and all-cause mortality, respectively, after adjusting for important confounders (all P<0.05 for trend). Higher adherence to a healthy plant-based diet index was associated with a 19% and 11% lower risk of cardiovascular disease mortality and all-cause mortality, respectively, but not incident cardiovascular disease (P<0.05 for trend). No associations were observed between the less healthy plant-based diet index and the outcomes. . Conclusions: Diets higher in plant foods and lower in animal foods were associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in a general population. ",
        "Large-scale GWAS reveals insights into the genetic architecture of same-sex sexual behavior. Twin and family studies have shown that same-sex sexual behavior is partly genetically influenced, but previous searches for specific genes involved have been underpowered. We performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) on 477,522 individuals, revealing five loci significantly associated with same-sex sexual behavior. In aggregate, all tested genetic variants accounted for 8 to 25% of variation in same-sex sexual behavior, only partially overlapped between males and females, and do not allow meaningful prediction of an individual's sexual behavior. Comparing these GWAS results with those for the proportion of same-sex to total number of sexual partners among nonheterosexuals suggests that there is no single continuum from opposite-sex to same-sex sexual behavior. Overall, our findings provide insights into the genetics underlying same-sex sexual behavior and underscore the complexity of sexuality. ",
        "Unapproved Pharmaceutical Ingredients Included in Dietary Supplements Associated With US Food and Drug Administration Warnings. Importance: Over half of adults in the United States report consuming dietary supplements. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has warned of numerous dietary supplements containing undeclared, unapproved pharmaceutical ingredients. These FDA warnings have not been comprehensively analyzed for recent years. Objective: To summarize trends across adulterated (containing unapproved ingredients) dietary supplements associated with a warning released by the FDA from 2007 through 2016. Design, Setting, and Participants: In this quality improvement study, data were extracted from the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, Tainted Products Marketed as Dietary Supplements_CDER database from 2007 through 2016. Data from each warning were recorded unless multiple warnings were issued for the same product within a 6-month period. Date, product name, company, hidden ingredient(s), product category, source of sample, and warning document type were recorded for each included warning. Data analysis was conducted from February 2017 to June 2017. Results: From 2007 through 2016, 776 adulterated dietary supplements were identified by the FDA and 146 different dietary supplement companies were implicated. Most of these products were marketed for sexual enhancement (353 [45.5%]), weight loss (317 [40.9%]), or muscle building (92 [11.9%]), with 157 adulterated products (20.2%) containing more than 1 unapproved ingredient. The most common adulterants were sildenafil for sexual enhancement supplements (166 of 353 [47.0%]), sibutramine for weight loss supplements (269 of 317 [84.9%]), and synthetic steroids or steroid-like ingredients for muscle building supplements (82 of 92 [89.1%]). There were 28 products named in 2 or 3 warnings more than 6 months apart. Of these products, 19 (67.9%) were reported to contain new unapproved ingredients in the second or third warning, consistent with the assumption that the FDA found the product to be adulterated more than once. In recent years (2014-2016), 117 of 303 adulterated samples (38.6%) were identified through online sampling and 104 of 303 (34.3%) were identified through the examination of international mail shipments. Conclusions and Relevance: Active pharmaceuticals continue to be identified in dietary supplements, especially those marketed for sexual enhancement or weight loss, even after FDA warnings. The drug ingredients in these dietary supplements have the potential to cause serious adverse health effects owing to accidental misuse, overuse, or interaction with other medications, underlying health conditions, or other pharmaceuticals within the supplement.

        "Long-term Cardiovascular Disease Risk Among Firefighters After the World Trade Center Disaster. Importance: Published studies examining the association between World Trade Center (WTC) exposure on and after September 11, 2001, and longer-term cardiovascular disease (CVD) outcomes have reported mixed findings. Objective: To assess whether WTC exposure was associated with elevated CVD risk in Fire Department of the City of New York (FDNY) firefighters. Design, Settings, and Participants: In this cohort study, the association between WTC exposure and the risk of CVD was assessed between September 11, 2001, and December 31, 2017, in FDNY male firefighters. Multivariable Cox regression analyses were used to estimate CVD risk in association with 2 measures of WTC exposure: arrival time to the WTC site and duration of work at the WTC site. Data analyses were conducted from May 1, 2018, to March 8, 2019. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary CVD outcome included myocardial infarction, stroke, unstable angina, coronary artery surgery or angioplasty, or CVD death. The secondary outcome (all CVD) included all primary outcome events or any of the following: transient ischemic attack; stable angina, defined as either use of angina medication or cardiac catheterization without intervention; cardiomyopathy; and other CVD (aortic aneurysm, peripheral arterial vascular intervention, and carotid artery surgery). Results: There were 489 primary outcome events among 9796 male firefighters (mean [SD] age on September 11, 2001, was 40.3 [7.4] years and 7210 individuals [73.6%] were never smokers). Age-adjusted incident rates of CVD were higher for firefighters with greater WTC exposure. The multivariable adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for the primary CVD outcome was 1.44 (95% CI, 1.09-1.90) for the earliest arrival group compared with those who arrived later. Similarly, those who worked at the WTC site for 6 or more months vs those who worked less time at the site were more likely to have a CVD event (HR, 1.30; 95% CI, 1.05-1.60). Well-established CVD risk factors, including hypertension (HR, 1.41; 95% CI, 1.10-1.80), hypercholesterolemia (HR, 1.56; 95% CI, 1.28-1.91), diabetes (HR, 1.99; 95% CI, 1.33-2.98), and smoking (current: HR, 2.13; 95% CI, 1.68-2.70; former: HR, 1.55; 95% CI, 1.23-1.95), were significantly associated with CVD in the multivariable models. Analyses with the all-CVD outcome were similar. Conclusions and Relevance: The findings of the study suggest a significant association between greater WTC exposure and long-term CVD risk. The findings appear to reinforce the importance of long-term monitoring of the health of survivors of disasters. ",
        "Contextual Factors Associated With County-Level Suicide Rates in the United States, 1999 to 2016. Importance: Understanding geographic and community-level factors associated with suicide can inform targeted suicide prevention efforts. Objectives: To estimate suicide rates and trajectories, assess associated county-level contextual factors, and explore variation across the rural-urban continuum. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cross-sectional study included all individuals aged 25 to 64 years who died by suicide from January 1, 1999, to December 31, 2016, in the United States. Spatial analysis was used to map excess risk of suicide, and longitudinal random-effects models using negative binomial regression tested associations of contextual variables with suicide rates as well as interactions among county-level contextual variables. Data analyses were conducted between January 2019 and July 2019. Exposure: County of residence. Main Outcomes and Measures: Three-year county suicide rates during an 18-year period stratified by rural-urban location. Results: Between 1999 and 2016, 453\u202f577 individuals aged 25 to 64 years died by suicide in the United States. Decedents were primarily male (349\u202f082 [77.0%]) with 101\u202f312 (22.3%) aged 25 to 34 years, 120\u202f157 (26.5%) aged 35 to 44 years, 136\u202f377 (30.1%) aged 45 to 54 years, and 95\u202f771 (21.1%) aged 55 to 64 years. Suicide rates were higher and increased more rapidly in rural than in large metropolitan counties. The highest deprivation quartile was associated with higher suicide rates compared with the lowest deprivation quartile, especially in rural areas, although this association declined during the period studied (rural, 1999-2001: incidence rate ratio [IRR], 1.438; 95% CI, 1.319-1.568; P\u2009<\u2009.001; large metropolitan, 1999-2001: 1.208; 95% CI, 1.149-1.270; P\u2009<\u2009.001; rural, 2014-2016: IRR, 1.121; 95% CI, 1.032-1.219; P\u2009=\u2009.01; large metropolitan, 2014-2016: IRR, 0.942; 95% CI, 0.887-1.001; P\u2009=\u2009.06). The presence of more gun shops was associated with an increase in county-level suicide rates in all county types except the most rural (rural: IRR, 1.001; 95% CI, 0.999-1.004; P\u2009=\u2009.40; micropolitan: IRR, 1.005; 95% CI, 1.002-1.007; P\u2009<\u2009.001; small metropolitan: IRR, 1.010; 95% CI, 1.006-1.014; P\u2009<\u2009.001; large metropolitan: IRR, 1.012; 95% CI, 1.006-1.018; P\u2009<\u2009.001). High social capital was associated with lower suicide rates than low social capital (IRR, 0.917; 95% CI, 0.891-0.943; P\u2009<\u2009.001). High social fragmentation, an increasing percentage of the population without health insurance, and an increasing percentage of veterans in a county were associated with higher suicide rates (high social fragmentation: IRR, 1.077; 95% CI, 1.050-1.103; P\u2009<\u2009.001; percentage of population without health insurance: IRR, 1.005; 95% CI, 1.004-1.006; P\u2009<\u2009.001; percentage of veterans: IRR, 1.025; 95% CI, 1.021-1.028; P\u2009<\u2009.001). Conclusions and Relevance: This study found that suicide rates have increased across the nation and most rapidly in rural counties, which may be more sensitive to the impact of social deprivation than more metropolitan counties. Improving social connectedness, civic opportunities, and health insurance coverage as well as limiting access to lethal means have the potential to reduce suicide rates across the rural-urban continuum.

        "Association Between Forced Sexual Initiation and Health Outcomes Among US Women. Importance: The #MeToo movement has highlighted how frequently women experience sexual violence. However, to date, no recent studies have assessed the prevalence of forced sex during girls' and women's first sexual encounter or its health consequences. Objective: To estimate the prevalence of forced sexual initiation among US women and its association with subsequent reproductive, gynecologic, and general health outcomes. Design, Setting, and Participants: A cross-sectional analysis of the 2011-2017 National Survey of Family Growth was conducted, including a population-based sample of 13 310 US women. The study was conducted from September 2011 to September 2017. Exposures: Self-reported forced vs voluntary first sexual intercourse. Main Outcomes and Measures: Prevalence of forced sexual initiation, age of woman and partner/assailant at first sexual encounter, and odds ratios (ORs) (adjusted for sociodemographic characteristics) for having an unwanted first pregnancy or abortion, development of painful pelvic conditions, and other reproductive and general health measures. Results: A total of 13\u202f310 women between the ages of 18 and 44 years were included in the study. After survey weights were applied, 6.5% (95% CI, 5.9%-7.1%) of respondents reported experiencing forced sexual initiation, equivalent to 3 351 733 women in this age group nationwide. Age at forced sexual initiation averaged 15.6 (95% CI, 15.3-16.0) years vs 17.4 (95% CI, 17.3-17.5) years for voluntary sexual initiation (P\u2009<\u2009.001). The mean age of the partner/assailant at first sexual encounter was 6 years older for women with forced vs voluntary sexual initiation (27.0; 95% CI, 24.8-29.2 years vs 21.0; 95% CI, 20.6-21.3 years). Compared with women with voluntary sexual initiation, women with forced sexual initiation were more likely to experience an unwanted first pregnancy (30.1% vs 18.9%; adjusted OR [aOR], 1.9; 95% CI, 1.5-2.4) or an abortion (24.1% vs 17.3%; aOR, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.2-2.0), endometriosis (10.4% vs 6.5%; aOR, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.1-2.3), pelvic inflammatory disease (8.1% vs 3.4%; aOR, 2.2; 95% CI, 1.5-3.4), and problems with ovulation or menstruation (27.0% vs 17.1%; aOR, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.4-2.3). Survivors of forced sexual initiation more frequently reported illicit drug use (2.6% vs 0.7%; aOR, 3.6; 95% CI, 1.8-7.0), fair or poor health (15.5% vs 7.5%; aOR, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.5-2.7), and difficulty completing tasks owing to a physical or mental health condition (9.0% vs 3.2%; aOR, 2.8; 95% CI, 2.0-3.9). Conclusions and Relevance: Forced sexual initiation in women appears to be common and associated with multiple adverse reproductive and general health outcomes. These findings highlight the possible need for public health measures and sociocultural changes to prevent sexual violence, particularly forced sexual initiation. ",
        "Ambient black carbon particles reach the fetal side of human placenta. Particle transfer across the placenta has been suggested but to date, no direct evidence in real-life, human context exists. Here we report the presence of black carbon (BC) particles as part of combustion-derived particulate matter in human placentae using white-light generation under femtosecond pulsed illumination. BC is identified in all screened placentae, with an average (SD) particle count of 0.95\u2009\u00d7\u2009104 (0.66\u2009\u00d7\u2009104) and 2.09\u2009\u00d7\u2009104 (0.9\u2009\u00d7\u2009104) particles per mm3 for low and high exposed mothers, respectively. Furthermore, the placental BC load is positively associated with mothers' residential BC exposure during pregnancy (0.63-2.42\u2009\u00b5g per m3). Our finding that BC particles accumulate on the fetal side of the placenta suggests that ambient particulates could be transported towards the fetus and represents a potential mechanism explaining the detrimental health effects of pollution from early life onwards.

        "Attachment bonds between domestic cats and humans. Worldwide, domestic cats (Felis silvestris catus) outnumber domestic dogs (Canis familiaris). Despite cats' success in human environments, dog social cognition has received considerably more scientific attention over the last several decades [1-3]. A key aspect of what has been said to make dogs unique is their proclivity for forming attachment bonds, including secure attachments to humans [1,3], which could provide scaffolding for the development of human-like socio-cognitive abilities and contribute to success in human environments [3]. Cats, like dogs, can be found living in social groups or solitarily, depending on early developmental factors, resource distribution, and lifetime experiences such as human interaction [1,2,4]. Despite fewer studies, research suggests we may be underestimating cats' socio-cognitive abilities [2]. Here we report evidence, using behavioral criteria established in the human infant literature [5,6], that cats display distinct attachment styles toward human caregivers. Evidence that cats share social traits once attributed to dogs and humans alone would suggest that broader non-canine-specific mechanisms may be needed to explain cross-species attachment and socio-cognitive abilities.

        "The Effect of Electronic-Cigarette Vaping on Cardiac Function and Angiogenesis in Mice. The rapid increase in use of electronic-cigarettes (e-cigarettes), especially among youth, raises the urgency for regulating bodies to make informed decisions, guidance, and policy on these products. This study evaluated cardiac function in an experimental model following exposure to e-cigarettes. We subjected C57BL/6 mice to e-cigarette vaping for 2-weeks, and cardiac function was assessed using echocardiography. Cardiac tissues were collected at the end of e-cigarette exposure for pathological analysis. The experimental data showed that e-cigarette vaping (3\u2009h/day for 14 days) had no significant effect on cardiac contractility as measured by ejection fraction. However, it significantly increased angiogenesis in mouse heart tissue. We found that e-cigarette exposure increased the endothelial cell marker CD31 and CD34 to approximately 2 fold (p\u2009<\u20090.05) in heart tissue from female mice and about 150% (p\u2009<\u20090.05) in male mice. E-cigarette vaping also caused slower weight gain compared to mice exposed to room air. In addition, short-term e-cigarette exposure slightly increased collagen content in heart tissue but did not result in significant tissue fibrosis. These results suggest that short-term exposure to e-cigarettes has no acute effect on cardiac contractile function or tissue fibrosis, but it increases cardiac angiogenesis. ",
        "Bedtime hypertension treatment improves cardiovascular risk reduction: the Hygia Chronotherapy Trial. AIMS: The Hygia Chronotherapy Trial, conducted within the clinical primary care setting, was designed to test whether bedtime in comparison to usual upon awakening hypertension therapy exerts better cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk reduction. METHODS AND RESULTS: In this multicentre, controlled, prospective endpoint trial, 19 084 hypertensive patients (10 614 men/8470 women, 60.5\u2009\u00b1\u200913.7\u2009years of age) were assigned (1:1) to ingest the entire daily dose of \u22651 hypertension medications at bedtime (n\u2009=\u20099552) or all of them upon awakening (n\u2009=\u20099532). At inclusion and at every scheduled clinic visit (at least annually) throughout follow-up, ambulatory blood pressure (ABP) monitoring was performed for 48\u2009h. During the 6.3-year median patient follow-up, 1752 participants experienced the primary CVD outcome (CVD death, myocardial infarction, coronary revascularization, heart failure, or stroke). Patients of the bedtime, compared with the upon-waking, treatment-time regimen showed significantly lower hazard ratio-adjusted for significant influential characteristics of age, sex, type 2 diabetes, chronic kidney disease, smoking, HDL cholesterol, asleep systolic blood pressure (BP) mean, sleep-time relative systolic BP decline, and previous CVD event-of the primary CVD outcome [0.55 (95% CI 0.50-0.61), P\u2009<\u20090.001] and each of its single components (P\u2009<\u20090.001 in all cases), i.e. CVD death [0.44 (0.34-0.56)], myocardial infarction [0.66 (0.52-0.84)], coronary revascularization [0.60 (0.47-0.75)], heart failure [0.58 (0.49-0.70)], and stroke [0.51 (0.41-0.63)]. CONCLUSION: Routine ingestion by hypertensive patients of \u22651 prescribed BP-lowering medications at bedtime, as opposed to upon waking, results in improved ABP control (significantly enhanced decrease in asleep BP and increased sleep-time relative BP decline, i.e. BP dipping) and, most importantly, markedly diminished occurrence of major CVD events.

        "Search-and-replace genome editing without double-strand breaks or donor DNA. Most genetic variants that contribute to disease1 are challenging to correct efficiently and without excess byproducts2-5. Here we describe prime editing, a versatile and precise genome editing method that directly writes new genetic information into a specified DNA site using a catalytically impaired Cas9 endonuclease fused to an engineered reverse transcriptase, programmed with a prime editing guide RNA (pegRNA) that both specifies the target site and encodes the desired edit. We performed more than 175 edits in human cells, including targeted insertions, deletions, and all 12 types of point mutation, without requiring double-strand breaks or donor DNA templates. We used prime editing in human cells to correct, efficiently and with few byproducts, the primary genetic causes of sickle cell disease (requiring a transversion in HBB) and Tay-Sachs disease (requiring a deletion in HEXA); to install a protective transversion in PRNP; and to insert various tags and epitopes precisely into target loci. Four human cell lines and primary post-mitotic mouse cortical neurons support prime editing with varying efficiencies. Prime editing shows higher or similar efficiency and fewer byproducts than homology-directed repair, has complementary strengths and weaknesses compared to base editing, and induces much lower off-target editing than Cas9 nuclease at known Cas9 off-target sites. Prime editing substantially expands the scope and capabilities of genome editing, and in principle could correct up to 89% of known genetic variants associated with human diseases. ",
        "Short-Term Impact of a Flavored Tobacco Restriction: Changes in Youth Tobacco Use in a Massachusetts Community. Introduction: To counter the high prevalence of flavored tobacco use among youth, many U.S. localities have passed policies that restrict youth access to these products. This study aims to evaluate the short-term impact of a flavored tobacco restriction policy on youth access to, and use of, flavored tobacco products in a Massachusetts community. . Methods: A community with the policy (Lowell) was matched to a community without the policy (Malden) with similar demographics, retailer characteristics, and point-of-sale tobacco policies. Product inventories were assessed in tobacco retailers in the 2 communities, and surveys were administered to high school-aged youth in those communities. Inventories and surveys were conducted around the time the policy took effect in October 2016 (baseline) and approximately 6 months later (follow-up); all data were analyzed in 2017. Chi-squared tests and difference-in-difference models were used to estimate the impact of the policy on flavored tobacco availability and youth perceptions and behaviors related to flavored tobacco use. . Results: Flavored tobacco availability decreased significantly in Lowell from baseline to follow-up periods by 70 percentage points (p<0.001), whereas no significant changes in flavored tobacco availability were seen in Malden. In addition, current use of both flavored and non-flavored tobacco decreased in Lowell, but increased in Malden from baseline to follow-up; these changes were significantly different between communities (flavored tobacco: -5.7%, p=0.03; non-flavored tobacco: -6.2%, p=0.01). . Conclusions: Policies that restrict the sale of flavored tobacco have the potential to curb youth tobacco use in as few as 6 months.",
        "Association of Flavored Tobacco Use With Tobacco Initiation and Subsequent Use Among US Youth and Adults, 2013-2015. Importance: Flavors in tobacco products may appeal to young and inexperienced users. Objective: To examine among youth (aged 12-17 years), young adults (aged 18-24 years), and adults (aged \u226525 years) the prevalence of first use of flavored tobacco products among new tobacco users and the association between first flavored use of a given tobacco product and tobacco use 1 year later, including progression of tobacco use. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study represents a longitudinal analysis of data from the Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health (PATH) Study, a nationally representative study with data collected in 2013 to 2014 (wave 1) and 2014 to 2015 (wave 2). Participants were noninstitutionalized individuals, including 11\u202f996 youth and 26\u202f447 adults, in selected households who participated in both waves of the PATH Study. Data analysis was conducted from July 2016 to June 2019. Main Outcomes and Measures: Prevalence of tobacco product use at wave 2. Results: The mean (SE) age of the participants was 14.5 (0.0) years for youth, 21.1 (0.0) years for young adults, and 50.3 (0.0) for adults. Most youth (71.9%; 95% CI, 69.7%-74.0%) and young adults (57.6%; 95% CI, 54.9%-60.3%) who were new users of tobacco products over the 10- to 13-month follow-up period used flavored products. First use of a menthol or mint or other flavored cigarette documented at wave 1 was positively associated with past 12-month and past 30-day cigarette use in all age groups at wave 2 compared with first use of a nonflavored cigarette (youth, flavored cigarette, past 12-month use adjusted prevalence ratio [aPR], 1.14 [95% CI, 1.05-1.25] and past 30-day use aPR, 1.15 [95% CI, 1.00-1.31]; youth, menthol or mint cigarette, past 12-month use aPR, 1.18 [95% CI, 1.08-1.29] and past 30-day use aPR, 1.19 [95% CI, 1.04-1.37]; young adult, flavored cigarette, past 12-month use aPR, 1.09 [95% CI, 1.04-1.15] and past 30-day use aPR, 1.13 [95% CI, 1.06-1.21]; young adult menthol or mint cigarette, past 12-month use aPR, 1.10 [95% CI, 1.05-1.16] and past 30-day use aPR, 1.15 [95% CI, 1.07-1.23]; adult flavored cigarette, past 12-month use aPR, 1.10 [95% CI, 1.05-1.15] and past 30-day use aPR, 1.09 [95% CI, 1.04-1.14]; adult menthol or mint cigarette, past 12-month use aPR, 1.13 [95% CI, 1.08-1.18] and past 30-day use aPR, 1.12 [95% CI, 1.07-1.17]). Among young adults, first use of flavored e-cigarettes (aPR, 2.05; 95% CI, 1.61-2.61), any cigars (aPR, 1.60; 95% CI, 1.26-2.02), cigarillos (aPR, 1.49; 95% CI, 1.08-2.05), filtered cigars (aPR, 3.69; 95% CI, 2.08-6.57), hookah (aPR, 1.91; 95% CI, 1.23-2.98), and any smokeless tobacco (aPR, 1.54; 95% CI, 1.08-2.20) was prospectively associated with current regular use of those products at wave 2 compared with first nonflavored use. Among adults aged 25 years and older, first use of flavored e-cigarettes (aPR, 1.60; 95% CI, 1.41-1.82), any cigars (aPR, 1.56; 95% CI, 1.29-1.87), cigarillos (aPR, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.01-1.64), filtered cigars (aPR, 1.79; 95% CI, 1.25-2.54), hookah (aPR, 5.66; 95% CI, 2.04-15.71), and any smokeless tobacco (aPR, 1.55; 95% CI, 1.32-1.82) was prospectively associated with current regular use of those products at wave 2 compared with first nonflavored use. Conclusions and Relevance: In this longitudinal cohort study, flavors in tobacco products were associated with youth and young adult tobacco experimentation. First use of a flavored tobacco product may place youth, young adults, and adults at risk of subsequent tobacco use. ",
        "Measles virus infection diminishes preexisting antibodies that offer protection from other pathogens. Measles virus is directly responsible for more than 100,000 deaths yearly. Epidemiological studies have associated measles with increased morbidity and mortality for years after infection, but the reasons why are poorly understood. Measles virus infects immune cells, causing acute immune suppression. To identify and quantify long-term effects of measles on the immune system, we used VirScan, an assay that tracks antibodies to thousands of pathogen epitopes in blood. We studied 77 unvaccinated children before and 2 months after natural measles virus infection. Measles caused elimination of 11 to 73% of the antibody repertoire across individuals. Recovery of antibodies was detected after natural reexposure to pathogens. Notably, these immune system effects were not observed in infants vaccinated against MMR (measles, mumps, and rubella), but were confirmed in measles-infected macaques. The reduction in humoral immune memory after measles infection generates potential vulnerability to future infections, underscoring the need for widespread vaccination. ",
        "What the world's religions teach, applied to vaccines and immune globulins. For millennia, humans have sought and found purpose, solace, values, understanding, and fellowship in religious practices. Buddhist nuns performed variolation against smallpox over 1000 years ago. Since Jenner developed vaccination against smallpox in 1796, some people have objected to and declined vaccination, citing various religious reasons. This paper reviews the scriptural, canonical basis for such interpretations, as well as passages that support immunization. Populous faith traditions are considered, including Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. Subjects of concern such as blood components, pharmaceutical excipients of porcine or bovine origin, rubella strain RA 27/3, and cell-culture media with remote fetal origins are evaluated against the religious concerns identified. The review identified more than 60 reports or evaluations of vaccine-preventable infectious-disease outbreaks that occurred within religious communities or that spread from them to broader communities. In multiple cases, ostensibly religious reasons to decline immunization actually reflected concerns about vaccine safety or personal beliefs among a social network of people organized around a faith community, rather than theologically based objections per se. Themes favoring vaccine acceptance included transformation of vaccine excipients from their starting material, extensive dilution of components of concern, the medicinal purpose of immunization (in contrast to diet), and lack of alternatives. Other important features included imperatives to preserve health and duty to community (e.g., parent to child, among neighbors). Concern that 'the body is a temple not to be defiled' is contrasted with other teaching and quality-control requirements in manufacturing vaccines and immune globulins. Health professionals who counsel hesitant patients or parents can ask about the basis for concern and how the individual applies religious understanding to decision-making about medical products, explain facts about content and processes, and suggest further dialog with informed religious leaders. Key considerations for observant believers for each populous religion are described. ",
        "Age-Specific Incidence of Melanoma in the United States. Importance: Melanoma is epidemiologically linked to UV exposure, particularly childhood sunburn. Public health campaigns are increasing sun-protective behavior in the United States, but the effect on melanoma incidence is unknown. Objective: To examine the incidence of melanoma in the United States and whether any age-specific differences are present. Design, Setting, and Participants: Observational, population-based registry data were extracted on July 3, 2018, from the combined National Program of Cancer Registries-Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results United States Cancer Statistics database for 2001-2015. Deidentified data for 988\u202f103 cases of invasive melanoma, with International Classification of Diseases for Oncology histologic categorization codes 8720 to 8790, were used for analysis. Data analysis was performed from July 1, 2018, to March 1, 2019. Main Outcomes and Measures: The annual rates of melanoma in pediatric, adolescent, young adult, and adult age groups were determined. Analyses were stratified by sex, and incidence rates were age-adjusted to the 2000 US standard population. Annual percentage change (APC) in incidence rate was calculated over the most recent decade for which data were available (2006-2015) using the weighted least squares method. Results: In 2015, 83\u202f362 cases of invasive melanoma were reported in the United States, including 67 in children younger than 10 years, 251 in adolescents (10-19 years), and 1973 in young adults (20-29 years). Between 2006 and 2015, the overall incidence rate increased from 200.1 to 229.1 cases per million person-years. In adults aged 40 years or older, melanoma rates increased by an APC of 1.8% in both men (95% CI, 1.4%-2.1%) and women (95% CI, 1.4%-2.2%). In contrast, clinically and statistically significant decreases were seen in melanoma incidence for adolescents and young adults. Specifically, incidence rates decreased by an APC of -4.4% for male adolescents (95% CI, -1.7% to -7.0%), -5.4% for female adolescents (95% CI, -3.3% to -7.4%), -3.7% for male young adults (95% CI, -2.5% to -4.8%), and -3.6% for female young adults (95% CI, -2.8% to -4.5%). Data on skin pigmentation and sun protection history were unavailable; similar trends were observed with data limited to non-Hispanic whites. Young adult women appeared to have twice the risk of melanoma as young adult men. Conclusions and Relevance: The incidence of invasive melanoma in the United States appeared to decrease in adolescents and young adults from 2006 to 2015, and this finding contrasted with increases in older populations. These incidence trends suggest that public health efforts may be favorably influencing melanoma incidence in the United States. ",
        "Green spaces and mortality: a systematic review and meta-analysis of cohort studies. BACKGROUND: Green spaces have been proposed to be a health determinant, improving health and wellbeing through different mechanisms. We aimed to systematically review the epidemiological evidence from longitudinal studies that have investigated green spaces and their association with all-cause mortality. We aimed to evaluate this evidence with a meta-analysis, to determine exposure-response functions for future quantitative health impact assessments. METHODS: We did a systematic review and meta-analysis of cohort studies on green spaces and all-cause mortality. We searched for studies published and indexed in MEDLINE before Aug 20, 2019, which we complemented with an additional search of cited literature. We included studies if their design was longitudinal; the exposure of interest was measured green space; the endpoint of interest was all-cause mortality; they provided a risk estimate (ie, a hazard ratio [HR]) and the corresponding 95% CI for the association between green space exposure and all-cause mortality; and they used normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) as their green space exposure definition. Two investigators (DR-R and DP-L) independently screened the full-text articles for inclusion. We used a random-effects model to obtain pooled HRs. This study is registered with PROSPERO, CRD42018090315. FINDINGS: We identified 9298 studies in MEDLINE and 13 studies that were reported in the literature but not indexed in MEDLINE, of which 9234 (99%) studies were excluded after screening the titles and abstracts and 68 (88%) of 77 remaining studies were excluded after assessment of the full texts. We included nine (12%) studies in our quantitative evaluation, which comprised 8\u2008324\u2008652 individuals from seven countries. Seven (78%) of the nine studies found a significant inverse relationship between an increase in surrounding greenness per 0\u00b71 NDVI in a buffer zone of 500 m or less and the risk of all-cause mortality, but two studies found no association. The pooled HR for all-cause mortality per increment of 0\u00b71 NDVI within a buffer of 500 m or less of a participant's residence was 0\u00b796 (95% CI 0\u00b794-0\u00b797; I2, 95%). INTERPRETATION: We found evidence of an inverse association between surrounding greenness and all-cause mortality. Interventions to increase and manage green spaces should therefore be considered as a strategic public health intervention. FUNDING: World Health Organization. ",
        "Ketamine can reduce harmful drinking by pharmacologically rewriting drinking memories. Maladaptive reward memories (MRMs) are involved in the development and maintenance of acquired overconsumption disorders, such as harmful alcohol and drug use. The process of memory reconsolidation - where stored memories become briefly labile upon retrieval - may offer a means to disrupt MRMs and prevent relapse. However, reliable means for pharmacologically weakening MRMs in humans remain elusive. Here we demonstrate that the N-methyl D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonist ketamine is able to disrupt MRMs in hazardous drinkers when administered immediately after their retrieval. MRM retrieval\u2009+\u2009ketamine (RET\u2009+\u2009KET) effectively reduced the reinforcing effects of alcohol and long-term drinking levels, compared to ketamine or retrieval alone. Blood concentrations of ketamine and its metabolites during the critical 'reconsolidation window' predicted beneficial changes only following MRM reactivation. Pharmacological reconsolidation interference may provide a means to rapidly rewrite maladaptive memory and should be further pursued in alcohol and drug use disorders. ",
        "Natural psychoactive substance-related exposures reported to United States poison control centers, 2000-2017. Context/Objective: To investigate the epidemiology of exposures to psychoactive substances of natural origin in the United States.Methods: Data from the National Poison Data System were retrospectively analyzed to investigate exposures to psychoactive substances of natural origin.Results: From January 1, 2000 through December 31, 2017, there were 67,369 calls to poison control centers in the United States regarding exposures to natural psychoactive substances, equaling an average of 3,743 exposures annually. Individuals >19\u2009years of age (41.4%) and 13-19-year-olds (34.8%) accounted for most exposures with the highest annual rate reported among 13-19-year-olds at 79.4 per million population. The substances most commonly involved were marijuana (46.9%), anticholinergic plants (21.1%), and hallucinogenic mushrooms (15.6%). Kratom, khat, anticholinergic plants, and hallucinogenic mushrooms were the substances with the highest percentages of hospital admission and serious medical outcomes. The overall rate of exposure to natural psychoactive substances per million population increased significantly by 74.1% from 17.6 in 2000 to 30.7 in 2017 (p\u2009<\u20090.001). This increase was driven by a significant 150.0% increase in the rate of exposure to marijuana from 9.9 in 2000 to 24.7 in 2017 (p\u2009<\u20090.001). Despite this overall increase, most substances showed a significant decrease in exposure rate from 2000 to 2017, except for marijuana, nutmeg, and kratom. Kratom demonstrated a significant 4,948.9% increase from 2011 to 2017 and accounted for 8 of the 42 deaths identified in this study.Conclusions: While rates of exposure to most natural psychoactive substances decreased during the 18-year study period, rates for marijuana, nutmeg, and kratom increased significantly.

        "Life Expectancy and Mortality Rates in the United States, 1959-2017. Importance: US life expectancy has not kept pace with that of other wealthy countries and is now decreasing. Objective: To examine vital statistics and review the history of changes in US life expectancy and increasing mortality rates; and to identify potential contributing factors, drawing insights from current literature and an analysis of state-level trends. Evidence: Life expectancy data for 1959-2016 and cause-specific mortality rates for 1999-2017 were obtained from the US Mortality Database and CDC WONDER, respectively. The analysis focused on midlife deaths (ages 25-64 years), stratified by sex, race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and geography (including the 50 states). Published research from January 1990 through August 2019 that examined relevant mortality trends and potential contributory factors was examined. Findings: Between 1959 and 2016, US life expectancy increased from 69.9 years to 78.9 years but declined for 3 consecutive years after 2014. The recent decrease in US life expectancy culminated a period of increasing cause-specific mortality among adults aged 25 to 64 years that began in the 1990s, ultimately producing an increase in all-cause mortality that began in 2010. During 2010-2017, midlife all-cause mortality rates increased from 328.5 deaths/100\u202f000 to 348.2 deaths/100\u202f000. By 2014, midlife mortality was increasing across all racial groups, caused by drug overdoses, alcohol abuse, suicides, and a diverse list of organ system diseases. The largest relative increases in midlife mortality rates occurred in New England (New Hampshire, 23.3%; Maine, 20.7%; Vermont, 19.9%) and the Ohio Valley (West Virginia, 23.0%; Ohio, 21.6%; Indiana, 14.8%; Kentucky, 14.7%). The increase in midlife mortality during 2010-2017 was associated with an estimated 33\u202f307 excess US deaths, 32.8% of which occurred in 4 Ohio Valley states. Conclusions and Relevance: US life expectancy increased for most of the past 60 years, but the rate of increase slowed over time and life expectancy decreased after 2014. A major contributor has been an increase in mortality from specific causes (eg, drug overdoses, suicides, organ system diseases) among young and middle-aged adults of all racial groups, with an onset as early as the 1990s and with the largest relative increases occurring in the Ohio Valley and New England. The implications for public health and the economy are substantial, making it vital to understand the underlying causes. ",
        "Supplemental MRI Screening for Women with Extremely Dense Breast Tissue. BACKGROUND: Extremely dense breast tissue is a risk factor for breast cancer and limits the detection of cancer with mammography. Data are needed on the use of supplemental magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to improve early detection and reduce interval breast cancers in such patients. METHODS: In this multicenter, randomized, controlled trial in the Netherlands, we assigned 40,373 women between the ages of 50 and 75 years with extremely dense breast tissue and normal results on screening mammography to a group that was invited to undergo supplemental MRI or to a group that received mammography screening only. The groups were assigned in a 1:4 ratio, with 8061 in the MRI-invitation group and 32,312 in the mammography-only group. The primary outcome was the between-group difference in the incidence of interval cancers during a 2-year screening period. RESULTS: The interval-cancer rate was 2.5 per 1000 screenings in the MRI-invitation group and 5.0 per 1000 screenings in the mammography-only group, for a difference of 2.5 per 1000 screenings (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.0 to 3.7; P<0.001). Of the women who were invited to undergo MRI, 59% accepted the invitation. Of the 20 interval cancers that were diagnosed in the MRI-invitation group, 4 were diagnosed in the women who actually underwent MRI (0.8 per 1000 screenings) and 16 in those who did not accept the invitation (4.9 per 1000 screenings). The MRI cancer-detection rate among the women who actually underwent MRI screening was 16.5 per 1000 screenings (95% CI, 13.3 to 20.5). The positive predictive value was 17.4% (95% CI, 14.2 to 21.2) for recall for additional testing and 26.3% (95% CI, 21.7 to 31.6) for biopsy. The false positive rate was 79.8 per 1000 screenings. Among the women who underwent MRI, 0.1% had either an adverse event or a serious adverse event during or immediately after the screening. CONCLUSIONS: The use of supplemental MRI screening in women with extremely dense breast tissue and normal results on mammography resulted in the diagnosis of significantly fewer interval cancers than mammography alone during a 2-year screening period.

        "Deportation Worry, Cardiovascular Disease Risk Factor Trajectories, and Incident Hypertension: A Community-Based Cohort Study. Background Worry about deportation has been associated with cardiovascular disease risk factors in cross-sectional research. No research has evaluated this association longitudinally or examined the association between deportation worry and incident cardiovascular disease outcomes. Methods and Results We used data from an ongoing community-based cohort of 572 women primarily of Mexican origin. We estimated associations between self-reported deportation worry and: (1) trajectories of blood pressure, body mass index, and waist circumference with linear mixed models, and (2) incident hypertension with Cox proportional hazards models. Nearly half (48%) of women reported \"a lot,\" 24% reported \"moderate,\" and 28% reported \"not too much\" deportation worry. Higher worry at baseline was associated with nonlinear systolic blood pressure and mean arterial pressure trajectories. For example, compared with not too much worry, a lot of worry was associated with a faster initial increase (\u03b2, interaction with linear year term: 4.10; 95% CI, 1.17-7.03) followed by a faster decrease in systolic blood pressure (\u03b2, interaction with quadratic year term: -0.80; 95% CI, -1.55 to -0.06). There was weak evidence of an association between deportation worry and diastolic blood pressure and no association with body mass index, waist circumference, or pulse pressure trajectories. Among 408 women without baseline hypertension, reporting a lot (hazard ratio, 2.17; 95% CI, 1.15-4.10) and moderate deportation worry (hazard ratio, 2.48; 95% CI, 1.17-4.30) were each associated with greater risk of incident hypertension compared with reporting not too much worry. Conclusions Deportation worry may contribute to widening disparities in some cardiovascular disease risk factors and outcomes over time. ",
        "All-Cause and Cause-Specific Mortality Among People Using Extramedical Opioids: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis. Importance: Extramedical opioid use has escalated in recent years. A better understanding of cause-specific mortality in this population is needed to inform comprehensive responses. Objective: To estimate all-cause and cause-specific crude mortality rates (CMRs) and standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) among people using extramedical opioids, including age- and sex-specific estimates when possible. Data Sources: For this systematic review and meta-analysis, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and Embase were searched for studies published from January 1, 2009, to October 3, 2019, and an earlier systematic review on this topic published in 2011. Study Selection: Cohort studies of people using extramedical opioids and reporting mortality outcomes were screened for inclusion independently by 2 team members. Data Extraction and Synthesis: Data were extracted by a team member and checked by another team member. Study quality was assessed using a custom set of items that examined risk of bias and quality of reporting. Data were pooled using random-effects meta-analysis models. Heterogeneity was assessed using stratified meta-analyses and meta-regression. Main Outcomes and Measures: Outcome measures were all-cause and cause-specific CMRs and SMRs among people using extramedical opioids compared with the general population of the same age and sex. Results: Of 8683 identified studies, 124 were included in this analysis (100 primary studies and 24 studies providing additional data for primary studies). The pooled all-cause CMR, based on 99 cohorts of 1\u202f262\u202f592 people, was 1.6 per 100 person-years (95% CI, 1.4-1.8 per 100 person-years), with substantial heterogeneity (I2\u2009=\u200999.7%). Heterogeneity was associated with the proportion of the study sample that injected opioids or was living with HIV infection or hepatitis C. The pooled all-cause SMR, based on 43 cohorts, was 10.0 (95% CI, 7.6-13.2). Excess mortality was observed across a range of causes, including overdose, injuries, and infectious and noncommunicable diseases. Conclusions and Relevance: The findings suggest that people using extramedical opioids experience significant excess mortality, much of which is preventable. The range of causes for which excess mortality was observed highlights the multiplicity of risk exposures experienced by this population and the need for comprehensive responses to address these. Better data on cause-specific mortality in this population in several world regions appear to be needed. ",
        "Evaluation of the Extended-Release/Long-Acting Opioid Prescribing Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy Program by the US Food and Drug Administration: A Review. Importance: Extended-release/long-acting (ER/LA) opioids have caused substantial morbidity and mortality in the United States, yet little is known about the efforts of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and drug manufacturers to reduce adverse outcomes associated with inappropriate prescribing or use. This review of 9739 pages of FDA documents obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request aimed to investigate whether the FDA and ER/LA manufacturers were able to assess the effectiveness of the ER/LA Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) program by evaluating manufacturer REMS assessments and FDA oversight of these assessments. Observations: The REMS program was implemented largely as planned. The FDA's goal was for 60% of ER/LA prescribers to take REMS-adherent continuing education (CE) between 2012 and 2016; 27.6% (88\u202f316 of 320\u202f000) of prescribers had done so by 2016. Audits of REMS programs indicated close adherence to FDA content guidelines except for financial disclosures. Nonrepresentative cross-sectional surveys of self-selected prescribers suggested modestly greater ER/LA knowledge among CE completers than noncompleters, and claims-based surveillance indicated slowly declining ER/LA prescribing, although the contribution of the REMS to these trends could not be assessed. The effectiveness of the REMS program for reducing adverse outcomes also could not be assessed because the analyses used nonrepresentative samples, lacked adequate controls for confounding, and did not link prescribing or clinical outcomes to prescribers' receipt of CE training. Although the FDA had requested studies tracking adverse outcomes as a function of CE training, the FDA concluded that these studies had not been performed as of the 60-month report in 2017. Conclusions and Relevance: Five years after initiation, the FDA and ER/LA manufacturers could not conclude whether the ER/LA REMS had reduced inappropriate prescribing or improved patient outcomes. Alternative observational study designs would have allowed for more rigorous estimates of the program's effectiveness. ",
        "Association Between Automotive Assembly Plant Closures and Opioid Overdose Mortality in the United States: A Difference-in-Differences Analysis. Importance: Fading economic opportunity has been hypothesized to be an important factor associated with the US opioid overdose crisis. Automotive assembly plant closures are culturally significant events that substantially erode local economic opportunities. Objective: To estimate the extent to which automotive assembly plant closures were associated with increasing opioid overdose mortality rates among working-age adults. Design, Setting, and Participants: A county-level difference-in-differences study was conducted among adults aged 18 to 65 years in 112 manufacturing counties located in 30 commuting zones (primarily in the US South and Midwest) with at least 1 operational automotive assembly plant as of 1999. The study analyzed county-level changes from January 1, 1999, to December 31, 2016, in age-adjusted, county-level opioid overdose mortality rates before vs after automotive assembly plant closures in manufacturing counties affected by plant closures compared with changes in manufacturing counties unaffected by plant closures. Data analyses were performed between April 1, 2018, and July 20, 2019. Exposure: Closure of automotive assembly plants in the commuting zone of residence. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was the county-level age-adjusted opioid overdose mortality rate. Secondary outcomes included the overall drug overdose mortality rate and prescription vs illicit drug overdose mortality rates. Results: During the study period, 29 manufacturing counties in 10 commuting zones were exposed to an automotive assembly plant closure, while 83 manufacturing counties in 20 commuting zones remained unexposed. Mean (SD) baseline opioid overdose rates per 100\u202f000 were similar in exposed (0.9 [1.4]) and unexposed (1.0 [2.1]) counties. Automotive assembly plant closures were associated with statistically significant increases in opioid overdose mortality. Five years after a plant closure, mortality rates had increased by 8.6 opioid overdose deaths per 100\u202f000 individuals (95% CI, 2.6-14.6; P\u2009=\u2009.006) in exposed counties compared with unexposed counties, an 85% increase relative to the mortality rate of 12 deaths per 100\u202f000 observed in unexposed counties at the same time point. In analyses stratified by age, sex, and race/ethnicity, the largest increases in opioid overdose mortality were observed among non-Hispanic white men aged 18 to 34 years (20.1 deaths per 100\u202f000; 95% CI, 8.8-31.3; P\u2009=\u2009.001) and aged 35 to 65 years (12.8 deaths per 100\u202f000; 95% CI, 5.7-20.0; P\u2009=\u2009.001). We observed similar patterns of prescription vs illicit drug overdose mortality. Estimates for opioid overdose mortality in nonmanufacturing counties were not statistically significant. Conclusions and Relevance: From 1999 to 2016, automotive assembly plant closures were associated with increases in opioid overdose mortality. These findings highlight the potential importance of eroding economic opportunity as a factor in the US opioid overdose crisis. ",
        "Association of Powder Use in the Genital Area With Risk of Ovarian Cancer. Importance: The relationship between use of powder in the genital area and ovarian cancer is not established. Positive associations reported in case-control studies have not been confirmed in cohort studies. Objective: To estimate the association between use of powder in the genital area and ovarian cancer using prospective observational data. Design, Setting, and Participants: Data were pooled from 4 large, US-based cohorts: Nurses' Health Study (enrollment 1976; follow-up 1982-2016; n\u2009=\u200981\u202f869), Nurses' Health Study II (enrollment 1989; follow-up 2013-2017; n\u2009=\u200961\u202f261), Sister Study (enrollment 2003-2009; follow-up 2003-2017; n\u2009=\u200940\u202f647), and Women's Health Initiative Observational Study (enrollment 1993-1998; follow-up 1993-2017; n\u2009=\u200973\u202f267). Exposures: Ever, long-term (\u226520 years), and frequent (\u22651/week) use of powder in the genital area. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary analysis examined the association between ever use of powder in the genital area and self-reported incident ovarian cancer. Covariate-adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs were estimated using Cox proportional hazards models. Results: The pooled sample included 252\u202f745 women (median age at baseline, 57 years) with 38% self-reporting use of powder in the genital area. Ten percent reported long-term use, and 22% reported frequent use. During a median of 11.2 years of follow-up (3.8 million person-years at risk), 2168 women developed ovarian cancer (58 cases/100\u202f000 person-years). Ovarian cancer incidence was 61 cases/100\u202f000 person-years among ever users and 55 cases/100\u202f000 person-years among never users (estimated risk difference at age 70 years, 0.09% [95% CI, -0.02% to 0.19%]; estimated HR, 1.08 [95% CI, 0.99 to 1.17]). The estimated HR for frequent vs never use was 1.09 (95% CI, 0.97 to 1.23) and for long-term vs never use, the HR was 1.01 (95% CI, 0.82 to 1.25). Subgroup analyses were conducted for 10 variables; the tests for heterogeneity were not statistically significant for any of these comparisons. While the estimated HR for the association between ever use of powder in the genital area and ovarian cancer risk among women with a patent reproductive tract was 1.13 (95% CI, 1.01 to 1.26), the P value for interaction comparing women with vs without patent reproductive tracts was .15. Conclusions and Relevance: In this analysis of pooled data from women in 4 US cohorts, there was not a statistically significant association between use of powder in the genital area and incident ovarian cancer. However, the study may have been underpowered to identify a small increase in risk. ",
        "Effects of acute sleep loss on diurnal plasma dynamics of CNS health biomarkers in young men. Objective: Disrupted sleep increases CSF levels of tau and \u03b2-amyloid (A\u03b2) and is associated with an increased risk of Alzheimer disease (AD). Our aim was to determine whether acute sleep loss alters diurnal profiles of plasma-based AD-associated biomarkers. . Methods: In a 2-condition crossover study, 15 healthy young men participated in 2 standardized sedentary in-laboratory conditions in randomized order: normal sleep vs overnight sleep loss. Plasma levels of total tau (t-tau), A\u03b240, A\u03b242, neurofilament light chain (NfL), and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) were assessed using ultrasensitive single molecule array assays or ELISAs, in the fasted state in the evening prior to, and in the morning after, each intervention. . Results: In response to sleep loss (+17.2%), compared with normal sleep (+1.8%), the evening to morning ratio was increased for t-tau (p = 0.035). No changes between the sleep conditions were seen for levels of A\u03b240, A\u03b242, NfL, or GFAP (all p > 0.10). The AD risk genotype rs4420638 did not significantly interact with sleep loss-related diurnal changes in plasma levels of A\u03b240 or A\u03b242 (p > 0.10). Plasma levels of A\u03b242 (-17.1%) and GFAP (-12.1%) exhibited an evening to morning decrease across conditions (p < 0.05). . Conclusions: Our exploratory study suggests that acute sleep loss results in increased blood levels of t-tau. These changes provide further evidence that sleep loss may have detrimental effects on brain health even in younger individuals. Larger cohorts are warranted to delineate sleep vs circadian mechanisms, implications for long-term recurrent conditions (e.g., in shift workers), as well as interactions with other lifestyle and genetic factors.

        "Association of Frequency of Organic Food Consumption With Cancer Risk: Findings From the NutriNet-Sant\u00e9 Prospective Cohort Study. Importance: Although organic foods are less likely to contain pesticide residues than conventional foods, few studies have examined the association of organic food consumption with cancer risk. Objective: To prospectively investigate the association between organic food consumption and the risk of cancer in a large cohort of French adults. Design, Setting, and Participants: In this population-based prospective cohort study among French adult volunteers, data were included from participants with available information on organic food consumption frequency and dietary intake. For 16 products, participants reported their consumption frequency of labeled organic foods (never, occasionally, or most of the time). An organic food score was then computed (range, 0-32 points). The follow-up dates were May 10, 2009, to November 30, 2016. Main Outcomes and Measures: This study estimated the risk of cancer in association with the organic food score (modeled as quartiles) using Cox proportional hazards regression models adjusted for potential cancer risk factors. Results: Among 68\u202f946 participants (78.0% female; mean [SD] age at baseline, 44.2 [14.5] years), 1340 first incident cancer cases were identified during follow-up, with the most prevalent being 459 breast cancers, 180 prostate cancers, 135 skin cancers, 99 colorectal cancers, 47 non-Hodgkin lymphomas, and 15 other lymphomas. High organic food scores were inversely associated with the overall risk of cancer (hazard ratio for quartile 4 vs quartile 1, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.63-0.88; P for trend\u2009=\u2009.001; absolute risk reduction, 0.6%; hazard ratio for a 5-point increase, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.88-0.96). Conclusions and Relevance: A higher frequency of organic food consumption was associated with a reduced risk of cancer. If these findings are confirmed, further research is necessary to determine the underlying factors involved in this association. ",
        "Multifeature analyses of vascular cambial cells reveal longevity mechanisms in old Ginkgo biloba trees. Aging is a universal property of multicellular organisms. Although some tree species can live for centuries or millennia, the molecular and metabolic mechanisms underlying their longevity are unclear. To address this, we investigated age-related changes in the vascular cambium from 15- to 667-y-old Ginkgo biloba trees. The ring width decreased sharply during the first 100 to 200 y, with only a slight change after 200 y of age, accompanied by decreasing numbers of cambial cell layers. In contrast, average basal area increment (BAI) continuously increased with aging, showing that the lateral meristem can retain indeterminacy in old trees. The indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) concentration in cambial cells decreased with age, whereas the content of abscisic acid (ABA) increased significantly. In addition, cell division-, cell expansion-, and differentiation-related genes exhibited significantly lower expression in old trees, especially miR166 and HD-ZIP III interaction networks involved in cambial activity. Disease resistance-associated genes retained high expression in old trees, along with genes associated with synthesis of preformed protective secondary metabolites. Comprehensive evaluation of the expression of genes related to autophagy, senescence, and age-related miRNAs, together with analysis of leaf photosynthetic efficiencies and seed germination rates, demonstrated that the old trees are still in a healthy, mature state, and senescence is not manifested at the whole-plant level. Taken together, our results reveal that long-lived trees have evolved compensatory mechanisms to maintain a balance between growth and aging processes. This involves continued cambial divisions, high expression of resistance-associated genes, and continued synthetic capacity of preformed protective secondary metabolites. ",
        "What is the Current Knowledge About the Cardiovascular Risk for Users of Cannabis-Based Products? A Systematic Review. PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The purpose of the study was to examine the published evidence on the cardiovascular risk related to the use of cannabis-based products by performing a systematic review of recent literature. RECENT FINDINGS: The World Health Organization (WHO) emphasizes that cannabis use represents a risky behavior as it may lead to many adverse effects, and in particular, cardiovascular effects. A systematic review of articles published between January 1, 2011 and May 31, 2016 was performed in agreement with the PRISMA statement. Articles presenting data on humans exposed to cannabis-based products and suffering from any cardiovascular condition were eligible for inclusion. The inclusion process was based on a search algorithm and performed in a blinded standardized manner. Overall, 826 articles were found in the literature search, 115 of which remained after performing the inclusion procedure. These were 81 case reports, 29 observational studies, 3 clinical trials, and 2 experimental studies. A total of 116 individuals was the subject of case reports. The mean age was 31 years (95%CI = 29-34), and patients were more frequently men (81.9%) than women (18.1%). They mainly suffered from ischemic strokes or myocardial infarctions. Data provided by the 29 included observational studies evidenced an association between exposure to cannabis-based products and cardiovascular disease. Currently, this evidence is stronger for ischemic strokes than for any other cardiovascular diseases. While the data are limited, there is some suggestion that cannabis use may have negative cardiovascular consequences, particularly at large doses. ",
        "The Las Vegas mass shooting: An analysis of blood component administration and blood bank donations. BACKGROUND: The deadliest mass shooting in modern United States history occurred on October 1, 2017, in Las Vegas, killing 58 and overwhelming hospitals with more than 600 injured. The scope of the tragedy offers insight into medical demands, which may help guide preparedness for future mass shooting incidents. METHODS: Retrospective, deidentified, health care institution-provided data from all hospitals and blood banks providing care to Las Vegas shooting victims were gathered. Study authors independently reviewed all data and cross-referenced it for verification. Main outcomes and measures include the number of victims requiring hospital and intensive care admission, the amount and types of blood components transfused during the first 24 hours, and the amount of blood donated to local blood banks following the Las Vegas mass shooting. RESULTS: Two hundred twenty patients required hospital admission, 68 of them to critical care. Nearly 500 blood components were transfused during the first 24 hours in a red blood cell-to-plasma-to-platelet ratio of 1:0.54:0.81. Public citizens donated almost 800 units of blood immediately after the shooting; greater than 17% of this donated blood went unused. CONCLUSIONS: The amount of blood components transfused per patient admitted was similar in magnitude to other mass casualty events, and available blood supply met patient demand. The public call for blood donors was not necessary to meet immediate demand and led to resource waste. Preparation for future mass shooting incidents should include training the community in hemorrhage control, encouraging routine blood donation, and avoiding public calls for blood donation unless approved by local blood suppliers. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic study, level V. ",
        "Health-motivated taxes on red and processed meat: A modelling study on optimal tax levels and associated health impacts. BACKGROUND: The consumption of red and processed meat has been associated with increased mortality from chronic diseases, and as a result, it has been classified by the World Health Organization as carcinogenic (processed meat) and probably carcinogenic (red meat) to humans. One policy response is to regulate red and processed meat consumption similar to other carcinogens and foods of public health concerns. Here we describe a market-based approach of taxing red and processed meat according to its health impacts. METHODS: We calculated economically optimal tax levels for 149 world regions that would account for (internalize) the health costs associated with ill-health from red and processed meat consumption, and we used a coupled modelling framework to estimate the impacts of optimal taxation on consumption, health costs, and non-communicable disease mortality. Health impacts were estimated using a global comparative risk assessment framework, and economic responses were estimated using international data on health costs, prices, and price elasticities. FINDINGS: The health-related costs to society attributable to red and processed meat consumption in 2020 amounted to USD 285 billion (sensitivity intervals based on epidemiological uncertainty (SI), 93-431), three quarters of which were due to processed meat consumption. Under optimal taxation, prices for processed meat increased by 25% on average, ranging from 1% in low-income countries to over 100% in high-income countries, and prices for red meat increased by 4%, ranging from 0.2% to over 20%. Consumption of processed meat decreased by 16% on average, ranging from 1% to 25%, whilst red meat consumption remained stable as substitution for processed meat compensated price-related reductions. The number of deaths attributable to red and processed meat consumption decreased by 9% (222,000; SI, 38,000-357,000), and attributable health costs decreased by 14% (USD 41 billion; SI, 10-57) globally, in each case with greatest reductions in high and middle-income countries. INTERPRETATION: Including the social health cost of red and processed meat consumption in the price of red and processed meat could lead to significant health and environmental benefits, in particular in high and middle-income countries. The optimal tax levels estimated in this study are context-specific and can complement the simple rules of thumb currently used for setting health-motivated tax levels. ",
        "Sex differences in risk factors for myocardial infarction: cohort study of UK Biobank participants. OBJECTIVES: To investigate sex differences in risk factors for incident myocardial infarction (MI) and whether they vary with age. DESIGN: Prospective population based study. SETTING: UK Biobank. PARTICIPANTS: 471\u2009998 participants (56% women; mean age 56.2) with no history of cardiovascular disease. . MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Incident (fatal and non-fatal) MI. RESULTS: 5081 participants (1463 (28.8%) of whom were women) had MI over seven years' mean follow-up, resulting in an incidence per 10\u2009000 person years of 7.76 (95% confidence interval 7.37 to 8.16) for women and 24.35 (23.57 to 25.16) for men. Higher blood pressure indices, smoking intensity, body mass index, and the presence of diabetes were associated with an increased risk of MI in men and women, but associations were attenuated with age. In women, systolic blood pressure and hypertension, smoking status and intensity, and diabetes were associated with higher hazard ratios for MI compared with men: ratio of hazard ratios 1.09 (95% confidence interval 1.02 to 1.16) for systolic blood pressure, 1.55 (1.32 to 1.83) for current smoking, 2.91 (1.56 to 5.45) for type 1 diabetes, and 1.47 (1.16 to 1.87) for type 2 diabetes. There was no evidence that any of these ratios of hazard ratios decreased with age (P>0.2). With the exception of type 1 diabetes, the incidence of MI was higher in men than in women for all risk factors. CONCLUSIONS: Although the incidence of MI was higher in men than in women, several risk factors were more strongly associated with MI in women compared with men. Sex specific associations between risk factors and MI declined with age, but, where it occurred, the higher relative risk in women remained. As the population ages and the prevalence of lifestyle associated risk factors increase, the incidence of MI in women will likely become more similar to that in men. ",
        "Effects of a low carbohydrate diet on energy expenditure during weight loss maintenance: randomized trial. OBJECTIVE: To determine the effects of diets varying in carbohydrate to fat ratio on total energy expenditure. DESIGN: Randomized trial. SETTING: Multicenter collaboration at US two sites, August 2014 to May 2017. PARTICIPANTS: 164 adults aged 18-65 years with a body mass index of 25 or more. INTERVENTIONS: After 12% (within 2%) weight loss on a run-in diet, participants were randomly assigned to one of three test diets according to carbohydrate content (high, 60%, n=54; moderate, 40%, n=53; or low, 20%, n=57) for 20 weeks. Test diets were controlled for protein and were energy adjusted to maintain weight loss within 2 kg. To test for effect modification predicted by the carbohydrate-insulin model, the sample was divided into thirds of pre-weight loss insulin secretion (insulin concentration 30 minutes after oral glucose). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was total energy expenditure, measured with doubly labeled water, by intention-to-treat analysis. Per protocol analysis included participants who maintained target weight loss, potentially providing a more precise effect estimate. Secondary outcomes were resting energy expenditure, measures of physical activity, and levels of the metabolic hormones leptin and ghrelin. RESULTS: Total energy expenditure differed by diet in the intention-to-treat analysis (n=162, P=0.002), with a linear trend of 52 kcal/d (95% confidence interval 23 to 82) for every 10% decrease in the contribution of carbohydrate to total energy intake (1 kcal=4.18 kJ=0.00418 MJ). Change in total energy expenditure was 91 kcal/d (95% confidence interval -29 to 210) greater in participants assigned to the moderate carbohydrate diet and 209 kcal/d (91 to 326) greater in those assigned to the low carbohydrate diet compared with the high carbohydrate diet. In the per protocol analysis (n=120, P<0.001), the respective differences were 131 kcal/d (-6 to 267) and 278 kcal/d (144 to 411). Among participants in the highest third of pre-weight loss insulin secretion, the difference between the low and high carbohydrate diet was 308 kcal/d in the intention-to-treat analysis and 478 kcal/d in the per protocol analysis (P<0.004). Ghrelin was significantly lower in participants assigned to the low carbohydrate diet compared with those assigned to the high carbohydrate diet (both analyses). Leptin was also significantly lower in participants assigned to the low carbohydrate diet (per protocol). CONCLUSIONS: Consistent with the carbohydrate-insulin model, lowering dietary carbohydrate increased energy expenditure during weight loss maintenance. This metabolic effect may improve the success of obesity treatment, especially among those with high insulin secretion. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02068885. ",
        "Identifying facial phenotypes of genetic disorders using deep learning. Syndromic genetic conditions, in aggregate, affect 8% of the population1. Many syndromes have recognizable facial features2 that are highly informative to clinical geneticists3-5. Recent studies show that facial analysis technologies measured up to the capabilities of expert clinicians in syndrome identification6-9. However, these technologies identified only a few disease phenotypes, limiting their role in clinical settings, where hundreds of diagnoses must be considered. Here we present a facial image analysis framework, DeepGestalt, using computer vision and deep-learning algorithms, that quantifies similarities to hundreds of syndromes. DeepGestalt outperformed clinicians in three initial experiments, two with the goal of distinguishing subjects with a target syndrome from other syndromes, and one of separating different genetic subtypes in Noonan syndrome. On the final experiment reflecting a real clinical setting problem, DeepGestalt achieved 91% top-10 accuracy in identifying the correct syndrome on 502 different images. The model was trained on a dataset of over 17,000 images representing more than 200 syndromes, curated through a community-driven phenotyping platform. DeepGestalt potentially adds considerable value to phenotypic evaluations in clinical genetics, genetic testing, research and precision medicine.",
        "Association of body mass index and waist-to-hip ratio with brain structure: UK Biobank study. OBJECTIVE: To examine the association of body mass index (BMI) and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) with brain volume. METHODS: We used cross-sectional data from the UK Biobank study (n = 9,652, age 55.4 \u00b1 7.5 years, 47.9% men). Measures included BMI, WHR, and total fat mass as ascertained from bioimpedance. Brain images were produced with structural MRI. RESULTS: After adjustment for a range of covariates, higher levels of all obesity measures were related to lower gray matter volume: BMI per 1 SD (\u03b2 coefficient -4,113, 95% confidence interval [CI] -4,862 to -3,364), WHR (\u03b2 coefficient -4,272, 95% CI -5,280 to -3,264), and fat mass (\u03b2 coefficient -4,590, 95% CI -5,386 to -3,793). The combination of overall obesity (BMI \u226530 kg/m2) and central obesity (WHR >0.85 for women, >0.90 for men) was associated with the lowest gray matter compared with that in lean adults. In hypothesis-free testing with a Bonferroni correction, obesity was also related to various regional brain volumes, including caudate, putamen, pallidum, and nucleus accumbens. No associations between obesity and white matter were apparent. CONCLUSION: The combination of heightened BMI and WHR may be an important risk factor for gray matter atrophy. ",
        "Gastroschisis Trends and Ecologic Link to Opioid Prescription Rates \u2014 United States, 2006\u20132015. Prevalence of gastroschisis, a serious birth defect of the abdominal wall resulting in some of the abdominal contents extending outside the body at birth, has been increasing worldwide (1,2). Gastroschisis requires surgical repair after birth and is associated with digestive and feeding complications during infancy, which can affect development. Recent data from 14 U.S. states indicated an increasing prevalence of gastroschisis from 1995 to 2012 (1). Young maternal age has been strongly associated with gastroschisis, but research suggests that risk factors such as smoking, genitourinary infections, and prescription opioid use also might be associated (3-5). Data from 20 population-based state surveillance programs were pooled and analyzed to assess age-specific gastroschisis prevalence during two 5-year periods, 2006-2010 and 2011-2015, and an ecologic approach was used to compare annual gastroschisis prevalence by annual opioid prescription rate categories. Gastroschisis prevalence increased only slightly (10%) from 2006-2010 to 2011-2015 (prevalence ratio = 1.1, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.0-1.1), with the highest prevalence among mothers aged <20 years. During 2006-2015, the prevalence of gastroschisis was 1.6 times higher in counties with high opioid prescription rates (5.1 per 10,000 live births; CI = 4.9-5.3) and 1.4 times higher where opioid prescription rates were medium (4.6 per 10,000 live births; CI = 4.4-4.8) compared with areas with low prescription rates (3.2 per 10,000 live births; CI = 3.1-3.4). Public health research is needed to understand factors contributing to the association between young maternal age and gastroschisis and assess the effect of prescription opioid use during pregnancy on this pregnancy outcome.

        "Associations between 24 hour movement behaviours and global cognition in US children: a cross-sectional observational study. BACKGROUND: Childhood and adolescence are crucial periods for brain development, and the behaviours during a typical 24 h period contribute to cognitive performance. The Canadian 24-Hour Movement Guidelines for Children and Youth recommend at least 60 min physical activity per day, 2 h or less recreational screen time per day, and 9-11 h sleep per night in children aged 8-11 years. We investigated the relationship between adherence to these recommendations and global cognition. METHODS: In this cross-sectional observational study, we obtained data from the first annual curated release of the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development study, a 10-year longitudinal, observational study. Data were collected from 21 study sites across the USA between Sept 1, 2016, and Sept 15, 2017. The participants were 4524 US children aged 8-11 years from 20 study sites. Exposures of interest were adherence to the physical activity, recreational screen time, and sleep duration guideline recommendations. The primary outcome was global cognition, assessed with the NIH Toolbox (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA), which we analysed with multivariable linear mixed-effects models to examine the relations with movement behaviour variables. FINDINGS: Complete movement behaviour data were available for 4520 participants. The mean number of guideline recommendations met was 1\u00b71 (SD 0\u00b79). Overall, 2303 (51%) participants met the sleep recommendation, 1655 (37%) met screen time, and 793 (18%) met the physical activity recommendation. 3190 (71%) participants met at least one recommendation, whereas 216 (5%) of participants met all three recommendations. Global cognition was positively associated with each additional recommendation met (\u03b2=1\u00b744, 95% CI 0\u00b782-2\u00b707, p<0\u00b70001). Compared with meeting none of the recommendations, associations with superior global cognition were found in participants who met all three recommendations (\u03b2=3\u00b789, 95% CI 1\u00b743 to 6\u00b734, p=0\u00b70019), the screen time recommendation only (\u03b2=4\u00b725, 2\u00b750-6\u00b701, p<0\u00b70001), and both the screen time and the sleep recommendations (\u03b2=5\u00b715, 3\u00b756-6\u00b774, p<0\u00b70001). INTERPRETATION: Meeting the 24 h movement recommendations was associated with superior global cognition. These findings highlight the importance of limiting recreational screen time and encouraging healthy sleep to improve cognition in children. FUNDING: National Institutes of Health. ",
        "Porphyromonas gingivalis in Alzheimer's disease brains: Evidence for disease causation and treatment with small-molecule inhibitors. Porphyromonas gingivalis, the keystone pathogen in chronic periodontitis, was identified in the brain of Alzheimer's disease patients. Toxic proteases from the bacterium called gingipains were also identified in the brain of Alzheimer's patients, and levels correlated with tau and ubiquitin pathology. Oral P. gingivalis infection in mice resulted in brain colonization and increased production of A\u03b21-42, a component of amyloid plaques. Further, gingipains were neurotoxic in vivo and in vitro, exerting detrimental effects on tau, a protein needed for normal neuronal function. To block this neurotoxicity, we designed and synthesized small-molecule inhibitors targeting gingipains. Gingipain inhibition reduced the bacterial load of an established P. gingivalis brain infection, blocked A\u03b21-42 production, reduced neuroinflammation, and rescued neurons in the hippocampus. These data suggest that gingipain inhibitors could be valuable for treating P. gingivalis brain colonization and neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease. ",
        "Injuries Associated With Standing Electric Scooter Use. Importance: Since September 2017, standing electric scooters have proliferated rapidly as an inexpensive, easy mode of transportation. Although there are regulations for safe riding established by both electric scooter companies and local governments, public common use practices and the incidence and types of injuries associated with these standing electric scooters are unknown. Objective: To characterize injuries associated with standing electric scooter use, the clinical outcomes of injured patients, and common use practices in the first US metropolitan area to experience adoption of this technology. Design, Setting, and Participants: This study of a case series used retrospective cohort medical record review of all patients presenting with injuries associated with standing electric scooter use between September 1, 2017, and August 31, 2018, at 2 urban emergency departments associated with an academic medical center in Southern California. All electric scooter riders at selected public intersections in the community surrounding the 2 hospitals were also observed during a 7-hour observation period in September 2018. Main Outcomes and Measures: Incidence and characteristics of injuries and observation of riders' common use practices. Results: Two hundred forty-nine patients (145 [58.2%] male; mean [SD] age, 33.7 [15.3] years) presented to the emergency department with injuries associated with standing electric scooter use during the study period. Two hundred twenty-eight (91.6%) were injured as riders and 21 (8.4%) as nonriders. Twenty-seven patients were younger than 18 years (10.8%). Ten riders (4.4%) were documented as having worn a helmet, and 12 patients (4.8%) had either a blood alcohol level greater than 0.05% or were perceived to be intoxicated by a physician. Frequent injuries included fractures (79 [31.7%]), head injury (100 [40.2%]), and contusions, sprains, and lacerations without fracture or head injury (69 [27.7%]). The majority of patients (234 [94.0%]) were discharged home from the emergency department; of the 15 admitted patients, 2 had severe injuries and were admitted to the intensive care unit. Among 193 observed electric scooter riders in the local community in September 2018, 182 (94.3%) were not wearing a helmet. Conclusions and Relevance: Injuries associated with standing electric scooter use are a new phenomenon and vary in severity. In this study, helmet use was low and a significant subset of injuries occurred in patients younger than 18 years, the minimum age permitted by private scooter company regulations. These findings may inform public policy regarding standing electric scooter use. ",
        "Public Meets Private: Conversations Between Coca\u2010Cola and the CDC. Policy Points: There is growing understanding of how manufacturers of harmful products influence health policy. The strategies, approaches, and influences from such manufacturers that are detrimental to health have been termed the \"corporate\" or \"commercial\" determinants of health. However, while partnerships with the tobacco industry are clearly unacceptable for public health organizations, ties to other industries continue to be pursued. Such partnerships may influence health organizations in a number of ways detrimental to population health. However, with the exception of tobacco industry tactics as revealed by internal documents, we know relatively little about how this influence operates. This article uses emails between the Coca-Cola Company and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which we obtained through Freedom of Information Act requests, to explore the nature of corporate influence, conflicts of interest, and lobbying \"in their own words,\" and highlights the need for greater transparency and clearer policies on engaging with such industries. CONTEXT: There is a continuing debate about the appropriateness of contacts between manufacturers of some harmful products and health researchers, as well as practitioners and policymakers. Some argue that such contacts may be a means of exerting undue influence, while others present them as an opportunity to pursue shared health goals. This article examines interactions between the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Coca-Cola Company (Coca-Cola) as revealed by communications obtained through Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests. METHODS: We sent 10 US FOIA requests in 2016/2017 for communications between employees at the CDC and Coca-Cola. We then performed a thematic content analysis of the documents provided. FINDINGS: Of our 10 FOIA requests, 3 requests are still pending (at the time of this publication); 5 were rejected as too broad or because no records were found; and 3 returned 295 pages from 86 emails. The CDC withheld 102 pages to \"protect commercial or financial information which is privileged or confidential.\" The returned emails demonstrate three main themes in Coca-Cola's contact with CDC employees: to gain and expand access, to lobby, and to shift attention and blame away from sugar-sweetened beverages. CONCLUSIONS: The emails we obtained using FOIA requests reveal efforts by Coca-Cola to lobby the CDC to advance corporate objectives rather than health, including to influence the World Health Organization. Our findings provide a rare example of the ways in which corporate interests attempt to influence public health practitioners \"in their own words,\" and they demonstrate a need for clearer policies on avoiding partnerships with manufacturers of harmful products.

        "Effect of Intensive vs Standard Blood Pressure Control on Probable Dementia: A Randomized Clinical Trial. Importance: There are currently no proven treatments to reduce the risk of mild cognitive impairment and dementia. Objective: To evaluate the effect of intensive blood pressure control on risk of dementia. Design, Setting, and Participants: Randomized clinical trial conducted at 102 sites in the United States and Puerto Rico among adults aged 50 years or older with hypertension but without diabetes or history of stroke. Randomization began on November 8, 2010. The trial was stopped early for benefit on its primary outcome (a composite of cardiovascular events) and all-cause mortality on August 20, 2015. The final date for follow-up of cognitive outcomes was July 22, 2018. Interventions: Participants were randomized to a systolic blood pressure goal of either less than 120 mm Hg (intensive treatment group; n\u2009=\u20094678) or less than 140 mm Hg (standard treatment group; n\u2009=\u20094683). Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary cognitive outcome was occurrence of adjudicated probable dementia. Secondary cognitive outcomes included adjudicated mild cognitive impairment and a composite outcome of mild cognitive impairment or probable dementia. Results: Among 9361 randomized participants (mean age, 67.9 years; 3332 women [35.6%]), 8563 (91.5%) completed at least 1 follow-up cognitive assessment. The median intervention period was 3.34 years. During a total median follow-up of 5.11 years, adjudicated probable dementia occurred in 149 participants in the intensive treatment group vs 176 in the standard treatment group (7.2 vs 8.6 cases per 1000 person-years; hazard ratio [HR], 0.83; 95% CI, 0.67-1.04). Intensive BP control significantly reduced the risk of mild cognitive impairment (14.6 vs 18.3 cases per 1000 person-years; HR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.69-0.95) and the combined rate of mild cognitive impairment or probable dementia (20.2 vs 24.1 cases per 1000 person-years; HR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.74-0.97). Conclusions and Relevance: Among ambulatory adults with hypertension, treating to a systolic blood pressure goal of less than 120 mm Hg compared with a goal of less than 140 mm Hg did not result in a significant reduction in the risk of probable dementia. Because of early study termination and fewer than expected cases of dementia, the study may have been underpowered for this end point. Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01206062.

        "Emerging cancer trends among young adults in the USA: analysis of a population-based cancer registry. BACKGROUND: Cancer trends in young adults, often under 50 years, reflect recent changes in carcinogenic exposures, which could foreshadow the future overall disease burden. Previous studies reported an increase in early onset colorectal cancer, which could partly reflect the obesity epidemic. We examined age-specific contemporary incidence trends in the USA for 30 common cancers, including 12 obesity-related cancers. METHODS: We obtained incidence data for invasive cancers among people aged 25-84 years diagnosed from Jan 1, 1995, to Dec 31, 2014, for 25 population-based state registries in the USA. All patients in the registry were included in the analyses. We considered the 20 most common cancer types and 12 obesity-related cancers (30 cancer types in total). We used age-period-cohort modelling to estimate average annual percentage change in incidence rates by 5-year age group (25-29 years to 80-84 years in 5-year increments) and incidence rate ratios (IRR) by birth cohort (10-year overlapping birth cohorts from 1910-19 to 1980-89 in 5-year increments). No exclusion criteria were applied after including all invasive cancer cases based on age group and diagnosis year. FINDINGS: From 1995 to 2014 there were 14\u2008672\u2008409 incident cases for 30 types of cancer. Incidence significantly increased for six of 12 obesity-related cancers (multiple myeloma, colorectal, uterine corpus, gallbladder, kidney, and pancreatic cancer) in young adults (25-49 years) with steeper rises in successively younger generations. Annual increases ranged from 1\u00b744% (95% CI -0\u00b760 to 3\u00b753) for multiple myeloma to 6\u00b723% (5\u00b732-7\u00b714) for kidney cancer at age 25-29 years, and ranged from 0\u00b737% (0\u00b703-0\u00b772) for uterine corpus cancer to 2\u00b795% (2\u00b774-3\u00b716) for kidney cancer at age 45-49 years. Compared with people born around 1950, IRRs for those born around 1985 ranged from 1\u00b759 (95% CI 1\u00b714-2\u00b721) for multiple myeloma to 4\u00b791 (4\u00b727-5\u00b765) for kidney cancer. Conversely, incidence in young adults increased in successively younger generations for only two cancers (gastric non-cardia cancer and leukaemia), and decreased for eight of the 18 additional cancers, including smoking and HIV infection-associated cancers. INTERPRETATION: The risk of developing an obesity-related cancer seems to be increasing in a stepwise manner in successively younger birth cohorts in the USA. Further studies are needed to elucidate exposures responsible for these emerging trends, including excess bodyweight and other risk factors. ",
        "Prevalence and Sociodemographic Correlates of Adolescent Use and Polyuse of Combustible, Vaporized, and Edible Cannabis Products. Importance: Cannabis legalization and commercialization have introduced novel alternative cannabis products, including edible and vaporized cannabis that might appeal to youth and be associated with polyuse (ie, use of \u22652 different products). Objective: To investigate the prevalence, patterns, and sociodemographic correlates of cannabis product use across combustible, edible, and vaporized administration methods, including polyuse of cannabis via multiple administration methods. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cross-sectional survey study included 10th-grade students from 10 Los Angeles, California, area high schools from January 2 through October 6, 2015. Students were recruited from respondents in the Happiness and Health Study, an ongoing prospective cohort study in the 10 high schools. Students not in school during administration of the pencil-and-paper survey completed abbreviated surveys by telephone, internet, or mail. Data were analyzed from July 17, 2017, through July 12, 2018. Exposures: Self-reported sex, race/ethnicity, and socioeconomic status (SES). Students with high SES had parents who attained college or a higher educational level and were ineligible for free or subsidized lunch; those with low SES had parents with lower educational attainment or were eligible for free or subsidized lunch. Main Outcomes and Measures: Self-report of ever use (yes or no) and past 30-day use (yes or no) status and frequency of use (days in past 30 days) of combustible, edible, and vaporized cannabis. Results: The sample included 3177 tenth-grade students (93.5% of study enrollees); among these students, 1715 (54.0%) were girls and the mean (SD) age was 16.1 (0.4) years. Among those with available demographic data, respondents were diverse in race/ethnicity (537 [17.2%] Asian; 149 [4.8%] black; 1510 [48.3%] Hispanic; 507 [16.2%] white; 207 [6.6%] multiethnic/multiracial; and 216 [6.9%] other) and included 1654 (60.1%) with a low SES. Prevalence of ever use was highest for combustible products (993 [31.3%]), followed by edible (676 [21.3%]) and vaporized (333 [10.5%]) products. A similar pattern was found for past 30-day use (426 [13.4%] for combustible, 249 [7.8%] for edible, and 156 [4.9%] for vaporized cannabis). Among participants who reported using cannabis in the past 30 days, mean frequency of use of combustible cannabis was higher by 2.65 days (95% CI, 1.40-3.91 days, P\u2009=\u2009.001) than the mean frequency of use for edible cannabis and 1.75 days higher (95% CI, 0.59-2.90 days, P\u2009=\u2009.003) than frequency of use for vaporized cannabis. Most cannabis users (665 [61.7%]) used multiple administration methods, and 260 (8.2%) used all 3 methods. Boys had higher prevalence of ever use for vaporized (170 [11.6%] vs 163 [9.5%]) but not combustible (459 [31.4%] vs 534 [31.1%]) or edible (303 [20.7%] vs 373 [21.7%]) cannabis. Respondents with low SES had higher prevalence of ever use for combustible (614 [37.1%] vs 242 [22.0%]) and edible (408 [24.7%] vs 166 [15.1%]) but not vaporized (186 [11.2%] vs 93 [8.5%]) cannabis. Conclusions and Relevance: Among 10th-grade students in Los Angeles, use of cannabis via alternative administration methods was of appreciable prevalence, predominately reported in conjunction with other cannabis products and unequally distributed across sociodemographic strata. Prevention programs and regulatory restrictions addressing the spectrum of cannabis products might benefit pediatric public health. ",
        "Exposure to glyphosate-based herbicides and risk for non-Hodgkin lymphoma: A meta-analysis and supporting evidence. Glyphosate is the most widely used broad-spectrum systemic herbicide in the world. Recent evaluations of the carcinogenic potential of glyphosate-based herbicides (GBHs) by various regional, national, and international agencies have engendered controversy. We investigated whether there was an association between high cumulative exposures to GBHs and increased risk of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) in humans. We conducted a new meta-analysis that includes the most recent update of the Agricultural Health Study (AHS) cohort published in 2018 along with five case-control studies. Using the highest exposure groups when available in each study, we report the overall meta-relative risk (meta-RR) of NHL in GBH-exposed individuals was increased by 41% (meta-RR\u2009=\u20091.41, 95% confidence interval, CI: 1.13-1.75). For comparison, we also performed a secondary meta-analysis using high-exposure groups with the earlier AHS (2005), and we calculated a meta-RR for NHL of 1.45 (95% CI: 1.11-1.91), which was higher than the meta-RRs reported previously. Multiple sensitivity tests conducted to assess the validity of our findings did not reveal meaningful differences from our primary estimated meta-RR. To contextualize our findings of an increased NHL risk in individuals with high GBH exposure, we reviewed publicly available animal and mechanistic studies related to lymphoma. We documented further support from studies of malignant lymphoma incidence in mice treated with pure glyphosate, as well as potential links between glyphosate / GBH exposure and immunosuppression, endocrine disruption, and genetic alterations that are commonly associated with NHL or lymphomagenesis. Overall, in accordance with findings from experimental animal and mechanistic studies, our current meta-analysis of human epidemiological studies suggests a compelling link between exposures to GBHs and increased risk for NHL.

        "Rapidly declining remarkability of temperature anomalies may obscure public perception of climate change. The changing global climate is producing increasingly unusual weather relative to preindustrial conditions. In an absolute sense, these changing conditions constitute direct evidence of anthropogenic climate change. However, human evaluation of weather as either normal or abnormal will also be influenced by a range of factors including expectations, memory limitations, and cognitive biases. Here we show that experience of weather in recent years-rather than longer historical periods-determines the climatic baseline against which current weather is evaluated, potentially obscuring public recognition of anthropogenic climate change. We employ variation in decadal trends in temperature at weekly and county resolution over the continental United States, combined with discussion of the weather drawn from over 2 billion social media posts. These data indicate that the remarkability of particular temperatures changes rapidly with repeated exposure. Using sentiment analysis tools, we provide evidence for a \"boiling frog\" effect: The declining noteworthiness of historically extreme temperatures is not accompanied by a decline in the negative sentiment that they induce, indicating that social normalization of extreme conditions rather than adaptation is driving these results. Using climate model projections we show that, despite large increases in absolute temperature, anomalies relative to our empirically estimated shifting baseline are small and not clearly distinguishable from zero throughout the 21st century.

        "Genetic meta-analysis of diagnosed Alzheimer\u2019s disease identifies new risk loci and implicates A\u03b2, tau, immunity and lipid processing. Risk for late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD), the most prevalent dementia, is partially driven by genetics. To identify LOAD risk loci, we performed a large genome-wide association meta-analysis of clinically diagnosed LOAD (94,437 individuals). We confirm 20 previous LOAD risk loci and identify five new genome-wide loci (IQCK, ACE, ADAM10, ADAMTS1, and WWOX), two of which (ADAM10, ACE) were identified in a recent genome-wide association (GWAS)-by-familial-proxy of Alzheimer's or dementia. Fine-mapping of the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) region confirms the neurological and immune-mediated disease haplotype HLA-DR15 as a risk factor for LOAD. Pathway analysis implicates immunity, lipid metabolism, tau binding proteins, and amyloid precursor protein (APP) metabolism, showing that genetic variants affecting APP and A\u03b2 processing are associated not only with early-onset autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease but also with LOAD. Analyses of risk genes and pathways show enrichment for rare variants (P = 1.32 \u00d7 10-7), indicating that additional rare variants remain to be identified. We also identify important genetic correlations between LOAD and traits such as family history of dementia and education. ",
        "HIV-1 remission following CCR5\u039432/\u039432 haematopoietic stem-cell transplantation. A cure for HIV-1 remains unattainable as only one case has been reported, a decade ago1,2. The individual-who is known as the 'Berlin patient'-underwent two allogeneic haematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (HSCT) procedures using a donor with a homozygous mutation in the HIV coreceptor CCR5 (CCR5\u039432/\u039432) to treat his acute myeloid leukaemia. Total body irradiation was given with each HSCT. Notably, it is unclear which treatment or patient parameters contributed to this case of long-term HIV remission. Here we show that HIV-1 remission may be possible with a less aggressive and toxic approach. An adult infected with HIV-1 underwent allogeneic HSCT for Hodgkin's lymphoma using cells from a CCR5\u039432/\u039432 donor. He experienced mild gut graft-versus-host disease. Antiretroviral therapy was interrupted 16 months after transplantation. HIV-1 remission has been maintained over a further 18 months. Plasma HIV-1 RNA has been undetectable at less than one copy per millilitre along with undetectable HIV-1 DNA in peripheral CD4 T lymphocytes. Quantitative viral outgrowth assays from peripheral CD4 T lymphocytes show no reactivatable virus using a total of 24 million resting CD4 T cells. CCR5-tropic, but not CXCR4-tropic, viruses were identified in HIV-1 DNA from CD4 T cells of the patient before the transplant. CD4 T cells isolated from peripheral blood after transplantation did not express CCR5 and were susceptible only to CXCR4-tropic virus ex vivo. HIV-1 Gag-specific CD4 and CD8 T cell responses were lost after transplantation, whereas cytomegalovirus-specific responses were detectable. Similarly, HIV-1-specific antibodies and avidities fell to levels comparable to those in the Berlin patient following transplantation. Although at 18 months after the interruption of treatment it is premature to conclude that this patient has been cured, these data suggest that a single allogeneic HSCT with homozygous CCR5\u039432 donor cells may be sufficient to achieve HIV-1 remission with reduced intensity conditioning and no irradiation, and the findings provide further support for the development of HIV-1 remission strategies based on preventing CCR5 expression.

        "Measles, Mumps, Rubella Vaccination and Autism: A Nationwide Cohort Study. Background: The hypothesized link between the measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine and autism continues to cause concern and challenge vaccine uptake. Objective: To evaluate whether the MMR vaccine increases the risk for autism in children, subgroups of children, or time periods after vaccination. Design: Nationwide cohort study. Setting: Denmark. Participants: 657\u00a0461 children born in Denmark from 1999 through 31 December 2010, with follow-up from 1 year of age and through 31 August 2013. Measurements: Danish population registries were used to link information on MMR vaccination, autism diagnoses, other childhood vaccines, sibling history of autism, and autism risk factors to children in the cohort. Survival analysis of the time to autism diagnosis with Cox proportional hazards regression was used to estimate hazard ratios of autism according to MMR vaccination status, with adjustment for age, birth year, sex, other childhood vaccines, sibling history of autism, and autism risk factors (based on a disease risk score). Results: During 5\u00a0025\u00a0754 person-years of follow-up, 6517 children were diagnosed with autism (incidence rate, 129.7 per 100\u00a0000 person-years). Comparing MMR-vaccinated with MMR-unvaccinated children yielded a fully adjusted autism hazard ratio of 0.93 (95% CI, 0.85 to 1.02). Similarly, no increased risk for autism after MMR vaccination was consistently observed in subgroups of children defined according to sibling history of autism, autism risk factors (based on a disease risk score) or other childhood vaccinations, or during specified time periods after vaccination. Limitation: No individual medical charts were reviewed. Conclusion: The study strongly supports that MMR vaccination does not increase the risk for autism, does not trigger autism in susceptible children, and is not associated with clustering of autism cases after vaccination. It adds to previous studies through significant additional statistical power and by addressing hypotheses of susceptible subgroups and clustering of cases.

        "Influence of Genetic Variants on Steady-State Etonogestrel Concentrations Among Contraceptive Implant Users. OBJECTIVE: To identify genetic variants that influence steady-state etonogestrel concentrations among contraceptive implant users. . METHODS: We enrolled healthy, reproductive-age women in our pharmacogenomic study using etonogestrel implants for 12-36 months without concomitant use of hepatic enzyme inducers or inhibitors. We collected participant characteristics, measured serum etonogestrel concentrations, and genotyped each participant for 120 single nucleotide variants in 14 genes encoding proteins involved in steroid hormone (ie, estrogens, progestins) metabolism, regulation, or function. We performed generalized linear modeling to identify genetic variants associated with steady-state etonogestrel concentrations. RESULTS: We enrolled 350 women, who had a median serum etonogestrel concentration of 137.4 pg/mL (range 55.8-695.1). Our final generalized linear model contained three genetic variants associated with serum etonogestrel concentrations: NR1I2(PXR) rs2461817 (\u03b2=13.36, P=.005), PGR rs537681 (\u03b2=-29.77, P=.007), and CYP3A7*1C (\u03b2=-35.06, P=.025). Variant allele frequencies were 69.4%, 84.9%, and 5.1%, respectively. Our linear model also contained two nongenetic factors associated with etonogestrel concentrations: body mass index (BMI) (\u03b2=-3.08, P=7.0\u00d710) and duration of implant use (\u03b2=-1.60, P=5.8\u00d710); R for the model =0.17. CONCLUSION: Only BMI and duration of implant use remained significantly associated with steady-state etonogestrel concentrations. Of the three novel genetic associations found, one variant associated with increased etonogestrel metabolism (CYP3A7*1C) causes adult expression of fetal CYP3A7 proteins and can consequently alter steroid hormone metabolism. Women with this variant may potentially have increased metabolism of all steroid hormones, as 27.8% (5/18) of CYP3A7*1C carriers had serum etonogestrel concentrations that fell below the threshold for consistent ovulatory suppression (less than 90 pg/mL). More pharmacogenomic investigations are needed to advance our understanding of how genetic variation can influence the effectiveness and safety of hormonal contraception, and lay the groundwork for personalized medicine approaches in women's health.

        "Texting-While-Driving Bans and Motor Vehicle Crash-Related Emergency Department Visits in 16 US States: 2007-2014. OBJECTIVES: To examine the impact of state texting bans on motor vehicle crash (MVC)-related emergency department (ED) visits. METHODS: We used ED data from 16 US states between 2007 and 2014. We employed a difference-in-difference approach and conditional Poisson regressions to estimate changes in counts of MVC-related ED visits in states with and without texting bans. We also constructed age cohorts to explore whether texting bans have differential impacts by age group. RESULTS: On average, states with a texting ban saw a 4% reduction in MVC-related ED visits (incidence rate ratio\u2009=\u20090.96; 95% confidence interval\u2009=\u20090.96, 0.97). This equates to an average of 1632 traffic-related ED visits prevented per year in states with a ban. Both primary and secondary bans were associated with significant reductions in MVC-related visits to the ED regardless of whether they were on all drivers or young drivers only. Individuals aged 64 years and younger in states with a texting ban saw significantly fewer MVC-related ED visits following its implementation. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that states' efforts to curb distracted driving through texting bans and decrease its negative consequences are associated with significant decreases in the incidence of ED visits that follow an MVC.

        "Assessment of the FDA Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy for Transmucosal Immediate-Release Fentanyl Products. Importance: Transmucosal immediate-release fentanyls (TIRFs), indicated solely for breakthrough cancer pain in opioid-tolerant patients, are subject to a US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) to prevent them from being prescribed inappropriately. Objectives: To evaluate knowledge assessments of pharmacists, prescribers, and patients regarding appropriate TIRF use; to describe sponsor assessments, based on claims data, of whether the REMS program was meeting its goals; and to characterize how the FDA responded to REMS assessments. Design, Setting, and Participants: Qualitative analysis of 4877 pages of FDA documents obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request, including 6 annual REMS assessment reports (2012-2017), FDA evaluations of these reports, and FDA-sponsor correspondence about safety issues. Exposure: A REMS program to reduce the risk of adverse outcomes, including misuse, abuse, addiction, and overdose, arising from use of TIRFs. Main Outcomes and Measures: (1) Knowledge assessments of pharmacists, prescribers, and patients; (2) survey and claims-based prescribing assessments; (3) FDA and TIRF sponsor communications; (4) modifications to the REMS program; and (5) disenrollment of noncompliant prescribers. Results: Twelve months after initiation of the program, 24 of 302 pharmacists (7.9%), 35 of 302 prescribers (11.6%), and 5 of 192 patients (2.6%) incorrectly reported that TIRFs can be prescribed to opioid-nontolerant patients, with similar levels of misunderstanding maintained in the subsequent reports. At 60 months, product-specific analyses of claims data indicated that between 34.6% and 55.4% of patients prescribed TIRFs were opioid-nontolerant. In the 48-month survey, 106 of 310 prescribers (34.2%) reported prescribing TIRFs for opioid-tolerant patients with chronic, noncancer pain; at 60 months, 54 of 302 prescribers (18.4%) and 148 of 310 patients (47.7%) erroneously reported that TIRFs were FDA-approved for such use. Over the 60-month period examined, there were few substantive changes made to the REMS to address evidence of high rates of off-label TIRF use, and, although the REMS program had a noncompliance plan, there was no report of prescribers being disenrolled for inappropriate prescribing. Conclusions and Relevance: In this review of FDA documents pertaining to the TIRF REMS, surveys of pharmacists, prescribers, and patients reflected generally high levels of knowledge regarding proper TIRF prescribing, yet some survey items as well as claims-based analyses indicated substantial rates of inappropriate TIRF use. Despite these findings, the FDA did not require substantive changes to the program. ",
        "Artificially Sweetened Beverages and Stroke, Coronary Heart Disease, and All-Cause Mortality in the Women's Health Initiative. Background and Purpose- We examine the association between self-reported consumption of artificially sweetened beverages (ASB) and stroke and its subtypes, coronary heart disease, and all-cause mortality in a cohort of postmenopausal US women. Methods- The analytic cohort included 81\u2009714 women from the Women's Health Initiative Observational Study, a multicenter longitudinal study of the health of 93\u2009676 postmenopausal women of ages 50 to 79 years at baseline who enrolled in 1993 to 1998. This prospective study had a mean follow-up time of 11.9 years (SD of 5.3 years.) Participants who completed a follow-up visit 3 years after baseline were included in the study. Results- Most participants (64.1%) were infrequent consumers (never or <1/week) of ASB, with only 5.1% consuming \u22652 ASBs/day. In multivariate analyses, those consuming the highest level of ASB compared to never or rarely (<1/wk) had significantly greater likelihood of all end points (except hemorrhagic stroke), after controlling for multiple covariates. Adjusted models indicated that hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals were 1.23 (1.02-1.47) for all stroke; 1.31 (1.06-1.63) for ischemic stroke; 1.29 (1.11-1.51) for coronary heart disease; and 1.16 (1.07-1.26) for all-cause mortality. In women with no prior history of cardiovascular disease or diabetes mellitus, high consumption of ASB was associated with more than a 2-fold increased risk of small artery occlusion ischemic stroke hazard ratio =2.44 (95% confidence interval, 1.47-4.04.) High consumption of ASBs was associated with significantly increased risk of ischemic stroke in women with body mass index \u226530; hazard ratio =2.03 (95% confidence interval, 1.38-2.98). Conclusions- Higher intake of ASB was associated with increased risk of stroke, particularly small artery occlusion subtype, coronary heart disease, and all-cause mortality. Although requiring replication, these new findings add to the potentially harmful association of consuming high quantities of ASB with these health outcomes. ",
        "Retinal Microvascular and Neurodegenerative Changes in Alzheimer's Disease and Mild Cognitive Impairment Compared with Control Participants. PURPOSE: Evaluate and compare the retinal microvasculature in the superficial capillary plexus (SCP) in Alzheimer's disease (AD), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and cognitively intact controls using OCT angiography. OCT parameters were also compared. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. PARTICIPANTS: Seventy eyes from 39 AD participants, 72 eyes from 37 MCI participants, and 254 eyes from 133 control participants were enrolled. METHODS: Participants were imaged using Zeiss Cirrus HD-5000 with AngioPlex (Carl Zeiss Meditec, Dublin, CA) and underwent cognitive evaluation with Mini-Mental State Examination. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Vessel density (VD) and perfusion density (PD) in the SCP within the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study 6-mm circle, 3-mm circle, and 3-mm ring were compared between groups. Foveal avascular zone (FAZ) area, central subfield thickness (CST), macular ganglion cell-inner plexiform layer (GC-IPL) thickness, and peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness were also compared. RESULTS: Alzheimer's participants showed significantly decreased SCP VD and PD in the 3-mm ring (P\u00a0=\u00a00.001 and P = 0.002, respectively) and 3-mm circle (P = 0.003 and P = 0.004, respectively) and decreased SCP VD in the 6-mm circle (P = 0.047) compared with MCI and significantly decreased SCP VD and PD in the 3-mm ring (P = 0.008 and P = 0.004, respectively) and 3-mm circle (P = 0.015 and P = 0.009, respectively) and SCP PD in the 6-mm circle (P = 0.033) when compared with cognitively intact controls. There was no difference in SCP VD or PD between MCI and controls (P > 0.05). FAZ area and CST did not differ significantly between groups (P\u00a0>\u00a00.05). Alzheimer's participants showed significantly decreased GC-IPL thickness over the inferior (P = 0.032) and inferonasal (P = 0.025) sectors compared with MCI and significantly decreased GC-IPL thickness over the entire (P = 0.012), superonasal (P = 0.041), inferior (P = 0.004), and inferonasal (P = 0.006) sectors compared to controls. MCI participants showed significantly decreased temporal RNFL thickness (P = 0.04) compared with controls. CONCLUSIONS: Alzheimer's participants showed significantly reduced macular VD, PD, and GC-IPL thickness compared with MCI and controls. Changes in the retinal microvasculature may mirror small vessel cerebrovascular changes in AD. ",
        "Sugary drink consumption and risk of cancer: results from NutriNet-Sant\u00e9 prospective cohort. OBJECTIVE: To assess the associations between the consumption of sugary drinks (such as sugar sweetened beverages and 100% fruit juices), artificially sweetened beverages, and the risk of cancer. DESIGN: Population based prospective cohort study. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Overall, 101\u2009257 participants aged 18 and over (mean age 42.2, SD 14.4; median follow-up time 5.1 years) from the French NutriNet-Sant\u00e9 cohort (2009-2017) were included. Consumptions of sugary drinks and artificially sweetened beverages were assessed by using repeated 24 hour dietary records, which were designed to register participants' usual consumption for 3300 different food and beverage items. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Prospective associations between beverage consumption and the risk of overall, breast, prostate, and colorectal cancer were assessed by multi-adjusted Fine and Gray hazard models, accounting for competing risks. Subdistribution hazard ratios were computed. RESULTS: The consumption of sugary drinks was significantly associated with the risk of overall cancer (n=2193 cases, subdistribution hazard ratio for a 100mL/d increase 1.18, 95% confidence interval 1.10 to 1.27, P<0.0001) and breast cancer (693, 1.22, 1.07 to 1.39, P=0.004). The consumption of artificially sweetened beverages was not associated with the risk of cancer. In specific subanalyses, the consumption of 100% fruit juice was significantly associated with the risk of overall cancer (2193, 1.12, 1.03 to 1.23, P=0.007). CONCLUSIONS: In this large prospective study, the consumption of sugary drinks was positively associated with the risk of overall cancer and breast cancer. 100% fruit juices were also positively associated with the risk of overall cancer. These results need replication in other large scale prospective studies. They suggest that sugary drinks, which are widely consumed in Western countries, might represent a modifiable risk factor for cancer prevention. STUDY REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03335644. ",
        "Uninterrupted Infant Sleep, Development, and Maternal Mood. OBJECTIVES: Contrary to the importance of total sleep duration, the association between sleeping through the night and development in early infancy remains unclear. Our aims were to investigate the proportion of infants who sleep through the night (6- or 8-hour sleep blocks) at ages 6 and 12 months in a longitudinal cohort and to explore associations between sleeping through the night, mental and psychomotor development, maternal mood, and breastfeeding. METHODS: At 6 and 12 months of age, maternal reports were used to assess the longest period of uninterrupted infant sleep and feeding method (n = 388). Two different criteria were used to determine if infants slept through the night: 6 and 8 hours of uninterrupted sleep. Mental and psychomotor developmental indices (Bayley Scales of Infant Development II) and maternal mood (Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale) were measured at 6, 12, and 36 months of age. RESULTS: Using a definition of either 6 or 8 hours of uninterrupted sleep, we found that 27.9% to 57.0% of 6- and 12-month-old infants did not sleep through the night. Linear regressions revealed no significant associations between sleeping through the night and concurrent or later mental development, psychomotor development, or maternal mood (P > .05). However, sleeping through the night was associated with a much lower rate of breastfeeding (P < .0001). CONCLUSIONS: Considering that high proportions of infants did not sleep through the night and that no associations were found between uninterrupted sleep, mental or psychomotor development, and maternal mood, expectations for early sleep consolidation could be moderated.

        "Forecasted Size of Measles Outbreaks Associated With Vaccination Exemptions for Schoolchildren. Importance: Vaccine exemptions, which allow unvaccinated children to attend school, have increased by a factor of 28 since 2003 in Texas. Geographic clustering of unvaccinated children facilitates the spread of measles introductions, but the potential size of outbreaks is unclear. Objective: To forecast the range of measles outbreak sizes in each metropolitan area of Texas at 2018 and future reduced school vaccination rates. Design, Setting, and Participants: An agent-based decision analytical model using a synthetic population of Texas, derived from the 2010 US Census, was used to simulate measles transmission in the Texas population. Real schools were represented in the simulations, and the 2018 vaccination rate of each real school was applied to a simulated hypothetical equivalent. Single cases of measles were introduced, daily activities and interactions were modeled for each population member, and the number of infections over the course of 9 months was counted for 1000 simulated runs in each Texas metropolitan area. Interventions: To determine the outcomes of further decreases in vaccination coverage, additional simulations were performed with vaccination rates reduced by 1% to 10% in schools with populations that are currently undervaccinated. Main Outcomes and Measures: Expected distributions of outbreak sizes in each metropolitan area of Texas at 2018 and reduced vaccination rates. Results: At 2018 vaccination rates, the median number of cases in large metropolitan areas was typically small, ranging from 1 to 3 cases, which is consistent with outbreaks in Texas 2006 to 2017. However, the upper limit of the distribution of plausible outbreaks (the 95th percentile, associated with 1 in 20 measles introductions) exceeded 400 cases in both the Austin and Dallas metropolitan areas, similar to the largest US outbreaks since measles was eliminated in 2000. Decreases in vaccination rates in schools with undervaccinated populations in 2018 were associated with exponential increases in the potential size of outbreaks: a 5% decrease in vaccination rate was associated with a 40% to 4000% increase in potential outbreak size, depending on the metropolitan area. A mean (SD) of 64% (11%) of cases occurred in students for whom a vaccine had been refused, but a mean (SD) of 36% (11%) occurred in others (ie, bystanders). Conclusions and Relevance: This study suggests that vaccination rates in some Texas schools are currently low enough to allow large measles outbreaks. Further decreases are associated with dramatic increases in the probability of large outbreaks. Limiting vaccine exemptions could be associated with a decrease in the risk of large measles outbreaks.

        "A New Segmented Virus Associated with Human Febrile Illness in China. BACKGROUND: In 2017, surveillance for tickborne diseases in China led to the identification of a patient who presented to a hospital in Inner Mongolia with a febrile illness that had an unknown cause. The clinical manifestation of the illness was similar to that of tickborne encephalitis virus (TBEV) infection, but neither TBEV RNA nor antibodies against the virus were detected. METHODS: We obtained a blood specimen from the index patient and attempted to isolate and identify a causative pathogen, using genome sequence analysis and electron microscopy. We also initiated a heightened surveillance program in the same hospital to screen for other patients who presented with fever, headache, and a history of tick bites. We used reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) and cell-culture assays to detect the pathogen and immunofluorescence and neutralization assays to determine the levels of virus-specific antibodies in serum specimens from the patients. RESULTS: We found that the index patient was infected with a previously unknown segmented RNA virus, which we designated Alongshan virus (ALSV) and which belongs to the jingmenvirus group of the family Flaviviridae. ALSV infection was confirmed by RT-PCR assay in 86 patients from Inner Mongolia and Heilongjiang who presented with fever, headache, and a history of tick bites. Serologic assays showed that seroconversion had occurred in all 19 patients for whom specimens were available from the acute phase and the convalescent phase of the illness. CONCLUSIONS: A newly discovered segmented virus was found to be associated with a febrile illness in northeastern China.

        "Oxytocin blocks enhanced motivation for alcohol in alcohol dependence and blocks alcohol effects on GABAergic transmission in the central amygdala. Oxytocin administration has been reported to decrease consumption, withdrawal, and drug-seeking associated with several drugs of abuse and thus represents a promising pharmacological approach to treat drug addiction. We used an established rat model of alcohol dependence to investigate oxytocin's effects on dependence-induced alcohol drinking, enhanced motivation for alcohol, and altered GABAergic transmission in the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA). Intraperitoneal oxytocin administration blocked escalated alcohol drinking and the enhanced motivation for alcohol in alcohol-dependent but not nondependent rats. Intranasal oxytocin delivery fully replicated these effects. Intraperitoneal administration had minor but significant effects of reducing locomotion and intake of non-alcoholic palatable solutions, whereas intranasal oxytocin administration did not. In dependent rats, intracerebroventricular administration of oxytocin or the oxytocin receptor agonist PF-06655075, which does not cross the blood-brain barrier (i.e., it would not diffuse to the periphery), but not systemic administration of PF-06655075 (i.e., it would not reach the brain), decreased alcohol drinking. Administration of a peripherally restricted oxytocin receptor antagonist did not reverse the effect of intranasal oxytocin on alcohol drinking. Ex vivo electrophysiological recordings from CeA neurons indicated that oxytocin decreases evoked GABA transmission in nondependent but not in dependent rats, whereas oxytocin decreased the amplitude of spontaneous GABAergic responses in both groups. Oxytocin blocked the facilitatory effects of acute alcohol on GABA release in the CeA of dependent but not nondependent rats. Together, these results provide converging evidence that oxytocin specifically and selectively blocks the enhanced motivation for alcohol drinking that develops in alcohol dependence likely via a central mechanism that may result from altered oxytocin effects on CeA GABA transmission in alcohol dependence. Neuroadaptations in endogenous oxytocin signaling may provide a mechanism to further our understanding of alcohol use disorder. ",
        "Trends in Opioid Prescribing and Dispensing by Veterinarians in Pennsylvania. Importance: Veterinarians are a subset of opioid prescribers. Objective: To assess the quantity and trends in prescribing and dispensing of several different opioids in the past 11 years in a large veterinary hospital in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cross-sectional study inventoried all opioid tablets and/or patches dispensed or prescribed by veterinarians practicing in a multispecialty academic veterinary teaching hospital in Philadelphia for small animals and species, such as rabbits, birds, and reptiles, from January 1, 2007, through December 31, 2017. Prescribing data were obtained from all veterinarians who wrote a prescription for opioids by reviewing detailed pharmacy records of controlled substances for the study period. Data included all opioids dispensed, or prescribed to animals (patients) undergoing evaluation at the center or being followed up as outpatients by the veterinarians in the hospital. Statewide veterinarian prescribing data were used for comparison. Data were analyzed from December 24, 2017, through May 15, 2018. Main Outcomes and Measures: The trend in administration and prescribing of 4 specific opioid analgesics (codeine sulfate, hydrocodone bitartrate, and tramadol hydrochloride tablets as well as fentanyl citrate patch) during the 11-year study period. The individual opioids were converted to morphine milligram equivalents (MME) for comparison. Results: The study included 134 veterinarians (70.9% women) with 366\u202f468 patient visits. During the study period, the hospital veterinarians prescribed 105 183 689 tablets of tramadol, 97 547 tablets of hydrocodone, 38 939 tablets of codeine, and 3153 fentanyl patches to dogs (73.0%), cats (22.5%), and exotic animals (4.5%). Overall, MME use increased 41.2%, whereas visits increased by 12.8%. The comparison data for Pennsylvania revealed a predominance of hydrocodone use (688 340 tablets prescribed), although data were not available for comparison with tramadol because it is a Schedule IV drug. Conclusions and Relevance: Results of this study suggest that the large, increasing volume of opioids prescribed at 1 veterinary teaching hospital highlights concerns parallel to those about excessive opioid prescribing in humans. The extent to which these data may represent similar volumes of prescriptions from the general veterinary practices and hospitals across the United States is suggested by the accompanying Pennsylvania state data. These findings highlight an opportunity to assess the risk of veterinarian opioid prescriptions to safeguard public health. ",
        "Pan-viral serology implicates enteroviruses in acute flaccid myelitis. Since 2012, the United States of America has experienced a biennial spike in pediatric acute flaccid myelitis (AFM)1-6. Epidemiologic evidence suggests non-polio enteroviruses (EVs) are a potential etiology, yet EV RNA is rarely detected in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)2. CSF from children with AFM (n\u2009=\u200942) and other pediatric neurologic disease controls (n\u2009=\u200958) were investigated for intrathecal antiviral antibodies, using a phage display library expressing 481,966 overlapping peptides derived from all known vertebrate and arboviruses (VirScan). Metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) of AFM CSF RNA (n\u2009=\u200920 cases) was also performed, both unbiased sequencing and with targeted enrichment for EVs. Using VirScan, the viral family significantly enriched by the CSF of AFM cases relative to controls was Picornaviridae, with the most enriched Picornaviridae peptides belonging to the genus Enterovirus (n\u2009=\u200929/42 cases versus 4/58 controls). EV VP1 ELISA confirmed this finding (n\u2009=\u200922/26 cases versus 7/50 controls). mNGS did not detect additional EV RNA. Despite rare detection of EV RNA, pan-viral serology frequently identified high levels of CSF EV-specific antibodies in AFM compared with controls, providing further evidence for a causal role of non-polio EVs in AFM.

        "Prevalence and Severity of Sesame Allergy in the United States. Importance: Sesame allergy is of growing concern in the United States. The US Food and Drug Administration recently issued a request for epidemiological data on the prevalence and severity of sesame allergies in the United States to inform possible regulatory action requiring sesame to be labeled as an allergen on packaged foods. Objective: To provide current estimates of the prevalence, severity, distribution, and clinical characteristics of sesame allergy in the United States. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cross-sectional study assessed findings of web- and telephone-based food allergy questionnaires. Study participants were first recruited from NORC (National Opinion Research Center) at the University of Chicago's probability-based AmeriSpeak panel, and additional participants were recruited through Survey Sampling International. Surveys were administered to a nationally representative sample of 51\u202f819 US households from October 1, 2015, through September 31, 2016. Responses for 40\u202f453 adults and 38\u202f408 children were included in the analysis. Data were analyzed from January 1, 2017, through May 1, 2019. Exposures: Demographic and allergic characteristics of participants. Main Outcomes and Measures: Self-reported sesame allergy was the main outcome and was considered convincing if reported symptoms to sesame-allergic reactions were consistent with an IgE-mediated reaction. Diagnostic history of specific allergens and use of food allergy-related health care services were also primary outcomes. Results: Using survey responses from 78 851 individuals, an estimated 0.49% (95% CI, 0.40%-0.58%) of the US population reported a current sesame allergy, whereas 0.23% (95% CI, 0.19%-0.28%) met symptom-report criteria for convincing IgE-mediated allergy. An additional 0.11% (95% CI, 0.08%-0.16%) had a sesame allergy reported as physician diagnosed but did not report reactions fulfilling survey-specified convincing reaction symptoms. Among individuals with convincing IgE-mediated sesame allergy, an estimated 23.6% (95% CI, 16.9%-32.0%) to 37.2% (95% CI, 29.2%-45.9%) had previously experienced a severe sesame-allergic reaction, depending on the definition used, and 81.6% (95% CI, 71.0%-88.9%) of patients with convincing sesame allergy had at least 1 additional convincing food allergy. Roughly one-third of patients with convincing sesame allergy (33.7%; 95% CI, 26.3%-42.0%) reported previous epinephrine use for sesame allergy treatment. Conclusions and Relevance: These data indicate a substantial burden of sesame allergy and provide valuable context to physicians and policy makers in their efforts to evaluate and reduce the public health burden of sesame allergy. Moreover, the relatively low rates of physician diagnosis observed among individuals with convincing IgE-mediated sesame allergy seem to indicate the need for clear diagnosis and appropriate management.

        "Ad libitum Weekend Recovery Sleep Fails to Prevent Metabolic Dysregulation during a Repeating Pattern of Insufficient Sleep and Weekend Recovery Sleep. People commonly increase sleep duration on the weekend to recover from sleep loss incurred during the workweek. Whether ad libitum weekend recovery sleep prevents metabolic dysregulation caused by recurrent insufficient sleep is unknown. Here, we assessed sleep, circadian timing, energy intake, weight gain, and insulin sensitivity during sustained insufficient sleep (9 nights) and during recurrent insufficient sleep following ad libitum weekend recovery sleep. Healthy, young adults were randomly assigned to one of three groups: (1) control (CON; 9-h sleep opportunities, n\u00a0= 8), (2) sleep restriction without weekend recovery sleep (SR; 5-h sleep opportunities, n\u00a0= 14), and (3) sleep restriction with weekend recovery sleep (WR; insufficient sleep for 5-day workweek, then 2\u00a0days of weekend recovery, then 2 nights of insufficient sleep, n\u00a0= 14). For SR and WR groups, insufficient sleep increased after-dinner energy intake and body weight versus baseline. During ad libitum weekend recovery sleep, participants cumulatively slept \u223c1.1\u00a0h more than baseline, and after-dinner energy intake decreased versus insufficient sleep. However, during recurrent insufficient sleep following the weekend, the circadian phase was delayed, and after-dinner energy intake and body weight increased versus baseline. In SR, whole-body insulin sensitivity decreased \u223c13% during insufficient sleep versus baseline, and in WR, whole-body, hepatic, and muscle insulin sensitivity decreased \u223c9%-27% during recurrent insufficient sleep versus baseline. Furthermore, during the weekend, total sleep duration was lower in women versus men, and energy intake decreased to baseline levels in women but not in men. Our findings suggest that weekend recovery sleep is not an effective strategy to prevent metabolic dysregulation associated with recurrent insufficient sleep. ",
        "Consumption of low-calorie sweetened beverages is associated with higher total energy and sugar intake among children, NHANES 2011-2016. OBJECTIVE: To examine associations between consumption of low-calorie sweetened beverages (LCSBs), sugar, and total energy intake in children in the United States. METHODS: We used 24-hour dietary recalls from 7026 children enrolled in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2011 to 2016 to assess energy and macronutrient intake among LCSB (\u22654 oz LCSB, <4 oz SB), SB (\u22654 oz SB, <4 oz LCSB), and LCSB + SB consumers (\u22654 oz each) compared with water consumers (\u22654 oz water, <4 oz LCSB and SBs). Sample weights and complex survey procedures were used for all analyses. RESULTS: Adjusting for body mass index (BMI) percentile, LCSB, SB, and LCSB + SB consumption was associated with 196, 312, and 450 more total calories and 15, 39, and 46 more grams of added sugar, which amounts to 60, 156, 184 more calories from added sugar, compared with water consumers (P < .05 for all pairwise comparisons). No differences in energy intake were observed between LCSB and SB consumers. [Correction added on 28 May 2019, after first online publication: In the preceding sentence, quantities of added sugar reported are in grams. The corresponding calories have also been specified in this version.] CONCLUSIONS: These findings challenge the utility of LCSB for weight management in children and adolescents. ",
        "Disparities in Acceptance of Deceased Donor Kidneys Between the United States and France and Estimated Effects of Increased US Acceptance. Importance: Approximately 3500 donated kidneys are discarded in the United States each year, drawing concern from Medicare and advocacy groups. Objective: To estimate the effects of more aggressive allograft acceptance practices on the donor pool and allograft survival for the population of US wait-listed kidney transplant candidates. Design, Setting, and Participants: A nationwide study using validated registries from the United States and France comprising comprehensive cohorts of deceased donors with organs offered to kidney transplant centers between January 1, 2004, and December 31, 2014. Data were analyzed between September 1, 2018, and April 5, 2019. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was kidney allograft discard. The secondary outcome was allograft failure after transplantation. We used logistic regression to model organ acceptance and discard practices in both countries. We then quantified using computer simulation models the number of kidneys discarded in the United States that a more aggressive system would have instead used for transplantation. Finally, based on actual survival data, we quantified the additional years of allograft life that a redesigned US system would have saved. Findings: In the United States, 156\u202f089 kidneys were recovered from deceased donors between 2004 and 2014, of which 128\u202f102 were transplanted, and 27\u202f987 (17.9%) were discarded. In France, among the 29\u202f984 kidneys recovered between 2004 and 2014, 27\u202f252 were transplanted, and 2732 (9.1%, P\u2009<\u2009.001 vs United States) were discarded. The mean (SD) age of kidneys transplanted in the United States was 36.51 (17.02) years vs 50.91 (17.34) years in France (P\u2009<\u2009.001). Kidney quality showed little change in the United States over time (mean [SD] kidney donor risk index [KDRI], 1.30 [0.48] in 2004 vs 1.32 [0.46] in 2014), whereas a steadily rising KDRI in France reflected a temporal trend of more aggressive organ use (mean [SD] KDRI, 1.37 [0.47] in 2004 vs 1.74 [0.72] in 2014; P\u2009<\u2009.001). We applied the French-based allocation model to the population of US deceased donor kidneys and found that 17\u202f435 (62%) of kidneys discarded in the United States would have instead been transplanted under the French system. We further determined that a redesigned system with more aggressive organ acceptance practices would generate an additional 132\u202f445 allograft life-years in the United States over the 10-year observation period. Conclusions and Relevance: Greater acceptance of kidneys from deceased donors who are older and have more comorbidities could provide major survival benefits to the population of US wait-listed patients.

        "Association of Dietary Fiber and Yogurt Consumption With Lung Cancer Risk: A Pooled Analysis. Importance: Dietary fiber (the main source of prebiotics) and yogurt (a probiotic food) confer various health benefits via modulating the gut microbiota and metabolic pathways. However, their associations with lung cancer risk have not been well investigated. Objective: To evaluate the individual and joint associations of dietary fiber and yogurt consumption with lung cancer risk and to assess the potential effect modification of the associations by lifestyle and other dietary factors. Design, Setting, and Participants: This pooled analysis included 10 prospective cohorts involving 1\u202f445\u202f850 adults from studies that were conducted in the United States, Europe, and Asia. Data analyses were performed between November 2017 and February 2019. Using harmonized individual participant data, hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals for lung cancer risk associated with dietary fiber and yogurt intakes were estimated for each cohort by Cox regression and pooled using random-effects meta-analysis. Participants who had a history of cancer at enrollment or developed any cancer, died, or were lost to follow-up within 2 years after enrollment were excluded. Exposures: Dietary fiber intake and yogurt consumption measured by validated instruments. Main Outcomes and Measures: Incident lung cancer, subclassified by histologic type (eg, adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and small cell carcinoma). Results: The analytic sample included 627\u202f988 men, with a mean (SD) age of 57.9 (9.0) years, and 817\u202f862 women, with a mean (SD) age of 54.8 (9.7) years. During a median follow-up of 8.6 years, 18\u202f822 incident lung cancer cases were documented. Both fiber and yogurt intakes were inversely associated with lung cancer risk after adjustment for status and pack-years of smoking and other lung cancer risk factors: hazard ratio, 0.83 (95% CI, 0.76-0.91) for the highest vs lowest quintile of fiber intake; and hazard ratio, 0.81 (95% CI, 0.76-0.87) for high vs no yogurt consumption. The fiber or yogurt associations with lung cancer were significant in never smokers and were consistently observed across sex, race/ethnicity, and tumor histologic type. When considered jointly, high yogurt consumption with the highest quintile of fiber intake showed more than 30% reduced risk of lung cancer than nonyogurt consumption with the lowest quintile of fiber intake (hazard ratio, 0.67 [95% CI, 0.61-0.73] in total study populations; hazard ratio 0.69 [95% CI, 0.54-0.89] in never smokers), suggesting potential synergism. Conclusions and Relevance: Dietary fiber and yogurt consumption was associated with reduced risk of lung cancer after adjusting for known risk factors and among never smokers. Our findings suggest a potential protective role of prebiotics and probiotics against lung carcinogenesis. ",
        "Association of Air Pollution Exposure With Psychotic Experiences During Adolescence. Importance: Urbanicity is a well-established risk factor for clinical (eg, schizophrenia) and subclinical (eg, hearing voices and paranoia) expressions of psychosis. To our knowledge, no studies have examined the association of air pollution with adolescent psychotic experiences, despite air pollution being a major environmental problem in cities. Objectives: To examine the association between exposure to air pollution and adolescent psychotic experiences and test whether exposure mediates the association between urban residency and adolescent psychotic experiences. Design, Setting, and Participants: The Environmental-Risk Longitudinal Twin Study is a population-based cohort study of 2232 children born during the period from January 1, 1994, through December 4, 1995, in England and Wales and followed up from birth through 18 years of age. The cohort represents the geographic and socioeconomic composition of UK households. Of the original cohort, 2066 (92.6%) participated in assessments at 18 years of age, of whom 2063 (99.9%) provided data on psychotic experiences. Generation of the pollution data was completed on October 4, 2017, and data were analyzed from May 4 to November 21, 2018. Exposures: High-resolution annualized estimates of exposure to 4 air pollutants-nitrogen dioxide (NO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and particulate matter with aerodynamic diameters of less than 2.5 (PM2.5) and less than 10 \u03bcm (PM10)-were modeled for 2012 and linked to the home addresses of the sample plus 2 commonly visited locations when the participants were 18 years old. Main Outcomes and Measures: At 18 years of age, participants were privately interviewed regarding adolescent psychotic experiences. Urbanicity was estimated using 2011 census data. Results: Among the 2063 participants who provided data on psychotic experiences, sex was evenly distributed (52.5% female). Six hundred twenty-three participants (30.2%) had at least 1 psychotic experience from 12 to 18 years of age. Psychotic experiences were significantly more common among adolescents with the highest (top quartile) level of annual exposure to NO2 (odds ratio [OR], 1.71; 95% CI, 1.28-2.28), NOx (OR, 1.72; 95% CI, 1.30-2.29), and PM2.5 (OR, 1.45; 95% CI, 1.11-1.90). Together NO2 and NOx statistically explained 60% of the association between urbanicity and adolescent psychotic experiences. No evidence of confounding by family socioeconomic status, family psychiatric history, maternal psychosis, childhood psychotic symptoms, adolescent smoking and substance dependence, or neighborhood socioeconomic status, crime, and social conditions occurred. Conclusions and Relevance: In this study, air pollution exposure-particularly NO2 and NOx-was associated with increased odds of adolescent psychotic experiences, which partly explained the association between urban residency and adolescent psychotic experiences. Biological (eg, neuroinflammation) and psychosocial (eg, stress) mechanisms are plausible. ",
        "The Justinianic Plague: An inconsequential pandemic?. Existing mortality estimates assert that the Justinianic Plague (circa 541 to 750 CE) caused tens of millions of deaths throughout the Mediterranean world and Europe, helping to end antiquity and start the Middle Ages. In this article, we argue that this paradigm does not fit the evidence. We examine a series of independent quantitative and qualitative datasets that are directly or indirectly linked to demographic and economic trends during this two-century period: Written sources, legislation, coinage, papyri, inscriptions, pollen, ancient DNA, and mortuary archaeology. Individually or together, they fail to support the maximalist paradigm: None has a clear independent link to plague outbreaks and none supports maximalist reconstructions of late antique plague. Instead of large-scale, disruptive mortality, when contextualized and examined together, the datasets suggest continuity across the plague period. Although demographic, economic, and political changes continued between the 6th and 8th centuries, the evidence does not support the now commonplace claim that the Justinianic Plague was a primary causal factor of them.

        "Compliance with ethical standards in the reporting of donor sources and ethics review in peer-reviewed publications involving organ transplantation in China: a scoping review. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study is to investigate whether papers reporting research on Chinese transplant recipients comply with international professional standards aimed at excluding publication of research that: (1) involves any biological material from executed prisoners; (2) lacks Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval and (3) lacks consent of donors. DESIGN: Scoping review based on Arksey and O'Mallee's methodological framework. DATA SOURCES: Medline, Scopus and Embase were searched from January 2000 to April 2017. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: We included research papers published in peer-reviewed English-language journals reporting on outcomes of research involving recipients of transplanted hearts, livers or lungs in mainland China. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Data were extracted by individual authors working independently following training and benchmarking. Descriptive statistics were compiled using Excel. RESULTS: 445 included studies reported on outcomes of 85\u2009477 transplants. 412 (92.5%) failed to report whether or not organs were sourced from executed prisoners; and 439 (99%) failed to report that organ sources gave consent for transplantation. In contrast, 324 (73%) reported approval from an IRB. Of the papers claiming that no prisoners' organs were involved in the transplants, 19 of them involved 2688 transplants that took place prior to 2010, when there was no volunteer donor programme in China. DISCUSSION: The transplant research community has failed to implement ethical standards banning publication of research using material from executed prisoners. As a result, a large body of unethical research now exists, raising issues of complicity and moral hazard to the extent that the transplant community uses and benefits from the results of this research. We call for retraction of this literature pending investigation of individual papers. ",
        "Characterization of a filovirus (M\u011bngl\u00e0 virus) from Rousettus bats in China. Filoviruses, especially Ebola virus (EBOV) and Marburg virus (MARV), are notoriously pathogenic and capable of causing severe haemorrhagic fever diseases in humans with high lethality1,2. The risk of future outbreaks is exacerbated by the discovery of other bat-borne filoviruses of wide genetic diversity globally3-5. Here we report the characterization of a phylogenetically distinct bat filovirus, named M\u011bngl\u00e0 virus (MLAV). The coding-complete genome of MLAV shares 32-54% nucleotide sequence identity with known filoviruses. Phylogenetic analysis places this new virus between EBOV and MARV, suggesting the need for a new genus taxon. Importantly, despite the low amino acid sequence identity (22-39%) of the glycoprotein with other filoviruses, MLAV is capable of using the Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1) as entry receptor. MLAV is also replication-competent with chimeric MLAV mini-genomes containing EBOV or MARV leader and trailer sequences, indicating that these viruses are evolutionally and functionally closely related. Finally, MLAV glycoprotein-typed pseudo-types transduced cell lines derived from humans, monkeys, dogs, hamsters and bats, implying a broad species cell tropism with a high risk of interspecies spillover transmission.

        "Ambient Particulate Air Pollution and Daily Mortality in 652 Cities. BACKGROUND: The systematic evaluation of the results of time-series studies of air pollution is challenged by differences in model specification and publication bias. METHODS: We evaluated the associations of inhalable particulate matter (PM) with an aerodynamic diameter of 10 \u03bcm or less (PM10) and fine PM with an aerodynamic diameter of 2.5 \u03bcm or less (PM2.5) with daily all-cause, cardiovascular, and respiratory mortality across multiple countries or regions. Daily data on mortality and air pollution were collected from 652 cities in 24 countries or regions. We used overdispersed generalized additive models with random-effects meta-analysis to investigate the associations. Two-pollutant models were fitted to test the robustness of the associations. Concentration-response curves from each city were pooled to allow global estimates to be derived. RESULTS: On average, an increase of 10 \u03bcg per cubic meter in the 2-day moving average of PM10 concentration, which represents the average over the current and previous day, was associated with increases of 0.44% (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.39 to 0.50) in daily all-cause mortality, 0.36% (95% CI, 0.30 to 0.43) in daily cardiovascular mortality, and 0.47% (95% CI, 0.35 to 0.58) in daily respiratory mortality. The corresponding increases in daily mortality for the same change in PM2.5 concentration were 0.68% (95% CI, 0.59 to 0.77), 0.55% (95% CI, 0.45 to 0.66), and 0.74% (95% CI, 0.53 to 0.95). These associations remained significant after adjustment for gaseous pollutants. Associations were stronger in locations with lower annual mean PM concentrations and higher annual mean temperatures. The pooled concentration-response curves showed a consistent increase in daily mortality with increasing PM concentration, with steeper slopes at lower PM concentrations. CONCLUSIONS: Our data show independent associations between short-term exposure to PM10 and PM2.5 and daily all-cause, cardiovascular, and respiratory mortality in more than 600 cities across the globe. These data reinforce the evidence of a link between mortality and PM concentration established in regional and local studies. (Funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China and others.).

        "Whole genome variant association across 100 dogs identifies a frame shift mutation in DISHEVELLED 2 which contributes to Robinow-like syndrome in Bulldogs and related screw tail dog breeds. Domestic dog breeds exhibit remarkable morphological variations that result from centuries of artificial selection and breeding. Identifying the genetic changes that contribute to these variations could provide critical insights into the molecular basis of tissue and organismal morphogenesis. Bulldogs, French Bulldogs and Boston Terriers share many morphological and disease-predisposition traits, including brachycephalic skull morphology, widely set eyes and short stature. Unlike other brachycephalic dogs, these breeds also exhibit vertebral malformations that result in a truncated, kinked tail (screw tail). Whole genome sequencing of 100 dogs from 21 breeds identified 12.4 million bi-allelic variants that met inclusion criteria. Whole Genome Association of these variants with the breed defining phenotype of screw tail was performed using 10 cases and 84 controls and identified a frameshift mutation in the WNT pathway gene DISHEVELLED 2 (DVL2) (Chr5: 32195043_32195044del, p = 4.37 X 10-37) as the most strongly associated variant in the canine genome. This DVL2 variant was fixed in Bulldogs and French Bulldogs and had a high allele frequency (0.94) in Boston Terriers. The DVL2 variant segregated with thoracic and caudal vertebral column malformations in a recessive manner with incomplete and variable penetrance for thoracic vertebral malformations between different breeds. Importantly, analogous frameshift mutations in the human DVL1 and DVL3 genes cause Robinow syndrome, a congenital disorder characterized by similar craniofacial, limb and vertebral malformations. Analysis of the canine DVL2 variant protein showed that its ability to undergo WNT-induced phosphorylation is reduced, suggesting that altered WNT signaling may contribute to the Robinow-like syndrome in the screwtail breeds.

        "Food for Sex in Bats Revealed as Producer Males Reproduce with Scrounging Females. Food sharing is often evolutionarily puzzling, because the provider's benefits are not always clear. Sharing among kin may increase indirect fitness [1], but when non-kin are involved, different mechanisms were suggested to act. Occasionally, \"tolerated theft\" [2, 3] is observed, merely because defending a resource is not cost effective. Sharing may also be explained as \"costly signaling\" [4, 5], where individuals signal their high qualities by distributing acquired resources, as has been suggested to occur in certain human cultures [6]. Alternatively, a transferred food item might be compensated for in later interactions [7]. In vampire bats, blood sharing reflects reciprocity between non-kin colony members [8-10], and long-term social bonds affect food sharing in chimpanzees [11]. Food may also be exchanged for other goods or social benefits [12-14]. One reciprocity-based explanation for intersexual food sharing is the food-for-sex hypothesis [15-17]. This hypothesis proposes that males share food with females in exchange for mating opportunities. Studies on human hunter-gatherer societies suggest that males with increased foraging success have higher reproductive success [18, 19]. Male chimpanzees, which in contrast to humans do not maintain pair bonds, were suggested to share food with females to increase their mating opportunities [16] (but see [20]). Bats, which are long-lived social mammals [21, 22], provide an opportunity to study long-term social reciprocity mechanisms. We monitored producer-scrounger interactions of a captive Egyptian fruit bat (Rousettus aegyptiacus) colony for more than a year and genetically determined the paternity of the pups that were born in the colony. We found that females carry the young of males from which they used to scrounge food, supporting the food-for-sex hypothesis in this species. ",
        "Precise in vivo genome editing via single homology arm donor mediated intron-targeting gene integration for genetic disease correction. In vivo genome editing represents a powerful strategy for both understanding basic biology and treating inherited diseases. However, it remains a challenge to develop universal and efficient in vivo genome-editing tools for tissues that comprise diverse cell types in either a dividing or non-dividing state. Here, we describe a versatile in vivo gene knock-in methodology that enables the targeting of a broad range of mutations and cell types through the insertion of a minigene at an intron of the target gene locus using an intracellularly linearized single homology arm donor. As\u00a0a proof-of-concept, we focused on a mouse model of premature-aging caused by a dominant point mutation, which is difficult to repair using existing in vivo genome-editing tools. Systemic treatment using our new method ameliorated aging-associated phenotypes and extended animal lifespan, thus highlighting the potential of this methodology for a broad range of in vivo genome-editing applications.

        "3D Printing of Personalized Thick and Perfusable Cardiac Patches and Hearts. Generation of thick vascularized tissues that fully match the patient still remains an unmet challenge in cardiac tissue engineering. Here, a simple approach to 3D-print thick, vascularized, and perfusable cardiac patches that completely match the immunological, cellular, biochemical, and anatomical properties of the patient is reported. To this end, a biopsy of an omental tissue is taken from patients. While the cells are reprogrammed to become pluripotent stem cells, and differentiated to cardiomyocytes and endothelial cells, the extracellular matrix is processed into a personalized hydrogel. Following, the two cell types are separately combined with hydrogels to form bioinks for the parenchymal cardiac tissue and blood vessels. The ability to print functional vascularized patches according to the patient's anatomy is demonstrated. Blood vessel architecture is further improved by mathematical modeling of oxygen transfer. The structure and function of the patches are studied in vitro, and cardiac cell morphology is assessed after transplantation, revealing elongated cardiomyocytes with massive actinin striation. Finally, as a proof of concept, cellularized human hearts with a natural architecture are printed. These results demonstrate the potential of the approach for engineering personalized tissues and organs, or for drug screening in an appropriate anatomical structure and patient-specific biochemical microenvironment.

        "Enriched environment exposure accelerates rodent driving skills. Although rarely used, long-term behavioral training protocols provide opportunities to shape complex skills in rodent laboratory investigations that incorporate cognitive, motor, visuospatial and temporal functions to achieve desired goals. In the current study, following preliminary research establishing that rats could be taught to drive a rodent operated vehicle (ROV) in a forward direction, as well as steer in more complex navigational patterns, male rats housed in an enriched environment were exposed to the rodent driving regime. Compared to standard-housed rats, enriched-housed rats demonstrated more robust learning in driving performance and their interest in the ROV persisted through extinction trials. Dehydroepiandrosterone/corticosterone (DHEA/CORT) metabolite ratios in fecal samples increased in accordance with training in all animals, suggesting that driving training, regardless of housing group, enhanced markers of emotional resilience. These results confirm the importance of enriched environments in preparing animals to engage in complex behavioral tasks. Further, behavioral models that include trained motor skills enable researchers to assess subtle alterations in motivation and behavioral response patterns that are relevant for translational research related to neurodegenerative disease and psychiatric illness.

        "Cannabis resin in the region of Madrid: Adulteration and contamination. The aim of this study is to analyze the adulteration and contamination of cannabis resin obtained on the streets of Madrid, in order to establish whether it is suitable for human consumption. A total of 90 samples obtained through street vending in the Region of Madrid (CAM) were analyzed. Our results showed a direct relationship between the shape of the samples (acorn or ingot) and the presence of foreign elements, adulterants and microbiological contamination. Foreign elements were found in 64.7% of the ingot-shaped samples and in 30.2% of the acorn-shaped samples (p\u2009<\u20090.01); 25% of the samples were deliberately adulterated, 66.7% of which had an ingot shape. With regard to microbiological contamination, 93% of acorns were contaminated by E. coli, compared to 29.4% of ingots (p\u2009<\u20090.0001). In addition, all samples with fecal odor were acorns and were contaminated by E. coli. Ten per cent of the samples were contaminated by Aspergillus; of these, 66.7% had the shape of an acorn. Overall, our results showed that most (88.3%) of the hashish samples were not suitable for consumption. This percentage was significantly higher (p\u2009<\u20090.0001) in acorn than in ingot samples (100% vs. 58.8%). Hence, illegal street vending of hashish constitutes a public health issue. ",
        "Assessment of Exposure to High-Performing Schools and Risk of Adolescent Substance Use: A Natural Experiment. Importance: Although school environments are thought to influence health behaviors, experimental data assessing causality are lacking, and which aspects of school environments may be most important for adolescent health are unknown. Objective: To test whether exposure to high-performing schools is associated with risky adolescent health behaviors. Design, Setting, and Participants: This natural experiment used admission lotteries, which mimic random assignment, to estimate the association of school environments and adolescent health. A survey of 1270 students who applied to at least 1 of 5 high-performing public charter schools in low-income minority communities in Los Angeles, California. Schools had an academic performance ranked in the top tertile of Los Angeles County public high schools, applicants outnumbered available seats by at least 50, and an admissions lottery was used. Participants included lottery winners (intervention group [n = 694]) and lottery losers (control group [n = 576]) from the end of 8th grade and beginning of 9th grade through the end of 11th grade. Intention-to-treat (ITT) and instrumental variable techniques estimated the association of winning the lottery and attending high-performing schools with health behaviors and whether the association varied by sex. Data were collected from March 11, 2013, through February 22, 2017, and analyzed from October 1, 2017, through July 1, 2018. Exposures: Schools were considered high performing if they placed in the top tercile of public high schools in LA County on 2012 state standardized tests. Most students attended that same school for 3 years (9th-11th grades). Main Outcomes and Measures: Primary self-reported outcomes were 30-day and high-risk self-reported marijuana use. Additional health outcomes included 30-day alcohol use, alcohol misuse, ever being in a fight, ever having sex, and past-year delinquency. Potential intermediate factors (time studying, truancy, school mobility, school culture, school order, teacher support for college, and proportion of substance-using peers in students' social networks) were also examined. Results: Among the 1270 participating students (52.6% female; mean [SD] age at enrollment, 14.3 [0.5] years), ITT analysis showed that the intervention group reported less marijuana misuse than the control group (mean marijuana misuse score, 0.46 vs 0.71), as well as fewer substance-using peers (9.6% vs 12.7%), more time studying (mean, 2.63 vs 2.49 hours), less truancy (84.3% vs 77.3% with no truancy), greater teacher support for college (mean scores, 7.20 vs 7.02), more orderly schools (mean order score, 7.06 vs 6.83), and less school mobility (21.4% vs 28.4%) (all P\u2009<\u2009.05). Stratified analyses suggest that among boys, intervention participants had significantly lower marijuana use (mean misuse score, 0.43 vs 0.88; difference, -0.45; 95% CI, -0.78 to -0.13) and alcohol misuse (mean misuse score, 0.52 vs 0.97; difference, -0.44; 95% CI, -0.80 to -0.09) scores compared with control participants, whereas no significant health outcomes were noted for girls. Conclusions and Relevance: This natural experiment provides evidence that school environments can improve risky behaviors for low-income minority adolescents. ",
        "Association of Sexual Harassment and Sexual Assault With Midlife Women's Mental and Physical Health. Importance: Sexual harassment and sexual assault are prevalent experiences among women. However, their association with health indices is less well understood. Objective: To investigate the association of history of sexual harassment and sexual assault with blood pressure, mood, anxiety, and sleep among midlife women. Design, Setting, and Participants: Nonsmoking women without cardiovascular disease were recruited from the community to undergo physical measurements (blood pressure, height, weight), medical history, and questionnaire psychosocial assessments (workplace sexual harassment, sexual assault, depression, anxiety, sleep). Exposures: Sexual harassment and sexual assault. Main Outcomes and Measures: Blood pressure, depressive symptoms, anxiety, and sleep characteristics. Results: Among the 304 nonsmoking women aged 40 to 60 years who participated in the study, all were free of clinical cardiovascular disease, and the mean (SD) age was 54.05 (3.99) years. A total of 19% reported a history of workplace sexual harassment (n\u2009=\u200958), and 22% reported a history of sexual assault (n\u2009=\u200967). Sexual harassment was related to significantly greater odds of stage 1 or 2 hypertension among women not taking antihypertensives (odds ratio [OR], 2.36; 95% CI, 1.10-5.06; P\u2009=\u2009.03) as well as clinically poor sleep (OR, 1.89; 95% CI, 1.05-3.42; P\u2009=\u2009.03), after adjusting for covariates. Sexual assault was associated with significantly greater odds of clinically elevated depressive symptoms (OR, 2.86; 95% CI, 1.42-5.77; multivariable P\u2009=\u2009.003), clinically relevant anxiety (OR, 2.26; 95% CI, 1.26-4.06; P\u2009=\u2009.006), and clinically poor sleep (OR, 2.15; 95% CI, 1.23-3.77; multivariable P\u2009=\u2009.007), after adjusting for covariates. Conclusions and Relevance: Sexual harassment and sexual assault are prevalent experiences among midlife women. Sexual harassment was associated with higher blood pressure and poorer sleep. Sexual assault was associated with poorer mental health and sleep. Efforts to improve women's health should target sexual harassment and assault prevention. ",
        "Reduced Salt Intake for Heart Failure: A Systematic Review. Importance: Recent estimates suggest that more than 26 million people worldwide have heart failure. The syndrome is associated with major symptoms, significantly increased mortality, and extensive use of health care. Evidence-based treatments influence all these outcomes in a proportion of patients with heart failure. Current management also often includes advice to reduce dietary salt intake, although the benefits are uncertain. Objective: To systematically review randomized clinical trials of reduced dietary salt in adult inpatients or outpatients with heart failure. Evidence Review: Several bibliographic databases were systematically searched, including the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, Embase, and CINAHL. The methodologic quality of the studies was evaluated, and data associated with primary outcomes of interest (cardiovascular-associated mortality, all-cause mortality, and adverse events, such as stroke and myocardial infarction) and secondary outcomes (hospitalization, length of inpatient stay, change in New York Heart Association [NYHA] functional class, adherence to dietary low-salt intake, and changes in blood pressure) were extracted. Findings: Of 2655 retrieved references, 9 studies involving 479 unique participants were included in the analysis. None of the studies included more than 100 participants. The risks of bias in the 9 studies were variable. None of the included studies provided sufficient data on the primary outcomes of interest. For the secondary outcomes of interest, 2 outpatient-based studies reported that NYHA functional class was not improved by restriction of salt intake, whereas 2 studies reported significant improvements in NYHA functional class. Conclusions and Relevance: Limited evidence of clinical improvement was available among outpatients who reduced dietary salt intake, and evidence was inconclusive for inpatients. Overall, a paucity of robust high-quality evidence to support or refute current guidance was available. This review suggests that well-designed, adequately powered studies are needed to reduce uncertainty about the use of this intervention. Protocol Registration: PROSPERO Identifier: CRD42015019504. ",
        "Association of Weather With Day-to-Day Incidence of Myocardial Infarction: A SWEDEHEART Nationwide Observational Study. Importance: Whether certain weather conditions modulate the onset of myocardial infarction (MI) is of great interest to clinicians because it could be used to prevent MIs as well as guide allocation of health care resources. Objective: To determine if weather is associated with day-to-day incidence of MI. Design, Setting, and Participants: In this prospective, population-based and nationwide setting, daily weather data from the Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute were extracted for all MIs reported to the Swedish nationwide coronary care unit registry, Swedish Web-System for Enhancement and Development of Evidence-Based Care in Heart Disease Evaluated According to Recommended Therapies (SWEDEHEART), during 1998 to 2013 and then merged with each MI on date of symptom onset and coronary care unit. All patients admitted to any coronary care unit in Sweden owing to MI were included. A total of 280 873 patients were included, of whom 92 044 were diagnosed as having ST-elevation MI. Weather data were available for 274 029 patients (97.6%), which composed the final study population. Data were analyzed between February 2017 and April 2018. Exposures: The nationwide daily mean air temperature, minimum air temperature, maximum air temperature, wind velocity, sunshine duration, atmospheric air pressure, air humidity, snow precipitation, rain precipitation, and change in air temperature. Main Outcomes and Measures: The nationwide daily counts of MI as outcome. Results: In 274\u202f029 patients, mean (SD) age was 71.7 (12) years. Incidence of MI increased with lower air temperature, lower atmospheric air pressure, higher wind velocity, and shorter sunshine duration. The most pronounced association was observed for air temperature, where a 1-SD increase in air temperature (7.4\u00b0C) was associated with a 2.8% reduction in risk of MI (unadjusted incidence ratio, 0.972; 95% CI, 0.967-0.977; P <.001). Results were consistent for non-ST-elevation MI as well as ST-elevation MI and across a large range of subgroups and health care regions. Conclusions and Relevance: In this large, nationwide study, low air temperature, low atmospheric air pressure, high wind velocity, and shorter sunshine duration were associated with risk of MI with the most evident association observed for air temperature.

        "Variation and Disparities in Awareness of Myocardial Infarction Symptoms Among Adults in the United States. Importance: Prompt recognition of myocardial infarction symptoms is critical for timely access to lifesaving emergency cardiac care. However, patients with myocardial infarction continue to have a delayed presentation to the hospital. Objective: To understand the variation and disparities in awareness of myocardial infarction symptoms among adults in the United States. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cross-sectional study used data from the 2017 National Health Interview Survey among adult residents of the United States, assessing awareness of the 5 following common myocardial infarction symptoms among different sociodemographic subgroups: (1) chest pain or discomfort, (2) shortness of breath, (3) pain or discomfort in arms or shoulders, (4) feeling weak, lightheaded, or faint, and (5) jaw, neck, or back pain. The response to a perceived myocardial infarction (ie, calling emergency medical services vs other) was also assessed. Main Outcomes and Measures: Prevalence and characteristics of individuals who were unaware of myocardial infarction symptoms and/or chose not to call emergency medical services in response to these symptoms. Results: Among 25\u202f271 individuals (13\u202f820 women [51.6%; 95% CI, 50.8%-52.4%]; 17\u202f910 non-Hispanic white individuals [69.9%; 95% CI, 68.2%-71.6%]; and 21\u202f826 individuals [82.7%; 95% CI, 81.5%-83.8%] born in the United States), 23\u202f383 (91.8%; 95% CI, 91.0%-92.6%) considered chest pain or discomfort a symptom of myocardial infarction; 22\u202f158 (87.0%; 95% CI, 86.1%-87.8%) considered shortness of breath a symptom; 22\u202f064 (85.7%; 95% CI, 84.8%-86.5%) considered pain or discomfort in arm a symptom; 19\u202f760 (77.0%; 95% CI, 76.1%-77.9%) considered feeling weak, lightheaded, or faint a symptom; and 16\u202f567 (62.6%; 95% CI, 61.6%-63.7%) considered jaw, neck, or back pain a symptom. Overall, 14\u202f075 adults (53.0%; 95% CI, 51.9%-54.1%) were aware of all 5 symptoms, whereas 4698 (20.3%; 95% CI, 19.4%-21.3%) were not aware of the 3 most common symptoms and 1295 (5.8%; 95% CI, 5.2%-6.4%) were not aware of any symptoms. Not being aware of any symptoms was associated with male sex (odds ratio [OR], 1.23; 95% CI, 1.05-1.44; P\u2009=\u2009.01), Hispanic ethnicity (OR, 1.89; 95% CI, 1.47-2.43; P\u2009<\u2009.001), not having been born in the United States (OR, 1.85; 95% CI, 1.47-2.33; P\u2009<\u2009.001), and having a lower education level (OR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.09-1.58; P\u2009=\u2009.004). Among 294 non-Hispanic black or Hispanic individuals who were not born in the United States, belonged to the low-income or lowest-income subgroup, were uninsured, and had a lower education level, 61 (17.9%; 95% CI, 13.3%-23.6%) were not aware of any symptoms. This group had 6-fold higher odds of not being aware of any symptoms (OR, 6.34; 95% CI, 3.92-10.26; P\u2009<\u2009.001) compared with individuals without these characteristics. Overall, 1130 individuals (4.5%; 95% CI, 4.0%-5.0%) chose a different response than calling emergency medical services in response to a myocardial infarction. Conclusions and Relevance: Many adults in the United States remain unaware of the symptoms of and appropriate response to a myocardial infarction. In this study, several sociodemographic subgroups were associated with a higher risk of not being aware. They may benefit the most from targeted public health initiatives. ",
        "Combustible and Electronic Tobacco and Marijuana Products in Hip-Hop Music Videos, 2013-2017. Importance: Hip-hop is the leading music genre in the United States and its fan base includes a large proportion of adolescents and young adults of all racial and ethnic groups, particularly minorities. The appearance of combustible and electronic tobacco and marijuana products, especially brand placement and use by popular and influential artists, may increase the risk of tobacco and marijuana use and decrease perceptions of harm. Objective: To assess the prevalence of the appearance and use of combustible and electronic tobacco and marijuana products, including brand placement, in leading hip-hop songs. Design, Setting, and Participants: Analysis of top 50 songs from 2013 to 2017 of Billboard magazine's weekly Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs with videos that included the appearance or use of combustible tobacco and marijuana products (manufactured cigarettes, cigars, hookah or waterpipe, pipe, hand-rolled tobacco and marijuana products, marijuana buds); appearance of exhaled smoke or vapor without an identifiable source product; appearance or use of electronic tobacco and marijuana products (eg, electronic cigarettes); tobacco or marijuana brand placement; appearance or use of combustible and electronic tobacco and marijuana by main or featured artist. Data were collected from December 6, 2017, to June 4, 2018. Main Outcomes and Measures: Prevalence of (1) appearance or use of combustible tobacco and marijuana products, (2) appearance of smoke or vapor, (3) appearance or use of electronic tobacco and marijuana products, (4) tobacco or marijuana brand placement, and (5) appearance or use of combustible and electronic tobacco and marijuana by main or featured artist. Probability of appearance or use of combustible and electronic tobacco and marijuana products by quartile of viewership of videos. Results: The proportion of leading hip-hop videos containing combustible use, electronic use, or smoke or vapor ranged from 40.2% (76 of 189) in 2015, to 50.7% (102 of 201) in 2016. For each year, the leading category of combustible use was hand-rolled products. The appearance of branded products increased from 0% in 2013 (0 of 82) to 9.9% in 2017 (10 of 101) for combustible products, and from 25.0% in 2013 (3 of 12) to 87.5% in 2017 (14 of 16) for electronic products. The prevalence of combustible or electronic product use or exhaled smoke or vapor increased by quartile of total number of views: 41.9% (8700 to 19 million views) among songs in the first quartile of viewership and 49.7% among songs in the fourth quartile of viewership (112 million to 4 billion views). Conclusions and Relevance: Combustible and electronic tobacco and marijuana use frequently occurred in popular hip-hop music videos. The genre's broad appeal, use of branded products by influential artists, and rise of electronic product and marijuana use may contribute to a growing public health concern of tobacco and marijuana use.

        "Association of High Intakes of Vitamins B6 and B12 From Food and Supplements With Risk of Hip Fracture Among Postmenopausal Women in the Nurses' Health Study. Importance: Vitamin supplementation far exceeding recommended doses is popular in segments of the population. However, adverse effects can occur. In a previous secondary analysis of combined data from 2 double-blind randomized clinical trials (RCTs), an unexpected increased risk of hip fracture was found among those treated with high doses of vitamin B6 in combination with vitamin B12. Objectives: To study if high intakes of vitamins B6 and B12 from food and supplements were associated with a risk of hip fracture in the Nurses' Health Study and to investigate whether combined high intakes of both vitamins conferred a particularly increased fracture risk. Design, Setting, and Participants: In this prospective cohort study, 75\u202f864 postmenopausal women in the United States were followed up from June 1984 through May 2014. The dates of analysis were July 2016 to June 2018. Information on hip fracture and a wide range of potential confounders was collected at baseline and with biennial follow-up questionnaires. Extensive dietary information was collected approximately every 4 years with a semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire. Relative risks (RRs) were calculated by Cox proportional hazards regression, with cumulative average intakes of vitamins B6 and B12 as main exposures, adjusting for potential confounders. Main Outcome and Measure: Hip fracture. Results: During follow-up, 2304 of 75\u202f864 women had a hip fracture. Among the women with hip fractures, the median (range) age at hip fracture was 75.8 (46.7-93.0) years and the mean (SD) body mass index (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) was 24.3 (4.6). Median (interquartile range) cumulative average intakes of total vitamins B6 and B12 were 3.6 (4.8) mg/d and 12.1 (11.7) \u03bcg/d, respectively. Both vitamin B6 (RR, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.04-1.59 for an intake of \u226535 vs <2 mg/d; P\u2009=\u2009.06 for linear trend) and vitamin B12 (RR, 1.25; 95% CI, 0.98-1.58 for an intake of \u226530 vs <5 \u03bcg/d; P\u2009=\u2009.02 for linear trend) were associated with increased fracture risk. Risk was highest in women with a combined high intake of both vitamins (B6 \u226535 mg/d and B12 \u226520 \u03bcg/d), exhibiting an almost 50% increased risk of hip fracture (RR, 1.47; 95% CI, 1.15-1.89) compared with women with a low intake of both vitamins (B6 <2 mg/d and B12 <10 \u03bcg/d). Conclusions and Relevance: In this cohort study, a combined high intake of vitamins B6 and B12 was associated with an increased risk of hip fracture. The intakes were far higher than the recommended dietary allowances. These findings add to previous studies suggesting that vitamin supplements should be used cautiously because adverse effects can occur. ",
        "Preexposure Prophylaxis for the Prevention of HIV Infection: US Preventive Services Task Force Recommendation Statement. Importance: An estimated 1.1 million individuals in the United States are currently living with HIV, and more than 700\u202f000 persons have died of AIDS since the first cases were reported in 1981. In 2017, there were 38\u202f281 new diagnoses of HIV infection reported in the United States; 81% of these new diagnoses were among males and 19% were among females. Although treatable, HIV infection has no cure and has significant health consequences. Objective: To issue a new US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendation on preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for the prevention of HIV infection. Evidence Review: The USPSTF reviewed the evidence on the benefits of PrEP for the prevention of HIV infection with oral tenofovir disoproxil fumarate monotherapy or combined tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and emtricitabine and whether the benefits vary by risk group, population subgroup, or regimen or dosing strategy; the diagnostic accuracy of risk assessment tools to identify persons at high risk of HIV acquisition; the rates of adherence to PrEP in primary care settings; the association between adherence and effectiveness of PrEP; and the harms of PrEP when used for HIV prevention. Findings: The USPSTF found convincing evidence that PrEP is of substantial benefit in decreasing the risk of HIV infection in persons at high risk of HIV acquisition. The USPSTF also found convincing evidence that adherence to PrEP is highly associated with its efficacy in preventing the acquisition of HIV infection; thus, adherence to PrEP is central to realizing its benefit. The USPSTF found adequate evidence that PrEP is associated with small harms, including kidney and gastrointestinal adverse effects. The USPSTF concludes with high certainty that the magnitude of benefit of PrEP with oral tenofovir disoproxil fumarate-based therapy to reduce the risk of acquisition of HIV infection in persons at high risk is substantial. Conclusions and Recommendation: The USPSTF recommends offering PrEP with effective antiretroviral therapy to persons at high risk of HIV acquisition. (A recommendation). ",
        "Association of US News and World Report Top Ranking for Gastroenterology and Gastrointestinal Operation With Patient Outcomes in Abdominal Procedures. Importance: The US News & World Report (USNWR) annual ranking of the best hospitals for gastroenterology and gastrointestinal operations provides guidance and referral of care for medical and surgical gastrointestinal conditions. Objective: To investigate whether USNWR top-ranked hospitals for gastroenterology and gastrointestinal surgical procedures are associated with improvements in patient outcomes, compared with nonranked hospitals, in common advanced laparoscopic abdominal operations. Design, Setting, and Participants: This study used the Vizient database, which contains administrative, clinical, and financial inpatient information of index hospitalizations for US academic centers and their affiliated hospitals that are members of Vizient. Data were obtained on advanced laparoscopic abdominal operations performed from January 1, 2017, through December 31, 2017, at USNWR top-ranked hospitals (n\u2009=\u200916\u202f296 operations) and nonranked hospitals (n\u2009=\u200935\u202f573 operations). Abdominal operations included bariatric, colorectal, and hiatal hernia procedures. Operations on patients younger than 18 years, emergent cases, conversion cases, and patients with extreme severity of illness were excluded. Main Outcomes and Measures: Outcome measures included in-hospital mortality, mortality index (observed to expected mortality ratio), serious morbidity, length of stay, and cost. Results: A total of 51\u202f869 advanced laparoscopic abdominal operations were performed at 351 academic health centers and their community affiliates. Of these procedures, 16\u202f296 (31.4%) were performed at 41 top-ranked hospitals and 35\u202f573 (68.6%) at 310 nonranked hospitals. The annual case volume at top-ranked hospitals was 397 compared with 114 at nonranked hospitals. Between top-ranked and nonranked hospitals, no significant differences were found in in-hospital mortality (0.04% vs 0.07%; P\u2009=\u2009.33) or serious morbidity (1.06% vs 1.02%; P\u2009=\u2009.75). Compared with nonranked hospitals, advanced laparoscopic abdominal operations performed at top-ranked hospitals had higher mean costs ($7128 [$4917] vs $7742 [$6787]; P\u2009<\u2009.01) and longer mean lengths of stay (2.38 [2.60] days vs 2.73 [3.31] days; P\u2009<\u2009.01). Conclusions and Relevance: Although, among academic centers, the annual volume of advanced laparoscopic abdominal operations was 3-fold higher for USNWR top-ranked hospitals compared with nonranked hospitals, the volume did not appear to be associated with improved patient outcomes.

        "Patient Views on Religious Institutional Health Care. Importance: Federal protections allow health facilities to limit options to patients on the basis of religious values. Little is known about whether US adults consider religious affiliation when selecting facilities and whether they agree with such limitations. Objective: To understand patient views on religious institutional care. Design, Setting, and Participants: This is a population-based, cross-sectional survey study of US adults recruited from the probability-based AmeriSpeak Omnibus panel available from NORC (formerly the National Opinion Research Center) at the University of Chicago. Surveys were administered via internet or telephone during a 3-day fielding period in November 2017. Data analysis was performed from January 2018 to October 2019. Exposures: Participant characteristics, including religiosity measures. Main Outcomes and Measures: Whether patients consider religious affiliation when selecting a health care facility and their views on whether an institution's religious values should take precedence over their health choices. Responses were compared by gender. When gender differences existed, regression models were performed, and thematic content analysis was applied to open-ended responses. Results: There were 1446 participants (745 [51.5%] male; mean [SD] age, 46 [17] years), for a survey completion rate of 24.5% and weighted cumulative response weight of 7.3%. Most respondents (62.6%) were white, and the most common religion was Protestant (28.2%). When specifically asked, only 6.4% reported that they considered religious affiliation when selecting a health care facility; most participants (71.3%) reported when selecting a health care facility that they did not care whether it is religiously affiliated, 13.4% preferred a religious affiliation, and 15.3% preferred no religious affiliation. There were no gender differences. Most participants (71.4%) believed that their health choices should take priority over an institution's religious affiliation in services offered, and this was more common for women than for men (74.9% vs 68.1%; difference, 6.8%; 95% CI, 5.6%-8.2%; P\u2009=\u2009.005), who more commonly endorsed concerns for personal choice and autonomy over one's own body. Conclusions and Relevance: This study suggests that most patients value their personal choices, yet do not consider an institution's religious affiliation when choosing their source of health care. Women placed greater emphasis on their autonomy in comparison with an institution's right to invoke religious restrictions to care. Given the growth in ownership of health care facilities by religious entities in the United States and increasing attention to conscientious objections, these findings point to a need for advocacy and legislation that effectively balances protections for religious institutions with protections for patients.

        "Association of Clinical and Social Factors With Excess Hypertension Risk in Black Compared With White US Adults. Importance: The high prevalence of hypertension among the US black population is a major contributor to disparities in life expectancy; however, the causes for higher incidence of hypertension among black adults are unknown. Objective: To evaluate potential factors associated with higher risk of incident hypertension among black adults. Design, Setting, and Participants: Prospective cohort study of black and white adults selected from a longitudinal cohort study of 30\u202f239 participants as not having hypertension at baseline (2003-2007) and participating in a follow-up visit 9.4 years (median) later. Exposures: There were 12 clinical and social factors, including score for the Southern diet (range, -4.5 to 8.2; higher values reflect higher level of adherence to the dietary pattern), including higher fried and related food intake. Main Outcomes and Measures: Incident hypertension (systolic blood pressure \u2265140 mm Hg, diastolic blood pressure \u226590 mm Hg, or use of antihypertensive medications) at the follow-up visit. Results: Of 6897 participants (mean [SD] age, 62 [8] years; 26% were black adults; and 55% were women), 46% of black participants and 33% of white participants developed hypertension. Black men had an adjusted mean Southern diet score of 0.81 (95% CI, 0.72 to 0.90); white men, -0.26 (95% CI, -0.31 to -0.21); black women, 0.27 (95% CI, 0.20 to 0.33); and white women, -0.57 (95% CI, -0.61 to -0.54). The Southern diet score was significantly associated with incident hypertension for men (odds ratio [OR], 1.16 per 1 SD [95% CI, 1.06 to 1.27]; incidence of 32.4% at the 25th percentile and 36.1% at the 75th percentile; difference, 3.7% [95% CI, 1.4% to 6.2%]) and women (OR, 1.17 per 1 SD [95% CI, 1.08 to 1.28]; incidence of 31.0% at the 25th percentile and 34.8% at the 75th percentile; difference, 3.8% [95% CI, 1.5% to 5.8%]). The Southern dietary pattern was the largest mediating factor for differences in the incidence of hypertension, accounting for 51.6% (95% CI, 18.8% to 84.4%) of the excess risk among black men and 29.2% (95% CI, 13.4% to 44.9%) of the excess risk among black women. Among black men, a higher dietary ratio of sodium to potassium and an education level of high school graduate or less each mediated 12.3% of the excess risk of incident hypertension. Among black women, higher body mass index mediated 18.3% of the excess risk; a larger waist, 15.2%; less adherence to the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension diet, 11.2%; income level of $35\u202f000 or less, 9.3%; higher dietary ratio of sodium to potassium, 6.8%; and an education level of high school graduate or less, 4.1%. Conclusions and Relevance: In a mediation analysis comparing incident hypertension among black adults vs white adults in the United States, key factors statistically mediating the racial difference for both men and women included Southern diet score, dietary ratio of sodium to potassium, and education level. Among women, waist circumference and body mass index also were key factors. ",
        "Association of Genetic and Environmental Factors With Autism in a 5-Country Cohort. Importance: The origins and development of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) remain unresolved. No individual-level study has provided estimates of additive genetic, maternal, and environmental effects in ASD across several countries. Objective: To estimate the additive genetic, maternal, and environmental effects in ASD. Design, Setting, and Participants: Population-based, multinational cohort study including full birth cohorts of children from Denmark, Finland, Sweden, Israel, and Western Australia born between January 1, 1998, and December 31, 2011, and followed up to age 16 years. Data were analyzed from September 23, 2016 through February 4, 2018. Main Outcomes and Measures: Across 5 countries, models were fitted to estimate variance components describing the total variance in risk for ASD occurrence owing to additive genetics, maternal, and shared and nonshared environmental effects. Results: The analytic sample included 2\u202f001\u202f631 individuals, of whom 1\u202f027\u202f546 (51.3%) were male. Among the entire sample, 22\u202f156 were diagnosed with ASD. The median (95% CI) ASD heritability was 80.8% (73.2%-85.5%) for country-specific point estimates, ranging from 50.9% (25.1%-75.6%) (Finland) to 86.8% (69.8%-100.0%) (Israel). For the Nordic countries combined, heritability estimates ranged from 81.2% (73.9%-85.3%) to 82.7% (79.1%-86.0%). Maternal effect was estimated to range from 0.4% to 1.6%. Estimates of genetic, maternal, and environmental effects for autistic disorder were similar with ASD. Conclusions and Relevance: Based on population data from 5 countries, the heritability of ASD was estimated to be approximately 80%, indicating that the variation in ASD occurrence in the population is mostly owing to inherited genetic influences, with no support for contribution from maternal effects. The results suggest possible modest differences in the sources of ASD risk between countries. ",
        "Effect of Flexible Family Visitation on Delirium Among Patients in the Intensive Care Unit: The ICU Visits Randomized Clinical Trial. Importance: The effects of intensive care unit (ICU) visiting hours remain uncertain. Objective: To determine whether a flexible family visitation policy in the ICU reduces the incidence of delirium. Design, Setting and Participants: Cluster-crossover randomized clinical trial involving patients, family members, and clinicians from 36 adult ICUs with restricted visiting hours (<4.5 hours per day) in Brazil. Participants were recruited from April 2017 to June 2018, with follow-up until July 2018. Interventions: Flexible visitation (up to 12 hours per day) supported by family education (n\u2009=\u2009837 patients, 652 family members, and 435 clinicians) or usual restricted visitation (median, 1.5 hours per day; n\u2009=\u2009848 patients, 643 family members, and 391 clinicians). Nineteen ICUs started with flexible visitation, and 17 started with restricted visitation. Main Outcomes and Measures: Primary outcome was incidence of delirium during ICU stay, assessed using the CAM-ICU. Secondary outcomes included ICU-acquired infections for patients; symptoms of anxiety and depression assessed using the HADS (range, 0 [best] to 21 [worst]) for family members; and burnout for ICU staff (Maslach Burnout Inventory). Results: Among 1685 patients, 1295 family members, and 826 clinicians enrolled, 1685 patients (100%) (mean age, 58.5 years; 47.2% women), 1060 family members (81.8%) (mean age, 45.2 years; 70.3% women), and 737 clinicians (89.2%) (mean age, 35.5 years; 72.9% women) completed the trial. The mean daily duration of visits was significantly higher with flexible visitation (4.8 vs 1.4 hours; adjusted difference, 3.4 hours [95% CI, 2.8 to 3.9]; P\u2009<\u2009.001). The incidence of delirium during ICU stay was not significantly different between flexible and restricted visitation (18.9% vs 20.1%; adjusted difference, -1.7% [95% CI, -6.1% to 2.7%]; P\u2009=\u2009.44). Among 9 prespecified secondary outcomes, 6 did not differ significantly between flexible and restricted visitation, including ICU-acquired infections (3.7% vs 4.5%; adjusted difference, -0.8% [95% CI, -2.1% to 1.0%]; P\u2009=\u2009.38) and staff burnout (22.0% vs 24.8%; adjusted difference, -3.8% [95% CI, -4.8% to 12.5%]; P\u2009=\u2009.36). For family members, median anxiety (6.0 vs 7.0; adjusted difference, -1.6 [95% CI, -2.3 to -0.9]; P\u2009<\u2009.001) and depression scores (4.0 vs 5.0; adjusted difference, -1.2 [95% CI, -2.0 to -0.4]; P\u2009=\u2009.003) were significantly better with flexible visitation. Conclusions and Relevance: Among patients in the ICU, a flexible family visitation policy, vs standard restricted visiting hours, did not significantly reduce the incidence of delirium. Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02932358. Effect of an ICU Diary on Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Symptoms Among Patients Receiving Mechanical Ventilation: A Randomized Clinical Trial. Importance: Keeping a diary for patients while they are in the intensive care unit (ICU) might reduce their posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms. Objectives: To assess the effect of an ICU diary on the psychological consequences of an ICU hospitalization. Design, Setting, and Participants: Assessor-blinded, multicenter, randomized clinical trial in 35 French ICUs from October 2015 to January 2017, with follow-up until July 2017. Among 2631 approached patients, 709 adult patients (with 1 family member each) who received mechanical ventilation within 48 hours after ICU admission for at least 2 days were eligible, 657 were randomized, and 339 were assessed 3 months after ICU discharge. Interventions: Patients in the intervention group (n\u2009=\u2009355) had an ICU diary filled in by clinicians and family members. Patients in the control group (n\u2009=\u2009354) had usual ICU care without an ICU diary. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was significant PTSD symptoms, defined as an Impact Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) score greater than 22 (range, 0-88; a higher score indicates more severe symptoms), measured in patients 3 months after ICU discharge. Secondary outcomes, also measured at 3 months and compared between groups, included significant PTSD symptoms in family members; significant anxiety and depression symptoms in patients and family members, based on a Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale score greater than 8 for each subscale (range, 0-42; higher scores indicate more severe symptoms; minimal clinically important difference, 2.5); and patient memories of the ICU stay, reported with the ICU memory tool. Results: Among 657 patients who were randomized (median [interquartile range] age, 62 [51-70] years; 126 women [37.2%]), 339 (51.6%) completed the trial. At 3 months, significant PTSD symptoms were reported by 49 of 164 patients (29.9%) in the intervention group vs 60 of 175 (34.3%) in the control group (risk difference, -4% [95% CI, -15% to 6%]; P\u2009=\u2009.39). The median (interquartile range) IES-R score was 12 (5-25) in the intervention group vs 13 (6-27) in the control group (difference, -1.47 [95% CI, -1.93 to 4.87]; P\u2009=\u2009.38). There were no significant differences in any of the 6 prespecified comparative secondary outcomes. Conclusions and Relevance: Among patients who received mechanical ventilation in the ICU, the use of an ICU diary filled in by clinicians and family members did not significantly reduce the number of patients who reported significant PTSD symptoms at 3 months. These findings do not support the use of ICU diaries for preventing PTSD symptoms. Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02519725. ",
        "Clinician-Family Communication About Patients' Values and Preferences in Intensive Care Units. Importance: Little is known about whether clinicians and surrogate decision makers follow recommended strategies for shared decision making by incorporating intensive care unit (ICU) patients' values and preferences into treatment decisions. Objectives: To determine how often clinicians and surrogates exchange information about patients' previously expressed values and preferences and deliberate and plan treatment based on these factors during conferences about prognosis and goals of care for incapacitated ICU patients. Design, Setting, and Participants: A secondary analysis of a prospective, multicenter cohort study of audiorecorded clinician-family conferences between surrogates and clinicians of 249 incapacitated, critically ill adults was conducted. The study was performed between October 8, 2009, and October 23, 2012. Data analysis was performed between July 2, 2014, and April 20, 2015. Patient eligibility criteria included lack of decision-making capacity, a diagnosis of acute respiratory distress syndrome, and predicted in-hospital mortality of 50% or more. In addition to the patients, 451 surrogates and 144 clinicians at 13 ICUs at 6 US academic and community medical centers were included. Main Outcomes and Measures: Two coders analyzed transcripts of audiorecorded conversations for statements in which clinicians and surrogates exchanged information about patients' treatment preferences and health-related values and applied them in deliberation and treatment planning. Results: Of the 249 patients, 134 (54.9%) were men; mean (SD) age was 58.2 (16.5) years. Among the 244 conferences that addressed a decision about goals of care, 63 (25.8%; 95% CI, 20.3%-31.3%) contained no information exchange or deliberation about patients' values and preferences. Clinicians and surrogates exchanged information about patients' values and preferences in 167 (68.4%) (95% CI, 62.6%-74.3%) of the conferences and specifically deliberated about how the patients' values applied to the decision in 108 (44.3%; 95% CI, 38.0%-50.5%). Important end-of-life considerations, such as physical, cognitive, and social functioning or spirituality were each discussed in 87 (35.7%) or less of the conferences; surrogates provided a substituted judgment in 33 (13.5%); and clinicians made treatment recommendations based on patients' values and preferences in 20 conferences (8.2%). Conclusions and Relevance: Most clinician-family conferences about prognosis and goals of care for critically ill patients appear to lack important elements of communication about values and preferences, with robust deliberation being particularly deficient. Interventions may be needed to better prepare surrogates for these conversations and improve clinicians' communication skills for eliciting and incorporating patients' values and preferences into treatment decisions.

        "Association of Scheduled vs Emergency-Only Dialysis With Health Outcomes and Costs in Undocumented Immigrants With End-stage Renal Disease. Importance: In 40 of 50 US states, scheduled dialysis is withheld from undocumented immigrants with end-stage renal disease (ESRD); instead, they receive intermittent emergency-only dialysis to treat life-threatening manifestations of ESRD. However, the comparative effectiveness of scheduled dialysis vs emergency-only dialysis and the influence of treatment on health outcomes, utilization, and costs is uncertain. Objective: To compare the effectiveness of scheduled vs emergency-only dialysis with regard to health outcomes, utilization, and costs in undocumented immigrants with ESRD. Design, Setting, and Participants: Observational cohort study of 181 eligible adults with ESRD receiving emergency-only dialysis in Dallas, Texas, who became newly eligible and applied for private commercial health insurance in February 2015; 105 received coverage and were enrolled in scheduled dialysis; 76 were not enrolled in insurance for nonclinical reasons (eg, lack of capacity at a participating outpatient dialysis center) and remained uninsured, receiving emergency-only dialysis. We examined data on eligible persons during a 6-month period prior to enrollment (baseline period, August 1, 2014-January 31, 2015) until 12 months after enrollment (follow-up period, March 1, 2015-February 29, 2016), with an intervening 1-month washout period (February 2015). All participants were undocumented immigrants; self-reported data on immigration status was collected from Parkland Hospital electronic health records. Exposures: Enrollment in private health insurance coverage and scheduled dialysis. Main Outcomes and Measures: We used enrollment in health insurance and scheduled dialysis to estimate the influence of scheduled dialysis on 1-year mortality, utilization, and health care costs, using a propensity score-adjusted, intention-to-treat approach, including time-to-event analyses for mortality, difference-in-differences (DiD) negative binomial regression analyses for utilization, and DiD gamma generalized linear regression for health care costs. Results: Of 181 eligible adults with ESRD, 105 (65 men, 40 women; mean age, 45 years) received scheduled dialysis and 76 (38 men, 38 women; mean age, 52 years) received emergency-only dialysis. Compared with emergency-only dialysis, scheduled dialysis was significantly associated with reduced mortality (3% vs 17%, P\u2009=\u2009.001; absolute risk reduction, 14%; number needed to treat, 7; adjusted hazard ratio, 4.6; 95% CI, 1.2-18.2; P\u2009=\u2009.03), adjusted emergency department visits (-5.2 vs +1.1 visits/mo; DiD, -6.2; P\u2009<\u2009.001), adjusted hospitalizations (-2.1 vs -0.5 hospitalizations/6 months; DiD, -1.6; P\u2009<\u2009.001), adjusted hospital days (-9.2 vs +0.8 days/6 months; DiD, -9.9; P\u2009=\u2009.007), and adjusted costs (-$4316 vs +$1452 per person per month; DiD, -$5768; P\u2009<\u2009.001). Conclusions and Relevance: In this study, scheduled dialysis was significantly associated with reduced 1-year mortality, health care utilization, and costs compared with emergency-only dialysis. Scheduled dialysis should be the universal standard of care for all individuals with ESRD in the United States. ",
        "Implications of Changing Public Charge Immigration Rules for Children Who Need Medical Care. Importance: In October 2018, the Trump administration published a proposed rule change that would increase the chance of an immigrant being deemed a \"public charge\" and thereby denied legal permanent residency or entry to the United States. The proposed changes are expected to cause many immigrant parents to disenroll their families from safety-net programs, in large part because of fear and confusion about the rule, even among families to whom the rule does not technically apply. Objective: To simulate the potential harms of the rule change by estimating the number, medical conditions, and care needs of children who are at risk of losing their current benefits, including Medicaid and Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) and Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). Design, Setting, and Participants: A cross-sectional study used nationally representative data from 4007 children 17 years of age or younger who participated in the 2015 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey to assess their potential risk of losing benefits because they live with a noncitizen adult. Statistical analysis was conducted from January 3 to April 8, 2019. Main Outcomes and Measures: The number of children at risk of losing benefits; the number of children with medical need, defined as having a potentially serious medical diagnosis; being disabled (or functionally limited); or having received any specific treatment in the past year. The numbers of children who would be disenrolled under likely disenrollment scenarios drawn from research on immigrants before and after the 1996 welfare reform were estimated. Results: A total of 8.3 million children who are currently enrolled in Medicaid and CHIP or receiving SNAP benefits are potentially at risk of disenrollment, of whom 5.5 million have specific medical needs, including 615\u202f842 children with asthma, 53\u202f728 children with epilepsy, 3658 children with cancer, and 583\u202f700 children with disabilities or functional limitations. Nonetheless, among the population potentially at risk of disenrollment, medical need was less common than among other children receiving Medicaid and CHIP or SNAP (64.5%; 95% CI, 61.5%-67.4%; vs 76.0%; 95% CI, 73.9%-78.4%; P\u2009<\u2009.001). The proposed rule is likely to cause parents to disenroll between 0.8 million and 1.9 million children with specific medical needs from health and nutrition benefits. Conclusions and Relevance: The proposed public charge rule would likely cause millions of children to lose health and nutrition benefits, including many with specific medical needs that, if left untreated, may contribute to child deaths and future disability.

        "Public Health Insurance Expansion for Immigrant Children and Interstate Migration of Low-Income Immigrants. Importance: Federal policy changes in 2002 and 2009 led some states to expand public health insurance coverage to non-US-born children and pregnant women who are lawful permanent residents during their first 5 years of residency in the United States. In other states, there were concerns that insurance expansion could attract immigrants to relocate to gain free health insurance coverage. Objective: To examine whether expansion of public health insurance to non-US-born, lawful permanent resident children and pregnant women during their first 5 years of residency is associated with increased interstate migration among these groups. Design, Setting, and Participants: This difference-in-differences analysis included data on 208\u202f060 immigrants from the American Community Survey from 2000 through 2016, with analysis including all 50 states and the District of Columbia. The study sample included 2 treatment groups that became eligible under the expanded coverage: lawful permanent resident adults with at least 1 non-US-born child younger than 18 years (n\u2009=\u200936\u202f438) and lawful permanent resident women of reproductive age (n\u2009=\u200987\u202f418). Control groups that remained ineligible under the expanded coverage included lawful permanent resident adults without non-US-born children (n\u2009=\u2009171\u202f622), lawful permanent resident single men (n\u2009=\u200956\u202f142), and lawful permanent resident postreproductive women (n\u2009=\u200915\u202f129). A difference-in-differences design compared migration rates between eligible and ineligible immigrant groups before and after insurance coverage expansions. Data analysis was performed from November 3, 2018, to May 31, 2019. Exposures: Public health insurance coverage for immigrant women and children who were lawful permanent residents within 5 years of residency. Main Outcomes and Measures: Migration to a health expansion state from any other state and from a neighboring state. Results: Of 208\u202f060 immigrants (47% women in the weighted sample; mean [SD] age, 32.97 [12.94] years; 63% Hispanic), the mean (SD) annual move rate across the entire sample was 3% (17%). Expansion of public health insurance to non-US-born children or pregnant women within their first 5 years of residency was not associated with interstate movement for health care benefits. Coverage expansion for non-US-born children of lawful permanent residents was not associated with a change in the rate of in-migration higher than 1.78 percentage points or lower than -1.28 percentage points. The corresponding estimate for coverage expansion of lawful permanent resident pregnant women was a change higher than 1.38 percentage points and lower than -1.20 percentage points. Conclusions and Relevance: The results suggest that states considering expanding health care benefits coverage to recently arrived immigrant children and pregnant women may be unlikely to experience in-migration of these persons from other states, which has important implications for understanding short- and long-term program costs.

        "Injuries Associated With Standing Electric Scooter Use. Importance: Since September 2017, standing electric scooters have proliferated rapidly as an inexpensive, easy mode of transportation. Although there are regulations for safe riding established by both electric scooter companies and local governments, public common use practices and the incidence and types of injuries associated with these standing electric scooters are unknown. Objective: To characterize injuries associated with standing electric scooter use, the clinical outcomes of injured patients, and common use practices in the first US metropolitan area to experience adoption of this technology. Design, Setting, and Participants: This study of a case series used retrospective cohort medical record review of all patients presenting with injuries associated with standing electric scooter use between September 1, 2017, and August 31, 2018, at 2 urban emergency departments associated with an academic medical center in Southern California. All electric scooter riders at selected public intersections in the community surrounding the 2 hospitals were also observed during a 7-hour observation period in September 2018. Main Outcomes and Measures: Incidence and characteristics of injuries and observation of riders' common use practices. Results: Two hundred forty-nine patients (145 [58.2%] male; mean [SD] age, 33.7 [15.3] years) presented to the emergency department with injuries associated with standing electric scooter use during the study period. Two hundred twenty-eight (91.6%) were injured as riders and 21 (8.4%) as nonriders. Twenty-seven patients were younger than 18 years (10.8%). Ten riders (4.4%) were documented as having worn a helmet, and 12 patients (4.8%) had either a blood alcohol level greater than 0.05% or were perceived to be intoxicated by a physician. Frequent injuries included fractures (79 [31.7%]), head injury (100 [40.2%]), and contusions, sprains, and lacerations without fracture or head injury (69 [27.7%]). The majority of patients (234 [94.0%]) were discharged home from the emergency department; of the 15 admitted patients, 2 had severe injuries and were admitted to the intensive care unit. Among 193 observed electric scooter riders in the local community in September 2018, 182 (94.3%) were not wearing a helmet. Conclusions and Relevance: Injuries associated with standing electric scooter use are a new phenomenon and vary in severity. In this study, helmet use was low and a significant subset of injuries occurred in patients younger than 18 years, the minimum age permitted by private scooter company regulations. These findings may inform public policy regarding standing electric scooter use. ",
        "Effect of Digital Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia on Health, Psychological Well-being, and Sleep-Related Quality of Life: A Randomized Clinical Trial. Importance: Digital cognitive behavioral therapy (dCBT) is a scalable and effective intervention for treating insomnia. Most people with insomnia, however, seek help because of the daytime consequences of poor sleep, which adversely affects quality of life. Objectives: To investigate the effect of dCBT for insomnia on functional health, psychological well-being, and sleep-related quality of life and to determine whether a reduction in insomnia symptoms was a mediating factor. Design, Setting, and Participants: This online, 2-arm, parallel-group randomized trial comparing dCBT for insomnia with sleep hygiene education (SHE) evaluated 1711 participants with self-reported symptoms of insomnia. Participants were recruited between December 1, 2015, and December 1, 2016, and dCBT was delivered using web and/or mobile channels plus treatment as usual; SHE comprised a website and a downloadable booklet plus treatment as usual. Online assessments took place at 0 (baseline), 4 (midtreatment), 8 (posttreatment), and 24 (follow-up) weeks. Programs were completed within 12 weeks after inclusion. Main Outcomes and Measures: Primary outcomes were scores on self-reported measures of functional health (Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System: Global Health Scale; range, 10-50; higher scores indicate better health); psychological well-being (Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-being Scale; range, 14-70; higher scores indicate greater well-being); and sleep-related quality of life (Glasgow Sleep Impact Index; range, 1-100; higher scores indicate greater impairment). Secondary outcomes comprised mood, fatigue, sleepiness, cognitive failures, work productivity, and relationship satisfaction. Insomnia was assessed with the Sleep Condition Indicator (range: 0-32; higher scores indicate better sleep). Results: Of the 1711 participants included in the intention-to-treat analysis, 1329 (77.7%) were female, mean (SD) age was 48.0 (13.8) years, and 1558 (91.1%) were white. Use of dCBT was associated with a small improvement in functional health compared with SHE (adjusted difference [95% CI] at week 4, 0.90 [0.40-1.40]; week 8, 1.76 [1.24-2.28]; week 24, 1.76 [1.22-2.30]) and psychological well-being (adjusted difference [95% CI] at week 4, 1.04 [0.28-1.80]; week 8, 2.68 [1.89-3.47]; week 24, 2.95 [2.13-3.76]), and with a large improvement in sleep-related quality of life (at week 4, -8.76 [-11.83 to -5.69]; week 8, -17.60 [-20.81 to -14.39]; week 24, -18.72 [-22.04 to -15.41]) (all P\u2009<\u2009.01). A large improvement in insomnia mediated these outcomes (range mediated, 45.5%-84.0%). Conclusions and Relevance: Use of dCBT is effective in improving functional health, psychological well-being, and sleep-related quality of life in people reporting insomnia symptoms. A reduction in insomnia symptoms mediates these improvements. These results confirm that dCBT improves both daytime and nighttime aspects of insomnia, strengthening existing recommendations of CBT as the treatment of choice for insomnia.

        "Association Between Childhood Behavioral Problems and Insomnia Symptoms in Adulthood. Importance: Life-course determinants of insomnia, particularly the long-term association of childhood behavioral problems with insomnia later in life, are unknown. As childhood behaviors are measurable and potentially modifiable, understanding their associations with insomnia symptoms may provide novel insights into early intervention strategies to reduce the burden. Objective: To investigate the association between behavioral problems at 5, 10, and 16 years of age and self-reported insomnia symptoms at 42 years of age. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study used data from the United Kingdom 1970 Birth Cohort Study, an ongoing large-scale follow-up study. Participants were followed up from birth (1970) to age 42 years (2012). Missing data were imputed via multiple imputation. Statistical analysis was performed from February 1 to July 15, 2019. Exposures: Behavior measured at 5, 10, and 16 years of age using the Rutter Behavioral Scale (RBS). Children's behavior was classified as normal (\u226480th percentile), moderate behavioral problems (>80th to \u226495th percentile), and severe behavioral problems (>95th percentile) based on their RBS score. Main Outcomes and Measures: Self-reported difficulties initiating or maintaining sleep (DIMS) were collected using a self-administered questionnaire at 42 years of age. Log-binomial logistic regression, adjusted for several potential confounders, was used to estimate the association of childhood behavioral problems with insomnia symptoms in adulthood. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to check robustness of the findings. Results: Participants were followed up from a baseline age of 5 years (n\u2009=\u20098050; 3854 boys and 4196 girls), 10 years (n\u2009=\u20099090; 4365 boys and 4725 girls), or 16 years (n\u2009=\u20097653; 3575 boys and 4078 girls) until age 42 years. There was a 39% higher risk of DIMS (odds ratio [OR], 1.39; 95% CI, 1.04-1.84; P\u2009=\u2009.06 for trend) for participants with severe behavioral problems at 5 years of age compared with those with a normal RBS score. The odds of DIMS plus not feeling rested on waking (DIMS plus) in participants with severe behavioral problems at 5 years of age were 29% higher (odds ratio, 1.29; 95% CI, 0.97-1.70; P\u2009=\u2009.14 for trend) than participants with a normal RBS score, although this result was not statistically significant. Moderate and severe behavioral problems at 16 years of age were positively associated with DIMS and DIMS plus (moderate: OR, 1.28; 95% CI, 1.07-1.52; severe: OR, 1.67; 95% CI, 1.22-2.30; P\u2009<\u2009.001 for trend) and DIMS plus (moderate: OR, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.11-1.56; severe: OR, 1.47; 95% CI, 1.09-1.98; P\u2009<\u2009.001 for trend). Externalizing behavioral problems at 5 and 10 years of age were positively associated with insomnia symptoms at 42 years of age. Conclusions and Relevance: This study is the first to show associations of early-life behavioral problems, particularly early- and middle-childhood externalizing problems, with insomnia symptoms in adulthood. These findings underline the importance of addressing insomnia from a life-course perspective and considering the benefits of early behavioral intervention to sleep health. ",
        "Association of Insurance Status and Racial Disparities With the Detection of Early-Stage Breast Cancer. Importance: Compared with non-Hispanic white women, racial/ethnic minority women receive a diagnosis of breast cancer at a more advanced stage and have higher morbidity and mortality with breast cancer diagnosis. Access to care with adequate insurance may be associated with earlier diagnosis, expedited treatment, and improved prognosis. Objective: To examine the extent to which insurance is associated with access to timely breast cancer diagnosis and breast cancer stage differences among a large, diverse population of US patients with breast cancer. Design, Setting, and Participants: This retrospective, cross-sectional population-based study used data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program on 177\u202f075 women aged 40 to 64 years who received a diagnosis of stage I to III breast cancer between January 1, 2010, and December 31, 2016. Statistical analysis was performed from August 1, 2017, to October 1, 2019. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was the risk of having a more advanced stage of breast cancer at diagnosis (ie, stage III vs stages I and II). Mediation analyses were conducted to determine associations of race/ethnicity and proportion of observed differences mediated by health insurance status with earlier stage of diagnosis. Results: A total of 177\u202f075 women (mean [SD] age, 53.5 [6.8] years; 148\u202f124 insured and 28\u202f951 uninsured or receiving Medicaid) were included in the study. A higher proportion of women either receiving Medicaid or who were uninsured received a diagnosis of locally advanced breast cancer (stage III) compared with women with health insurance (20% vs 11%). In multivariable models, non-Hispanic black (odds ratio [OR], 1.46 [95% CI, 1.40-1.53]), American Indian or Alaskan Native (OR, 1.31 [95% CI, 1.07-1.61]) and Hispanic (OR, 1.35 [95% CI, 1.30-1.42]) women had higher odds of receiving a diagnosis of locally advanced disease (stage III) compared with non-Hispanic white women. When adjusting for health insurance and other socioeconomic factors, associations between race/ethnicity and risk of locally advanced breast cancer were attenuated (non-Hispanic black: OR, 1.29 [95% CI, 1.23-1.35]; American Indian or Alaskan Native: OR, 1.11 [95% CI, 0.91-1.35]; Hispanic: OR, 1.17 [95% CI, 1.12-1.22]). Nearly half (45%-47%) of racial differences in the risk of locally advanced disease were mediated by health insurance. Conclusions and Relevance: This study's findings suggest that nearly half of the observed racial/ethnic disparities in higher stage at breast cancer diagnosis are mediated by health insurance coverage.

        "Effect of Wearable Digital Intervention for Improving Socialization in Children With Autism Spectrum Disorder: A Randomized Clinical Trial. Importance: Autism behavioral therapy is effective but expensive and difficult to access. While mobile technology-based therapy can alleviate wait-lists and scale for increasing demand, few clinical trials exist to support its use for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) care. Objective: To evaluate the efficacy of Superpower Glass, an artificial intelligence-driven wearable behavioral intervention for improving social outcomes of children with ASD. Design, Setting, and Participants: A randomized clinical trial in which participants received the Superpower Glass intervention plus standard of care applied behavioral analysis therapy and control participants received only applied behavioral analysis therapy. Assessments were completed at the Stanford University Medical School, and enrolled participants used the Superpower Glass intervention in their homes. Children aged 6 to 12 years with a formal ASD diagnosis who were currently receiving applied behavioral analysis therapy were included. Families were recruited between June 2016 and December 2017. The first participant was enrolled on November 1, 2016, and the last appointment was completed on April 11, 2018. Data analysis was conducted between April and October 2018. Interventions: The Superpower Glass intervention, deployed via Google Glass (worn by the child) and a smartphone app, promotes facial engagement and emotion recognition by detecting facial expressions and providing reinforcing social cues. Families were asked to conduct 20-minute sessions at home 4 times per week for 6 weeks. Main Outcomes and Measures: Four socialization measures were assessed using an intention-to-treat analysis with a Bonferroni test correction. Results: Overall, 71 children (63 boys [89%]; mean [SD] age, 8.38 [2.46] years) diagnosed with ASD were enrolled (40 [56.3%] were randomized to treatment, and 31 (43.7%) were randomized to control). Children receiving the intervention showed significant improvements on the Vineland Adaptive Behaviors Scale socialization subscale compared with treatment as usual controls (mean [SD] treatment impact, 4.58 [1.62]; P\u2009=\u2009.005). Positive mean treatment effects were also found for the other 3 primary measures but not to a significance threshold of P\u2009=\u2009.0125. Conclusions and Relevance: The observed 4.58-point average gain on the Vineland Adaptive Behaviors Scale socialization subscale is comparable with gains observed with standard of care therapy. To our knowledge, this is the first randomized clinical trial to demonstrate efficacy of a wearable digital intervention to improve social behavior of children with ASD. The intervention reinforces facial engagement and emotion recognition, suggesting either or both could be a mechanism of action driving the observed improvement. This study underscores the potential of digital home therapy to augment the standard of care. Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03569176. ",
        "Assessment of Out-of-Network Billing for Privately Insured Patients Receiving Care in In-Network Hospitals. Importance: Although surprise medical bills are receiving considerable attention from lawmakers and the news media, to date there has been little systematic study of the incidence and financial consequences of out-of-network billing. Objective: To examine out-of-network billing among privately insured patients with an inpatient admission or emergency department (ED) visit at in-network hospitals. Design, Setting, and Participants: A retrospective analysis using data from the Clinformatics Data Mart database (Optum), which includes health insurance claims for individuals from all 50 US states receiving private health insurance from a large commercial insurer was conducted of all inpatient admissions (n\u2009=\u20095\u202f457\u202f981) and ED visits (n\u2009=\u200913\u202f579\u202f006) at in-network hospitals between January 1, 2010, and December 31, 2016. Data were collected and analyzed in March 2019. Exposures: Receipt of a bill for care from at least 1 out-of-network physician or medical transport service associated with patient admission or ED visit. Main Outcomes and Measures: The incidence of out-of-network billing and the potential amount of patients' financial liability associated with out-of-network bills from the admission or visit. Results: Of 5\u202f457\u202f981 inpatient admissions and 13\u202f579\u202f006 ED admissions between 2010 and 2016, the percentage of ED visits with an out-of-network bill increased from 32.3% to 42.8% (P\u2009<\u2009.001) during the study period, and the mean (SD) potential financial responsibility for these bills increased from $220 ($420) to $628 ($865) (P\u2009<\u2009.001; all dollar values in 2018 US$). Similarly, the percentage of inpatient admissions with an out-of-network bill increased from 26.3% to 42.0% (P\u2009<\u2009.001), and the mean (SD) potential financial responsibility increased from $804 ($2456) to $2040 ($4967) (P\u2009<\u2009.001). Conclusions and Relevance: Out-of-network billing appears to have become common for privately insured patients even when they seek treatment at in-network hospitals. The mean amounts billed appear to be sufficiently large that they may create financial strain for a substantial proportion of patients. ",
        "Association Between Fertility Treatment and Cancer Risk in Children. Importance: An increasing number of children worldwide are born after the use of fertility treatment, although it remains unclear whether the treatment affects the risk of childhood cancer and whether any associations observed are due to the use of specific drugs, the use of specific procedures, or the underlying infertility. Objective: To examine the association between different types of fertility treatments and cancer risk in children. Design, Setting, and Participants: A retrospective cohort study based on Danish population-based registry data and the Danish Infertility Cohort (individual record linkage) that included 1\u202f085\u202f172 children born in Denmark between January 1, 1996, and December 31, 2012, linked with parental information. There were a total of 2217 children diagnosed with cancer (follow-up occurred during 1996-2015). Exposures: Maternal fertility treatment during the index pregnancy, including the use of fertility drugs (clomiphene [n\u2009=\u200933\u202f835], gonadotropins [n\u2009=\u200957\u202f136], gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogs [n\u2009=\u200938\u202f653], human chorionic gonadotropin [n\u2009=\u200968\u202f181], progesterone [n\u2009=\u200941\u202f628], and estrogen [n\u2009=\u200916\u202f948]) and assisted reproductive technology (in vitro fertilization [n\u2009=\u200919\u202f448], intracytoplasmic sperm injection [n\u2009=\u200913\u202f417], and frozen embryo transfer [n\u2009=\u20093356]). Each exposure was examined separately and compared with children born to fertile women. Main Outcomes and Measures: Hazard ratios and incidence rate differences for childhood cancer. Results: After 12.2 million person-years of follow-up (mean, 11.3 years), the incidence rate of childhood cancer was 17.5 per 100\u202f000 for children born to fertile women (n\u2009=\u2009910\u202f291) and 44.4 per 100\u202f000 for children born after the use of frozen embryo transfer (n\u2009=\u20093356). Compared with children born to fertile women, the use of frozen embryo transfer was associated with an elevated risk of childhood cancer (14 cancer cases; hazard ratio, 2.43 [95% CI, 1.44 to 4.11]; incidence rate difference, 26.9 [95% CI, 2.8 to 51.0] per 100\u202f000), mainly due to an increased risk of leukemia (5 cancer cases; incidence rate, 14.4 per 100\u202f000; hazard ratio, 2.87 [95% CI, 1.19 to 6.93]; incidence rate difference, 10.1 [95% CI, -4.0 to 24.2] per 100\u202f000) and sympathetic nervous system tumors (<5 cancer cases; hazard ratio, 7.82 [95% CI, 2.47 to 24.70]). There were no statistically significant associations with the use of the other types of fertility treatment examined. Conclusions and Relevance: Among children born in Denmark, the use of frozen embryo transfer, compared with children born to fertile women, was associated with a small but statistically significant increased risk of childhood cancer; this association was not found for the use of other types of fertility treatment examined.

        "Association of In Vitro Fertilization With Childhood Cancer in the United States. Importance: In vitro fertilization (IVF) is associated with birth defects and imprinting disorders. Because these conditions are associated with an increased risk of childhood cancer, many of which originate in utero, descriptions of cancers among children conceived via IVF are imperative. Objective: To compare the incidence of childhood cancers among children conceived in vitro with those conceived naturally. Design, Setting, and Participants: A retrospective, population-based cohort study linking cycles reported to the Society for Assisted Reproductive Technology Clinical Outcomes Reporting System from January 1, 2004, to December 31, 2012, that resulted in live births from September 1, 2004, to December 31, 2013, to the birth and cancer registries of 14 states, comprising 66% of United States births and 75% of IVF-conceived births, with follow-up from September 1, 2004, to December 31, 2014. The study included 275\u202f686 children conceived via IVF and a cohort of 2\u202f266\u202f847 children, in which 10 births were randomly selected for each IVF birth. Statistical analysis was performed from April 1, 2017, to October 1, 2018. Exposure: In vitro fertilization. Main Outcomes and Measures: Cancer diagnosed in the first decade of life. Results: A total of 321 cancers were detected among the children conceived via IVF (49.1% girls and 50.9% boys; mean [SD] age, 4.6 [2.5] years for singleton births and 5.9 [2.4] years for multiple births), and a total of 2042 cancers were detected among the children not conceived via IVF (49.2% girls and 50.8% boys; mean [SD] age, 6.1 [2.6] years for singleton births and 4.7 [2.6] years for multiple births). The overall cancer rate (per 1\u202f000\u202f000 person-years) was 251.9 for the IVF group and 192.7 for the non-IVF group (hazard ratio, 1.17; 95% CI, 1.00-1.36). The rate of hepatic tumors was higher among the IVF group than the non-IVF group (hepatic tumor rate: 18.1 vs 5.7; hazard ratio, 2.46; 95% CI, 1.29-4.70); the rates of other cancers did not differ between the 2 groups. There were no associations with specific IVF treatment modalities or indication for IVF. Conclusions and Relevance: This study found a small association of IVF with overall cancers of early childhood, but it did observe an increased rate of embryonal cancers, particularly hepatic tumors, that could not be attributed to IVF rather than to underlying infertility. Continued follow-up for cancer occurrence among children conceived via IVF is warranted. ",
        "Association Between Automotive Assembly Plant Closures and Opioid Overdose Mortality in the United States: A Difference-in-Differences Analysis. Importance: Fading economic opportunity has been hypothesized to be an important factor associated with the US opioid overdose crisis. Automotive assembly plant closures are culturally significant events that substantially erode local economic opportunities. Objective: To estimate the extent to which automotive assembly plant closures were associated with increasing opioid overdose mortality rates among working-age adults. Design, Setting, and Participants: A county-level difference-in-differences study was conducted among adults aged 18 to 65 years in 112 manufacturing counties located in 30 commuting zones (primarily in the US South and Midwest) with at least 1 operational automotive assembly plant as of 1999. The study analyzed county-level changes from January 1, 1999, to December 31, 2016, in age-adjusted, county-level opioid overdose mortality rates before vs after automotive assembly plant closures in manufacturing counties affected by plant closures compared with changes in manufacturing counties unaffected by plant closures. Data analyses were performed between April 1, 2018, and July 20, 2019. Exposure: Closure of automotive assembly plants in the commuting zone of residence. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was the county-level age-adjusted opioid overdose mortality rate. Secondary outcomes included the overall drug overdose mortality rate and prescription vs illicit drug overdose mortality rates. Results: During the study period, 29 manufacturing counties in 10 commuting zones were exposed to an automotive assembly plant closure, while 83 manufacturing counties in 20 commuting zones remained unexposed. Mean (SD) baseline opioid overdose rates per 100\u202f000 were similar in exposed (0.9 [1.4]) and unexposed (1.0 [2.1]) counties. Automotive assembly plant closures were associated with statistically significant increases in opioid overdose mortality. Five years after a plant closure, mortality rates had increased by 8.6 opioid overdose deaths per 100\u202f000 individuals (95% CI, 2.6-14.6; P\u2009=\u2009.006) in exposed counties compared with unexposed counties, an 85% increase relative to the mortality rate of 12 deaths per 100\u202f000 observed in unexposed counties at the same time point. In analyses stratified by age, sex, and race/ethnicity, the largest increases in opioid overdose mortality were observed among non-Hispanic white men aged 18 to 34 years (20.1 deaths per 100\u202f000; 95% CI, 8.8-31.3; P\u2009=\u2009.001) and aged 35 to 65 years (12.8 deaths per 100\u202f000; 95% CI, 5.7-20.0; P\u2009=\u2009.001). We observed similar patterns of prescription vs illicit drug overdose mortality. Estimates for opioid overdose mortality in nonmanufacturing counties were not statistically significant. Conclusions and Relevance: From 1999 to 2016, automotive assembly plant closures were associated with increases in opioid overdose mortality. These findings highlight the potential importance of eroding economic opportunity as a factor in the US opioid overdose crisis. ",
        "Influence of Surgical Procedures and General Anesthesia on Child Development Before Primary School Entry Among Matched Sibling Pairs. Importance: Substantial preclinical evidence suggests that the developing brain is susceptible to injury from anesthetic drugs. Findings from clinical studies of the neurotoxic effects of anesthesia are mixed, but these effects can be influenced by unmeasured confounding from biological and environmental risk and protective factors on child development. Objective: To examine the association between surgical procedures that require general anesthesia before primary school entry and child development in biological siblings. Design, Setting, and Participants: This retrospective sibling-matched cohort study included sibling pairs aged 5 to 6 years with the same birth mother who had Early Development Instrument (EDI) data completed. The EDI is a population-based measure of child development that assesses children's readiness to learn in 5 major domains (physical health and well-being, social knowledge and competence, emotional health and maturity, language and cognitive development, and communication skills and general knowledge). All eligible children in public and Catholic schools in Ontario, Canada, from 2004 through 2012 were included. Data were analyzed from December 13, 2017, through July 27, 2018. Exposures: Surgical procedures that require general anesthesia from the date of birth to EDI completion. Main Outcomes and Measures: Early developmental vulnerability, defined as any major domain of the EDI in the lowest 10th percentile of the Ontario population. Results: Of the 187\u202f226 eligible children for whom the EDI was completed, a total of 10\u202f897 sibling pairs (21 794 children; 53.8% female; mean [SD] age, 5.7 [0.3] years) were subsequently identified, including 2346 with only 1 child exposed to surgery. No significant differences were found between exposed and unexposed children in early developmental vulnerability (697 of 3080 [22.6%] vs 3739 of 18 714 [20.0%]; adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.03; 95% CI, 0.98-1.14; P\u2009=\u2009.58) or for each of the 5 major EDI domains (aOR for language and cognitive development, 0.96 [95% CI, 0.80-1.14]; aOR for physical health and well-being, 1.09 [95% CI, 0.96-1.24]; aOR for social knowledge and competence, 0.98 [95% CI, 0.84-1.14]; aOR for emotional health and maturity, 0.98 [95% CI, 0.84-1.14]; and aOR for communication skills and general knowledge, 0.90 [95% CI, 0.77-1.05]), after adjusting for confounding factors (age at EDI completion, sex, mother's age at birth, and eldest sibling status). Conclusions and Relevance: In this provincial cohort study, children who had surgical procedures that require general anesthesia before primary school entry were not found to be at increased risk of adverse child development outcomes compared with their biological siblings who did not have surgery. These findings further support that anesthesia exposure in early childhood is not associated with detectable adverse child development outcomes. ",
        "Association of Constellations of Parental Risk With Children's Subsequent Anxiety and Depression: Findings From a HUNT Survey and Health Registry Study. Importance: The research focus on children of parents with alcohol use disorder has eclipsed the potentially wider-reaching detrimental effects of subclinical parental drinking, both alone and in combination with other parental risk factors. Objective: To identify constellations of early parental risk characterized by variations in drinking, mental health, and education in both parents and examine their prospective associations with children's contact with the health care system for anxiety and/or depression (ie, diagnoses or treatment). Design, Setting, and Participants: This prospective study was based on linked survey and health registries data. The sample included 8773 children from 6696 two-parent families in Norway who participated in the Nord-Tr\u00f8ndelag Health Study (HUNT) survey in 1995 to 1997 or 2006 to 2008, when the children were aged 13 to 19 years. Data were analyzed from January to September 2018. Exposures: Five constellations of early parental risks, characterized by variations in drinking frequencies and amounts, mental health, and education for both parents, as identified through latent profile analysis. Main Outcomes and Measures: Children's diagnoses or treatment of anxiety and/or depression from 2008 to 2016 were recorded in 3 health registries. The primary outcome was the total number of registries where participants presented (ranging from 0 to 3). Results: Of the 8773 included children, 4404 (50.2%) were boys, and the mean (SD) age at the time of participation in the Nord-Tr\u00f8ndelag Health Study was 16.1 (1.8) years. Prevalence of anxiety and/or depression, as evidenced in at least 1 registry record, was 24.3% (2132 of 8773). Early parental risk profiles risks marked by (1) the lowest parental education (adjusted relative risk, 1.13; 95% CI, 1.01-1.25) and (2) elevated drinking in both parents and elevated mental health symptoms in fathers (adjusted relative risk, 1.52; 95% CI, 1.03-2.22) were associated with a significant increase in risk of anxiety and/or depression in children from those families compared with children from no-risk families. Conclusions and Relevance: Studies seeking to understand prospective associations of parental drinking with children's mental health need to consider additional risk factors in combination with one another as well as parental behaviors and characteristics below clinically defined levels. When accumulated at a family level, even seemingly innocuous characteristics contributed to meaningful increases in risk of anxiety and/or depression among children, potentially translating into poorer mental health outcomes for many young people.

        "Association of Type 1 Diabetes With Standardized Test Scores of Danish Schoolchildren. Importance: Type 1 diabetes has been associated with cardiovascular disease and late complications such as retinopathy and nephropathy. However, it is unclear whether there is an association between type 1 diabetes and school performance in children. Objective: To compare standardized reading and mathematics test scores of schoolchildren with type 1 diabetes vs those without diabetes. Design, Setting, and Participants: Population-based retrospective cohort study from January 1, 2011, to December 31, 2015 (end date of follow-up), including Danish public schoolchildren attending grades 2, 3, 4, 6, and 8. Test scores were obtained in math (n\u2009=\u2009524\u202f764) and reading (n\u2009=\u20091\u202f037\u202f006). Linear regression models compared outcomes with and without adjustment for socioeconomic characteristics. Exposures: Type 1 diabetes. Main Outcomes and Measures: Primary outcomes were pooled test scores in math and reading (range, 1-100). Results: Among 631\u202f620 included public schoolchildren, the mean (SD) age was 10.31 (SD, 2.42) years, and 51% were male; 2031 had a confirmed diagnosis of type 1 diabetes. Overall, the mean combined score in math and reading was 56.11 (SD, 24.93). There were no significant differences in test scores found between children with type 1 diabetes (mean, 56.56) and children without diabetes (mean, 56.11; difference, 0.45 [95% CI, -0.31 to 1.22]). The estimated difference in test scores between children with and without type 1 diabetes from a linear regression model with adjustment for grade, test topic, and year was 0.24 (95% CI, -0.90 to 1.39) and 0.45 (95% CI, -0.58 to 1.49) with additional adjustment for socioeconomic status. Conclusions and Relevance: Among Danish public schoolchildren, there was no significant difference in standardized reading and mathematics test scores of children with type 1 diabetes compared with test scores of children without diabetes.

        "Association of Secondhand Smoking Exposure With Choroidal Thinning in Children Aged 6 to 8 Years: The Hong Kong Children Eye Study. Importance: Secondhand smoking is a risk to adult ocular health, but its effect on children's ocular development is not known. Objective: To assess the association between choroidal thickness and secondhand smoking exposure in children. Design, Setting, and Participants: Children aged 6 to 8 years were consecutively recruited from January 2016 to July 2017 from the population-based Hong Kong Children Eye Study at the Chinese University of Hong Kong Eye Centre. All participants underwent detailed ophthalmic investigations. Choroidal thickness was measured by swept-source optical coherence tomography, with built-in software that automatically segmented the choroid layer to analyze its terrain imagery. History of secondhand smoking was obtained from a questionnaire. Multiple linear regression analyses were performed to assess the correlation between choroidal thickness and secondhand exposure when controlling for confounding factors. Analysis began July 2018 and ended in April 2019. Main Outcomes and Measurements: The association between children's choroidal thickness and their exposure to secondhand smoking. Results: Of 1400 children, 941 (67.2%) had no exposure to secondhand smoking, and 459 (32.8%) had exposure to secondhand smoking. The mean (SD) age was 7.65\u2009(1.09) years for children in the nonexposure group and 7.54\u2009(1.11) years for children in the exposure group. After adjustment for age, sex, body mass index, axial length, and birth weight, exposure to secondhand smoking was associated with a thinner choroid by 8.3 \u03bcm in the central subfield, 7.2 \u03bcm in the inner inferior, 6.4 \u03bcm in the outer inferior, 6.4 \u03bcm in the inner temporal, and 7.3 \u03bcm in the outer temporal. Choroidal thinning with also associated with increased number of family smokers and increased quantity of secondhand smoking. An increase of 1 family smoker was associated with choroidal thinning by 7.86 \u03bcm in the central subfield, 4.51 \u03bcm in the outer superior, 6.23 \u03bcm in the inner inferior, 5.59 \u03bcm in the outer inferior, 6.06 \u03bcm in the inner nasal, and 6.55 \u03bcm in the outer nasal. An increase of exposure to 1 secondhand cigarette smoke per day was associated with choroidal thinning by 0.54 \u03bcm in the central subfield, 0.42 \u03bcm in the inner temporal, and 0.47 \u03bcm in the outer temporal. Conclusions and Relevance: This investigation showed that exposure to secondhand smoking in children was associated with choroidal thinning along with a dose-dependent effect. These results support evidence regarding the potential hazards of secondhand smoking to children. ",
        "Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors in Child and Adolescent Health, 1990 to 2017: Findings From the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors 2017 Study. Importance: Understanding causes and correlates of health loss among children and adolescents can identify areas of success, stagnation, and emerging threats and thereby facilitate effective improvement strategies. Objective: To estimate mortality and morbidity in children and adolescents from 1990 to 2017 by age and sex in 195 countries and territories. Design, Setting, and Participants: This study examined levels, trends, and spatiotemporal patterns of cause-specific mortality and nonfatal health outcomes using standardized approaches to data processing and statistical analysis. It also describes epidemiologic transitions by evaluating historical associations between disease indicators and the Socio-Demographic Index (SDI), a composite indicator of income, educational attainment, and fertility. Data collected from 1990 to 2017 on children and adolescents from birth through 19 years of age in 195 countries and territories were assessed. Data analysis occurred from January 2018 to August 2018. Exposures: Being under the age of 20 years between 1990 and 2017. Main Outcomes and Measures: Death and disability. All-cause and cause-specific deaths, disability-adjusted life years, years of life lost, and years of life lived with disability. Results: Child and adolescent deaths decreased 51.7% from 13.77 million (95% uncertainty interval [UI], 13.60-13.93 million) in 1990 to 6.64 million (95% UI, 6.44-6.87 million) in 2017, but in 2017, aggregate disability increased 4.7% to a total of 145 million (95% UI, 107-190 million) years lived with disability globally. Progress was uneven, and inequity increased, with low-SDI and low-middle-SDI locations experiencing 82.2% (95% UI, 81.6%-82.9%) of deaths, up from 70.9% (95% UI, 70.4%-71.4%) in 1990. The leading disaggregated causes of disability-adjusted life years in 2017 in the low-SDI quintile were neonatal disorders, lower respiratory infections, diarrhea, malaria, and congenital birth defects, whereas neonatal disorders, congenital birth defects, headache, dermatitis, and anxiety were highest-ranked in the high-SDI quintile. Conclusions and Relevance: Mortality reductions over this 27-year period mean that children are more likely than ever to reach their 20th birthdays. The concomitant expansion of nonfatal health loss and epidemiological transition in children and adolescents, especially in low-SDI and middle-SDI countries, has the potential to increase already overburdened health systems, will affect the human capital potential of societies, and may influence the trajectory of socioeconomic development. Continued monitoring of child and adolescent health loss is crucial to sustain the progress of the past 27 years. ",
        "Coverage of Nonpharmacologic Treatments for Low Back Pain Among US Public and Private Insurers. Importance: Despite epidemic rates of addiction and death from prescription opioids in the United States, suggesting the importance of providing alternatives to opioids in the treatment of pain, little is known regarding how payers' coverage policies may facilitate or impede access to such treatments. Objective: To examine coverage policies for 5 nonpharmacologic approaches commonly used to treat acute or chronic low back pain among commercial and Medicare Advantage insurance plans, plus an additional 6 treatments among Medicaid plans. Design, Setting, and Participants: Cross-sectional study of 15 commercial, 15 Medicaid, and 15 Medicare Advantage health plans for the 2017 calendar year in 16 states representing more than half of the US population. Interviews were conducted with 43 senior medical and pharmacy health plan executives from representative plans. Main Outcomes and Measures: Medical necessity and coverage status for the treatments examined, as well as the use of utilization management tools and cost-sharing magnitude and structure. Results: Commercial and Medicare insurers consistently regarded physical and occupational therapy as medically necessary, but policies varied for other therapies examined. Payers most commonly covered physical therapy (98% [44 of 45 plans]), occupational therapy (96% [43 of 45 plans]), and chiropractic care (89% [40 of 45 plans]), while transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (67% [10 of 15 plans]) and steroid injections (60% [9 of 15 plans]) were the most commonly covered among the therapies examined for Medicaid plans only. Despite evidence in the literature to support use of acupuncture and psychological interventions, these therapies were either not covered by plans examined (67% of all plans [30 of 45] did not cover acupuncture) or lacked information about coverage (80% of Medicaid plans [12 of 15] lacked information about coverage of psychological interventions). Utilization management tools, such as prior authorization, were common, but criteria varied greatly with respect to which conditions and what quantity and duration of services were covered. Interviewees represented 6 Medicaid managed care organizations, 2 Medicare Advantage or Part D plans, 9 commercial plans, and 3 trade organizations (eg, Blue Cross Blue Shield Association). Interviews with plan executives indicated a low level of integration between the coverage decision-making processes for pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic therapies for chronic pain. Conclusions and Relevance: Wide variation in coverage of nonpharmacologic treatments for low back pain may be driven by the absence of best practices, the administrative complexities of developing and revising coverage policies, and payers' economic incentives. Such variation suggests an important opportunity to improve the accessibility of services, reduce opioid use, and ultimately improve the quality of care for individuals with chronic, noncancer pain while alleviating the burden of opioid addiction and overdose.

        "Association of Childhood Oral Infections With Cardiovascular Risk Factors and Subclinical Atherosclerosis in Adulthood. Importance: Severe forms of common chronic oral infections or inflammations are associated with increased cardiovascular risk in adults. To date, the role of childhood oral infections in cardiovascular risk is not known because no long-term studies have been conducted. Objective: To investigate whether signs of oral infections in childhood are associated with cardiovascular risk factors and subclinical atherosclerosis in adulthood. Design, Setting, and Participants: The cohort study (n\u2009=\u2009755) was derived from the Cardiovascular Risk in Young Finns Study, an ongoing prospective cohort study in Finland initiated in 1980. Participants underwent clinical oral examinations during childhood, when they were aged 6, 9, or 12 years and a clinical cardiovascular follow-up in adulthood in 2001 at age 27, 30, or 33 years and/or in 2007 at age 33, 36, or 39 years. Cardiovascular risk factors were measured at baseline and during the follow-up until the end of 2007. Final statistical analyses were completed on February 19, 2019. Main Outcomes and Measures: Four signs of oral infections (bleeding on probing, periodontal probing pocket depth, caries, and dental fillings) were documented. Cumulative lifetime exposure to 6 cardiovascular risk factors was calculated from dichotomized variables obtained by using the area-under-the-curve method. Subclinical atherosclerosis (ie, carotid artery intima-media thickness [IMT]) was quantified in 2001 (n\u2009=\u2009468) and 2007 (n\u2009=\u2009489). Results: This study included 755 participants, of whom 371 (49.1%) were male; the mean (SD) age at baseline examination was 8.07 (2.00) years. In this cohort, 33 children (4.5%) had no sign of oral infections, whereas 41 (5.6%) had 1 sign, 127 (17.4%) had 2 signs, 278 (38.3%) had 3 signs, and 248 (34.1%) had 4 signs. The cumulative exposure to risk factors increased with the increasing number of oral infections both in childhood and adulthood. In multiple linear regression models, childhood oral infections, including signs of either periodontal disease (R2\u2009=\u20090.018; P\u2009=\u2009.01), caries (R2\u2009=\u20090.022; P\u2009=\u2009.008), or both (R2\u2009=\u20090.024; P\u2009=\u2009.004), were associated with adulthood IMT. The presence of any sign of oral infection in childhood was associated with increased IMT (third tertile vs tertiles 1 and 2) with a relative risk of 1.87 (95% CI, 1.25-2.79), whereas the presence of all 4 signs produced a relative risk of 1.95 (95% CI, 1.28-3.00). The associations were more obvious in boys: if periodontal disease were present, the corresponding estimate was 1.69 (95% CI, 1.21-2.36); if caries, 1.46 (95% CI, 1.04-2.05); and if all 4 signs of oral infections, 2.25 (95% CI, 1.30-3.89). The associations were independent of cardiovascular risk factors. Conclusions and Relevance: Oral infections in childhood appear to be associated with the subclinical carotid atherosclerosis seen in adulthood. ",
        "Prevalence of Prediabetes Among Adolescents and Young Adults in the United States, 2005-2016. Importance: Individuals with prediabetes are at increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and cardiovascular disease. The incidence and prevalence of type 2 diabetes in the US adolescent population have increased in the last decade. Therefore, it is important to monitor the prevalence of prediabetes and varying levels of glucose tolerance to assess the future risk of type 2 diabetes in the youngest segment of the population. Objective: To examine the prevalence of impaired fasting glucose (IFG), impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), and increased glycated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels in US adolescents (aged 12-18 years) and young adults (aged 19-34 years) without diabetes. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cross-sectional analyses of the 2005-2016 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey assessed a population-based sample of adolescents and young adults who were not pregnant, did not have diabetes, and had measured fasting plasma glucose, 2-hour plasma glucose after a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test, and HbA1c levels. Analysis began in April 2017. Main Outcomes and Measures: Impaired fasting glucose was defined as fasting plasma glucose of 100 mg/dL to less than 126 mg/dL, IGT as 2-hour plasma glucose of 140 mg/dL to less than 200 mg/dL, and increased HbA1c level as HbA1c level between 5.7% and 6.4%. The prevalence of IFG, isolated IFG, IGT, isolated IGT, increased HbA1c level, isolated increased HbA1c level, and prediabetes (defined as having IFG, IGT, or increased HbA1c level) were estimated. Fasting insulin levels and cardiometabolic risk factors across glycemic abnormality phenotypes were also compared. Obesity was defined as having age- and sex-specific body mass index (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) in the 95th percentile or higher in adolescents or 30 or higher in young adults. Results: Of 5786 individuals, 2606 (45%) were adolescents and 3180 (55%) were young adults. Of adolescents, 50.6% (95% CI, 47.6%-53.6%) were boys, and 50.6% (95% CI, 48.8%-52.4%) of young adults were men. Among adolescents, the prevalence of prediabetes was 18.0% (95% CI, 16.0%-20.1%) and among young adults was 24.0% (95% CI, 22.0%-26.1%). Impaired fasting glucose constituted the largest proportion of prediabetes, with prevalence of 11.1% (95% CI, 9.5%-13.0%) in adolescents and 15.8% (95% CI, 14.0%-17.9%) in young adults. In multivariable logistic models including age, sex, race/ethnicity, and body mass index, the predictive marginal prevalence of prediabetes was significantly higher in male than in female individuals (22.5% [95% CI, 19.5%-25.4%] vs 13.4% [95% CI, 10.8%-16.5%] in adolescents and 29.1% [95% CI, 26.4%-32.1%] vs 18.8% [95% CI, 16.5%-21.3%] in young adults). Prediabetes prevalence was significantly higher in individuals with obesity than in those with normal weight (25.7% [95% CI, 20.0%-32.4%] vs 16.4% [95% CI, 14.3%-18.7%] in adolescents and 36.9% [95% CI, 32.9%-41.1%] vs 16.6% [95% CI, 14.2%-19.4%] in young adults). Compared with persons with normal glucose tolerance, adolescents and young adults with prediabetes had significantly higher non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, systolic blood pressure, central adiposity, and lower insulin sensitivity (P\u2009<\u2009.05 for all). Conclusions and Relevance: In the United States, about 1 of 5 adolescents and 1 of 4 young adults have prediabetes. The adjusted prevalence of prediabetes is higher in male individuals and in people with obesity. Adolescents and young adults with prediabetes also present an unfavorable cardiometabolic risk profile, putting them both at increased risk of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. ",
        "Association Between Screen Time and Children's Performance on a Developmental Screening Test. Importance: Excessive screen time is associated with delays in development; however, it is unclear if greater screen time predicts lower performance scores on developmental screening tests or if children with poor developmental performance receive added screen time as a way to modulate challenging behavior. Objective: To assess the directional association between screen time and child development in a population of mothers and children. Design, Setting, and Participants: This longitudinal cohort study used a 3-wave, cross-lagged panel model in\u20092441 mothers and children in Calgary, Alberta, Canada, drawn from the All Our Families study. Data were available when children were aged 24, 36, and 60 months. Data were collected between October 20, 2011, and October 6, 2016. Statistical analyses were conducted from July 31 to November 15, 2018. Exposures: Media. Main Outcomes and Measures: At age 24, 36, and 60 months, children's screen-time behavior (total hours per week) and developmental outcomes (Ages and Stages Questionnaire, Third Edition) were assessed via maternal report. Results: Of the 2441 children included in the analysis, 1227 (50.2%) were boys. A random-intercepts, cross-lagged panel model revealed that higher levels of screen time at 24 and 36 months were significantly associated with poorer performance on developmental screening tests at 36 months (\u03b2, -0.06; 95% CI, -0.10 to -0.01) and 60 months (\u03b2, -0.08; 95% CI, -0.13 to -0.02), respectively. These within-person (time-varying) associations statistically controlled for between-person (stable) differences. Conclusions and Relevance: The results of this study support the directional association between screen time and child development. Recommendations include encouraging family media plans, as well as managing screen time, to offset the potential consequences of excess use. ",
        "Association Between Electronic Cigarette Use and Marijuana Use Among Adolescents and Young Adults: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis. Importance: Use of electronic cigarettes (often called e-cigarettes) has increased considerably among young people in the past 5 years. Use of e-cigarettes has been associated with higher rates of marijuana use, which is associated with several adverse health outcomes in youth. Objective: To characterize and quantify the association between e-cigarette and marijuana use among youth using a meta-analysis. Data Sources: PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science & ProQuest Dissertations and Theses were searched from inception to October 2018. A gray-literature search was also conducted on conference abstracts, government reports, and other sources. Study Selection: Included studies compared rates of marijuana use among youth aged 10 to 24 years who had used e-cigarettes vs those who had not used e-cigarettes. Two reviewers independently assessed studies for inclusion; disagreements were discussed with a third reviewer and resolved by consensus. Data Extraction and Synthesis: Data were extracted by 2 independent reviewers following Meta-analyses of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) reporting guidelines and pooled using a random-effects analysis. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale was used to assess data quality and validity of individual studies. Main Outcomes and Measures: Adjusted odds ratios (AORs) of self-reported past or current marijuana use by youth with vs without past or current e-cigarette use. Results: Twenty-one of 835 initially identified studies (2.5%) met selection criteria. The meta-analysis included 3 longitudinal and 18 cross-sectional studies that included 128\u202f227 participants. Odds of marijuana use were higher in youth who had an e-cigarette use history vs those who did not (AOR, 3.47 [95% CI, 2.63-4.59]; I2, 94%). Odds of marijuana use were significantly increased in youth who used e-cigarettes in both longitudinal studies (3 studies; AOR, 2.43 [95% CI, 1.51-3.90]; I2, 74%) and cross-sectional studies (18 studies; AOR, 3.70 [95% CI, 2.76-4.96]; I2, 94%). Odds of using marijuana in youth with e-cigarette use were higher in adolescents aged 12 to 17 years (AOR, 4.29 [95% CI, 3.14-5.87]; I2, 94%) than young adults aged 18 to 24 years (AOR, 2.30 [95% CI, 1.40-3.79]; I2, 91%). Conclusions and Relevance: This meta-analysis found a significant increase in the odds of past or current and subsequent marijuana use in adolescents and young adults who used e-cigarettes. These findings highlight the importance of addressing the rapid increases in e-cigarette use among youths as a means to help limit marijuana use in this population. ",
        "Estimating the Risk of Attempted Suicide Among Sexual Minority Youths: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis. Importance: Suicide is the second-leading cause of death among adolescents. Sexual minority individuals are at a higher risk of suicide and attempted suicide, but a precise and systematic evaluation of this risk among sexual minority youths has not been documented to our knowledge. Objective: To examine the risk of attempted suicide among sexual minority adolescents, differentiating for each sexual minority group. Data Sources: Electronic databases (PubMed, Embase, and PsycINFO) were searched for articles published through April 30, 2017, with the following search terms: heterosexual, homosexual, bisexual, transgender, adolescents, teens, and attempted suicide. Study Selection: Studies that reported attempted suicide in sexual minority adolescents compared with heterosexual peers were included. Thirty-five studies satisfied criteria for inclusion of 764 records identified. Data Extraction and Synthesis: Pooled analyses were based on odds ratios (ORs), with relevant 95% CIs, weighting each study with inverse variance models with random effects. Risk of publication bias and analysis of heterogeneity through univariable and multivariable meta-regressions were also rated. Main Outcomes and Measures: The evaluation of increased odds of attempted suicide among sexual minority youths compared with heterosexual peers. Results: Thirty-five studies reported in 22 articles that involved a total of 2\u202f378\u202f987 heterosexual and 113\u202f468 sexual minority adolescents (age range, 12-20 years) were included in the analysis. Sexual minority youths were generally at higher risk of attempted suicide (OR, 3.50; 95% CI, 2.98-4.12; c2\u2009=\u20093074.01; P\u2009<\u2009.001; I2\u2009=\u200999%). If estimated in each sexual minority group, the OR was 3.71 in the homosexual group (95% CI, 3.15-4.37; c2\u2009=\u2009825.20; P\u2009<\u2009.001; I2\u2009=\u200997%) and 4.87 in the bisexual group (95% CI, 4.76-4.98; c2\u2009=\u2009980.02; P\u2009<\u2009.001; I2\u2009=\u200998%); transgender youths were described as an individual group in only 1 study, which reported an OR of 5.87 (95% CI, 3.51-9.82). Meta-regressions weighted for the study weight highlighted that the presence of young participants (12 years old) was associated with heterogeneity in the bisexual group, whereas the year of sampling was associated with heterogeneity in the whole group when combined with other covariates. Conclusions and Relevance: Our findings suggest that youths with nonheterosexual identity have a significantly higher risk of life-threatening behavior compared with their heterosexual peers. Public awareness is important, and a careful evaluation of supportive strategies (eg, support programs, counseling, and destigmatizing efforts) should be part of education and public health planning.

        "Life Expectancy and Mortality Rates in the United States, 1959-2017. Importance: US life expectancy has not kept pace with that of other wealthy countries and is now decreasing. Objective: To examine vital statistics and review the history of changes in US life expectancy and increasing mortality rates; and to identify potential contributing factors, drawing insights from current literature and an analysis of state-level trends. Evidence: Life expectancy data for 1959-2016 and cause-specific mortality rates for 1999-2017 were obtained from the US Mortality Database and CDC WONDER, respectively. The analysis focused on midlife deaths (ages 25-64 years), stratified by sex, race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and geography (including the 50 states). Published research from January 1990 through August 2019 that examined relevant mortality trends and potential contributory factors was examined. Findings: Between 1959 and 2016, US life expectancy increased from 69.9 years to 78.9 years but declined for 3 consecutive years after 2014. The recent decrease in US life expectancy culminated a period of increasing cause-specific mortality among adults aged 25 to 64 years that began in the 1990s, ultimately producing an increase in all-cause mortality that began in 2010. During 2010-2017, midlife all-cause mortality rates increased from 328.5 deaths/100\u202f000 to 348.2 deaths/100\u202f000. By 2014, midlife mortality was increasing across all racial groups, caused by drug overdoses, alcohol abuse, suicides, and a diverse list of organ system diseases. The largest relative increases in midlife mortality rates occurred in New England (New Hampshire, 23.3%; Maine, 20.7%; Vermont, 19.9%) and the Ohio Valley (West Virginia, 23.0%; Ohio, 21.6%; Indiana, 14.8%; Kentucky, 14.7%). The increase in midlife mortality during 2010-2017 was associated with an estimated 33\u202f307 excess US deaths, 32.8% of which occurred in 4 Ohio Valley states. Conclusions and Relevance: US life expectancy increased for most of the past 60 years, but the rate of increase slowed over time and life expectancy decreased after 2014. A major contributor has been an increase in mortality from specific causes (eg, drug overdoses, suicides, organ system diseases) among young and middle-aged adults of all racial groups, with an onset as early as the 1990s and with the largest relative increases occurring in the Ohio Valley and New England. The implications for public health and the economy are substantial, making it vital to understand the underlying causes. ",
        "Analysis of Price Transparency via National Cancer Institute-Designated Cancer Centers' Chargemasters for Prostate Cancer Radiation Therapy. Importance: A January 2019 price transparency mandate by the US Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) allows patients to look up the prices of cancer treatment services at hospitals across the United States. Objective: To investigate the value of the CMS price transparency rule in allowing patients with prostate cancer to comparison shop by price for radiation treatment services among National Cancer Institute-designated cancer centers. Design, Setting, and Participants: We identified the February 2019 publicly available price-containing chargemasters for National Cancer Institute-designated cancer centers. We isolated the charge per fraction of intensity-modulated radiation therapy used in standard prostate radiation treatment. We then calculated the mean (SD) charges of a 28-fraction course of prostate irradiation at all included hospitals. No human participants were included in this study. Main Outcomes and Measures: We analyzed the degree of price variation, the association of the mean price to the price paid by Medicare, and the association of the prices with the practice expense geographic practice cost index, as determined by Medicare. Results: Of the 63 designated hospitals, 52 (84%) listed a price for simple intensity-modulated radiation therapy that is associated with standard prostate cancer radiation treatment. For a standard 28-fraction treatment, the charges ranged from $18\u202f368 to $399\u202f056, with a mean of $111\u202f728.80 (10.1 times the price paid by Medicare). There was a weak positive association between price and geographic practice cost index, with an r2 value of 0.13 (P\u2009=\u2009.008). Conclusions and Relevance: The availability of CMS-mandated hospital chargemasters and the descriptors used for simple intensity-modulated radiation therapy are not uniform, and the listed charges are highly variable. The association between listed charges and actual prices paid by patients or insurers is unclear, mitigating the value of the CMS rule for patients with prostate cancer who are receiving radiation therapy. This study suggests that implementation of the CMS price transparency policy may be insufficient to enable patients to estimate or compare prices for prostate cancer radiation treatment. ",
        "Association Between Life Purpose and Mortality Among US Adults Older Than 50 Years. Importance: A growing body of literature suggests that having a strong sense of purpose in life leads to improvements in both physical and mental health and enhances overall quality of life. There are interventions available to influence life purpose; thus, understanding the association of life purpose with mortality is critical. Objective: To evaluate whether an association exists between life purpose and all-cause or cause-specific mortality among older adults in the United States. Design, Setting, and Participants: The Health and Retirement Study (HRS) is a national cohort study of US adults older than 50 years. Adults between the ages of 51 to 61 were enrolled in the HRS, and their spouses or partners were enrolled regardless of age. Initially, individuals born between 1931 and 1941 were enrolled starting in 1992, but subsequent cohort enrichment was carried out. The present prospective cohort study sample was drawn from 8419 HRS participants who were older than 50 years and who had filled out a psychological questionnaire during the HRS 2006 interview period. Of these, 1142 nonresponders with incomplete life purpose data, 163 respondents with missing sample weights, 81 participants lost to follow-up, 1 participant with an incorrect survival time, and 47 participants with missing information on covariates were excluded. The final sample for analysis was 6985 individuals. Data analyses were conducted between June 5, 2018, and April 22, 2019. Exposures: Purpose in life was assessed for the 2006 interview period with a 7-item questionnaire from the modified Ryff and Keyes Scales of Psychological Well-being evaluation using a Likert scale ranging from 1 to 6, with higher scores indicating greater purpose in life; for all-cause and cause-specific mortality analyses, 5 categories of life purpose scores were used (1.00-2.99, 3.00-3.99, 4.00-4.99, 5.00-5.99, and 6.00). Main Outcomes and Measures: All-cause and cause-specific mortality were assessed between 2006 and 2010. Weighted Cox proportional hazards models were used to evaluate life purpose and mortality. Results: Of 6985 individuals included in the analysis, 4016 (57.5%) were women, the mean (SD) age of all participants was 68.6 (9.8) years, and the mean (SD) survival time for decedents was 31.21 (15.42) months (range, 1.00-71.00 months). Life purpose was significantly associated with all-cause mortality in the HRS (hazard ratio, 2.43; 95% CI, 1.57-3.75, comparing those in the lowest life purpose category with those in the highest life purpose category). Some significant cause-specific mortality associations with life purpose were also observed (heart, circulatory, and blood conditions: hazard ratio, 2.66; 95% CI, 1.62-4.38). Conclusions and Relevance: This study's results indicated that stronger purpose in life was associated with decreased mortality. Purposeful living may have health benefits. Future research should focus on evaluating the association of life purpose interventions with health outcomes, including mortality. In addition, understanding potential biological mechanisms through which life purpose may influence health outcomes would be valuable. ",
        "Evaluation of USPSTF Lung Cancer Screening Guidelines Among African American Adult Smokers. Importance: The United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends low-dose computed tomography screening for lung cancer. However, USPSTF screening guidelines were derived from a study population including only 4% African American smokers, and racial differences in smoking patterns were not considered. Objective: To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of USPSTF lung cancer screening eligibility criteria in a predominantly African American and low-income cohort. Design, Setting, and Participants: The Southern Community Cohort Study prospectively enrolled adults visiting community health centers across 12 southern US states from March 25, 2002, through September 24, 2009, and followed up for cancer incidence through December 31, 2014. Participants included African American and white current and former smokers aged 40 through 79 years. Statistical analysis was performed from May 11, 2016, to December 6, 2018. Exposures: Self-reported race, age, and smoking history. Cumulative exposure smoking histories encompassed most recent follow-up questionnaires. Main Outcomes and Measures: Incident lung cancer cases assessed for eligibility for lung cancer screening using USPSTF criteria. Results: Among 48\u202f364 ever smokers, 32\u202f463 (67%) were African American and 15\u202f901 (33%) were white, with 1269 incident lung cancers identified. Among all 48\u202f364 Southern Community Cohort Study participants, 5654 of 32\u202f463 African American smokers (17%) were eligible for USPSTF screening compared with 4992 of 15\u202f901 white smokers (31%) (P\u2009<\u2009.001). Among persons diagnosed with lung cancer, a significantly lower percentage of African American smokers (255 of 791; 32%) was eligible for screening compared with white smokers (270 of 478; 56%) (P\u2009<\u2009.001). The lower percentage of eligible lung cancer cases in African American smokers was primarily associated with fewer smoking pack-years among African American vs white smokers (median pack-years: 25.8 [interquartile range, 16.9-42.0] vs 48.0 [interquartile range, 30.2-70.5]; P\u2009<\u2009.001). Racial disparity was observed in the sensitivity and specificity of USPSTF guidelines between African American and white smokers for all ages. Lowering the smoking pack-year eligibility criteria to a minimum 20-pack-year history was associated with an increased percentage of screening eligibility of African American smokers and with equitable performance of sensitivity and specificity compared with white smokers across all ages (for a 55-year-old current African American smoker, sensitivity increased from 32.2% to 49.0% vs 56.5% for a 55-year-old white current smoker; specificity decreased from 83.0% to 71.6% vs 69.4%; P\u2009<\u2009.001). Conclusions and Relevance: Current USPSTF lung cancer screening guidelines may be too conservative for African American smokers. The findings suggest that race-specific adjustment of pack-year criteria in lung cancer screening guidelines would result in more equitable screening for African American smokers at high risk for lung cancer.

        "Association of Dietary Fiber and Yogurt Consumption With Lung Cancer Risk: A Pooled Analysis. Importance: Dietary fiber (the main source of prebiotics) and yogurt (a probiotic food) confer various health benefits via modulating the gut microbiota and metabolic pathways. However, their associations with lung cancer risk have not been well investigated. Objective: To evaluate the individual and joint associations of dietary fiber and yogurt consumption with lung cancer risk and to assess the potential effect modification of the associations by lifestyle and other dietary factors. Design, Setting, and Participants: This pooled analysis included 10 prospective cohorts involving 1\u202f445\u202f850 adults from studies that were conducted in the United States, Europe, and Asia. Data analyses were performed between November 2017 and February 2019. Using harmonized individual participant data, hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals for lung cancer risk associated with dietary fiber and yogurt intakes were estimated for each cohort by Cox regression and pooled using random-effects meta-analysis. Participants who had a history of cancer at enrollment or developed any cancer, died, or were lost to follow-up within 2 years after enrollment were excluded. Exposures: Dietary fiber intake and yogurt consumption measured by validated instruments. Main Outcomes and Measures: Incident lung cancer, subclassified by histologic type (eg, adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and small cell carcinoma). Results: The analytic sample included 627\u202f988 men, with a mean (SD) age of 57.9 (9.0) years, and 817\u202f862 women, with a mean (SD) age of 54.8 (9.7) years. During a median follow-up of 8.6 years, 18\u202f822 incident lung cancer cases were documented. Both fiber and yogurt intakes were inversely associated with lung cancer risk after adjustment for status and pack-years of smoking and other lung cancer risk factors: hazard ratio, 0.83 (95% CI, 0.76-0.91) for the highest vs lowest quintile of fiber intake; and hazard ratio, 0.81 (95% CI, 0.76-0.87) for high vs no yogurt consumption. The fiber or yogurt associations with lung cancer were significant in never smokers and were consistently observed across sex, race/ethnicity, and tumor histologic type. When considered jointly, high yogurt consumption with the highest quintile of fiber intake showed more than 30% reduced risk of lung cancer than nonyogurt consumption with the lowest quintile of fiber intake (hazard ratio, 0.67 [95% CI, 0.61-0.73] in total study populations; hazard ratio 0.69 [95% CI, 0.54-0.89] in never smokers), suggesting potential synergism. Conclusions and Relevance: Dietary fiber and yogurt consumption was associated with reduced risk of lung cancer after adjusting for known risk factors and among never smokers. Our findings suggest a potential protective role of prebiotics and probiotics against lung carcinogenesis. ",
        "Incidence and Determinants of Mental Health Service Use After Bariatric Surgery. Importance: Obesity is associated with an increased prevalence of psychiatric disorders. The association of bariatric surgery with mental health outcomes is poorly understood. Objective: To investigate the association of bariatric surgery with the incidence of outpatient, emergency department (ED), and inpatient mental health service use. Design, Setting, and Participants: This statewide, mirror-image, longitudinal cohort study used data from Western Australian Department of Health Data Linkage Branch records from all patients undergoing index (ie, first) bariatric surgery in Western Australia over a 10-year period (January 2007-December 2016), with mean (SD) follow-up periods of 10.2 (2.9) years before and 5.2 (2.9) years after index bariatric surgery. The data analysis was performed between November 2018 and March 2019. Exposures: Index bariatric surgery. Main Outcomes and Measures: The incidence and predictors for mental health presentations, deliberate self-harm, and suicide in association with the timing of bariatric surgery. Results: A total of 24\u202f766 patients underwent index bariatric surgery; of these, the mean (SD) age was 42.5 (11.7) years and 19\u202f144 (77.3%) were women. Use of at least 1 mental health service occurred in 3976 patients (16.1%), with 1401 patients (35.2%) presenting only before surgery, 1025 (25.8%) presenting before and after surgery, and 1550 patients (39.0%) presenting only after surgery. There was an increase in psychiatric illness presentations after bariatric surgery (outpatient clinic attendance: incidence rate ratio [IRR], 2.3; 95% CI, 2.3-2.4; ED attendance: IRR, 3.0; 95% CI, 2.8-3.2; psychiatric hospitalization: IRR, 3.0; 95% CI, 2.8-3.1). There was also a 5-fold increase in deliberate self-harm presentations to an ED after surgery (IRR, 4.7; 95% CI, 3.8-5.7), with 25 of 261 postoperatives deaths (9.6%) due to suicide. Complications after bariatric surgery requiring further surgical intervention and a history of mental health service provision before surgery were the most important associations with subsequent mental health presentations after surgery. Deliberate self-harm and mental and behavioral disorders due to psychoactive substance use before bariatric surgery were the main associations with subsequent deliberate self-harm or suicide after surgery. Conclusions and Relevance: We observed an increase in mental health service presentations after bariatric surgery, particularly among those who had prior psychiatric illnesses or developed surgical complications requiring further surgery. These findings caution the hypothesis that weight reduction by bariatric surgery will improve mental health in patients with obesity. ",
        "Self-compression Technique vs Standard Compression in Mammography: A Randomized Clinical Trial. Importance: Many women dread undergoing mammography, and some may not attend or reattend breast cancer screening because of the discomfort or pain induced by breast compression. Objective: To evaluate the noninferiority of the self-compression mammography technique for reducing breast thickness compared with standard compression. Design, Setting, and Participants: This prospective, parallel-group, noninferiority randomized clinical trial was conducted from May 7, 2013, to October 26, 2015, at 6 cancer care centers in France. Participants were women aged 50 to 75 years, without a history of recent breast surgical procedure or treatment, and who could perform self-compression. Analyses were performed on intention-to-treat basis from January 27, 2017, to March 30, 2018. Interventions: Patients were randomized 1:1 to the self-compression group or the standard compression group. Main Outcomes and Measures: Primary end point was breast thickness expressed as the mean of 4 views: right and left craniocaudal and right and left mediolateral oblique. The predefined noninferiority margin was a difference of 3 mm, with a 1-sided 95% CI. Secondary end points included compression force, image quality, requirement for additional views, pain, and patient satisfaction and radiographer assessment questionnaires. Results: Among the 549 women randomized, 548 (97.3%) completed the trial. Of these, 275 (48.8%) (mean [SD] age, 61.35 [6.34] years) were randomized to the self-compression arm and 273 (48.5%) (mean [SD] age, 60.84 [6.41] years) to the standard compression arm. The difference in the mean thickness between the 2 arms was lower than the noninferiority margin, with an upper 1-sided 95% CI less than 3 mm (-0.17; 95% CI,-\u221e to 1.89 mm; P\u2009<\u2009.05). Compression force was higher in the self-compression group compared with the standard compression arm for the 4 mammographic views. Pain was statistically significantly lower in the self-compression group (n\u2009=\u2009274) compared with the standard compression group (n\u2009=\u2009269) (median [interquartile range (IQR)] score, 2 [1-5] vs 3 [1-5]; P\u2009=\u2009.009). No difference was reported in the image quality scores of the 2 groups or in the number of additional views performed (median [IQR] extra views, 2 [2-2] vs 2 [2-3] extra views; P\u2009=\u2009.64), whatever the indication, including insufficient image quality (29 [16.8%] vs 27 [15.0%] insufficient quality views; P\u2009=\u2009.65). No adverse effects or pain were reported by the participants after the self-compression mammography. Conclusions and Relevance: Self-compression does not appear to be inferior to standard compression mammography in achieving minimal breast thickness without increasing pain or compromising image quality; this technique may be an effective option for women who want to be involved in their breast examination.

        "Social Media Posts by Recreational Marijuana Companies and Administrative Code Regulations in Washington State. Importance: Recreational marijuana use was legalized in the state of Washington in 2012, and the Washington Administrative Code (WAC) 314-55-155 was implemented to limit the exposure of youths to marijuana advertisements. Objectives: To evaluate the content of social media posts by marijuana companies and to assess the compliance of these posts with WAC regulations. Design, Setting, and Participants: In a cross-sectional study, a content analysis of 1027 social media posts was conducted to identify and assess compliance of WAC regulations with the business pages of recreational marijuana companies located on Facebook and Twitter platforms in the state of Washington from December 1, 2015, through November 30, 2016. Main Outcomes and Measures: Application of coding based on WAC regulations to focus on the prohibition of language that promoted the overconsumption of marijuana, that described its curative or therapeutic benefits, or that was designed to appeal to youths; and the requirements for warnings about intoxication, driving, health risks, and age restrictions for marijuana. Results: Of the 1027 posts on Facebook and Twitter from business pages of 6 marijuana companies, Facebook followers ranged from 342 to 1592 persons and Twitter followers ranged from 374 to 2915 persons per company. Findings for WAC regulations included 17 posts (1.7%) that encouraged overconsumption; 137 posts (13.3%) that promoted therapeutic benefits; and 9 posts (0.01%) that appealed to youths. Requirements for warnings addressing intoxication, driving, health risks, and age restrictions were present on 110 posts (10.7%). Some businesses repeatedly violated particular regulations; 7 of 17 (41.2%) posts encouraging overconsumption derived from 1 marijuana company. Conclusions and Relevance: Most social media posts by marijuana companies were consistent with WAC regulations that prohibit particular messages, but few companies provided required warning messages. Findings can be used toward implementation strategies for marijuana prevention to address these influential media messages. ",
        "Medical Marketing in the United States, 1997-2016. Importance: Manufacturers, companies, and health care professionals and organizations use an array of promotional activities to sell and increase market share of their products and services. These activities seek to shape public and clinician beliefs about laboratory testing, the benefits and harms of prescription drugs, and some disease definitions. Objective: To review the marketing of prescription drugs, disease awareness campaigns, health services, and laboratory tests and the related consequences and regulation in the United States over a 20-year period (1997-2016). Evidence: Analysis (1997-2016) of consumer advertising (Kantar Media data for spending and number of ads); professional marketing (IQVIA Institute for Human Data Science, Open Payments Data [Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services]); regulations and legal actions of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Federal Trade Commission (FTC), state attorneys general, and US Department of Justice; and searches (1975-2018) of peer-reviewed medical literature (PubMed), business journals (Business Source Ultimate), and news media (Lexis Nexis) for articles about expenditures, content, and consequences and regulation of consumer and professional medical marketing. Spending is reported in 2016 dollars. Findings: From 1997 through 2016, spending on medical marketing of drugs, disease awareness campaigns, health services, and laboratory testing increased from $17.7 to $29.9 billion. The most rapid increase was in direct-to-consumer (DTC) advertising, which increased from $2.1 billion (11.9%) of total spending in 1997 to $9.6 billion (32.0%) of total spending in 2016. DTC prescription drug advertising increased from $1.3 billion (79\u202f000 ads) to $6 billion (4.6 million ads [including 663\u202f000 TV commercials]), with a shift toward advertising high-cost biologics and cancer immunotherapies. Pharmaceutical companies increased DTC marketing about diseases treated by their drugs with increases in disease awareness campaigns from 44 to 401 and in spending from $177 million to $430 million. DTC advertising for health services increased from $542 million to $2.9 billion, with the largest spending increases by hospitals, dental centers, cancer centers, mental health and addiction clinics, and medical services (eg, home health). DTC spending on advertising for laboratory tests (such as genetic testing) increased from $75.4 million to $82.6 million, although the number of ads increased more substantially (from 14\u202f100 to 255\u202f300), reflecting an increase in less expensive electronic media advertising. Marketing to health care professionals by pharmaceutical companies accounted for most promotional spending and increased from $15.6 billion to $20.3 billion, including $5.6 billion for prescriber detailing, $13.5 billion for free samples, $979 million for direct physician payments (eg, speaking fees, meals) related to specific drugs, and $59 million for disease education. Manufacturers of FDA-approved laboratory tests paid $12.9 million to professionals in 2016. From 1997 through 2016, the number of consumer and professional drug promotional materials that companies submitted for FDA review increased from 34\u202f182 to 97\u202f252, while FDA violation letters for misleading drug marketing decreased from 156 to 11. Since 1997, 103 financial settlements between drug companies and federal and state governments resulted in more than $11 billion in fines for off-label or deceptive marketing practices. The FTC has acted against misleading marketing by a single for-profit cancer center. Conclusions and Relevance: Medical marketing increased substantially from 1997 through 2016, especially DTC advertising for prescription drugs and health services. Pharmaceutical marketing to health professionals accounted for most spending and remains high even with new policies to limit industry influence. Despite the increase in marketing over 20 years, regulatory oversight remains limited. ",
        "Analysis of Proposed Medicare Part B to Part D Shift With Associated Changes in Total Spending and Patient Cost-Sharing for Prescription Drugs. Importance: The US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has proposed to reform drug pricing in Medicare Part B, which primarily covers physician-administered drugs and biologic agents. One HHS proposal would shift coverage of certain drugs from Medicare Part B to Part D, which is administered by private prescription drug plans. Objective: To estimate the association of changes of a shift in Medicare Part B to Part D with total drug spending and patient cost-sharing. Design, Setting, and Participants: Retrospective drug cohort study of the 75 brand-name drugs associated with the highest Part B expenditures among fee-for-service Medicare beneficiaries in 2016. Main Outcomes and Measures: Estimated total Medicare spending in Part B and Part D; annual out-of-pocket costs in Part B and under the standard 2018 Part D benefit; and proportion of drugs in Part D's protected drug classes (immunosuppressants for prophylaxis of organ transplant rejection, antidepressants, antipsychotics, anticonvulsants, antiretrovirals, and antineoplastics). Results: At 2018 prices, total Medicare Part B spending for the 75 brand-name drugs with the highest Part B expenditures was estimated to be $21.6 billion annually. Under the proposed policy, total Part D drug spending for these drugs was estimated to range between $17.6 billion and $20.1 billion after rebates, corresponding to a 6.9% to 18.3% decrease in drug spending in Part D compared with Part B. Of the 75 drugs studied, 33 (44.0%) drugs, accounting for $9.5 billion (43.9%) in Part B spending, were in protected Part D classes where plans must cover essentially all drugs. For 67 drugs with available information, the prices for 65 (97.0%) were a median of 45.8% to 59.7% lower in comparator high-income countries than Part B drug prices. Median patient cost-sharing in Part B for all 75 brand-name drugs was $4683 (interquartile range [IQR], $1069-$9282) per year. Shifting Part B drugs to the 2018 standard Part D benefit was projected to decrease out-of-pocket costs by a median of $860 (IQR, -$3884 to $496) among Medicare beneficiaries without Medicaid or Part B supplemental insurance (Medigap). For beneficiaries who would qualify for the low-income subsidy program in Part D, cost-sharing would be lower in Part D than in Part B for all drugs. For beneficiaries with Medigap insurance, estimated Part D out-of-pocket costs exceeded average Medigap premium costs by a median of $1460 for those with Part D coverage and by a median of $1952 for those without Part D coverage. Conclusions and Relevance: Although the HHS proposal to shift certain drugs from Medicare Part B to Part D may reduce total drug spending, it may increase out-of-pocket costs for some Medicare beneficiaries, including those with Medicare supplement insurance. The Department of Health and Human Services should ensure that the proposed reforms benefit both patients and payers. ",
        "Quality of Home Health Agencies Serving Traditional Medicare vs Medicare Advantage Beneficiaries. Importance: Medicare Advantage (MA) enrollment is increasing, with one-third of Medicare beneficiaries currently selecting MA. Despite this growth, it is difficult to assess the quality of the health care professionals and organizations that serve MA beneficiaries or to compare them with health care professionals and organizations serving traditional Medicare (TM) beneficiaries. Elderly individuals served by home health agencies (HHAs) may be particularly susceptible to the negative outcomes associated with low-quality care. Objective: To compare the quality of HHAs that serve TM and MA beneficiaries. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cross-sectional, admission-level analysis used data from 4\u202f391\u202f980 home health admissions identified using the Outcome and Assessment Information Set (most commonly known as OASIS) admission assessments of Medicare beneficiaries in 2015 from Medicare-certified HHAs. A multinomial logistic regression model was used to assess whether an association existed between the Medicare plan type and HHA quality. The model was adjusted for patient demographics, acuity, and characteristics of the zip codes. Sensitivity analyses controlled for zip code fixed effects. The present analysis was conducted between October 2018 and March 2019. Exposures: Home health users were classified as TM or MA beneficiaries using the Master Beneficiary Summary File. The MA beneficiaries were further classified as enrolled in a high- or low-quality MA plan on the basis of publicly reported MA star ratings. Main Outcomes and Measures: Quality of HHA derived from the publicly reported patient care star ratings: low quality (1.0-2.5 stars), average quality (3.0-3.5 stars), or high quality (\u22654.0 stars). Results: Of 4\u202f391\u202f980 admissions, most (75.5%) were for TM beneficiaries (mean [SD] age, 76.1 [12.2] years), with 16.6% of beneficiaries enrolled in high-quality MA plans (mean [SD] age, 77.8 [10.0] years) and 7.9% in low-quality MA plans (mean [SD] age, 74.4 [11.4] years). Individuals enrolled in low-rated MA plans were most likely to be nonwhite (percentages of nonwhite individuals in TM, 14.3%; in high-quality MA, 19.8%; and in low-quality MA, 36.5%) and dual Medicare-Medicaid eligible (percentages for dual eligible in TM, 30.5%; in high-quality MA, 19.5%; and in low-quality MA, 43.3%). Among TM beneficiaries, 30.4% received care from high-quality HHAs, whereas 17.0% received care from low-quality HHAs. Compared with TM beneficiaries, those in a low-quality MA plan were 3.0 percentage points (95% CI, 2.6%-3.4%) more likely to be treated by a low-quality HHA and 4.9 percentage points (95% CI, -5.4% to -4.3%) less likely to be treated by a high-quality HHA. The MA beneficiaries in high-quality plans were also less likely to receive care from high-quality vs low-quality HHAs (-2.8% [95% CI, -3.1% to -2.2%] vs 1.0% [95% CI, 0.7%-1.3%]). Conclusions and Relevance: Compared with TM beneficiaries, MA beneficiaries residing in the same zip code enrolled in either high- or low-quality MA plans may receive treatment from lower-quality HHAs. Policy makers may consider incentivizing MA plans to include higher-quality HHAs in their networks and improving patient education regarding HHA quality. ",
        "Head and Neck Melanoma Incidence Trends in the Pediatric, Adolescent, and Young Adult Population of the United States and Canada, 1995-2014. Importance: Melanoma is one of the most common cancers worldwide, typically diagnosed in older adults. There is an increasing incidence in the younger population (age \u226440 years) in America. In addition, approximately 1 in 5 cases of melanoma affect the head and neck. However, there are limited data on the incidence of head and neck melanoma in the pediatric, adolescent, and young adult population in North America (United States and Canada). Objective: To assess 20-year demographic and incidence changes associated with head and neck melanoma in the pediatric, adolescent, and young adult population in North America. Design, Setting, and Participants: A descriptive analysis of retrospective data on head and neck melanoma from the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries' Cancer in North America public use data set from 1995 to 2014 was conducted. The data set currently includes 93% of the United States and 64% of the Canadian populations. Eligible data were from 12\u202f462 pediatric, adolescent, and young adult patients (aged 0-39 years) with a confirmed diagnosis of melanoma (International Classification of Diseases-Oncology 3 histologic types 8720-8790) in primary head and neck sites: skin of lip, not otherwise specified (C44.0); eyelid (C44.1); external ear (C44.2); skin of other/unspecified parts of face (C44.3); and skin of scalp and neck (C44.4). The study was conducted from January 26 to July 21, 2019. Main Outcomes and Measures: Log-linear regression was used to estimate annual percentage change in age-adjusted incidence rates (AAIRs) of head and neck melanoma. Results: Of the 12\u202f462 patients with head and neck melanoma included in the study, 6810 were male (54.6%). The AAIR was 0.51 per 100\u202f000 persons (95% CI, 0.50-0.52 per 100\u202f000 persons). In North America, the incidence of head and neck melanoma increased by 51.1% from 1995 to 2014. The rate was higher in the United States (AAIR, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.51-0.53 per 100\u202f000 person-years) than Canada (AAIR, 0.43; 95% CI, 0.40-0.45 per 100\u202f000 persons). In the United States, the incidence increased 4.68% yearly from 1995 to 2000 and 1.15% yearly from 2000 to 2014. In Canada, the incidence increased 2.18% yearly from 1995 to 2014. Male sex (AAIR, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.54-0.57 per 100\u202f000 persons), older age (AAIR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.79-0.80 per 100\u202f000 persons), and non-Hispanic white race/ethnicity (AAIR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.77-0.80 per 100\u202f000 persons) were associated with an increased incidence of head and neck melanoma. Conclusions and Relevance: The incidence of pediatric, adolescent, and young adult head and neck melanoma in North America appears to have increased by 51.1% in the past 2 decades, with males aged 15 to 39 years the main cohort associated with the increase.

        "Effect of Augmenting Standard Care for Military Personnel With Brief Caring Text Messages for Suicide Prevention: A Randomized Clinical Trial. Importance: Accessible and cost-effective interventions for suicidality are needed to address high rates of suicidal behavior among military service members. Caring Contacts are brief periodic messages that express unconditional care and concern and have been previously shown to prevent suicide deaths, attempts, ideation, and hospitalizations. Objective: To test the effectiveness of augmenting standard military health care with Caring Contacts delivered via text message to reduce suicidal thoughts and behaviors over 12 months. Design, Setting, and Participants: This randomized clinical trial was conducted at 3 military installations in the southern and western United States. Soldiers and Marines identified as being at risk of suicide were recruited between April 2013 and September 2016. The final follow-up was in September 2017. Interventions: Both groups received standard care, and the Caring Contacts group also received consisted of 11 text messages delivered on day 1, at week 1, at months 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12, and on participants' birthdays. Main Outcomes and Measures: Primary outcomes were current suicidal ideation and suicide risk incidents (hospitalization or medical evacuation). Secondary outcomes were worst-point suicidal ideation, emergency department visits, and suicide attempts. Suicidal ideation was measured by the Scale for Suicide Ideation, suicide risk incidents, and emergency department visits by the Treatment History Interview; attempted suicide was measured by the Suicide Attempt Self-Injury Count. Results: Among 658 randomized participants (329 randomizely assigned to each group), data were analyzed for 657 individuals (mean [SD] age, 25.2 [6.1] years; 539 men [82.0%]). All participants reported suicidal ideation at baseline, and 291 (44.3%) had previously attempted suicide. Of the 657 participants, 461 (70.2%) were assessed at 12 months. Primary outcomes were nonsignificant. There was no significant effect on likelihood or severity of current suicidal ideation or likelihood of a suicide risk incident; there was also no effect on emergency department visits. However, participants who received Caring Contacts (172 of 216 participants [79.6%]) had lower odds than those receiving standard care alone (179 of 204 participants [87.7%]) of experiencing any suicidal ideation between baseline and follow-up (odds ratio, 0.56 [95% CI, 0.33-0.95]; P\u2009=\u2009.03) and fewer had attempted suicide since baseline (21 of 233 [9.0%] in the group receiving Caring Contacts vs 34 of 228 [14.9%] in the standard-care group; odds ratio, 0.52 [95% CI, 0.29-0.92]; P\u2009=\u2009.03). Conclusions and Relevance: This trial provides inconsistent results on the effectiveness of caring text messages between primary and secondary outcomes, but this inexpensive and scalable intervention offers promise for preventing suicide attempts and ideation in military personnel. Additional research is needed. Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01829620. ",
        "Disparities in Low-Vision Device Use Among Older US Medicare Recipients. Importance: Low-vision assistive devices are not covered by Medicare and many private insurers, although there is evidence that they can improve functioning and quality of life. Little is known about whether sociodemographic disparities exist in the use of low-vision services by Medicare beneficiaries. Objective: To determine if sociodemographic disparities exist in the use of low-vision services by Medicare beneficiaries. Design, Setting, and Participants: Cross-sectional population-based survey. The National Health Interview Survey is an annually administered nationally representative US survey. Data used in this study were from the 2002, 2008, and 2016 National Health Interview Survey vision supplement. Participants who were Medicare beneficiaries 65 years and older with self-reported vision impairment were included. Main Outcomes and Measures: Multivariable logistic regression was performed to evaluate if sociodemographic or economic factors were associated with self-reported use of low-vision devices or low-vision rehabilitation among Medicare beneficiaries 65 years and older who self-reported vision impairment. Results: There were 3058 participants included in the study. The survey weighted proportion of participants who were men was 37.9% (95% CI, 35.8%-40.0%), while 79.1% (95% CI, 77.2%-80.9%) were non-Hispanic white, 10.2% (95% CI, 9.0%-11.5%) were non-Hispanic black, 6.7% (95% CI, 5.6%-8.1%) were Hispanic, and 4.0% (95% CI, 3.2%-5.0%) identified with another race/ethnicity. The weighted proportion who reported using low-vison devices and low-vision rehabilitation were 26.1% (95% CI, 24.2%-28.1%) and 3.5% (95% CI, 2.8%-4.3%), respectively. In a model adjusted for ocular diagnoses, Hispanic individuals (odds ratio,\u20090.61; 95% CI,\u20090.39-0.97) and individuals from other races/ethnicities (odds ratio,\u20090.39; 95% CI,\u20090.19-0.80), but not black individuals, were significantly less likely to report using low-vision devices than white individuals. In the model that was not adjusted for ocular diagnoses, black individuals (odds ratio,\u20090.73; 95% CI, 0.54-0.99) were also significantly less likely to report using low-vision devices. There were no significant racial/ethnic disparities for reported use of low-vision rehabilitation. Conclusions and Relevance: Additional research is needed to clarify the association between sociodemographics and use of low-vision services in the Medicare population. However, policy makers could consider expanding Medicare coverage to include low-vision devices in an effort to address significant disparities in the use of this evidence-based intervention. ",
        "Association of Domestic Responsibilities With Career Satisfaction for Physician Mothers in Procedural vs Nonprocedural Fields. Importance: Physicians who are mothers face challenges with equal distribution of domestic duties, which can be an obstacle in career advancement and achieving overall job satisfaction. Objectives: To study and report on the association between increased domestic workload and career dissatisfaction and if this association differed between proceduralists and nonproceduralists. Design, Setting, and Participants: Data for this study were gathered from April 28 to May 26, 2015, via an online survey of 1712 attending physician mothers recruited from the Physician Moms Group. Statistical analysis was performed from August 25, 2017, to November 20, 2018. Main Outcomes and Measures: Univariate analysis was performed for respondents who reported sole responsibility for 5 or more vs fewer than 5 main domestic tasks. Independent factors associated with career dissatisfaction or a desire to change careers were identified using a multivariate logistic regression model. Results: Of the 1712 respondents, most were partnered or married (1698 [99.2%]), of which 458 (27.0%) were in procedural specialties. Overall, respondents reported having sole responsibility for most domestic tasks, and there were no statistically significant differences between procedural and nonprocedural groups. Physician mothers in procedural specialties primarily responsible for 5 or more domestic tasks reported a desire to change careers more often than those responsible for fewer than 5 tasks (105 of 191 [55.0%] vs 114 of 271 [42.1%]; P\u2009=\u2009.008). This difference was not noted in physician mothers in nonprocedural specialties. In multivariate analysis of the proceduralist cohort, primary responsibility for 5 or more tasks was identified as a factor independently associated with the desire to change careers (odds ratio, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.0-2.2; P\u2009=\u2009.05). Conclusions and Relevance: Physician mothers report having more domestic responsibilities than their partners. For proceduralist mothers, self-reported higher levels of domestic responsibility were associated with career dissatisfaction. Increasing numbers of mothers in the medical workforce may create a demand for more equitable distribution and/or outsourcing of domestic tasks. ",
        "Patterns in Outpatient Benzodiazepine Prescribing in the United States. Importance: Benzodiazepines are implicated in a growing number of overdose-related deaths. Objectives: To quantify patterns in outpatient benzodiazepine prescribing and to compare them across specialties and indications. Design, Setting, and Participants: This serial cross-sectional study (January 1, 2003, through December 31, 2015) used nationally representative National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey data. The yearly population-based sample of outpatient visits among adults, ranging from 20\u202f884 visits in 2003 (representing 737 million visits) to 24\u202f273 visits in 2015 (representing 841 million visits) was analyzed. Prescribing patterns were examined by specialty and indication and used to calculate the annual coprescribing rate of benzodiazepines with other sedating medications. Data were analyzed from July 1, 2017, through November 30, 2018. Main Outcomes and Measures: Annual benzodiazepine visit rate. Results: Among the 386 457 ambulatory care visits from 2003 through 2015, a total of 919 benzodiazepine visits occurred in 2003 and 1672 in 2015, nationally representing 27.6 million and 62.6 million visits, respectively. The benzodiazepine visit rate doubled from 3.8% (95% CI, 3.2%-4.4%) to 7.4% (95% CI, 6.4%-8.6%; P\u2009<\u2009.001) of visits. Visits to primary care physicians accounted for approximately half of all benzodiazepine visits (52.3% [95% CI, 50.0%-54.6%]). The benzodiazepine visit rate did not change among visits to psychiatrists (29.6% [95% CI, 23.3%-36.7%] in 2003 to 30.2% [95% CI, 25.6%-35.2%] in 2015; P\u2009=\u2009.90), but increased among all other physicians, including primary care physicians (3.6% [95% CI, 2.9%-4.4%] to 7.5% [95% CI, 6.0%-9.5%]; P\u2009<\u2009.001). The benzodiazepine visit rate increased slightly for anxiety and depression (26.6% [95% CI, 22.6%-31.0%] to 33.5% [95% CI, 28.8%-38.6%]; P\u2009=\u2009.003) and neurologic conditions (6.8% [95% CI, 4.8%-9.5%] to 8.7% [95% CI, 6.2%-12.1%]; P\u2009<\u2009.001), but more so for back and/or chronic pain (3.6% [95% CI, 2.6%-4.9%] to 8.5% [95% CI, 6.0%-11.9%]; P\u2009<\u2009.001) and other conditions (1.8% [95% CI, 1.4%-2.2%] to 4.4% [95% CI, 3.7%-5.2%]; P\u2009<\u2009.001); use did not change for insomnia (26.9% [95% CI, 19.3%-36.0%] to 25.6% [95% CI, 15.3%-39.6%]; P\u2009=\u2009.72). The coprescribing rate of benzodiazepines with opioids quadrupled from 0.5% (95% CI, 0.3%-0.7%) in 2003 to 2.0% (95% CI, 1.4%-2.7%) in 2015 (P\u2009<\u2009.001); the coprescribing rate with other sedating medications doubled from 0.7% (95% CI, 0.5%-0.9%) to 1.5% (95% CI, 1.1%-1.9%) (P\u2009<\u2009.001). Conclusions and Relevance: The outpatient use of benzodiazepines has increased substantially. In light of increasing rates of overdose deaths involving benzodiazepines, understanding and addressing prescribing patterns may help curb the growing use of benzodiazepines. ",
        "Trends in Prices, Market Share, and Spending on Self-administered Disease-Modifying Therapies for Multiple Sclerosis in Medicare Part D. Importance: Before 2009, only 4 self-administered disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) were approved for the treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS). Since then, 7 new agents have entered the market. Objective: To assess trends in prices, market share, and spending on self-administered DMTs for MS in Medicare Part D from 2006 through 2016. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study used claims data from 2006 through 2016 from a 5% random sample of Medicare beneficiaries (a mean of 2.8 million Medicare beneficiaries per year). All prescription claims for self-administered DMTs for MS (glatiramer acetate, interferon beta-1a, interferon beta-1b, fingolimod hydrochloride, teriflunomide, dimethyl fumarate, and peginterferon beta-1a) were extracted throughout the study period. Main Outcomes and Measures: The main outcomes were the annual cost of treatment with each medication, based on Medicare Part D prescription claims gross costs and US Food and Drug Administration-approved recommended dosing; market share of each medication, defined as the proportion of pharmaceutical spending accounted by every drug; and pharmaceutical spending per 1000 Medicare beneficiaries for all drugs. The relative contributions of Medicare Part D Plans' payments, Medicare catastrophic coverage payments, low-income cost-sharing subsidies, patients' out-of-pocket costs, manufacturers' coverage gap discounts, and other payments toward pharmaceutical spending were further quantified. Results: Annual costs of treatment with self-administered DMTs for MS more than quadrupled from 2006 to 2016, from a mean (SD) of $18\u202f660 ($1177) to $75\u202f847 ($16\u202f956) and at a mean rate of 12.8% every year. Brand-name glatiramers accounted for the largest market share across the study period, ranging between $25\u202f552 of $79\u202f411 per 1000 Medicare beneficiaries (32.2%) and $10\u202f342 of $21\u202f365 per 1000 Medicare beneficiaries (48.4%). Platform therapies experienced a substantial drop from 2006 to 2016 in favor of newer therapies, with decreases in the market shares of brand-name glatiramers (per 1000 Medicare beneficiaries: $2861 of $7794 [36.7%] to $25\u202f552 of $79\u202f411 [32.2%]), interferon beta-1a (30 \u00b5g; per 1000 Medicare beneficiaries: $2521 of $7794 [32.3%] to $11\u202f298 of $79\u202f411 [14.2%]), interferon beta-1b (Betaseron; per 1000 Medicare beneficiaries: $1460 of $7794 [18.7%] to $3588 of $79\u202f411 [4.5%]), and interferon beta-1a (8.8/22/44 \u00b5g; per 1000 Medicare beneficiaries: $951 of $7794 [12.2%] to $6588 of $79\u202f411 [8.3%]) and increases in fingolimod (to $6311 of $79\u202f411 per 1000 Medicare beneficiaries [7.9%]), teriflunomide (to $7177 of $79\u202f411 per 1000 Medicare beneficiaries [9.0%]), and dimethyl fumarate (to $15\u202f262 of $79\u202f411 per 1000 Medicare beneficiaries [19.2%]). Throughout the study period, pharmaceutical spending per 1000 beneficiaries increased 10.2-fold (from $7794 to $79\u202f411), and out-of-pocket patient spending per 1000 beneficiaries increased 7.2-fold (from $372 to $2673). The relative contribution of federal payments toward pharmaceutical spending increased from $5335 of $7794 (68.5%) to $58\u202f620 to $79\u202f411 (73.8%). Conclusions and Relevance: Per this analysis, prices of self-administered DMTs for MS increased dramatically between 2006 and 2016. This resulted in a 7.2-fold increase in patient out-of-pocket costs. ",
        "Naloxone Prescriptions Among Commercially Insured Individuals at High Risk of Opioid Overdose. Importance: As opioid-related mortality continues to increase, naloxone remains a critical intervention in preventing overdose death. Opportunities to expand access through the health care setting should be optimized. Objective: To determine the characteristics of naloxone prescribing for US patients at high risk of opioid overdose. Design, Setting, and Participants: This retrospective cohort study used Truven Health MarketScan data from October 1, 2015, through December 31, 2016, of individuals with International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision codes related to opioid use, misuse, dependence, and overdose. The cohort included 138\u202f108 commercially insured individuals aged 15 years or older in the United States with claims related to opioid misuse or dependence, opioid-related overdose, or both. Exposures: Outpatient naloxone pharmacy claims. Main Outcomes and Measures: Demographic characteristics, clinical characteristics, health care service use, and proportion prescribed naloxone were included in multivariable logistic regression analyses to test the association of opioid risk group with naloxone claim. Results: Of 138\u202f108 high-risk individuals (mean [SD] age, 43.4 [0.4] years; 72\u202f435 [52.4%] men), 2135 (1.5%) were prescribed naloxone. Having prior diagnoses of both opioid misuse or dependence and overdose was associated with a greater likelihood of receiving naloxone (odds ratio [OR], 2.32; 95% CI, 1.98-2.72; P\u2009<\u2009.001) compared with having a prior diagnosis of opioid misuse or dependence without overdose. Having a prior diagnosis of opioid overdose alone was associated with a decreased likelihood of receiving naloxone (OR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.57-0.94; P\u2009=\u2009.01) compared with having a prior diagnosis of opioid misuse or dependence without overdose. Factors associated with lower naloxone prescription included being aged 30 to 44 years (OR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.62-0.84; P\u2009<\u2009.001) and being from the Midwest (OR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.54-0.71; P\u2009<\u2009.001) or West (OR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.74-0.98; P\u2009=\u2009.03). Opioid use disorder treatment, such as use of medication-assisted therapy (OR, 1.68; 95% CI, 1.53-1.86; P\u2009<\u2009.001), visiting a detoxification facility (OR, 1.51; 95% CI, 1.31-1.76; P\u2009<\u2009.001), or receiving other substance use disorder treatment (OR, 1.16; 95% CI, 1.04-1.30; P\u2009=\u2009.01), were associated with increased likelihood of receiving naloxone, as were receiving outpatient care from a pain specialist (OR, 1.57; 95% CI, 1.40-1.76; P\u2009<\u2009.001), psychologist (OR, 1.49; 95% CI, 1.29-1.70; P\u2009<\u2009.001), or surgeon (OR, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.08-1.32; P\u2009<\u2009.001). Overall, 98.5% (n\u2009=\u2009135\u202f973) of high-risk patients did not received naloxone, despite many interactions with the health care system, including 88\u202f618 hospitalizations, 229\u202f680 emergency department visits, 298\u202f058 internal medicine visits, and 568\u202f448 family practice visits. Conclusions and Relevance: Patients at high risk of opioid overdose rarely received prescriptions for naloxone despite numerous interactions with the health care system. Prescribing in emergency, inpatient, and outpatient settings represents an opportunity to improve access. ",
        "Association Between State Laws Facilitating Pharmacy Distribution of Naloxone and Risk of Fatal Overdose. Importance: Given high rates of opioid-related fatal overdoses, improving naloxone access has become a priority. States have implemented different types of naloxone access laws (NALs) and there is controversy over which of these policies, if any, can curb overdose deaths. We hypothesize that NALs granting direct authority to pharmacists to provide naloxone will have the greatest potential for reducing fatal overdoses. Objectives: To identify which types of NALs, if any, are associated with reductions in fatal overdoses involving opioids and examine possible implications for nonfatal overdoses. Design, Setting, and Participants: State-level changes in both fatal and nonfatal overdoses from 2005 to 2016 were examined across the 50 states and the District of Columbia after adoption of NALs using a difference-in-differences approach while estimating the magnitude of the association for each year relative to time of adoption. Policy environments across full state populations were represented in the primary data set. The association for 3 types of NALs was associated: NALs providing direct authority to pharmacists to prescribe, NALs providing indirect authority to prescribe, and other NALs. The study was conducted from January 2017 to January 2019. Exposures: Fatal and nonfatal overdoses in states that adopted NAL laws were compared with those in states that did not adopt NAL laws. Further consideration was given to the type of NAL passed in terms of its association with these outcomes. We hypothesize that NALs granting direct authority to pharmacists to provide naloxone will have the greatest potential for reducing fatal overdoses. Main Outcomes and Measures: Fatal overdoses involving opioids were the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes were nonfatal overdoses resulting in emergency department visits and Medicaid naloxone prescriptions. Results: In this evaluation of the dispensing of naloxone across the United States, NALs granting direct authority to pharmacists were associated with significant reductions in fatal overdoses, but they may also increase nonfatal overdoses seen in emergency department visits. The effect sizes for fatal overdoses grew over time relative to adoption of the NALs. These policies were estimated to reduce opioid-rated fatal overdoses by 0.387 (95% CI, 0.119-0.656; P\u2009=\u2009.007) per 100\u202f000 people in 3 or more years after adoption. There was little evidence of an association for indirect authority to dispense (increase by 0.121; 95% CI, -0.014 to 0.257; P\u2009=\u2009.09) and other NALs (increase by 0.094; 95% CI, -0.040 to 0.227; P\u2009=\u2009.17). Conclusions and Relevance: Although many states have passed some type of law affecting naloxone availability, only laws allowing direct dispensing by pharmacists appear to be useful. Communities in which access to naloxone is improved should prepare for increases in nonfatal overdoses and link these individuals to effective treatment. ",
        "Risk of Wrong-Patient Orders Among Multiple vs Singleton Births in the Neonatal Intensive Care Units of 2 Integrated Health Care Systems. Importance: Multiple-birth infants in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) have nearly identical patient identifiers and may be at greater risk of wrong-patient order errors compared with singleton-birth infants. Objectives: To assess the risk of wrong-patient orders among multiple-birth infants and singletons receiving care in the NICU and to examine the proportion of wrong-patient orders between multiple-birth infants and siblings (intrafamilial errors) and between multiple-birth infants and nonsiblings (extrafamilial errors). Design, Setting, and Participants: A retrospective cohort study was conducted in 6 NICUs of 2 large, integrated health care systems in New York City that used distinct temporary names for newborns per the requirements of The Joint Commission. Data were collected from 4 NICUs at New York-Presbyterian Hospital from January 1, 2012, to December 31, 2015, and 2 NICUs at Montefiore Health System from July 1, 2013, to June 30, 2015. Data were analyzed from May 1, 2017, to December 31, 2017. All infants in the 6 NICUs for whom electronic orders were placed during the study periods were included. Main Outcomes and Measures: Wrong-patient electronic orders were identified using the Wrong-Patient Retract-and-Reorder (RAR) Measure. This measure was used to detect RAR events, which are defined as 1 or more orders placed for a patient that are retracted (ie, canceled) by the same clinician within 10 minutes, then reordered by the same clinician for a different patient within the next 10 minutes. Results: A total of 10\u202f819 infants were included: 85.5% were singleton-birth infants and 14.5% were multiple-birth infants (male, 55.8%; female, 44.2%). The overall wrong-patient order rate was significantly higher among multiple-birth infants than among singleton-birth infants (66.0 vs 41.7 RAR events per 100\u202f000 orders, respectively; adjusted odds ratio, 1.75; 95% CI, 1.39-2.20; P\u2009<\u2009.001). The rate of extrafamilial RAR events among multiple-birth infants (36.1 per 100\u202f000 orders) was similar to that of singleton-birth infants (41.7 per 100\u202f000 orders). The excess risk among multiple-birth infants (29.9 per 100\u202f000 orders) appears to be owing to intrafamilial RAR events. The risk increased as the number of siblings receiving care in the NICU increased; a wrong-patient order error occurred in 1 in 7 sets of twin births and in 1 in 3 sets of higher-order multiple births. Conclusions and Relevance: This study suggests that multiple-birth status in the NICU is associated with significantly increased risk of wrong-patient orders compared with singleton-birth status. This excess risk appears to be owing to misidentification between siblings. These results suggest that a distinct naming convention as required by The Joint Commission may provide insufficient protection against identification errors among multiple-birth infants. Strategies to reduce this risk include using given names at birth, changing from temporary to given names when available, and encouraging parents to select names for multiple births before they are born when acceptable to families.

        "Racial Segregation and Inequality in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit for Very Low-Birth-Weight and Very Preterm Infants. Importance: Racial and ethnic minorities receive lower-quality health care than white non-Hispanic individuals in the United States. Where minority infants receive care and the role that may play in the quality of care received is unclear. Objective: To determine the extent of segregation and inequality of care of very low-birth-weight and very preterm infants across neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) in the United States. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study of 743 NICUs in the Vermont Oxford Network included 117\u202f982 black, Hispanic, Asian, and white infants born at 401 g to 1500 g or 22 to 29 weeks' gestation from January 2014 to December 2016. Analysis began January 2018. Main Outcomes and Measures: The NICU segregation index and NICU inequality index were calculated at the hospital level as the Gini coefficients associated with the Lorenz curves for black, Hispanic, and Asian infants compared with white infants, with NICUs ranked by proportion of white infants for the NICU segregation index and by composite Baby-MONITOR (Measure of Neonatal Intensive Care Outcomes Research) score for the NICU inequality index. Results: Infants (36\u202f359 black [31%], 21\u202f808 Hispanic [18%], 5920 Asian [5%], and 53\u202f895 white [46%]) were segregated among the 743 NICUs by race and ethnicity (NICU segregation index: black: 0.50 [95% CI, 0.46-0.53], Hispanic: 0.58 [95% CI, 0.54-0.61], and Asian: 0.45 [95% CI, 0.40-0.50]). Compared with white infants, black infants were concentrated at NICUs with lower-quality scores, and Hispanic and Asian infants were concentrated at NICUs with higher-quality scores (NICU inequality index: black: 0.07 [95% CI, 0.02-0.13], Hispanic: -0.10 [95% CI, -0.17 to -0.04], and Asian: -0.26 [95% CI, -0.32 to -0.19]). There was marked variation among the census regions in weighted mean NICU quality scores (range: -0.69 to 0.85). Region of residence explained the observed inequality for Hispanic infants but not for black or Asian infants. Conclusions and Relevance: Black, Hispanic, and Asian infants were segregated across NICUs, reflecting the racial segregation of minority populations in the United States. There were large differences between geographic regions in NICU quality. After accounting for these differences, compared with white infants, Asian infants received care at higher-quality NICUs and black infants, at lower-quality NICUs. Explaining these patterns will require understanding the effects of sociodemographic factors and public policies on hospital quality, access, and choice for minority women and their infants. ",
        "Adverse Events in Long-term Care Residents Transitioning From Hospital Back to Nursing Home. Importance: Transition from hospital to nursing home is a high-risk period for adverse events in long-term care (LTC) residents. Adverse events include harms from medical care, including failure to provide appropriate care. Objective: To report the incidence, type, severity, and preventability of adverse events in LTC residents transitioning from hospital back to the same LTC facility. Design, Setting, and Participants: Prospective cohort study of LTC residents discharged from hospital back to LTC from March 1, 2016, to December 31, 2017, and followed up for 45 days. In a random sample of 32 nursing homes located in 6 New England states, 555 LTC residents were selected, contributing 762 transitions from hospital back to the same LTC facility. Main Outcomes and Measures: The main outcome was an adverse event within the 45-day period after transition from hospital back to nursing home. Trained nurse abstractors reviewed nursing home records for the period, and then 2 physicians independently reviewed each potential adverse event to determine whether harm occurred and to characterize the type, severity, and preventability of each event. When reviewers disagreed, they met to reach consensus. Results: Of the 555 individual residents, 365 (65.6%) were female, and the mean (SD) age at the time of discharge was 82.2 (11.5) years. Five hundred twenty (93.7%) were non-Hispanic white, 21 (3.8%) were non-Hispanic black, 9 (1.6%) were Hispanic, and 5 (0.9%) were of other non-Hispanic race/ethnicity. In the cohort, there were 379 adverse events among 762 discharges. One hundred ninety-seven events (52.0%) related to resident care, with pressure ulcers, skin tears, and falls with injury representing the most common types of events in this category. Health care-acquired infections (108 [28.5%]) and adverse drug events (64 [16.9%]) were the next most common. One hundred ninety-eight (52.2%) adverse events were characterized as less serious. However, 145 (38.3%) events were deemed serious, 28 (7.4%) life-threatening, and 8 (2.1%) fatal. In terms of preventability, 267 (70.4%) adverse events were found to be preventable or ameliorable, with less serious events more often considered preventable or ameliorable (146 [73.7%]) compared with more severe events (121 [66.9%]). In addition, resident care-related adverse events such as fall with injury, skin tear, and pressure ulcer were more commonly deemed preventable (173 of 197 [87.8%]) compared with adverse drug events (39 of 64 [60.9%]) or health care-acquired infections (49 of 108 [45.4%]). Conclusions and Relevance: Adverse events developed in nearly 4 of 10 of discharges from hospital back to LTC. Most were preventable or ameliorable. Standardized reporting of events and better coordination and information transfer across settings are potential ways to prevent adverse events in LTC residents. ",
        "Effectiveness of Behaviorally Designed Gamification Interventions With Social Incentives for Increasing Physical Activity Among Overweight and Obese Adults Across the United States: The STEP UP Randomized Clinical Trial. Importance: Gamification, the use of game design elements in nongame contexts, is increasingly being used in workplace wellness programs and digital health applications. However, the best way to design social incentives in gamification interventions has not been well examined. Objective: To assess the effectiveness of support, collaboration, and competition within a behaviorally designed gamification intervention to increase physical activity among overweight and obese adults. Design, Setting, and Participants: This 36-week randomized clinical trial with a 24-week intervention and 12-week follow-up assessed 602 adults from 40 states with body mass indexes (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) of 25 or higher from February 12, 2018, to March 17, 2019. Interventions: Participants used a wearable device to track daily steps, established a baseline, selected a step goal increase, were randomly assigned to a control (n\u2009=\u2009151) or to 1 of 3 gamification interventions (support [n\u2009=\u2009151], collaboration [n\u2009=\u2009150], and competition [n\u2009=\u2009150]), and were remotely monitored. The control group received feedback from the wearable device but no other interventions for 36 weeks. The gamification arms were entered into a 24-week game designed using insights from behavioral economics with points and levels for achieving step goals. No gamification interventions occurred during follow-up. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was change in mean daily steps from baseline through the 24-week intervention period. Results: A total of 602 participants (mean [SD] age, 39 [10] years; mean [SD] body mass index, 30 [5]; 427 [70.9%] male) were included in the study. Compared with controls, participants had a significantly greater increase in mean daily steps from baseline during the intervention in the competition arm (adjusted difference, 920; 95% CI, 513-1328; P\u2009<\u2009.001), support arm (adjusted difference, 689; 95% CI, 267-977; P\u2009<\u2009.001), and collaboration arm (adjusted difference, 637; 95% CI, 258-1017; P\u2009=\u2009.001). During follow-up, physical activity remained significantly greater in the competition arm than in the control arm (adjusted difference, 569; 95% CI, 142-996; P\u2009=\u2009.009) but was not significantly greater in the support (adjusted difference, 428; 95% CI, 19-837; P\u2009=\u2009.04) and collaboration (adjusted difference, 126; 95% CI, -248 to 468; P\u2009=\u2009.49) arms than in the control arm. Conclusions and Relevance: All 3 gamification interventions significantly increased physical activity during the 24-week intervention, and competition was the most effective. Physical activity was lower in all arms during follow-up and only remained significantly greater in the competition arm than in the control arm. Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03311230. ",
        "Association of Exposure to Artificial Light at Night While Sleeping With Risk of Obesity in Women. Importance: Short sleep has been associated with obesity, but to date the association between exposure to artificial light at night (ALAN) while sleeping and obesity is unknown. Objective: To determine whether ALAN exposure while sleeping is associated with the prevalence and risk of obesity. Design, Setting, and Participants: This baseline and prospective analysis included women aged 35 to 74 years enrolled in the Sister Study in all 50 US states and Puerto Rico from July 2003 through March 2009. Follow-up was completed on August 14, 2015. A total of 43\u202f722 women with no history of cancer or cardiovascular disease who were not shift workers, daytime sleepers, or pregnant at baseline were included in the analysis. Data were analyzed from September 1, 2017, through December 31, 2018. Exposures: Artificial light at night while sleeping reported at enrollment, categorized as no light, small nightlight in the room, light outside the room, and light or television in the room. Main Outcomes and Measures: Prevalent obesity at baseline was based on measured general obesity (body mass index [BMI] \u226530.0) and central obesity (waist circumference [WC] \u226588 cm, waist-to-hip ratio [WHR] \u22650.85, or waist-to-height ratio [WHtR]\u22650.5). To evaluate incident overweight and obesity, self-reported BMI at enrollment was compared with self-reported BMI at follow-up (mean [SD] follow-up,\u20095.7 [1.0] years). Generalized log-linear models with robust error variance were used to estimate multivariable-adjusted prevalence ratios (PRs) and relative risks (RRs) with 95% CIs for prevalent and incident obesity. Results: Among the population of 43 722 women (mean [SD] age, 55.4 [8.9] years), having any ALAN exposure while sleeping was positively associated with a higher prevalence of obesity at baseline, as measured using BMI (PR, 1.03; 95% CI, 1.02-1.03), WC (PR, 1.12; 95% CI, 1.09-1.16), WHR (PR, 1.04; 95% CI, 1.00-1.08), and WHtR (PR, 1.07; 95% CI, 1.04-1.09), after adjusting for confounding factors, with P\u2009<\u2009.001 for trend for each measure. Having any ALAN exposure while sleeping was also associated with incident obesity (RR, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.06-1.34). Compared with no ALAN, sleeping with a television or a light on in the room was associated with gaining 5 kg or more (RR, 1.17; 95% CI, 1.08-1.27; P\u2009<\u2009.001 for trend), a BMI increase of 10% or more (RR, 1.13; 95% CI, 1.02-1.26; P\u2009=\u2009.04 for trend), incident overweight (RR, 1.22; 95% CI,1.06-1.40;\u2009P\u2009=\u2009.03 for trend), and incident obesity (RR, 1.33; 95% CI, 1.13-1.57; P\u2009<\u2009.001 for trend). Results were supported by sensitivity analyses and additional multivariable analyses including potential mediators such as sleep duration and quality, diet, and physical activity. Conclusions and Relevance: These results suggest that exposure to ALAN while sleeping may be a risk factor for weight gain and development of overweight or obesity. Further prospective and interventional studies could help elucidate this association and clarify whether lowering exposure to ALAN while sleeping can promote obesity prevention. ",
        "Assessment of Differences in Clinical Activity and Medicare Payments Among Female and Male Radiation Oncologists. Importance: Although physician sex is known to influence salary even after controlling for productivity, sex-based differences in clinical activity and reimbursement among radiation oncologists are poorly understood. Objectives: To evaluate differences by sex in productivity, breadth of practice, and payments and to characterize Medicare reimbursement by sex among similarly productive groups of radiation oncologists. Design, Setting, and Participants: A retrospective cohort study was conducted using the January 1 to December 31, 2016, Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Physician and Other Supplier Public Use File (POSPUF) to identify charge and payment information for individual radiation oncologists. Clinicians were part of a population-based sample of US radiation oncologists who bill Medicare in both non-facility-based (NFB) and facility-based (FB) practice settings. Analysis was conducted from June 5 to 25, 2018. Main Outcomes and Measures: Outcome measurements included physician productivity (measured by number of Medicare charges), physician payments (reported as total Medicare payments as well as mean payments per charge submitted and per beneficiary treated), and physician breadth of practice (measured by number of unique Medicare billing codes) in NFB and FB settings. Results: A total of 4393 radiation oncologists (1133 women and 3260 men) were included in the POSPUF in 2016. Compared with their male counterparts, female physicians in the NFB setting submitted a mean of 1051 fewer charges (95% CI, -1458 to -644; P\u2009<\u2009.001), collected a mean of $143\u202f610 less in revenue (95% CI, -$185\u202f528 to -$101\u202f692; P\u2009<\u2009.001), and used a mean of 1.32 fewer unique billing codes (95% CI, -2.23 to -0.41; P\u2009=\u2009.004). Compared with their male counterparts, female radiation oncologists in the FB setting submitted a mean of 423 fewer charges (95% CI, -506 to -341; P\u2009<\u2009.001), collected a mean of $26\u202f735 less in revenue (95% CI, -$31\u202f910 to -$21\u202f560; P\u2009<\u2009.001), and submitted a mean of 1.28 fewer unique billing codes (95% CI, -1.77 to -0.78; P\u2009<\u2009.001). Women represented 46 of the 397 most highly productive radiation oncologists in the FB setting (11.6%) and collected a mean of $33\u202f026 less (95% CI, -$52\u202f379 to -$13\u202f673; P\u2009=\u2009.001) than men who were similarly productive. In the NFB setting, women represented 54 of the 326 most highly productive radiation oncologists (16.6%) and collected $345\u202f944 (95% CI, -$522\u202f663 to -$169\u202f225; P\u2009<\u2009.001) less than similarly highly productive men. Women collected a mean of $8.49 less per charge (95% CI, -$14.13 to -$2.86; P\u2009=\u2009.003) than men in the NFB setting. Conclusions and Relevance: This study suggests that female radiation oncologists submit fewer Medicare charges, are reimbursed less per charge they submit, and receive lower Medicare payments overall compared with male radiation oncologists. Even among similarly productive radiation oncologists, women in this study still collected less revenue than men. Further research is required to understand the sex-based barriers to economic advancement within radiation oncology. ",
        "Comparison of Opioid Prescribing by Dentists in the United States and England. Importance: The United States consumes most of the opioids worldwide despite representing a small portion of the world's population. Dentists are one of the most frequent US prescribers of opioids despite data suggesting that nonopioid analgesics are similarly effective for oral pain. While oral health and dentist use are generally similar between the United States and England, it is unclear how opioid prescribing by dentists varies between the 2 countries. Objective: To compare opioid prescribing by dentists in the United States and England. Design, Setting, and Participants: Cross-sectional study of prescriptions for opioids dispensed from outpatient pharmacies and health care settings between January 1 and December 31, 2016, by dentists in the United States and England. Data were analyzed from October 2018 to January 2019. Exposures: Opioids prescribed by dentists. Main Outcomes and Measures: Proportion and prescribing rates of opioid prescriptions. Results: In 2016, the proportion of prescriptions written by US dentists that were for opioids was 37 times greater than the proportion written by English dentists. In all, 22.3% of US dental prescriptions were opioids (11.4 million prescriptions) compared with 0.6% of English dental prescriptions (28\u202f082 prescriptions) (difference, 21.7%; 95% CI, 13.8%-32.1%; P\u2009<\u2009.001). Dentists in the United States also had a higher number of opioid prescriptions per 1000 population (35.4 per 1000 US population [95% CI, 25.2-48.7 per 1000 population] vs 0.5 per 1000 England population [95% CI, 0.03-3.7 per 1000 population]) and number of opioid prescriptions per dentist (58.2 prescriptions per dentist [95% CI, 44.9-75.0 prescriptions per dentist] vs 1.2 prescriptions per dentist [95% CI, 0.2-5.6 prescriptions per dentist]). While the codeine derivative dihydrocodeine was the sole opioid prescribed by English dentists, US dentists prescribed a range of opioids containing hydrocodone (62.3%), codeine (23.2%), oxycodone (9.1%), and tramadol (4.8%). Dentists in the United States also prescribed long-acting opioids (0.06% of opioids prescribed by US dentists [6425 prescriptions]). Long-acting opioids were not prescribed by English dentists. Conclusions and Relevance: This study found that in 2016, dentists in the United States prescribed opioids with significantly greater frequency than their English counterparts. Opioids with a high potential for abuse, such as oxycodone, were frequently prescribed by US dentists but not prescribed in England. These results illustrate how 1 source of opioids differs substantially in the United States vs England. To reduce dental opioid prescribing in the United States, dentists could adopt measures similar to those used in England, including national guidelines for treating dental pain that emphasize prescribing opioids conservatively.

        "Association of Daytime and Nighttime Blood Pressure With Cardiovascular Disease Events Among African American Individuals. Importance: Little is known regarding health outcomes associated with higher blood pressure (BP) levels measured outside the clinic among African American individuals. Objective: To examine whether daytime and nighttime BP levels measured outside the clinic among African American individuals are associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD) and all-cause mortality independent of BP levels measured inside the clinic. Design, Setting, and Participants: This prospective cohort study analyzed data from 1034 African American participants in the Jackson Heart Study who completed ambulatory BP monitoring at baseline (September 26, 2000, to March 31, 2004). Mean daytime and nighttime BPs were calculated based on measurements taken while participants were awake and asleep, respectively. Data were analyzed from July 1, 2017, to April 30, 2019. Main Outcomes and Measures: Cardiovascular disease events, including coronary heart disease and stroke, experienced through December 31, 2014, and all-cause mortality experienced through December 31, 2016, were adjudicated. The associations of daytime BP and nighttime BP, separately, with CVD events and all-cause mortality were determined using Cox proportional hazards regression models. Results: A total of 1034 participants (mean [SD] age, 58.9 [10.9] years; 337 [32.6%] male; and 583 [56.4%] taking antihypertensive medication) were included in the study. The mean daytime systolic BP (SBP)/diastolic BP (DBP) was 129.4/77.6 mm Hg, and the mean nighttime SBP/DBP was 121.3/68.4 mm Hg. During follow-up (median [interquartile range], 12.5 [11.1-13.6] years for CVD and 14.8 [13.7-15.6] years for all-cause mortality), 113 CVD events and 194 deaths occurred. After multivariable adjustment, including in-clinic SBP and DBP, the hazard ratios (HRs) for CVD events for each SD higher level were 1.53 (95% CI, 1.24-1.88) for daytime SBP (per 13.5 mm Hg), 1.48 (95% CI, 1.22-1.80) for nighttime SBP (per 15.5 mm Hg), 1.25 (95% CI, 1.02-1.51) for daytime DBP (per 9.3 mm Hg), and 1.30 (95% CI, 1.06-1.59) for nighttime DBP (per 9.5 mm Hg). Nighttime SBP was associated with all-cause mortality (HR per 1-SD higher level, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.06-1.45), but no association was present for daytime SBP (HR, 1.13; 95% CI, 0.97-1.33) and daytime (HR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.81-1.10) and nighttime (HR, 1.06; 95% CI, 0.90-1.24) DBP. Conclusions and Relevance: Among African American individuals, higher daytime and nighttime SBPs were associated with an increased risk for CVD events and all-cause mortality independent of BP levels measured in the clinic. Measurement of daytime and nighttime BP using ambulatory monitoring during a 24-hour period may help identify African American individuals who have an increased cardiovascular disease risk. ",
        "Use of Prescription Opioids and Initiation of Fatal 2-Vehicle Crashes. Importance: The prevalence of prescription opioids detected in fatally injured drivers has increased markedly in the past 2 decades in the United States. It is unclear whether driver use of prescription opioids plays a role in fatal crash causation. Objective: To assess the association between driver use of prescription opioids and the risk of being culpable of crash initiation in fatal 2-vehicle crashes. Design, Setting, and Participants: This pair-matched study was based on data from the Fatality Analysis Reporting System for drivers involved in fatal 2-vehicle crashes on US public roads between January 1, 1993, and December 31, 2016. Data analysis was conducted from December 8, 2017, to December 7, 2018. Exposures: Testing positive for prescription opioids compared with testing negative, and blood alcohol concentrations (BACs) based on toxicological testing results. Main Outcomes and Measures: Culpability of crash initiation and adjusted odds ratios and 95% CIs. Results: A total of 36\u202f642 drivers involved in 18\u202f321 fatal 2-vehicle crashes were included. The most common driving error leading to fatal 2-vehicle crashes was failure to keep in lane (7535 [41%]). Drivers culpable of initiating the crashes were more likely than their nonculpable counterparts to test positive for prescription opioids (918 [5.0%] vs 549 [3.0%]; P\u2009<\u2009.001), alcohol (BAC \u22650.01 g/dL, 5258 [28.7%] vs 1815 [9.9%]; P\u2009<\u2009.001), and both substances (1.0% vs 0.3%, P\u2009<\u2009.001). The adjusted odds ratio of crash initiation was 2.18 (95% CI, 1.91-2.48) for drivers testing positive for prescription opioids compared with drivers testing negative, and increased with BACs (BAC 0.01-0.07 g/dL: adjusted odds ratio, 1.97; 95% CI, 1.75-2.22; BAC \u22650.08 g/dL: adjusted odds ratio, 8.20; 95% CI, 7.42-9.07; compared with BAC <0.01 g/dL). There was no significant interaction effect on crash initiation between prescription opioid use and alcohol use. Conclusions and Relevance: Driver use of prescription opioids was associated with initiation of 2-vehicle crashes, independent of alcohol use. Clinicians should take into consideration the adverse effect of opioid analgesics on driving safety while prescribing these medications and counseling patients. ",
        "Trends and Outcomes of Cardiovascular Surgery in Patients With Opioid Use Disorders. Importance: Persistent opioid use is currently a major health care crisis. There is a lack of knowledge regarding its prevalence and effect among patients undergoing cardiac surgery. Objective: To characterize the national population of cardiac surgery patients with opioid use disorder (OUD) and compare outcomes with the cardiac surgery population without OUD. Design, Setting, and Participants: In this retrospective population-based cohort study, more than 5.7 million adult patients who underwent cardiac surgery (ie, coronary artery bypass graft, valve surgery, or aortic surgery) in the United States were included. Pregnant patients were excluded. Propensity matching was performed to compare outcomes between cardiac surgery patients with OUD (n\u2009=\u200911\u202f359) and without OUD (n\u2009=\u20095\u202f707\u202f193). The Nationwide Inpatient Sample database was queried from January 1998 to December 2013. Data were analyzed in January 2018. Exposures: Persistent opioid use and/or dependence. Main Outcomes and Measures: In-hospital mortality, complications, length of stay, costs, and discharge disposition. Results: Among the 5\u202f718\u202f552 included patients, 3\u202f887\u202f097 (68.0%) were male; the mean (SD) age of patients with OUD was 47.67 (13.03) years and of patients without OUD was 65.53 (26.14) years. The prevalence of OUD among cardiac surgery patients was 0.2% (n\u2009=\u200911\u202f359), with an 8-fold increase over 15 years (0.06% [262 of 437\u202f641] in 1998 vs 0.54% [1425 of 263\u202f930] in 2013; difference, 0.48%; 95% CI of difference, 0.45-0.51; P\u2009<\u2009.001). Compared with patients without OUD, patients with OUD were younger (mean [SD] age, 48 [0.30] years vs 66 [0.05] years; P\u2009<\u2009.001) and more often male (70.8% vs 68.0%; P\u2009<\u2009.001), black (13.7% vs 4.8%), or Hispanic (9.1% vs 4.8%). Patients with OUD more commonly fell in the first quartile of median income (30.7% vs 17.1%; P\u2009<\u2009.001) and were more likely to be uninsured or Medicaid beneficiaries (48.6% vs 7.7%; P\u2009<\u2009.001). Valve and aortic operations were more commonly performed among patients with OUD (49.8% vs 16.4%; P\u2009<\u2009.001). Among propensity-matched pairs, the mortality was similar between patients with vs without OUD (3.1% vs 4.0%; P\u2009=\u2009.12), but cardiac surgery patients with OUD had an overall higher incidence of major complications (67.6% vs 59.2%; P\u2009<\u2009.001). Specifically, the risks of blood transfusion (30.4% vs 25.9%; P\u2009=\u2009.002), pulmonary embolism (7.3% vs 3.8%; P\u2009<\u2009.001), mechanical ventilation (18.4% vs 15.7%; P\u2009=\u2009.02), and prolonged postoperative pain (2.0% vs 1.2%; P\u2009=\u2009.048) were significantly higher. Patients with OUD also had a significantly longer length of stay (median [SE], 11 [0.30] vs 10 [0.22] days; P\u2009<\u2009.001) and cost significantly more per patient (median [SE], $49\u202f790 [1059] vs $45\u202f216 [732]; P\u2009<\u2009.001). Conclusions and Relevance: The population of patients with persistent opioid use or opioid dependency undergoing cardiac surgery has increased over the past decade. Cardiac surgery in patients with OUD is safe but is associated with higher complications and cost. Patients should not be denied surgery because of OUD status but should be carefully monitored postoperatively for complications. ",
        "Availability and Cost of Naloxone Nasal Spray at Pharmacies in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, 2017. Importance: Despite the increasingly important role of pharmacies in the implementation of naloxone access laws, there is limited information on the impact of such laws at the local level. Objective: To evaluate the availability (with or without a prescription) and cost of naloxone nasal spray at pharmacies in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, following a statewide standing order enacted in Pennsylvania in August 2015 to allow pharmacies to dispense naloxone without a prescription. Design, Setting, and Participants: A survey study was conducted by telephone of all pharmacies in Philadelphia between February and August 2017. Pharmacies were geocoded and linked with the American Community Survey (2011-2015) to obtain information on the demographic characteristics of census tracts and the Medical Examiner's Office of the Philadelphia Department of Public Health to derive information on the number of opioid overdose deaths per 100\u202f000 people for each planning district. Data were analyzed from March 2018 to February 2019. Main Outcomes and Measures: Availability and out-of-pocket cost of naloxone nasal spray (with or without a prescription) at Philadelphia pharmacies overall and by pharmacy and neighborhood characteristics. Results: Of 454 eligible pharmacies, 418 were surveyed (92.1% response rate). One in 3 pharmacies (34.2%) had naloxone nasal spray in stock; of these, 61.5% indicated it was available without a prescription. There were significant differences in the availability of naloxone by pharmacy type and neighborhood characteristics. Naloxone was both more likely to be in stock (45.9% vs 27.8%; difference, 18.0%; 95% CI, 8.3%-27.8%; P\u2009<\u2009.001) and available without a prescription (80.6% vs 42.2%; difference, 38.4%; 95% CI, 23.0%-53.8%; P\u2009<\u2009.001) in chain stores than in independent stores. Naloxone was also less likely to be available in planning districts with very elevated rates of opioid overdose death (\u226550 per 100\u202f000 people) compared with those with lower rates (31.1% vs 38.5%). The median (interquartile range) out-of-pocket cost among pharmacies offering naloxone without a prescription was $145 ($119-$150); costs were greatest in independent pharmacies and planning districts with elevated rates of opioid overdose death. Conclusions and Relevance: Despite the implementation of a statewide standing order in Pennsylvania more than 3 years prior to this study, only one-third of Philadelphia pharmacies carried naloxone nasal spray and many also required a physician's prescription. Efforts to strengthen the implementation of naloxone access laws and better ensure naloxone supply at local pharmacies are warranted, especially in localities with the highest rates of overdose death.

        "Trends in Opioid Prescribing and Dispensing by Veterinarians in Pennsylvania. Importance: Veterinarians are a subset of opioid prescribers. Objective: To assess the quantity and trends in prescribing and dispensing of several different opioids in the past 11 years in a large veterinary hospital in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cross-sectional study inventoried all opioid tablets and/or patches dispensed or prescribed by veterinarians practicing in a multispecialty academic veterinary teaching hospital in Philadelphia for small animals and species, such as rabbits, birds, and reptiles, from January 1, 2007, through December 31, 2017. Prescribing data were obtained from all veterinarians who wrote a prescription for opioids by reviewing detailed pharmacy records of controlled substances for the study period. Data included all opioids dispensed, or prescribed to animals (patients) undergoing evaluation at the center or being followed up as outpatients by the veterinarians in the hospital. Statewide veterinarian prescribing data were used for comparison. Data were analyzed from December 24, 2017, through May 15, 2018. Main Outcomes and Measures: The trend in administration and prescribing of 4 specific opioid analgesics (codeine sulfate, hydrocodone bitartrate, and tramadol hydrochloride tablets as well as fentanyl citrate patch) during the 11-year study period. The individual opioids were converted to morphine milligram equivalents (MME) for comparison. Results: The study included 134 veterinarians (70.9% women) with 366\u202f468 patient visits. During the study period, the hospital veterinarians prescribed 105 183 689 tablets of tramadol, 97 547 tablets of hydrocodone, 38 939 tablets of codeine, and 3153 fentanyl patches to dogs (73.0%), cats (22.5%), and exotic animals (4.5%). Overall, MME use increased 41.2%, whereas visits increased by 12.8%. The comparison data for Pennsylvania revealed a predominance of hydrocodone use (688 340 tablets prescribed), although data were not available for comparison with tramadol because it is a Schedule IV drug. Conclusions and Relevance: Results of this study suggest that the large, increasing volume of opioids prescribed at 1 veterinary teaching hospital highlights concerns parallel to those about excessive opioid prescribing in humans. The extent to which these data may represent similar volumes of prescriptions from the general veterinary practices and hospitals across the United States is suggested by the accompanying Pennsylvania state data. These findings highlight an opportunity to assess the risk of veterinarian opioid prescriptions to safeguard public health. ",
        "Association of Decreased Postsurgical Opioid Prescribing With Patients' Satisfaction With Surgeons. Importance: Opioid overdose is the leading cause of injury-related death in the United States. Several studies have shown that surgeons overprescribe opioids, and guidelines for appropriate opioid prescribing are available. Concern about patient-reported satisfaction scores may be a barrier to surgeons adopting guideline-directed prescribing. Objective: To determine whether decreased opioid prescribing is associated with a decrease in patient-reported satisfaction with their surgeon. Design, Setting, and Participants: Retrospective analysis of clinician satisfaction scores at Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center obtained in 2 periods: 1 before (period A) and 1 after (period B) an educational intervention that resulted in decreased opioid prescribing. The analysis included 11 surgeons who performed 5 common outpatient general surgical operations on 996 patients. Data were analyzed between March and August 2018. Main Outcomes and Measures: Patient-reported overall satisfaction rating of the surgeon (scale, 0-10). This was collected by a nonstudy-related, routine general institutional survey of approximately 40% of all outpatient encounters. Results: Of the total number of patients, 67% were women (667 of 996), and the mean patient age was 58 years. Comparing period A with B, the proportion of patients prescribed opioids decreased from 90.2% (n\u2009=\u2009367 of 407) to 72.8% (n\u2009=\u2009429 of 589) (P\u2009<\u2009.001). The mean number of opioid pills per prescription decreased from 28.3 to 13.3 (P\u2009<\u2009.001) and significantly decreased for each of the 11 surgeons. One hundred five of 996 patients (10.5%) undergoing index operations responded to the survey. There was no difference in the mean clinician satisfaction ratings from period A vs B (9.70 vs 9.65; P\u2009=\u2009.69). During the study periods, 640 total surveys were collected referencing these surgeons (including outpatient encounters associated with operations other than the 5 index cases). There was no difference in the mean satisfaction ratings from period A vs period B (9.55 vs 9.59; P\u2009=\u2009.62). When individual clinicians were analyzed, none had a significant difference in overall satisfaction rating from period A vs period B. Conclusions and Relevance: Despite a marked decrease in the proportion of patients receiving opioids and in the number of pills prescribed, there was no significant change in clinician satisfaction ratings.

        "Outcomes Before and After the Recall of a Heart Failure Pacemaker. Importance: Timely and complete disclosure of medical device defects is necessary to manage patient care safely and effectively. Objectives: To determine if the manufacturer's recommendations following the recall of a medical device were timely and complete, the follow-up information and data provided to patients and physicians were adequate for managing patient care, and the actions taken by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regarding the recall were appropriate. Design, Setting, and Participants: This single-center retrospective case series included 90 of 448 patients who were implanted with a cardiac resynchronization therapy pacemaker at the Minneapolis Heart Institute from May 2003 through January 2011; this pacemaker was recalled in November 2015. In addition, returned product reports submitted by the manufacturer to the FDA via the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database from January 2008 through December 2018 were analyzed. Main Outcomes and Measures: Clinical outcomes were serious adverse clinical events that occurred before and after the November 2015 recall notifying physicians and patients that the device's battery could fail unexpectedly because of high internal impedance. Technical outcomes were signs and causes of failure. Results: Five of 90 patients observed during 2015 experienced syncope when their pacemakers stopped pacing owing to battery or wire connection defects prior to the recall. Of the 90 patients, 37 (41%) were men, and the median (interquartile range) age at implantation was 71.3 (66.1-78.2) years. Analysis of the MAUDE data revealed that battery failures prior to the recall were associated with serious adverse events that included 1 death, 1 cardiac arrest, 5 syncopal attacks, and 6 heart failure exacerbations; 3 additional prerecall syncopal events were caused by wire connection defects. The manufacturer and the FDA were aware of the battery and wire connection defects for 19 months before issuing the recall, yet the wire connection problem was not included in the advisory and physicians were not informed that interrogating the pacemaker could result in loss of pacing. The FDA classified the recall as class II rather than the more critical class I. Conclusions and Relevance: This case series study of patients implanted with a defective pacemaker found that the pacemaker recall was delayed and that subsequent communications did not include all critical information needed for safe and effective patient care. These findings should prompt reforms in how the medical device industry and the FDA manage future medical device recalls. ",
        "Association of Care at Minority-Serving vs Non-Minority-Serving Hospitals With Use of Palliative Care Among Racial/Ethnic Minorities With Metastatic Cancer in the United States. Importance: It is not known whether racial/ethnic differences in receipt of palliative care are attributable to different treatment of minorities or lower utilization of palliative care at the relatively small number of hospitals that treat a large portion of minority patients. Objective: To assess the association of receipt of palliative care among patients with metastatic cancer with receipt of treatment at minority-serving hospitals (MSHs) vs non-MSHs. Design, Setting, and Participants: This retrospective cohort study used Participant Use Files of the National Cancer Database, a prospectively maintained, hospital-based cancer registry consisting of all patients treated at more than 1500 US hospitals, to collect data from individuals older than 40 years with metastatic prostate, lung, colon, and breast cancer, diagnosed from January 1, 2004, to December 31, 2015. Data were accessed in October 2017, and the analysis was performed in July 2018. Exposures: Hospitals in the top decile in terms of the proportion of black and Hispanic patients for each cancer type were defined as MSHs. Main Outcomes and Measures: A multilevel logistic regression model that estimated the odds of palliative care was fit, adjusting for year of diagnosis, sex, race/ethnicity, insurance, income, educational level, and cancer type, with an interaction term between cancer type and MSH status and a hospital-level random intercept to account for unmeasured hospital characteristics. Results: A total of 601\u202f680 individuals (mean [SD] age, 67.4 [11.4] years; 95% CI, 67.2-67.6 years; 314 279 [52.2%] male; 475 039 [78.9%] white) were studied. In total, 130\u202f813 patients (21.7%) received palliative care, ranging from 102\u202f019 (25.4%) with lung cancer to 9966 (11.1%) with colon cancer. In total, 16\u202f435 black individuals (20.0%) and 3551 Hispanic individuals (15.9%) received palliative care vs 106\u202f603 non-Hispanic white individuals (22.5%) (P\u2009<\u2009.001). The MSH patients were less likely than the non-MSH patients to receive palliative care, regardless of race/ethnicity (12\u202f692 [18.0%] vs 118\u202f121 [22.3%]; P\u2009=\u2009.002). In an adjusted analysis, treatment at an MSH had a statistically significant association with lower odds of receiving palliative care (odds ratio, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.53-0.84). Conclusions and Relevance: Although the factors associated with minority patients' receipt of palliative care are complex, in this study, treatment at MSHs was associated with significantly lower odds of receiving any palliative care in an adjusted analysis, but black and Hispanic race/ethnicity was not. These findings suggest that the site of care is associated with race/ethnicity-based differences in palliative care. ",
        "Association of Parental Incarceration With Psychiatric and Functional Outcomes of Young Adults. Importance: In 2016, an estimated 8% of US children younger than 18 years had experienced the incarceration of a parent, and rates were substantially higher among children from racial and ethnic minority backgrounds and disadvantaged groups. Little is known about whether parental incarceration during childhood is associated with adult psychiatric problems and functional outcomes. Objective: To examine whether parental incarceration is associated with increased levels of psychiatric diagnosis and poor outcomes in health, legal, financial, and social domains in adulthood. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study used data from the community-representative, prospective, longitudinal Great Smoky Mountains Study. Children and their parents were interviewed up to 8 times from January 1993 to December 2000 (ages 9-16 years; 6674 observations of 1420 participants) using the Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Assessment, which assessed parental incarceration, childhood psychiatric diagnoses, and other adversities. Young adults were followed up at ages 19, 21, 25, and 30 years from January 1999 to December 2015 (4556 observations of 1334 participants) to assess psychiatric diagnoses and functional outcomes indicative of a disrupted transition to adulthood. Data analysis was conducted from June 2018 to June 2019. Results: By age 16 years, 475 participants (weighted percentage, 23.9%) had a parental figure who had been incarcerated, including 259 young men (22.2%) and 216 young women (25.5%). Parental incarceration was associated with higher prevalence of childhood psychiatric diagnoses (eg, any depressive diagnosis: adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 2.5; 95% CI, 1.3-4.6; P\u2009=\u2009.006; attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder: aOR, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.0-5.5; P\u2009=\u2009.06; and conduct disorder: aOR, 2.5; 95% CI, 1.4-4.3; P\u2009=\u2009.001). After accounting for childhood psychiatric diagnoses and adversity exposure, parental incarceration remained associated with increased odds of having an adult anxiety disorder (aOR, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.0-3.0; P\u2009=\u2009.04), having an illicit drug use disorder (aOR, 6.6; 95% CI, 2.6-17.0; P\u2009<\u2009.001), having a felony charge (aOR, 3.4; 95% CI, 1.8-6.5; P\u2009<\u2009.001), incarceration (aOR, 2.8; 95% CI, 1.4-5.4; P\u2009=\u2009.003), not completing high school (aOR, 4.4; 95% CI, 2.2-8.8; P\u2009<\u2009.001), early parenthood (aOR, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.0-3.0; P\u2009=\u2009.04), and being socially isolated (aOR, 2.2; 95% CI, 1.2-4.0; P\u2009=\u2009.009). Conclusions and Relevance: This study suggests that parental incarceration is associated with a broad range of psychiatric, legal, financial, and social outcomes during young adulthood. Parental incarceration is a common experience that may perpetuate disadvantage from generation to generation. ",
        "Treating Parents for Tobacco Use in the Pediatric Setting: The Clinical Effort Against Secondhand Smoke Exposure Cluster Randomized Clinical Trial. Importance: Despite the availability of free and effective treatment, few pediatric practices identify and treat parental tobacco use. Objective: To determine if the Clinical Effort Against Secondhand Smoke Exposure (CEASE) intervention can be implemented and sustained in pediatric practices and test whether implementing CEASE led to changes in practice-level prevalence of smoking among parents over 2 years. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cluster randomized clinical trial was conducted from April 2015 to October 2017. Ten pediatric practices in 5 states were randomized to either implement the CEASE protocol or maintain usual care (as a control group). All parents who screened positive for tobacco use by exit survey after their child's clinical visit 2 weeks (from April to October 2015) and 2 years after intervention implementation (April to October 2017) were eligible to participate. Data analysis occurred from January 2018 to March 2019. Interventions: The CEASE intervention is a practice-change intervention designed to facilitate both routine screening in pediatric settings of families for tobacco use and delivery of tobacco cessation treatment to individuals in screened households who use tobacco. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was delivery of meaningful tobacco treatment, defined as the prescription of nicotine replacement therapy or quit line enrollment. Furthermore, changes in practice-level smoking prevalence and cotinine-confirmed quit rates over the 2 years of intervention implementation were assessed. Results: Of the 8184 parents screened after their child's visit 2 weeks after intervention implementation, 961 (27.1%) were identified as currently smoking in intervention practices; 1103 parents (23.9%) were currently smoking in control practices. Among the 822 and 701 eligible parents who completed the survey in intervention and control practices, respectively 364 in the intervention practices (44.3%) vs 1 in a control practice (0.1%) received meaningful treatment at that visit (risk difference, 44.0% [95% CI, 9.8%-84.8%]). Two years later, of the 9794 parents screened, 1261 (24.4%) in intervention practices and 1149 (25.0%) in control practices were identified as currently smoking. Among the 804 and 727 eligible parents completing the survey in intervention and control practices, respectively, 113 in the intervention practices (14.1%) vs 2 in the control practices (0.3%) received meaningful treatment at that visit (risk difference, 12.8% [95% CI, 3.3%-37.8%]). Change in smoking prevalence over the 2 years of intervention implementation favored the intervention (-2.7% vs 1.1%; difference -3.7% [95% CI, -6.3% to -1.2%]), as did the cotinine-confirmed quit rate (2.4% vs -3.2%; difference, 5.5% [95% CI, 1.4%-9.6%]). Conclusions and Relevance: In this trial, integrating screening and treatment for parental tobacco use in pediatric practices showed both immediate and long-term increases in treatment delivery, a decline in practice-level parental smoking prevalence, and an increase in cotinine-confirmed cessation, compared with usual care.

        "Effects of Mindfulness Yoga vs Stretching and Resistance Training Exercises on Anxiety and Depression for People With Parkinson Disease: A Randomized Clinical Trial. Importance: Clinical practice guidelines support exercise for patients with Parkinson disease (PD), but to our knowledge, no randomized clinical trials have tested whether yoga is superior to conventional physical exercises for stress and symptom management. Objective: To compare the effects of a mindfulness yoga program vs stretching and resistance training exercise (SRTE) on psychological distress, physical health, spiritual well-being, and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in patients with mild-to-moderate PD. Design, Setting, and Participants: An assessor-masked, randomized clinical trial using the intention-to-treat principle was conducted at 4 community rehabilitation centers in Hong Kong between December 1, 2016, and May 31, 2017. A total of 187 adults (aged \u226518 years) with a clinical diagnosis of idiopathic PD who were able to stand unaided and walk with or without an assistive device were enrolled via convenience sampling. Eligible participants were randomized 1:1 to mindfulness yoga or SRTE. Interventions: Mindfulness yoga was delivered in 90-minute groups and SRTE were delivered in 60-minute groups for 8 weeks. Main Outcomes and Measures: Primary outcomes included anxiety and depressive symptoms assessed using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. Secondary outcomes included severity of motor symptoms (Movement Disorder Society Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale [MDS-UPDRS], Part III motor score), mobility, spiritual well-being in terms of perceived hardship and equanimity, and HRQOL. Assessments were done at baseline, 8 weeks (T1), and 20 weeks (T2). Results: The 138 participants included 65 men (47.1%) with a mean (SD) age of 63.7 (8.7) years and a mean (SD) MDS-UPDRS score of 33.3 (15.3). Generalized estimating equation analyses revealed that the yoga group had significantly better improvement in outcomes than the SRTE group, particularly for anxiety (time-by-group interaction, T1: \u03b2, -1.79 [95% CI, -2.85 to -0.69; P\u2009=\u2009.001]; T2: \u03b2, -2.05 [95% CI, -3.02 to -1.08; P\u2009<\u2009.001]), depression (T1: \u03b2, -2.75 [95% CI, -3.17 to -1.35; P\u2009<\u2009.001]); T2: \u03b2, -2.75 [95% CI, -3.71 to -1.79; P\u2009<\u2009.001]), perceived hardship (T1: \u03b2, -0.92 [95% CI, -1.25 to -0.61; P\u2009<\u2009.001]; T2: \u03b2, -0.76 [95% CI, -1.12 to -0.40; P\u2009<\u2009.001]), perceived equanimity (T1: \u03b2, 1.11 [95% CI, 0.79-1.42; P\u2009<\u2009.001]; T2: \u03b2, 1.19 [95% CI, 0.82-1.56; P\u2009<\u2009.001]), and disease-specific HRQOL (T1: \u03b2, -7.77 [95% CI, -11.61 to -4.38; P\u2009<\u2009.001]; T2: \u03b2, -7.99 [95% CI, -11.61 to -4.38; P\u2009<\u2009.001]). Conclusions and Relevance: Among patients with mild-to-moderate PD, the mindfulness yoga program was found to be as effective as SRTE in improving motor dysfunction and mobility, with the additional benefits of a reduction in anxiety and depressive symptoms and an increase in spiritual well-being and HRQOL.

        "Association of Blood Pressure Classification in Young Adults Using the 2017 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Blood Pressure Guideline With Cardiovascular Events Later in Life. Importance: Little is known regarding the association between level of blood pressure (BP) in young adulthood and cardiovascular disease (CVD) events by middle age. Objective: To assess whether young adults who developed hypertension, defined by the 2017 American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA) BP guideline, before age 40 years have higher risk for CVD events compared with those who maintained normal BP. Design, Setting, and Participants: Analyses were conducted in the prospective cohort Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study, started in March 1985. CARDIA enrolled 5115 African American and white participants aged 18 to 30 years from 4 US field centers (Birmingham, Alabama; Chicago, Illinois; Minneapolis, Minnesota; and Oakland, California). Outcomes were available through August 2015. Exposures: Using the highest BP measured from the first examination to the examination closest to, but not after, age 40 years, each participant was categorized as having normal BP (untreated systolic BP [SBP] <120 mm Hg and diastolic BP [DBP] <80 mm Hg; n\u2009=\u20092574); elevated BP (untreated SBP 120-129 mm Hg and DBP <80 mm Hg; n\u2009=\u2009445); stage 1 hypertension (untreated SBP 130-139 mm Hg or DBP 80-89 mm Hg; n\u2009=\u20091194); or stage 2 hypertension (SBP \u2265140 mm Hg, DBP \u226590 mm Hg, or taking antihypertensive medication; n\u2009=\u2009638). Main Outcomes and Measures: CVD events: fatal and nonfatal coronary heart disease (CHD), heart failure, stroke, transient ischemic attack, or intervention for peripheral artery disease (PAD). Results: The final cohort included 4851 adults (mean age when follow-up for outcomes began, 35.7 years [SD, 3.6]; 2657 women [55%]; 2441 African American [50%]; 206 taking antihypertensive medication [4%]). Over a median follow-up of 18.8 years, 228 incident CVD events occurred (CHD, 109; stroke, 63; heart failure, 48; PAD, 8). CVD incidence rates for normal BP, elevated BP, stage 1 hypertension, and stage 2 hypertension were 1.37 (95% CI, 1.07-1.75), 2.74 (95% CI, 1.78-4.20), 3.15 (95% CI, 2.47-4.02), and 8.04 (95% CI, 6.45-10.03) per 1000 person-years, respectively. After multivariable adjustment, hazard ratios for CVD events for elevated BP, stage 1 hypertension, and stage 2 hypertension vs normal BP were 1.67 (95% CI, 1.01-2.77), 1.75 (95% CI, 1.22-2.53), and 3.49 (95% CI, 2.42-5.05), respectively. Conclusions and Relevance: Among young adults, those with elevated blood pressure, stage 1 hypertension, and stage 2 hypertension before age 40 years, as defined by the blood pressure classification in the 2017 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) guidelines, had significantly higher risk for subsequent cardiovascular disease events compared with those with normal blood pressure before age 40 years. The ACC/AHA blood pressure classification system may help identify young adults at higher risk for cardiovascular disease events. Association of Blood Pressure Classification in Korean Young Adults According to the 2017 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Guidelines With Subsequent Cardiovascular Disease Events. Importance: Among young adults, the association of the 2017 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) High Blood Pressure Clinical Practice Guidelines with risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) later in life is uncertain. Objective: To determine the association of blood pressure categories before age 40 years with risk of CVD later in life. Design, Setting, and Participants: This population-based cohort study from the Korean National Health Insurance Service consisted of 2\u202f488\u202f101 adults aged 20 through 39 years with blood pressure measurements taken twice from 2002 through 2005. Starting from January 1, 2006, participants were followed up until the date of CVD diagnosis, death, or December 31, 2015. Exposures: Participants were categorized by blood pressure readings: normal (systolic, <120 mm Hg; diastolic, <80 mm Hg), elevated (sytolic, 120-129 mm Hg; diastolic, <80 mm Hg), stage 1 hypertension (systolic, 130-139 mm Hg; diastolic, 80-89 mm Hg), and stage 2 hypertension (systolic, \u2265140 mm Hg; diastolic, \u226590 mm Hg). Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was CVD defined as 2 or more days of hospitalization due to CVD or death due to CVD. The secondary outcomes were coronary heart disease (CHD) and stroke. Results: The study population consisted of 2\u202f488\u202f101 participants (median age, 31 years [interquartile range, 27-36 years], 789\u202f870 women [31.7%]). A total of 44\u202f813 CVD events were observed during a median follow-up duration of 10 years. Men with baseline stage 1 hypertension compared with those with normal blood pressure had higher risk of CVD (incidence, 215 vs 164 per 100\u202f000 person-years; difference, 51 per 100\u202f000 person-years [95% CI, 48-55]; adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 1.25 [95% CI, 1.21-1.28]), CHD (incidence, 134 vs 103 per 100\u202f000 person-years; difference, 31 per 100\u202f000 person-years [95% CI, 28-33]; adjusted HR, 1.23 [95% CI, 1.19-1.27]), and stroke (incidence, 90 vs 67 per 100\u202f000 person-years; difference, 23 per 100\u202f000 person-years [95% CI, 21-26]; adjusted HR, 1.30 [95% CI, 1.25-1.36]). Women with baseline stage 1 hypertension compared with those with normal blood pressure had increased risk of CVD (incidence, 131 vs 91 per 100\u202f000 person-years; difference, 40 per 100\u202f000 person-years [95% CI, 35-45]; adjusted HR, 1.27 [95% CI, 1.21-1.34]), CHD (incidence, 56 vs 42 per 100\u202f000 person-years; difference, 14 per 100\u202f000 person-years [95% CI, 11-18]; adjusted HR, 1.16 [95% CI, 1.08-1.25]), and stroke (incidence, 79 vs 51 per 100\u202f000 person-years; difference, 28 per 100\u202f000 person-years [95% CI, 24-32]; adjusted HR [1.37, 95% CI, 1.29-1.46]). Results for state 2 hypertension were consistent. Conclusions and Relevance: Among Korean young adults, stage 1 and stage 2 hypertension, compared with normal blood pressure, were associated with increased risk of subsequent cardiovascular disease events. Young adults with hypertension, defined by the 2017 ACC/AHA criteria, may be at increased risk of cardiovascular disease. ",
        "Financial Eligibility Criteria and Medication Coverage for Independent Charity Patient Assistance Programs. Importance: Although independent charity patient assistance programs improve patient access to costly prescription drugs, recent federal investigations have raised questions about their potential to increase pharmaceutical spending and to violate the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. Little is known about the design of the programs, patient eligibility, or drug coverage. Objective: To examine the eligibility criteria of the independent charity patient assistance programs and the drugs covered by them. Design, Setting, and Participants: Descriptive cross-sectional study of the 6 largest independent charities offering patient assistance programs for patients including, but not limited to, Medicare beneficiaries in 2018. These charities offered 274 different disease-specific patient assistance programs. Drugs were identified for subgroup analysis that had any use reported on the Medicare Part D spending dashboard and any off-patent brand-name drugs that incurred more than $10\u202f000 in Medicare spending per beneficiary in 2016. Exposures: Support by independent charity patient assistance programs. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcomes were the characteristics of patient assistance programs, including assistance type, insurance coverage (vs uninsured), and income eligibility. The secondary outcomes were the cost of the drugs covered by the patient assistance programs and the coverage of expensive off-patent brand-name drugs vs substitutable generic drugs. Results: Among the 6 independent charity foundations included in the analysis, their total revenue in 2017 ranged from $24 million to $532 million, and expenditures on patient assistance programs ranged from $24 million to $353 million, representing on average, 86% of their revenue. Of the 274 patient assistance programs offered by these organizations, 168 (61%) provided only co-payment assistance, and the most common therapeutic area covered was cancer or cancer treatment-related symptoms (113 patient assistance programs; 41%). A total of 267 programs (97%) required insurance coverage as an eligibility criterion (ie, excluded uninsured patients). The most common income eligibility limit was 500% of the federal poverty level. The median annual cost of the drugs per beneficiary covered by the programs was $1157 (interquartile range, $247-$5609) compared with $367 (interquartile range, $100-$1500) for the noncovered drugs. Off-patent brand-name drugs (cost: >$10\u202f000) were covered by a mean of 3.1 (SD, 2.0) patient assistance programs, whereas their generic equivalents were covered by a mean of 1.2 (SD, 1.0) patient assistance programs. Conclusions and Relevance: In 2018, among 274 patient assistance programs operated by the 6 independent charity foundations, the majority did not provide coverage for uninsured patients. Medications that were covered by the patient assistance programs were generally more expensive than those that were not covered. ",
        "Primary Care Clinician and Clinic Director Experiences of Professional Bias, Harassment, and Discrimination in an Underserved Agricultural Region of California. Importance: Many rural and agricultural communities experience hardship from a shortage of clinicians. The aging of the clinician population threatens future supply in these areas. Developing policies to build a sustainable workforce requires the understanding of experiences from those currently in medical practice. Previous research about rural clinicians has primarily sampled non-Latinx white men, and to a lesser extent, non-Latinx white women; to date, no study has examined differences by race/ethnicity, sexual orientation, or gender identity. Objective: To describe the professional experiences of a diverse group of primary care clinicians and clinic directors in an underserved rural and agricultural region of California. Design, Setting, and Participants: In this qualitative study, semistructured in-depth qualitative interviews were performed with clinicians and clinic directors from December 1, 2017, to December 31, 2018, with a present or recent medical practice in the central San Joaquin Valley region of California. Participants (N\u2009=\u200926) consisted of physicians, nurse practitioners, and clinic directors practicing in primary care settings. Settings included solo and group private practice, academic training programs, community health centers, and rural health clinics. Main Outcomes and Measures: Personal experiences as primary care clinicians and clinic directors, and perceived associations with gender, race/ethnicity, sexual orientation, and gender identity. Results: Of 26 primary care clinicians and clinic directors interviewed, 16 (62%) identified as female, 12 (46%) identified as non-Latinx white, and 3 (12%) identified as a member of a sexual and gender minority group. Participants who self-identified as female, nonwhite, and of certain sexual orientation and gender identity minority groups described burnout from bias, harassment, and hostility in their professional relationships with colleagues and health care staff. These experiences intensified their feelings of community isolation and professional isolation. Harassment and institutional discrimination were factors in the decision of participants to change practices or exit the region entirely. Discriminatory acts against members of sexual and gender minority groups were the most severe, including threats to licensure and denial of hospital admitting privileges. In contrast to the minority group participants, the remaining participants expressed little to no awareness of these negative experiences, or the association between these experiences and retention. Conclusions and Relevance: Professional harassment and discrimination may hamper efforts to improve clinician and clinic director recruitment and retention in underserved rural and agricultural areas and may pose barriers to addressing health disparities within those communities. Additional investigation appears to be needed to assess the extent to which professional harassment and discrimination affect clinicians and clinic directors in similar communities across the United States.

        "Association of Changes in Air Quality With Incident Asthma in Children in California, 1993-2014. Importance: Exposure to air pollutants is a well-established cause of asthma exacerbation in children; whether air pollutants play a role in the development of childhood asthma, however, remains uncertain. Objective: To examine whether decreasing regional air pollutants were associated with reduced incidence of childhood asthma. Design, Setting, and Participants: A multilevel longitudinal cohort drawn from 3 waves of the Southern California Children's Health Study over a period of air pollution decline. Each cohort was followed up from 4th to 12th grade (8 years): 1993-2001, 1996-2004, and 2006-2014. Final follow-up for these data was June 2014. Population-based recruitment was from public elementary schools. A total of 4140 children with no history of asthma and residing in 1 of 9 Children's Health Study communities at baseline were included. Exposures: Annual mean community-level ozone, nitrogen dioxide, and particulate matter less than 10 \u03bcm (PM10) and less than 2.5 \u03bcm (PM2.5) in the baseline year for each of 3 cohorts. Main Outcomes and Measures: Prospectively identified incident asthma, collected via questionnaires during follow-up. Results: Among the 4140 children included in this study (mean [SD] age at baseline, 9.5 [0.6] years; 52.6% female [n\u2009=\u20092 179]; 58.6% white [n\u2009=\u20092273]; and 42.2% Hispanic [n\u2009=\u20091686]), 525 incident asthma cases were identified. For nitrogen dioxide, the incidence rate ratio (IRR) for asthma was 0.80 (95% CI, 0.71-0.90) for a median reduction of 4.3 parts per billion, with an absolute incidence rate decrease of 0.83 cases per 100 person-years. For PM2.5, the IRR was 0.81 (95% CI, 0.67-0.98) for a median reduction of 8.1 \u03bcg/m3, with an absolute incidence rate decrease of 1.53 cases per 100 person-years. For ozone, the IRR for asthma was 0.85 (95% CI, 0.71-1.02) for a median reduction of 8.9 parts per billion, with an absolute incidence rate decrease of 0.78 cases per 100 person-years. For PM10, the IRR was 0.93 (95% CI, 0.82-1.07) for a median reduction of 4.0 \u03bcg/m3, with an absolute incidence rate decrease of 0.46 cases per 100 person-years. Conclusions and Relevance: Among children in Southern California, decreases in ambient nitrogen dioxide and PM2.5 between 1993 and 2014 were significantly associated with lower asthma incidence. There were no statistically significant associations for ozone or PM10. ",
        "Association of Prenatal and Perinatal Exposures to Particulate Matter With Changes in Hemoglobin A1c Levels in Children Aged 4 to 6 Years. Importance: Environmental risk factors for childhood type 2 diabetes, an increasing global problem, are understudied. Air pollution exposure has been reported to be a risk factor for this condition. Objective: To examine the association between prenatal and perinatal exposures to fine particulate matter with a diameter less than 2.5 \u03bcm (PM2.5) and changes in hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), a measure of glycated hemoglobin and marker of glucose dysregulation, in children aged 4 to 7 years. Design, Setting, and Participants: The Programming Research in Obesity, Growth, Environment, and Social Stressors (PROGRESS) study, a birth cohort study conducted in Mexico City, Mexico, recruited pregnant women from July 3, 2007, to February 21, 2011, through public health maternity clinics. The present analysis includes 365 mother-child pairs followed up until the child was approximately 7 years of age. This study included data from only study visits at approximately 4 to 5 years (visit 1) and 6 to 7 years (visit 2) post partum because HbA1c levels were not measured in earlier visits. The data were analyzed from March 11, 2018, to May 3, 2019. Exposures: Daily PM2.5 exposure estimates at participants' home addresses from 4 weeks prior to mothers' date of last menstrual period (LMP), a marker of the beginning of pregnancy, to 12 weeks after the due date. Exposure was estimated from satellite measurements and calibrated against ground PM2.5 measurements, land use, and meteorological variables. Main Outcomes and Measures: Outcomes included HbA1c levels at 4 to 5 years and 6 to 7 years of age, and the change in the level from the former age group to the latter. Results: The sample included 365 children, of whom 184 (50.4%) were girls. The mean (range) age of the children was 4.8 (4.0-6.4) years at visit 1, and 6.7 (6.0-9.7) years at visit 2. At the time of delivery, the mean (range) age of the mothers was 27.7 (18.3-44.4) years, with a mean (range) prepregnancy body mass index of 26.4 (18.5-43.5). The mean (SD) prenatal PM2.5 exposure (22.4 \u03bcg/m3 [2.7 \u03bcg/m3]) was associated with an annual increase in HbA1c levels of 0.25% (95% CI, 0.004%-0.50%) from age 4 to 5 years to 6 to 7 years compared with exposure at 12 \u03bcg/m3, the national regulatory standard in Mexico. Sex-specific effect estimates were statistically significant for girls (\u03b2\u2009=\u20090.21%; 95% CI, 0.10% to 0.32%) but not for boys (\u03b2\u2009=\u20090.31%; 95% CI, -0.09% to 0.72%). The statistically significant windows of exposure were from week 28 to 50.6 after the mother's LMP for the overall cohort and from week 11 to the end of the study period for girls. Lower HbA1c levels were observed at age 4 to 5 years in girls (\u03b2\u2009=\u2009-0.72%; 95% CI, -1.31% to -0.13%, exposure window from week 16 to 37.3) and boys (\u03b2\u2009=\u2009-0.98%; 95% CI, -1.70% to -0.26%, exposure window from the beginning of the study period to week 32.7), but no significant association was found in the overall cohort (\u03b2\u2009=\u2009-0.13%; 95% CI, -1.27% to 1.01%). There was no significant association between PM2.5 exposure and HbA1c level at age 6 to 7 years in any group. Conclusions and Relevance: The findings of this study suggest that prenatal and perinatal exposures to PM2.5 are associated with changes in HbA1c, which are indicative of glucose dysregulation, in early childhood. Further research is needed because this finding may represent a risk factor for childhood or adolescent diabetes. ",
        "Association of Long-term Ambient Black Carbon Exposure and Oxidative Stress Allelic Variants With Intraocular Pressure in Older Men. Importance: Elevated intraocular pressure is a major risk factor for glaucoma, a leading cause of irreversible blindness worldwide. Environmental air pollution has been suggested as a potential contributor to elevated intraocular pressure; however, no studies have demonstrated such an association to date. Objective: To investigate the association of long-term ambient black carbon exposure with intraocular pressure in community-dwelling older adults. Design, Setting, and Participants: This population-based analysis, conducted from October 18, 2017, through March 22, 2018, used data from the all-male, New England-based Normative Aging Study of the US Department of Veterans Affairs. The analysis included 419 older men with a total of 911 follow-up study visits between January 1, 2000, and December 30, 2011. Intraocular pressure was measured by Goldmann applanation tonometry during the study visits. Validated spatiotemporal models were used to generate 1-year black carbon exposure levels at the addresses of the participants. Main Outcomes and Measures: An independently developed genetic score approach was used to calculate allelic risk scores for 3 pathways associated with black carbon toxicity: endothelial function, oxidative stress, and metal processing. The associations among black carbon exposure, allelic risk scores, and intraocular pressure were explored using linear mixed-effects models. Results: All 419 participants were men with a mean (SD) age of 75.3 (6.9) years. The mean (SD) 1-year black carbon exposure was 0.51 (0.18) \u03bcg/m3, and the mean (SD) intraocular pressure for the left eye was 14.1 (2.8) mm Hg and for the right eye was 14.1 (3.0) mm Hg. Of the 911 visits, 520 (57.1%) had a high endothelial function allelic risk score, 644 (70.7%) had a high metal-processing allelic risk score, and 623 (68.4%) had a high oxidative stress allelic risk score. In fully adjusted linear mixed-effects models, the association of black carbon with intraocular pressure was greater in individuals with a high oxidative stress allelic score (\u03b2\u2009=\u20090.36; 95% CI, 0.003-0.73) compared with individuals with a low score (\u03b2\u2009=\u2009-0.35; 95% CI, -0.86 to 0.15). Conclusions and Relevance: Ambient black carbon exposure may be a risk factor for increased intraocular pressure in individuals susceptible to other biological oxidative stressors. If additional studies confirm these results, monitoring ambient black carbon exposure and physiological oxidative stress may prevent the development and progression of intraocular pressure-related disease.

        "Prevalence of Survival Without Major Comorbidities Among Adults Born Prematurely. Importance: Preterm birth has been associated with cardiometabolic, respiratory, and neuropsychiatric disorders in adulthood. However, the prevalence of survival without any major comorbidities is unknown. Objective: To determine the prevalence of survival without major comorbidities in adulthood among persons born preterm vs full-term. Design, Setting, and Participants: National cohort study of all 2\u202f566\u202f699 persons born in Sweden from January 1, 1973, through December 31, 1997, who had gestational age data and who were followed up for survival and comorbidities through December 31, 2015 (ages 18-43 years). Exposures: Gestational age at birth. Main Outcomes and Measures: Survival without major comorbidities among persons born extremely preterm (22-27 weeks), very preterm (28-33 weeks), late preterm (34-36 weeks), or early term (37-38 weeks), compared with full-term (39-41 weeks). Comorbidities were defined using the Adolescent and Young Adult Health Outcomes and Patient Experience (AYA HOPE) Comorbidity Index, which includes conditions that commonly manifest in adolescence or young adulthood, including neuropsychiatric disorders; and the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), which includes major chronic disorders predictive of mortality in adulthood. Poisson regression was used to determine prevalence ratios and differences, adjusted for potential confounders. Results: In this study population, 48.6% were female, 5.8% were born preterm, and the median age at end of follow-up was 29.8 years (interquartile range, 12.6 years). Of all persons born preterm, 54.6% were alive with no AYA HOPE comorbidities at the end of follow-up. Further stratified, this prevalence was 22.3% for those born extremely preterm, 48.5% for very preterm, 58.0% for late preterm, 61.2% for early term, and 63.0% for full-term. These prevalences were significantly lower for earlier gestational ages vs full-term (eg, adjusted prevalence ratios: extremely preterm, 0.35 [95% CI, 0.33 to 0.36; P\u2009<\u2009.001]; all preterm, 0.86 [95% CI, 0.85 to 0.86; P\u2009<\u2009.001]; adjusted prevalence differences: extremely preterm, -0.41 [95% CI, -0.42 to -0.40; P\u2009<\u2009.001]; all preterm, -0.09 [95% CI, -0.09 to -0.09; P\u2009<\u2009.001]). Using the CCI, the corresponding prevalences were 73.1% (all preterm), 32.5% (extremely preterm), 66.4% (very preterm), 77.1% (late preterm), 80.4% (early term), and 81.8% (full-term) (adjusted prevalence ratios: extremely preterm, 0.39 [95% CI, 0.38 to 0.41; P\u2009<\u2009.001]; all preterm, 0.89 [95% CI, 0.89 to 0.89; P\u2009<\u2009.001]; adjusted prevalence differences: extremely preterm, -0.50 [95% CI, -0.51 to -0.49; P\u2009<\u2009.001]; all preterm, -0.09 [95% CI, -0.09 to -0.09; P\u2009<\u2009.001]). Conclusions and Relevance: Among persons born preterm in Sweden between 1973 and 1997, the majority survived to early to mid-adulthood without major comorbidities. However, outcomes were worse for those born extremely preterm. ",
        "Association of Preterm Birth With Risk of Ischemic Heart Disease in Adulthood. Importance: Preterm birth has previously been associated with increased risks of hypertension and diabetes, but not ischemic heart disease (IHD), in adulthood. The reasons for this lack of association with IHD despite associations with its risk factors have been elusive, but may be associated with methodologic issues, such as survivor bias, in prior studies. Objective: To determine whether preterm birth is associated with an increased risk of IHD in adulthood in a large population-based cohort. Design, Setting, and Participants: This national, population-based cohort study included all 2\u202f141\u202f709 persons who were born as singleton live births in Sweden during 1973 to 1994. The data were analyzed in September 2018. Exposures: Gestational age at birth, identified from nationwide birth records in the Swedish Birth Registry. Main Outcomes and Measures: Ischemic heart disease that was identified from nationwide inpatient and outpatient diagnoses through 2015 (maximum age, 43 years). A Cox regression was used to examine gestational age at birth in association with IHD in adulthood while adjusting for other perinatal and maternal factors. Cosibling analyses assessed for potential confounding by unmeasured shared familial factors. Results: Of 2\u202f141\u202f709 participants, 1\u202f041\u202f906 (48.6%) were female and there were 1921 persons (0.09%) who received a diagnosis of IHD in 30.9 million person-years of follow-up. Gestational age at birth was inversely associated with IHD risk in adulthood. At ages 30 to 43 years, adjusted hazard ratios for IHD associated with preterm (gestational age <37 weeks) and early-term birth (37-38 weeks) were 1.53 (95% CI, 1.20-1.94) and 1.19 (1.01-1.40), respectively, compared with full-term birth (39-41 weeks). Preterm-born women had lower IHD incidence than preterm-born men (15.16 vs 22.00 per 100\u202f000 person-years) but had a higher adjusted hazard ratio (1.93; 95% CI, 1.28-2.90 vs 1.37; 95% CI, 1.01-1.84). These associations did not appear to be explained by shared genetic or environmental factors in families. Conclusions and Relevance: In this large national cohort, preterm and early-term birth were associated with an increased IHD risk in adulthood. Persons born prematurely need early evaluation and preventive actions to reduce the risk of IHD. ",
        "National Trends in the Provision of Human Milk at Hospital Discharge Among Very Low-Birth-Weight Infants. Importance: Human milk confers important health benefits to very low-birth-weight (VLBW) infants (\u22641500 g). The extent to which the use of human milk has changed over time and the factors associated with human milk use nationally in this population are poorly understood. Objectives: To describe US trends in the provision of human milk at hospital discharge for VLBW infants during the past decade according to census region and maternal race/ethnicity, quantify associations of census region and maternal race/ethnicity with the provision of human milk at hospital discharge, and examine regional and state variations in any provision of human milk at hospital discharge among racial/ethnic groups. Design, Setting, and Participants: A cohort study was conducted of 346\u202f248 infants, born at 23 to 29 weeks' gestation or with a birth weight of 401 to 1500 g, who were cared for at 802 US hospitals in the Vermont Oxford Network from January 1, 2008, to December 31, 2017. The US census region was categorized as West, Midwest, Northeast, and South (reference). Maternal race/ethnicity was categorized as non-Hispanic white (reference), non-Hispanic black, Hispanic, Asian and Pacific Islanders, and Native American. Main Outcomes and Measures: Any provision of human milk at hospital discharge, defined as the use of human milk as the only enteral feeding or the use of human milk in combination with fortifier or formula. Results: Of the 346\u202f248 infants in the study (172 538 boys and 173 710 girls), 46.2% were non-Hispanic white, 30.1% were non-Hispanic black, 18.3% were Hispanic of any race, 4.7% were Asian and Pacific Islanders, and 0.8% were Native American. Any provision of human milk at hospital discharge increased steadily among all infants, from 44% in 2008 to 52% in 2017. There were increases across all US census regions and racial/ethnic groups. Any provision of human milk at hospital discharge was higher in the West (among singleton births: adjusted prevalence ratio, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.25-1.39; among multiple births: adjusted prevalence ratio, 1.28; 95% CI, 1.21-1.35) and Northeast (among singleton births: adjusted prevalence ratio, 1.11; 95% CI, 1.04-1.19; among multiple births: adjusted prevalence ratio, 1.11; 95% CI, 1.04-1.19), compared with the South, and was higher among Asian mothers (among singleton births: adjusted prevalence ratio, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.18-1.25; among multiple births: adjusted prevalence ratio, 1.12; 95% CI, 1.09-1.15) and lower among Hispanic (among singleton births: adjusted prevalence ratio, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.96-1.01; among multiple births: adjusted prevalence ratio, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.86-0.91), Native American (among singleton births: adjusted prevalence ratio, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.59-0.70; among multiple births: adjusted prevalence ratio, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.50-0.69), and non-Hispanic black mothers (among singleton births: adjusted prevalence ratio, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.65-0.70; among multiple births: adjusted prevalence ratio, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.54-0.60), compared with non-Hispanic white mothers. These results were robust to adjustment for birth year and infant characteristics. Wide regional and state variations were found in any provision of human milk at hospital discharge. Conclusions and Relevance: Overall prevalence of any provision of human milk at hospital discharge among VLBW infants has steadily increased during the past decade. Disparities by US region and race/ethnicity in the provision of human milk exist and have not diminished over time. ",
        "Association of Preterm Birth and Low Birth Weight With Romantic Partnership, Sexual Intercourse, and Parenthood in Adulthood: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis. Importance: Social relationships are important determinants of well-being, health, and quality of life. There are conflicting findings regarding the association between preterm birth or low birth weight and experiences of social relationships in adulthood. Objective: To systematically investigate the association between preterm birth or low birth weight and social outcomes in adulthood. Data Sources: PubMed, PsycINFO, Web of Science, and Embase were searched for peer-reviewed articles published through August 5, 2018. Study Selection: Prospective longitudinal and registry studies reporting on selected social outcomes in adults who were born preterm or with low birth weight (mean sample age \u226518 years) compared with control individuals born at term. Data Extraction and Synthesis: The meta-analysis followed Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. The data were collected and extracted by 2 independent reviewers. Pooled analyses were based on odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals and Hedges g, which were meta-analyzed using random-effects models. Main Outcomes and Measures: Ever being in a romantic partnership, ever having experienced sexual intercourse, parenthood, quality of romantic relationship, and peer social support. Results: Twenty-one studies were included of the 1829 articles screened. Summary data describing a maximum of 4\u202f423\u202f798 adult participants (179\u202f724 preterm or low birth weight) were analyzed. Adults born preterm or with low birth weight were less likely to have ever experienced a romantic partnership (OR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.64-0.81), to have had sexual intercourse (OR, 0.43; 95% CI, 0.31-0.61), or to have become parents (OR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.65-0.91) than adults born full-term. A dose-response association according to degree of prematurity was found for romantic partnership and parenthood. Overall, effect sizes did not differ with age and sex. When adults born preterm or with low birth weight were in a romantic partnership or had friends, the quality of these relationships was not poorer compared with adults born full-term. Conclusions and Relevance: These findings suggest that adults born preterm or with low birth weight are less likely to experience a romantic partnership, sexual intercourse, or to become parents. However, preterm birth or low birth weight does not seem to impair the quality of relationships with partners and friends. Lack of sexual or partner relationships might increase the risk of decreased well-being and poorer physical and mental health. ",
        "Association of Cord Plasma Biomarkers of In Utero Acetaminophen Exposure With Risk of Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder and Autism Spectrum Disorder in Childhood. Importance: Prior studies have raised concern about maternal acetaminophen use during pregnancy and increased risk of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in their children; however, most studies have relied on maternal self-report. Objective: To examine the prospective associations between cord plasma acetaminophen metabolites and physician-diagnosed ADHD, ASD, both ADHD and ASD, and developmental disabilities (DDs) in childhood. Design, Setting, and Participants: This prospective cohort study analyzed 996 mother-infant dyads, a subset of the Boston Birth Cohort, who were enrolled at birth and followed up prospectively at the Boston Medical Center from October 1, 1998, to June 30, 2018. Exposures: Three cord acetaminophen metabolites (unchanged acetaminophen, acetaminophen glucuronide, and 3-[N-acetyl-l-cystein-S-yl]-acetaminophen) were measured in archived cord plasma samples collected at birth. Main Outcomes and Measures: Physician-diagnosed ADHD, ASD, and other DDs as documented in the child's medical records. Results: Of 996 participants (mean [SD] age, 9.8 [3.9] years; 548 [55.0%] male), the final sample included 257 children (25.8%) with ADHD only, 66 (6.6%) with ASD only, 42 (4.2%) with both ADHD and ASD, 304 (30.5%) with other DDs, and 327 (32.8%) who were neurotypical. Unchanged acetaminophen levels were detectable in all cord plasma samples. Compared with being in the first tertile, being in the second and third tertiles of cord acetaminophen burden was associated with higher odds of ADHD diagnosis (odds ratio [OR] for second tertile, 2.26; 95% CI, 1.40-3.69; OR for third tertile, 2.86; 95% CI, 1.77-4.67) and ASD diagnosis (OR for second tertile, 2.14; 95% CI, 0.93-5.13; OR for third tertile, 3.62; 95% CI, 1.62-8.60). Sensitivity analyses and subgroup analyses found consistent associations between acetaminophen buden and ADHD and acetaminophen burden and ASD across strata of potential confounders, including maternal indication, substance use, preterm birth, and child age and sex, for which point estimates for the ORs vary from 2.3 to 3.5 for ADHD and 1.6 to 4.1 for ASD. Conclusions and Relevance: Cord biomarkers of fetal exposure to acetaminophen were associated with significantly increased risk of childhood ADHD and ASD in a dose-response fashion. Our findings support previous studies regarding the association between prenatal and perinatal acetaminophen exposure and childhood neurodevelopmental risk and warrant additional investigations. ",
        "Association of Prenatal Maternal Anemia With Neurodevelopmental Disorders. Importance: Given the critical role that iron plays in neurodevelopment, an association between prenatal iron deficiency and later risk of neurodevelopmental disorders, such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD), attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and intellectual disability (ID), is plausible. Objective: To test the a priori hypothesis that anemia diagnosed in mothers during pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of ASD, ADHD, and ID in offspring and that the magnitude of the risk varies with regard to the timing of anemia in pregnancy. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study used health and population register data from the Stockholm Youth Cohort to evaluate 532\u202f232 nonadoptive children born from January 1, 1987, to December 31, 2010, in Sweden, with follow-up in health registers until December 31, 2016. Data analysis was performed from January 15, 2018, to June 20, 2018. Exposures: Registered diagnoses of anemia during pregnancy. Gestational timing of the first recorded anemia diagnosis (\u226430 weeks or >30 weeks) was considered to assess potential critical windows of development. Main Outcomes and Measures: Registered diagnoses of ASD, ADHD, or ID or co-occurring combinations of these disorders. Results: The cohort included 532 232 individuals (272 884 [51.3%] male) between 6 and 29 years of age at the end of follow-up (mean [SD] age, 17.6 [7.1] years) and their 299 768 mothers. The prevalence of ASD, ADHD, and ID was higher among children born to mothers diagnosed with anemia within the first 30 weeks of pregnancy (4.9% ASD, 9.3% ADHD, and 3.1% ID) compared with mothers with anemia diagnosed later in pregnancy (3.8% ASD, 7.2% ADHD, and 1.1% ID) or mothers not diagnosed with anemia (3.5% ASD, 7.1% ADHD, and 1.3% ID). Anemia diagnosed during the first 30 weeks of pregnancy but not later was associated with increased risk of diagnosis of ASD (odds ratio [OR], 1.44; 95% CI, 1.13-1.84), ADHD (OR, 1.37; 95% CI, 1.14-1.64), and ID (OR, 2.20; 95% CI, 1.61-3.01) in offspring in models that included socioeconomic, maternal, and pregnancy-related factors. Early anemia diagnosis was similarly associated with risk of ASD (OR, 2.25; 95% CI, 1.24-4.11) and ID (OR, 2.59; 95% CI, 1.08-6.22) in a matched sibling comparison. Considering mutually exclusive diagnostic groups, we observed the strongest association between anemia and ID without co-occurring ASD (OR, 2.72; 95% CI, 1.84-4.01). Associations of these disorders with anemia diagnosed later in pregnancy were greatly diminished. Conclusions and Relevance: In contrast to maternal anemia diagnosed toward the end of pregnancy, anemia diagnosed earlier in pregnancy was associated with increased risk of the development of ASD, ADHD, and particularly ID in offspring. Given that iron deficiency and anemia are common among women of childbearing age, our findings emphasize the importance of early screening for iron status and nutritional counseling in antenatal care.

        "Association Between Incident Exposure to Benzodiazepines in Early Pregnancy and Risk of Spontaneous Abortion. Importance: Benzodiazepine use in early pregnancy is associated with spontaneous abortion (SA). However, to date, the association between specific benzodiazepine agent exposure and the risk of SA has not been examined. Objective: To quantify the risk of SA associated with gestational benzodiazepine incident use by drug class, duration of action, and specific benzodiazepine agent. Design, Setting, and Participants: This nested case-control study within the Quebec Pregnancy Cohort, Montreal, Quebec, Canada, includes all pregnancies covered by the Quebec Prescription Drug Insurance Plan from January 1, 1998, through December 31, 2015. Each case was randomly matched with up to 5 controls. Statistical analysis was performed from January 1, 1998, through December 31, 2015. Exposures: Benzodiazepine exposure was defined as 1 or more filled prescriptions between the first day of the last menstrual period and the index date (the calendar date of the SA diagnosis). Benzodiazepine exposure was categorized by overall use, long- or short-acting benzodiazepine, and specific benzodiazepine agents. Main Outcomes and Measures: Spontaneous abortion defined as a pregnancy loss between the beginning of the sixth week of gestation and the 19th completed week of gestation. Conditional logistic regression models were used to calculate odds ratios (OR) and 95% CIs. Results: Of the 442\u202f066 pregnancies included in the Quebec Pregnancy Cohort, 27\u202f149 (6.1%) ended with SA, with a mean (SD) maternal age of 24.2 (6.5) years. Among pregnancies ending with SA, 375 (1.4%) were among women exposed to benzodiazepines in early pregnancy compared with 788 (0.6%) of the 134\u202f305 matched control pregnancies (crude OR, 2.39; 95% CI, 2.10-2.73). Adjusting for potential confounders, including maternal mood and anxiety disorders before pregnancy, and compared with nonuse, benzodiazepine exposure in early pregnancy was associated with an increased risk of SA (adjusted OR, 1.85; 95% CI, 1.61-2.12). The risk was similar among pregnancies exposed to short-acting (284 exposed cases; adjusted OR, 1.81; 95% CI, 1.55-2.12) and long-acting (98 exposed cases; adjusted OR, 1.73; 95% CI, 1.31-2.28) benzodiazepines during early pregnancy. All benzodiazepine agents were independently associated with an increased risk of SA (range of adjusted ORs, 1.13-3.43). Conclusions and Relevance: An increased risk of SA was observed among early pregnancies with incident exposure to short and long-acting benzodiazepines and all specific benzodiazepine agents during early pregnancy. Insomnia, anxiety, and mood disorders are prevalent during pregnancy; clinicians should carefully evaluate the risk/benefit ratio of prescribing benzodiazepines in early pregnancy since alternative nonpharmacologic treatments exist.

        "Association Between Maternal Fluoride Exposure During Pregnancy and IQ Scores in Offspring in Canada. Importance: The potential neurotoxicity associated with exposure to fluoride, which has generated controversy about community water fluoridation, remains unclear. Objective: To examine the association between fluoride exposure during pregnancy and IQ scores in a prospective birth cohort. Design, Setting, and Participants: This prospective, multicenter birth cohort study used information from the Maternal-Infant Research on Environmental Chemicals cohort. Children were born between 2008 and 2012; 41% lived in communities supplied with fluoridated municipal water. The study sample included 601 mother-child pairs recruited from 6 major cities in Canada; children were between ages 3 and 4 years at testing. Data were analyzed between March 2017 and January 2019. Exposures: Maternal urinary fluoride (MUFSG), adjusted for specific gravity and averaged across 3 trimesters available for 512 pregnant women, as well as self-reported maternal daily fluoride intake from water and beverage consumption available for 400 pregnant women. Main Outcomes and Measures: Children's IQ was assessed at ages 3 to 4 years using the Wechsler Primary and Preschool Scale of Intelligence-III. Multiple linear regression analyses were used to examine covariate-adjusted associations between each fluoride exposure measure and IQ score. Results: Of 512 mother-child pairs, the mean (SD) age for enrollment for mothers was 32.3 (5.1) years, 463 (90%) were white, and 264 children (52%) were female. Data on MUFSG concentrations, IQ scores, and complete covariates were available for 512 mother-child pairs; data on maternal fluoride intake and children's IQ were available for 400 of 601 mother-child pairs. Women living in areas with fluoridated tap water (n\u2009=\u2009141) compared with nonfluoridated water (n\u2009=\u2009228) had significantly higher mean (SD) MUFSG concentrations (0.69 [0.42] mg/L vs 0.40 [0.27] mg/L; P\u2009=\u2009.001; to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.05263) and fluoride intake levels (0.93 [0.43] vs 0.30 [0.26] mg of fluoride per day; P\u2009=\u2009.001). Children had mean (SD) Full Scale IQ scores of 107.16 (13.26), range 52-143, with girls showing significantly higher mean (SD) scores than boys: 109.56 (11.96) vs 104.61 (14.09); P\u2009=\u2009.001. There was a significant interaction (P\u2009=\u2009.02) between child sex and MUFSG (6.89; 95% CI, 0.96-12.82) indicating a differential association between boys and girls. A 1-mg/L increase in MUFSG was associated with a 4.49-point lower IQ score (95% CI, -8.38 to -0.60) in boys, but there was no statistically significant association with IQ scores in girls (B = 2.40; 95% CI, -2.53 to 7.33). A 1-mg higher daily intake of fluoride among pregnant women was associated with a 3.66 lower IQ score (95% CI, -7.16 to -0.14) in boys and girls. Conclusions and Relevance: In this study, maternal exposure to higher levels of fluoride during pregnancy was associated with lower IQ scores in children aged 3 to 4 years. These findings indicate the possible need to reduce fluoride intake during pregnancy. ",
        "Association of Conventional Cardiovascular Risk Factors With Cardiovascular Disease After Hypertensive Disorders of Pregnancy: Analysis of the Nord-Tr\u00f8ndelag Health Study. Importance: Women with a history of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP) have higher risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). It is not known how much of the excess CVD risk in women with a history of HDP is associated with conventional cardiovascular risk factors. Objective: To quantify the excess risk of CVD in women with a history of HDP and estimate the proportion associated with conventional cardiovascular risk factors. Design, Setting, and Participants: Prospective cohort study with a median follow-up of 18 years. Population-based cohort of women participating in the Nord-Tr\u00f8ndelag Health Study in Norway. We linked data for 31 364 women from the Nord-Tr\u00f8ndelag Health Study (1984-2008) to validated hospital records (1987-2015), the Cause of Death Registry (1984-2015), and the Medical Birth Registry of Norway (1967-2012). A total of 7399 women were excluded based on selected pregnancy characteristics, incomplete data, or because of emigrating or experiencing the end point before start of follow-up, leaving 23 885 women for study. Data were analyzed between January 1, 2018, and June 6, 2018. Exposures: Experiencing 1 or more pregnancies complicated by HDP before age 40 years vs only experiencing normotensive pregnancies. Main Outcomes and Measures: We used Cox proportional hazards models to estimate the hazard ratios (HRs) for the association between HDP and CVD. The proportion of excess risk associated with conventional cardiovascular risk factors was estimated using an inverse odds ratio weighting approach. Results: Our study population consisted of 23 885 parous women from Nord-Tr\u00f8ndelag County, Norway. A total of 21 766 women had only normotensive pregnancies, while 2199 women experienced ever having an HDP. From age 40 to 70 years, women with history of HDP had an increased risk of CVD compared with women with only normotensive pregnancies (HR, 1.57; 95% CI, 1.32-1.87) but not at older age (\u03b2\u2009=\u20090.98; 95% CI, 0.96-1.00; P for interaction by age\u2009=\u2009.01). Blood pressure and body mass index were associated with up to 77% of the excess risk of CVD in women with history of HDP, while glucose and lipid levels were associated with smaller proportions. Conclusion and Relevance: In this study, the risk of excess CVD in women with history of HDP was associated with conventional cardiovascular risk factors, indicating that these risk factors are important targets for cardiovascular prevention in these women.

Importance: iPLEDGE is a rigorous program initiated in 2006 to reduce fetal exposure to isotretinoin, a disease-modifying medication for acne that carries a risk of teratogenesis. Despite the imposition of iPLEDGE requirements on patients and clinicians, the scope of isotretinoin-related adverse events is unknown. Objective: To determine the frequency and rate of pregnancy and pregnancy-related adverse events among women taking isotretinoin reported to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Design, Setting, and Participants: Pregnancy reports from the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System, a public database of medication adverse event reports filed by prescribers, consumers, and manufacturers, were used to perform a retrospective analysis of pregnancy-related adverse events associated with isotretinoin from January 1, 1997, to December 31, 2017. Each individual reporting any pregnancy-related adverse event signified 1 pregnancy. Abortions, pregnancies that occurred while contraception was used, and fetal defects were counted as subgroups of total pregnancy events. Main Outcomes and Measures: The frequency of pregnancy and of pregnancy-related events (abortions, pregnancies that occurred while using contraception, and fetal defects) were stratified by year that the FDA was notified of the event and by age. The rates of adverse events were calculated using isotretinoin prescribing data. Results: There was a total of 6740 pregnancies among women taking isotretinoin reported to the FDA from 1997 to 2017, peaking in 2006 (768 pregnancies) before settling into a range of 218 to 310 annual reports of pregnancy after 2011. The mean (SD) age of the women was 24.6 (7.1) years. The rate of pregnancy for females of childbearing potential was between 0.33% (388 of 115 925) and 0.65% (768 of 117 784), with a peak in 2006. Although pregnancies, abortions, and fetal defects among women taking isotretinoin have decreased since the initiation of iPLEDGE in 2006, all 3 persist. Conclusions and Relevance: The number of reports of pregnancies, abortions, and fetal defects among women taking isotretinoin has decreased since peaking around the initiation of iPLEDGE in 2006. Explanations for this trend include a broader national decrease in teenage pregnancies and abortion rates, improvements in access to effective long-term and emergency contraception, stringent iPLEDGE requirements, and reporting fatigue over time. Despite the decrease, persistent reporting of pregnancy-related events in the last decade warrants investigation into the efficacy of iPLEDGE and exploration of new approaches for lowering fetal exposure to isotretinoin.

        "Association Between Self-reported Prenatal Cannabis Use and Maternal, Perinatal, and Neonatal Outcomes. Importance: Recent evidence suggests that cannabis use during pregnancy is increasing, although population-based data about perinatal outcomes following in utero exposure remain limited. Objective: To assess whether there are associations between self-reported prenatal cannabis use and adverse maternal and perinatal outcomes. Design, Setting, and Participants: Population-based retrospective cohort study covering live births and stillbirths among women aged 15 years and older in Ontario, Canada, between April 2012 and December 2017. Exposures: Self-reported cannabis exposure in pregnancy was ascertained through routine perinatal care. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was preterm birth before 37 weeks' gestation. Indicators were defined for birth occurring at 34 to 36 6/7 weeks' gestation (late preterm), 32 to 33 6/7 weeks' gestation, 28 to 31 6/7 weeks' gestation, and less than 28 weeks' gestation (very preterm birth). Ten secondary outcomes were examined including small for gestational age, placental abruption, transfer to neonatal intensive care, and 5-minute Apgar score. Coarsened exact matching techniques and Poisson regression models were used to estimate the risk difference (RD) and relative risk (RR) of outcomes associated with cannabis exposure and control for confounding. Results: In a cohort of 661\u202f617 women, the mean gestational age was 39.3 weeks and 51% of infants were male. Mothers had a mean age of 30.4 years and 9427 (1.4%) reported cannabis use during pregnancy. Imbalance in measured maternal obstetrical and sociodemographic characteristics between reported cannabis users and nonusers was attenuated using matching, yielding a sample of 5639 reported users and 92\u202f873 nonusers. The crude rate of preterm birth less than 37 weeks' gestation was 6.1% among women who did not report cannabis use and 12.0% among those reporting use in the unmatched cohort (RD, 5.88% [95% CI, 5.22%-6.54%]). In the matched cohort, reported cannabis exposure was significantly associated with an RD of 2.98% (95% CI, 2.63%-3.34%) and an RR of 1.41 (95% CI, 1.36-1.47) for preterm birth. Compared with no reported use, cannabis exposure was significantly associated with greater frequency of small for gestational age (third percentile, 6.1% vs 4.0%; RR, 1.53 [95% CI, 1.45-1.61]), placental abruption (1.6% vs 0.9%; RR, 1.72 [95% CI, 1.54-1.92]), transfer to neonatal intensive care (19.3% vs 13.8%; RR, 1.40 [95% CI, 1.36-1.44]), and 5-minute Apgar score less than 4 (1.1% vs 0.9%; RR, 1.28 [95% CI, 1.13-1.45]). Conclusions and Relevance: Among pregnant women in Ontario, Canada, reported cannabis use was significantly associated with an increased risk of preterm birth. Findings may be limited by residual confounding. ",
        "Association of Maternal Exposure to Persistent Organic Pollutants in Early Pregnancy With Fetal Growth. Importance: Prenatal exposure to persistent organic pollutants (POPs) has been associated with birth size, but data on fetal growth and among racially/ethnically diverse pregnant women remain scarce. Objectives: To assess the association between maternal plasma POPs in early pregnancy and fetal growth and by infant sex and maternal race/ethnicity. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study used the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Fetal Growth Studies-Singleton cohort, which recruited nonobese, low-risk pregnant women before 14 weeks' gestation between July 1, 2009, and January 31, 2013, in 12 community-based clinics throughout the United States. Participants self-identified their race/ethnicity, self-reported their behavioral risk factors, and were followed up throughout their pregnancy. Data were analyzed from July 31, 2018, to June 3, 2019. Exposures: Levels of 76 POPs in early gestation plasma were measured: 11 perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, 1 polybrominated biphenyl, 9 polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), 44 polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and 11 organochlorine pesticides (OCPs). The bayesian kernel machine regression method was used to examine chemical class mixtures, and generalized additive mixed model was used to analyze individual chemicals. Main Outcomes and Measures: Fourteen fetal biometrics were measured, including head circumference, abdominal circumference, and femur length, within 5 ultrasonography appointments. Results: A total of 2284 low-risk pregnant women were included: 606 women (26.5%) self-identified as white with a mean (SD) age of 30.3 (4.4) years, 589 (25.8%) as black with a mean (SD) age of 25.5 (5.5) years, 635 (27.8%) as Hispanic with a mean (SD) age of 27.1 (5.5) years, and 454 (19.9%) as Asian with a mean (SD) age of 30.5 (4.5) years. A comparison between the 75th and 25th percentile of exposure revealed that the OCP mixture was negatively associated with most fetal growth measures, with a reduction of 4.7 mm (95% CI, -6.7 to -2.8 mm) in head circumference, 3.5 mm (95% CI, -4.7 to -2.2 mm) in abdominal circumference, and 0.6 mm (95% CI, -1.1 to -0.2 mm) in femur length. Higher exposure to the PBDE mixture was associated with reduced abdominal circumference (-2.4 mm; 95% CI, -4.0 to -0.5 mm) and femur length (-0.5 mm; 95% CI, -1.0 to -0.1 mm), and the dioxin-like PCB mixture was associated with reduced head circumference (-6.4 mm; 95% CI, -8.4 to -4.3 mm) and abdominal circumference (-2.4 mm; 95% CI, -3.9 to -0.8 mm). Associations with individual chemicals were less consistent. There were some interactions by fetal sex, although most of the results did not vary by maternal race/ethnicity. For example, oxychlordane (-0.98 mm; 95% CI, -1.60 to -0.36 mm; P for interaction <.001), trans-nonachlor (-0.31 mm; 95% CI, -0.54 to -0.08 mm; P for interaction\u2009=\u2009.005), and p,p'-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (-0.19 mm; 95% CI, -0.22 to -0.09 mm; P for interaction\u2009=\u2009.006) were associated with shorter femur length among boys only. Conclusions and Relevance: This study found that, among pregnant women with low POP levels, a mixture of OCPs was negatively associated with most fetal growth measures and that mixtures of PBDEs and dioxin-like PCBs were associated with reduced abdominal circumference. These findings suggested that, although exposures may be low, associations with fetal growth are apparent. ",
        "Association of Short Interpregnancy Interval With Pregnancy Outcomes According to Maternal Age. Importance: Interpregnancy intervals shorter than 18 months are associated with higher risks of adverse pregnancy outcomes. It is currently unknown whether short intervals are associated with increased risks among older women to the same extent as among younger women. Objective: To evaluate whether the association between short interpregnancy (delivery to conception) interval and adverse pregnancy outcomes is modified by maternal age. Design, Setting, and Participants: A population-based cohort study conducted in British Columbia, Canada, evaluated women with 2 or more singleton pregnancies from 2004 to 2014 with the first (index) pregnancy resulting in a live birth. Data analysis was performed from January 1 to July 20, 2018. Main Outcomes and Measures: Risks of maternal mortality or severe morbidity (eg, mechanical ventilation, blood transfusion >3 U, intensive care unit admission, organ failure, death), small-for-gestational age (<10th birthweight percentile for gestational age and sex), fetal and infant composite outcome (stillbirth, infant death, <third birthweight percentile for gestational age and sex, delivery <28 weeks), and spontaneous and indicated preterm delivery. Risks of each outcome for 3- to 24-month interpregnancy intervals were estimated, according to maternal age at index birth (20-34 and \u226535 years). Adjusted risk ratios (aRRs) comparing predicted risks at 3-, 6-, 9-, and 12-month intervals with risks at 18-month intervals for each age group were calculated. The potential role of other factors explaining any differences (unmeasured confounding) was examined in several sensitivity analyses. Results: Among 148\u202f544 pregnancies, maternal mortality or severe morbidity risks were increased at 6-month compared with 18-month interpregnancy intervals for women aged 35 years or older (0.62% at 6 months vs 0.26% at 18 months; aRR, 2.39; 95% CI, 2.03-2.80), but not for women aged 20 to 34 years (0.23% at 6 months vs 0.25% at 18 months; aRR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.83-1.02). Increased adverse fetal and infant outcome risks were more pronounced for women aged 20 to 34 years (2.0% at 6 months vs 1.4% at 18 months; aRR, 1.42; 95% CI, 1.36-1.47) than women 35 years or older (2.1% at 6 months vs 1.8% at 18 months; aRR, 1.15; 95% CI, 1.01-1.31). Risks of spontaneous preterm delivery at 6-month interpregnancy intervals were increased for women 20 to 34 years old (5.3% at 6 months vs 3.2% at 18 months; aRR, 1.65; 95% CI, 1.62-1.68) and to a lesser extent for women 35 years or older (5.0% at 6 months vs 3.6% at 18 months; aRR, 1.40; 95% CI, 1.31-1.49). Modest increases in risks of small-for-gestational age and indicated preterm delivery at short intervals did not vary meaningfully by maternal age. Sensitivity analyses suggested that observed associations were not fully explained by unmeasured confounding. Conclusions and Relevance: The findings of this study suggest that short interpregnancy intervals are associated with increased risks for adverse pregnancy outcomes for women of all ages. ",
        "Association of Primary Care Clinic Appointment Time With Clinician Ordering and Patient Completion of Breast and Colorectal Cancer Screening. Importance: As the clinic day progresses, clinicians may fall behind schedule and experience decision fatigue. However, the association of time of day with cancer screening rates is unknown. Objective: To evaluate the association of primary care clinic appointment time with clinician ordering and patient completion of breast and colorectal cancer screening. Design, Setting, and Participants: Retrospective, quality improvement study of 33 primary care practices in Pennsylvania and New Jersey from September 1, 2014, to August 31, 2016. Participants included adults eligible for breast or colorectal cancer screening. Data analysis was conducted from April 24, 2018, to November 8, 2018. Exposures: Clinic appointment time during each patient's first primary care physician visit in the study period. Main Outcomes and Measures: Primary outcome was clinician ordering of the screening test during the visit. Secondary outcome was patient completion of the tests within 1 year of the visit. Results: Among the 19\u202f254 patients eligible for breast cancer screening, the mean (SD) age was 60.2 (6.9) years; 19\u202f254 (100%) were female, 11\u202f682 (60.7%) were white, and 5495 (28.5%) were black. Screening test order rates were highest at 8 am at 63.7%, decreased throughout the morning to 48.7% at 11 am, increased to 56.2% at noon, and then decreased to 47.8% at 5 pm (adjusted odds ratio [OR] for overall trend, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.93-0.96; P\u2009<\u2009.001). Trends in screening test completion rates were similar beginning at 33.2% at 8 am and decreasing to 17.8% at 5 pm (adjusted OR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.94-0.97; P\u2009<\u2009.001). Among the 33\u202f468 patients eligible for colorectal cancer screening, the mean (SD) age was 59.6 (7.4) years; 18\u202f672 (55.8%) were female, 22\u202f157 (66.2%) were white, and 7296 (21.8%) were black. Screening test order rates were 36.5% at 8 am, decreased to 31.3% by 11 am, increased at noon to 34.4%, and then decreased to 23.4% at 5 pm (adjusted OR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.93-0.95; P\u2009<\u2009.001). Trends in screening test completion rates were similar beginning at 28.0% at 8 am and decreasing to 17.8% at 5 pm (adjusted OR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.96-0.98; P\u2009<\u2009.001). Conclusions and Relevance: Clinician ordering of cancer screening tests significantly decreased as the clinic day progressed. Patient completion of cancer screening tests within 1 year of the visit was also lower as the primary care appointment time was later in the day. Future interventions targeting improvements in cancer screening should consider how time of day may influence these behaviors. ",
        "Association of Primary Care Physician Supply With Population Mortality in the United States, 2005-2015. Importance: Recent US health care reforms incentivize improved population health outcomes and primary care functions. It remains unclear how much improving primary care physician supply can improve population health, independent of other health care and socioeconomic factors. Objectives: To identify primary care physician supply changes across US counties from 2005-2015 and associations between such changes and population mortality. Design, Setting, and Participants: This epidemiological study evaluated US population data and individual-level claims data linked to mortality from 2005 to 2015 against changes in primary care and specialist physician supply from 2005 to 2015. Data from 3142 US counties, 7144 primary care service areas, and 306 hospital referral regions were used to investigate the association of primary care physician supply with changes in life expectancy and cause-specific mortality after adjustment for health care, demographic, socioeconomic, and behavioral covariates. Analysis was performed from March to July 2018. Main Outcomes and Measures: Age-standardized life expectancy, cause-specific mortality, and restricted mean survival time. Results: Primary care physician supply increased from 196\u202f014 physicians in 2005 to 204\u202f419 in 2015. Owing to disproportionate losses of primary care physicians in some counties and population increases, the mean (SD) density of primary care physicians relative to population size decreased from 46.6 per 100\u202f000 population (95% CI, 0.0-114.6 per 100\u202f000 population) to 41.4 per 100\u202f000 population (95% CI, 0.0-108.6 per 100\u202f000 population), with greater losses in rural areas. In adjusted mixed-effects regressions, every 10 additional primary care physicians per 100\u202f000 population was associated with a 51.5-day increase in life expectancy (95% CI, 29.5-73.5 days; 0.2% increase), whereas an increase in 10 specialist physicians per 100\u202f000 population corresponded to a 19.2-day increase (95% CI, 7.0-31.3 days). A total of 10 additional primary care physicians per 100\u202f000 population was associated with reduced cardiovascular, cancer, and respiratory mortality by 0.9% to 1.4%. Analyses at different geographic levels, using instrumental variable regressions, or at the individual level found similar benefits associated with primary care supply. Conclusions and Relevance: Greater primary care physician supply was associated with lower mortality, but per capita supply decreased between 2005 and 2015. Programs to explicitly direct more resources to primary care physician supply may be important for population health. ",
        "Association Between Age at Puberty and Bone Accrual From 10 to 25 Years of Age. Importance: Bone health in early life is thought to influence the risk of osteoporosis in later life. Objective: To examine whether puberty timing is associated with bone mineral density accrual up to adulthood. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study used data from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children, a prospective population-based birth cohort initiated in 1991 to 1992 in southwest England. The participants were 6389 healthy British people who underwent regular follow-up, including up to 6 repeated bone density scans from ages 10 to 25 years. Data analysis was performed from June 2018 to June 2019. Exposures: Age at puberty from estimated age at peak height velocity (years). Main Outcomes and Measures: Gains per year in whole-body bone mineral density (grams per square centimeter), assessed by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry at ages 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, and 25 years and modeled using linear splines. Results: A total of 6389 participants (3196 [50.0%] female) were included. The mean (SD) age at peak height velocity was 13.5 (0.9) years for male participants and 11.6 (0.8) years for female participants. Male participants gained bone mineral density at faster rates than did female participants, with the greatest gains in both male participants (0.139 g/cm2/y; 95% CI, 0.127-0.151 g/cm2/y) and female participants (0.106 g/cm2/y; 95% CI, 0.098-0.114 g/cm2/y) observed between the year before and 2 years after peak height velocity. When aligned by chronological age, per 1-year older age at puberty was associated with faster subsequent gains in bone mineral density; the magnitudes of faster gains were greatest between ages 14 and 16 years in both male participants (0.013 g/cm2/y; 95% CI, 0.011-0.015 g/cm2/y) and female participants (0.014 g/cm2/y; 95% CI, 0.014-0.015 g/cm2/y), were greater in male participants (0.011 g/cm2/y; 95% CI, 0.010-0.013 g/cm2/y) than in female participants (0.003 g/cm2/y; 95% CI, 0.003-0.004 g/cm2/y) between ages 16 and 18 years, and were least in both male participants (0.002 g/cm2/y; 95% CI, 0.001-0.003 g/cm2/y) and female participants (0.000 g/cm2/y; 95% CI, -0.001 to 0.000 g/cm2/y) between ages 18 and 25 years. Despite faster gains, older age at puberty was associated with persistently lower bone mineral density, changing from 0.050 g/cm2 (95% CI, -0.056 to -0.045 g/cm2) lower at age 14 years to 0.047 g/cm2 (95% CI, -0.051 to -0.043 g/cm2) lower at age 25 years in male participants and from 0.044 g/cm2 (95% CI, -0.046 to -0.041 g/cm2) to 0.034 g/cm2 (95% CI, -0.036 to -0.032 g/cm2) lower at the same ages in female participants. Conclusions and Relevance: People with older pubertal age should be advised on how to maximize bone mineral density and minimize its decrease in later life to help prevent fracture and osteoporosis.

        "Assessment of the Data Sharing and Privacy Practices of Smartphone Apps for Depression and Smoking Cessation. Importance: Inadequate privacy disclosures have repeatedly been identified by cross-sectional surveys of health applications (apps), including apps for mental health and behavior change. However, few studies have assessed directly the correspondence between privacy disclosures and how apps handle personal data. Understanding the scope of this discrepancy is particularly important in mental health, given enhanced privacy concerns relating to stigma and negative impacts of inadvertent disclosure. Because most health apps fall outside government regulation, up-to-date technical scrutiny is essential for informed decision making by consumers and health care professionals wishing to prescribe health apps. Objective: To provide a contemporary assessment of the privacy practices of popular apps for depression and smoking cessation by critically evaluating privacy policy content and, specifically, comparing disclosures regarding third-party data transmission to actual behavior. Design and Setting: Cross-sectional assessment of 36 top-ranked (by app store search result ordering in January 2018) apps for depression and smoking cessation for Android and iOS in the United States and Australia. Privacy policy content was evaluated with prespecified criteria. Technical assessment of encrypted and unencrypted data transmission was performed. Analysis took place between April and June 2018. Main Outcomes and Measures: Correspondence between policies and transmission behavior observed by intercepting sent data. Results: Twenty-five of 36 apps (69%) incorporated a privacy policy. Twenty-two of 25 apps with a policy (88%) provided information about primary uses of collected data, while only 16 (64%) described secondary uses. While 23 of 25 apps with a privacy policy (92%) stated in a policy that data would be transmitted to a third party, transmission was detected in 33 of all 36 apps (92%). Twenty-nine of 36 apps (81%) transmitted data for advertising and marketing purposes or analytics to just 2 commercial entities, Google and Facebook, but only 12 of 28 (43%) transmitting data to Google and 6 of 12 (50%) transmitting data to Facebook disclosed this. Conclusions and Relevance: Data sharing with third parties that includes linkable identifiers is prevalent and focused on services provided by Google and Facebook. Despite this, most apps offer users no way to anticipate that data will be shared in this way. As a result, users are denied an informed choice about whether such sharing is acceptable to them. Privacy assessments that rely solely on disclosures made in policies, or are not regularly updated, are unlikely to uncover these evolving issues. This may limit their ability to offer effective guidance to consumers and health care professionals. ",
        "Feasibility of Reidentifying Individuals in Large National Physical Activity Data Sets From Which Protected Health Information Has Been Removed With Use of Machine Learning. Importance: Despite data aggregation and removal of protected health information, there is concern that deidentified physical activity (PA) data collected from wearable devices can be reidentified. Organizations collecting or distributing such data suggest that the aforementioned measures are sufficient to ensure privacy. However, no studies, to our knowledge, have been published that demonstrate the possibility or impossibility of reidentifying such activity data. Objective: To evaluate the feasibility of reidentifying accelerometer-measured PA data, which have had geographic and protected health information removed, using support vector machines (SVMs) and random forest methods from machine learning. Design, Setting, and Participants: In this cross-sectional study, the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2003-2004 and 2005-2006 data sets were analyzed in 2018. The accelerometer-measured PA data were collected in a free-living setting for 7 continuous days. NHANES uses a multistage probability sampling design to select a sample that is representative of the civilian noninstitutionalized household (both adult and children) population of the United States. Exposures: The NHANES data sets contain objectively measured movement intensity as recorded by accelerometers worn during all walking for 1 week. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was the ability of the random forest and linear SVM algorithms to match demographic and 20-minute aggregated PA data to individual-specific record numbers, and the percentage of correct matches by each machine learning algorithm was the measure. Results: A total of 4720 adults (mean [SD] age, 40.0 [20.6] years) and 2427 children (mean [SD] age, 12.3 [3.4] years) in NHANES 2003-2004 and 4765 adults (mean [SD] age, 45.2 [19.9] years) and 2539 children (mean [SD] age, 12.1 [3.4] years) in NHANES 2005-2006 were included in the study. The random forest algorithm successfully reidentified the demographic and 20-minute aggregated PA data of 4478 adults (94.9%) and 2120 children (87.4%) in NHANES 2003-2004 and 4470 adults (93.8%) and 2172 children (85.5%) in NHANES 2005-2006 (P\u2009<\u2009.001 for all). The linear SVM algorithm successfully reidentified the demographic and 20-minute aggregated PA data of 4043 adults (85.6%) and 1695 children (69.8%) in NHANES 2003-2004 and 4041 adults (84.8%) and 1705 children (67.2%) in NHANES 2005-2006 (P\u2009<\u2009.001 for all). Conclusions and Relevance: This study suggests that current practices for deidentification of accelerometer-measured PA data might be insufficient to ensure privacy. This finding has important policy implications because it appears to show the need for deidentification that aggregates the PA data of multiple individuals to ensure privacy for single individuals.

        "Association Between Androgen Deprivation Therapy Use and Diagnosis of Dementia in Men With Prostate Cancer. Importance: The association between androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) exposure and dementia is uncertain. Objective: To analyze the association between ADT exposure and diagnosis of Alzheimer disease or dementia among elderly men with prostate cancer. Design, Setting, and Participants: This retrospective cohort study used data from the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare linked database. Participants were 154\u202f089 elderly men newly diagnosed with prostate cancer between 1996 and 2003. The analyses were conducted between November 1, 2018, and December 31, 2018. Exposure: Androgen deprivation therapy. Main Outcomes and Measures: Patients receiving ADT within 2 years of prostate cancer diagnosis were identified. Survival analysis was used to determine the association between ADT exposure and diagnosis of Alzheimer disease or dementia in the follow-up period. Propensity score and instrumental variable approaches were used to minimize measured and unmeasured selection bias. The association by dose of ADT was also examined. Results: Of the 295\u202f733 men diagnosed with prostate cancer between 1996 and 2003, 154\u202f089 met the study criteria. Of these, 62\u202f330 (mean [SD] age, 76.0 [6.0] years) received ADT within 2 years of prostate cancer diagnosis, and 91\u202f759 (mean [SD] age, 74.3 [6.0] years) did not receive ADT. Mean (SD) follow-up was 8.3 (4.7) years. Exposure to ADT, compared with no ADT exposure, was associated with a diagnosis of Alzheimer disease (13.1% vs 9.4%; difference, 3.7%; 95% CI, 3.3%-3.9%; P\u2009<\u2009.001; hazard ratio [HR], 1.14; 95% CI, 1.10-1.18) and dementia (21.6% vs 15.8%; difference, 5.8%; 95% CI, 5.4%-6.2%; P\u2009<\u2009.001; HR, 1.20; 95% CI, 1.17-1.24). For 1 to 4 doses of ADT, the HR was 1.19 (95% CI, 1.15-1.24) for Alzheimer disease and 1.19 (95% CI, 1.15-1.23) for dementia. For 5 to 8 doses of ADT, the HR was 1.28 (95% CI, 1.22-1.35) for Alzheimer disease and 1.24 (95% CI, 1.19-1.29) for dementia. For more than 8 doses of ADT, the HR was 1.24 (95% CI, 1.16-1.34) for Alzheimer disease and 1.21 (95% CI, 1.15-1.28) for dementia. The number needed to harm was 18 patients (95% CI, 17-19 patients) and 10 patients (95% CI, 9.5-11 patients) for Alzheimer disease and dementia, respectively. Conclusions and Relevance: Among elderly patients with prostate cancer, ADT exposure was associated with subsequent diagnosis of Alzheimer disease or dementia over a follow-up period of at least 10 years.

        "Association of Black Race With Prostate Cancer-Specific and Other-Cause Mortality. Importance: Black men are more likely to die of prostate cancer than white men. In men with similar stages of disease, the contribution of biological vs nonbiological differences to this observed disparity is unclear. Objective: To quantify the association of black race with long-term survival outcomes after controlling for known prognostic variables and access to care among men with prostate cancer. Design, Setting, and Participants: This multiple-cohort study included updated individual patient-level data of men with clinical T1-4N0-1M0 prostate cancer from the following 3 cohorts: Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER [n\u2009=\u2009296\u202f273]); 5 equal-access regional medical centers within the Veterans Affairs health system (VA [n\u2009=\u20093972]); and 4 pooled National Cancer Institute-sponsored Radiation Therapy Oncology Group phase 3 randomized clinical trials (RCTs [n\u2009=\u20095854]). Data were collected in the 3 cohorts from January 1, 1992, through December 31, 2013, and analyzed from April 27, 2017, through April 13, 2019. Exposures: In the VA and RCT cohorts, all patients received surgery and radiotherapy, respectively, with curative intent. In SEER, radical treatment, hormone therapy, or conservative management were received. Main Outcomes and Measures: Prostate cancer-specific mortality (PCSM). Secondary measures included other-cause mortality (OCM). To adjust for demographic-, cancer-, and treatment-related baseline differences, inverse probability weighting (IPW) was performed. Results: Among the 306 100 participants included in the analysis (mean [SD] age, 64.9 [8.9] years), black men constituted\u200952\u202f840 patients (17.8%) in the SEER cohort, 1513 (38.1%) in the VA cohort, and 1129 (19.3%) in the RCT cohort. Black race was associated with an increased age-adjusted PCSM hazard (subdistribution hazard ratio [sHR], 1.30; 95% CI, 1.23-1.37; P\u2009<\u2009.001) within the SEER cohort. After IPW adjustment, black race was associated with a 0.5% (95% CI, 0.2%-0.9%) increase in PCSM at 10 years after diagnosis (sHR, 1.09; 95% CI, 1.04-1.15; P\u2009<\u2009.001), with no significant difference for high-risk men (sHR, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.97-1.12; P\u2009=\u2009.29). No significant differences in PCSM were found in the VA IPW cohort (sHR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.56-1.30; P\u2009=\u2009.46), and black men had a significantly lower hazard in the RCT IPW cohort (sHR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.66-0.99; P\u2009=\u2009.04). Black men had a significantly increased hazard of OCM in the SEER (sHR, 1.30; 95% CI, 1.27-1.34; P\u2009<\u2009.001) and RCT (sHR, 1.17; 95% CI, 1.06-1.29; P\u2009=\u2009.002) IPW cohorts. Conclusions and Relevance: In this study, after adjustment for nonbiological differences, notably access to care and standardized treatment, black race did not appear to be associated with inferior stage-for-stage PCSM. A large disparity remained in OCM for black men with nonmetastatic prostate cancer. ",
        "Complementary and Alternative Medicine Therapies for Psoriasis: A Systematic Review. Importance: Up to 51% of patients with psoriasis report the use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) in their treatment regimen, although it is unclear which CAM therapies are effective for treatment of psoriasis. Objective: This review compiles the evidence on the efficacy of the most studied CAM modalities for treatment of patients with plaque psoriasis and discusses those therapies with the most robust available evidence. Evidence Review: PubMed, Embase, and ClinicalTrials.gov searches (1950-2017) were used to identify all documented CAM psoriasis interventions in the literature. The criteria were further refined to focus on those treatments identified in the first step that had the highest level of evidence for plaque psoriasis with more than 1 randomized clinical trial supporting their use. This excluded therapies lacking randomized clinical trial (RCT) data or showing consistent inefficacy. Findings: Primary CAM therapy searches identified 457 articles, of which 107 articles were retrieved for closer examination. Of those articles, 54 were excluded because the CAM therapy did not have more than 1 RCT on the subject or showed consistent lack of efficacy. An additional 7 articles were found using references of the included studies, resulting in a total of 44 RCTs (17 double-blind, 13 single-blind, and 14 nonblind), 10 uncontrolled trials, 2 open-label nonrandomized controlled trials, 1 prospective controlled trial, and 3 meta-analyses. Compared with placebo, application of topical indigo naturalis, studied in 5 RCTs with 215 participants, showed significant improvements in the treatment of psoriasis. Treatment with curcumin, examined in 3 RCTs (with a total of 118 participants), 1 nonrandomized controlled study, and 1 uncontrolled study, conferred statistically and clinically significant improvements in psoriasis plaques. Fish oil treatment was evaluated in 20 studies (12 RCTs, 1 open-label nonrandomized controlled trial, and 7 uncontrolled studies); most of the RCTs showed no significant improvement in psoriasis, whereas most of the uncontrolled studies showed benefit when fish oil was used daily. Meditation and guided imagery therapies were studied in 3 single-blind RCTs (with a total of 112 patients) and showed modest efficacy in treatment of psoriasis. One meta-analysis of 13 RCTs examined the association of acupuncture with improvement in psoriasis and showed significant improvement with acupuncture compared with placebo. Conclusions and Relevance: The CAM therapies with the most robust evidence of efficacy for treatment of psoriasis are indigo naturalis, curcumin, dietary modification, fish oil, meditation, and acupuncture. This review will aid practitioners in advising patients seeking unconventional approaches for treatment of psoriasis. ",
        "Association Between Clinically Meaningful Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Improvement and Risk of Type 2 Diabetes. Importance: Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is associated with increased risk of type 2 diabetes (T2D). Improvement in PTSD has been associated with improved self-reported physical health and hypertension; however, there is no literature, to our knowledge, on whether PTSD improvement is associated with T2D risk. Objective: To examine whether clinically meaningful PTSD symptom reduction is associated with lower risk of T2D. Design, Setting, and Participants: This retrospective cohort study examined Veterans Health Affairs medical record data from 5916 patients who received PTSD specialty care between fiscal years 2008 and 2012 and were followed up through fiscal year 2015. Eligible patients had 1 or more PTSD Checklist (PCL) scores of 50 or higher between fiscal years 2008 and 2012 and a second PCL score within the following 12 months and at least 8 weeks after the first PCL score of 50 or higher. The index date was 12 months after the first PCL score. Patients were free of T2D diagnosis or an antidiabetic medication use for 12 months before the index date and had at least 1 visit after the index date. Data analyses were completed during January 2019. Exposures: Reduction in PCL scores during a 12-month period was used to define patients as those with a clinically meaningful improvement (\u226520-point PCL score decrease) and patients with less or no improvement (<20-point PCL score decrease). Main Outcomes and Measures: Incident T2D diagnosed during a 2- to 6-year follow-up. Results: Medical records from a total of 1598 patients (mean [SD] age, 42.1 [13.4] years; 1347 [84.3%] male; 1060 [66.3%] white) were studied. The age-adjusted cumulative incidence of T2D was 2.6% among patients with a clinically meaningful PCL score decrease and 5.9% among patients without a clinically meaningful PCL score decrease (P\u2009=\u2009.003). After control for confounding, patients with a clinically meaningful PCL score decrease were significantly less likely to develop T2DM compared with those without a clinically meaningful decrease (hazard ratio, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.26-0.98). Conclusions and Relevance: The findings suggest that clinically meaningful reductions in PTSD symptoms are associated with a lower risk of T2D. A decrease in PCL score, whether through treatment or spontaneous improvement, may help mitigate the greater risk of T2D in patients with PTSD. ",
        "Association Between Push-up Exercise Capacity and Future Cardiovascular Events Among Active Adult Men. Importance: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading cause of mortality worldwide. Robust evidence indicates an association of increased physical fitness with a lower risk of CVD events and improved longevity; however, few have studied simple, low-cost measures of functional status. Objective: To evaluate the association between push-up capacity and subsequent CVD event incidence in a cohort of active adult men. Design, Setting, and Participants: Retrospective longitudinal cohort study conducted between January 1, 2000, and December 31, 2010, in 1 outpatient clinics in Indiana of male firefighters aged 18 years or older. Baseline and periodic physical examinations, including tests of push-up capacity and exercise tolerance, were performed between February 2, 2000, and November 12, 2007. Participants were stratified into 5 groups based on number of push-ups completed and were followed up for 10 years. Final statistical analyses were completed on August 11, 2018. Main Outcomes and Measures: Cardiovascular disease-related outcomes through 2010 included incident diagnoses of coronary artery disease and other major CVD events. Incidence rate ratios (IRRs) were computed, and logistic regression models were used to model the time to each outcome from baseline, adjusting for age and body mass index (BMI) (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared). Kaplan-Meier estimates for cumulative risk were computed for the push-up categories. Results: A total of 1562 participants underwent baseline examination, and 1104 with available push-up data were included in the final analyses. Mean (SD) age of the cohort at baseline was 39.6 (9.2) years, and mean (SD) BMI was 28.7 (4.3). During the 10-year follow up, 37 CVD-related outcomes (8601 person-years) were reported in participants with available push-up data. Significant negative associations were found between increasing push-up capacity and CVD events. Participants able to complete more than 40 push-ups were associated with a significantly lower risk of incident CVD event risk compared with those completing fewer than 10 push-ups (IRR, 0.04; 95% CI, 0.01-0.36). Conclusions and Relevance: The findings suggest that higher baseline push-up capacity is associated with a lower incidence of CVD events. Although larger studies in more diverse cohorts are needed, push-up capacity may be a simple, no-cost measure to estimate functional status. ",
        "Use of Crowd Innovation to Develop an Artificial Intelligence-Based Solution for Radiation Therapy Targeting. Importance: Radiation therapy (RT) is a critical cancer treatment, but the existing radiation oncologist work force does not meet growing global demand. One key physician task in RT planning involves tumor segmentation for targeting, which requires substantial training and is subject to significant interobserver variation. Objective: To determine whether crowd innovation could be used to rapidly produce artificial intelligence (AI) solutions that replicate the accuracy of an expert radiation oncologist in segmenting lung tumors for RT targeting. Design, Setting, and Participants: We conducted a 10-week, prize-based, online, 3-phase challenge (prizes totaled $55\u202f000). A well-curated data set, including computed tomographic (CT) scans and lung tumor segmentations generated by an expert for clinical care, was used for the contest (CT scans from 461 patients; median 157 images per scan; 77\u202f942 images in total; 8144 images with tumor present). Contestants were provided a training set of 229 CT scans with accompanying expert contours to develop their algorithms and given feedback on their performance throughout the contest, including from the expert clinician. Main Outcomes and Measures: The AI algorithms generated by contestants were automatically scored on an independent data set that was withheld from contestants, and performance ranked using quantitative metrics that evaluated overlap of each algorithm's automated segmentations with the expert's segmentations. Performance was further benchmarked against human expert interobserver and intraobserver variation. Results: A total of 564 contestants from 62 countries registered for this challenge, and 34 (6%) submitted algorithms. The automated segmentations produced by the top 5 AI algorithms, when combined using an ensemble model, had an accuracy (Dice coefficient\u2009=\u20090.79) that was within the benchmark of mean interobserver variation measured between 6 human experts. For phase 1, the top 7 algorithms had average custom segmentation scores (S scores) on the holdout data set ranging from 0.15 to 0.38, and suboptimal performance using relative measures of error. The average S scores for phase 2 increased to 0.53 to 0.57, with a similar improvement in other performance metrics. In phase 3, performance of the top algorithm increased by an additional 9%. Combining the top 5 algorithms from phase 2 and phase 3 using an ensemble model, yielded an additional 9% to 12% improvement in performance with a final S score reaching 0.68. Conclusions and Relevance: A combined crowd innovation and AI approach rapidly produced automated algorithms that replicated the skills of a highly trained physician for a critical task in radiation therapy. These AI algorithms could improve cancer care globally by transferring the skills of expert clinicians to under-resourced health care settings. ",
        "Assessment of Use, Specificity, and Readability of Written Clinical Informed Consent Forms for Patients With Cancer Undergoing Radiotherapy. Importance: Appropriate informed consent processes are crucial to preservation of patient autonomy and shared decision making. Although half of patients with cancer receive radiotherapy, it is unknown whether current consent practices are comprehensible for patients. Objective: To characterize use, specificity, and readability of clinical informed consent forms for radiotherapy, hypothesizing that forms would be higher than the recommended sixth- to eighth-grade readability level. Design, Setting, and Participants: This nationwide cross-sectional survey study and readability analysis was conducted from 2016 to 2018 and included 89 academic radiation oncology departments that were part of the 2016 Electronic Residency Application Service. Department leaders (clinical directors, chairs, and personal contacts of study authors) at academic radiation oncology departments were contacted via email. Main Outcomes and Measures: Readability levels were measured by 7 validated readability indices, including the Ford, Caylor, Sticht (FORCAST) index for nonnarrative texts. Difficult words were identified using The Living Word Vocabulary, which describes the readability grade levels of 40\u202f000 common words. Results: Of 89 departments, 67 (75%) responded to questions and 57 (64%) provided 113 forms for analysis. Departments providing forms did not differ substantially from others in terms of region, residency size, research output, rural vs urban location, or public vs private institution status. All departments obtained patient written informed consent before radiotherapy; 38 (57%) used body site-specific forms. Using the most conservative (low-score) estimate, mean form readability ranged from grade level 10.6 to 14.2. By 7 distinct indices, only 9 (8%) of 113 forms met the recommended eighth-grade readability level, and 4 (4%) forms met a sixth-grade level. Not a single form met either recommendation based on the FORCAST index. Forms used an average of 7.2 difficult words. Body site-specific forms had considerably better readability than general consent forms. Conclusions and Relevance: This nationwide study of informed consent practices for cancer treatment with radiotherapy demonstrates that while all US academic radiotherapy departments use written consent forms, it is rare for templates to meet the recommended readability levels for patient materials. These data suggest the need for reevaluation and modification of the approach to radiotherapy consent, ideally with guidance and templates designed by national professional organizations. ",
        "Assessment of Rural-Urban Differences in Postacute Care Utilization and Outcomes Among Older US Adults. Importance: Although people living in rural areas of the United States are disproportionately older and more likely to die of conditions that require postacute care than those living in urban areas, rural-urban differences in postacute care utilization and outcomes have been understudied. Objective: To describe rural-urban differences in postacute care utilization and postdischarge outcomes. Design, Setting, and Participants: This retrospective cohort study used data from Medicare beneficiaries 66 years and older admitted to 4738 US acute care hospitals for stroke, hip fracture, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, congestive heart failure, or pneumonia between January 1, 2011, and September 30, 2015. Participants were tracked for 180 days after discharge. Data analyses were conducted between October 1, 2018, and May 30, 2019. Exposures: County of residence was classified as urban or rural using the US Department of Agriculture Rural-Urban Continuum Codes. Rural counties were divided into those adjacent and not adjacent to urban counties. Main Outcomes and Measures: Primary outcomes were discharge to community vs a formal postacute care setting (ie, skilled nursing facility, home health care, or inpatient rehabilitation facility) and readmission and mortality within 30, 90, and 180 days of hospital discharge. Results: Among 2\u202f044\u202f231 hospitalizations from 2011 to 2015, 1\u202f538\u202f888 (75.2%; mean [SD] age, 80.4 [8.3] years; 866\u202f540 [56.3%] women) were among patients from urban counties, 322\u202f360 (15.8%; mean [SD] age, 79.6 [8.1] years; 175\u202f806 [54.5%] women) were among patients from urban-adjacent rural counties, and 182\u202f983 (9.0%; mean [SD] age, 79.8 [8.1] years; 98\u202f775 [54.0%] women) were among patients from urban-nonadjacent rural counties. The probability of discharge to community without postacute care did not differ by rurality. However, compared with patients from urban counties, patients from the most rural counties were more frequently discharged to a skilled nursing facility (adjusted difference, 3.5 [95% CI, 2.8-4.3] percentage points), while discharge to an inpatient rehabilitation facility was less common among patients from rural counties than among those from urban counties (urban vs urban-adjacent rural: adjusted difference, -1.9 [95% CI, -2.4 to -1.4] percentage points; urban vs urban-nonadjacent rural: adjusted difference, -1.8 [95% CI, -2.4 to -1.2] percentage points) as was discharge to home health care (urban vs urban-adjacent rural: adjusted difference, -1.7 [95% CI, -2.3 to -1.2] percentage points; urban vs urban-nonadjacent rural: adjusted difference, -2.4 [95% CI, -3.0 to -1.8]). For patients from the most rural counties, adjusted 30-day readmission rates were 0.4 (95% CI, 0.2-0.6) percentage points higher than those of patients from urban counties among those who were discharged to the community but 0.3 (95% CI, -0.6 to -0.1) percentage points lower among patients receiving postacute care. Adjusted 30-day mortality rates were 0.4 (95% CI, 0.3-0.5) percentage points higher for patients from the most rural counties discharged to the community and 2.0 (95% CI, -1.7 to 2.3) percentage points higher among those receiving postacute care. Rural-urban differences in 90-day and 180-day outcomes were similar. Conclusions and Relevance: These findings suggest that rates of discharge to the community and postacute care settings were similar among patients from rural and urban counties. Rural-urban differences in mortality following discharge were much larger for patients receiving postacute care compared with patients discharged to the community setting. Improving postacute care in rural areas may reduce rural-urban disparities in patient outcomes. ",
        "Association of Leisure-Time Physical Activity Across the Adult Life Course With All-Cause and Cause-Specific Mortality. Importance: Although the benefits of leisure-time physical activity (LTPA) in middle age are established, the health effects of long-term participation and changes in LTPA between adolescence and middle age have not been documented. Objective: To determine whether an association exists between LTPA life course patterns and mortality. Design, Setting, and Participants: This prospective cohort study used data from the National Institutes of Health-AARP (formerly American Association of Retired Persons) Diet and Health Study established in 1995 to 1996. Data analysis was conducted from March 2017 through February 2018. Data were analyzed for 315\u202f059 adult AARP members living in 6 states, namely, California, Florida, Louisiana, New Jersey, North Carolina, or Pennsylvania, or 2 metropolitan areas, Atlanta, Georgia, or Detroit, Michigan. Exposures: Self-reported LTPA (hours per week) at the baseline interview for ages grouped as 15 to 18, 19 to 29, 35 to 39, and 40 to 61 years. Main Outcomes and Measures: All-cause, cardiovascular disease (CVD)-related, and cancer-related mortality records available through December 31, 2011. Results: Of 315\u202f059 participants, 183\u202f451 (58.2%) were men, and the participants were 50 to 71 years of age at enrollment. Ten LTPA trajectories (categorized as maintaining, increasing, and decreasing LTPA across time) were identified, and 71\u202f377 deaths due to all causes, 22\u202f219 deaths due to CVD, and 16\u202f388 deaths due to cancer occurred. Compared with participants who were consistently inactive throughout adulthood, participants who maintained the highest amount of LTPA in each age period were at lower risks for all-cause, CVD-related, and cancer-related mortality. For example, compared with participants who were consistently inactive, maintaining higher amounts of LTPA was associated with lower all-cause (hazard ratio [HR], 0.64; 95% CI, 0.60-0.68), CVD-related (HR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.53-0.64), and cancer-related (HR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.77-0.97) mortality. Adults who were less active throughout most of the adult life course but increased LTPA in later adulthood (40-61 years of age) also had lower risk for all-cause (HR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.62-0.68), CVD-related (HR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.53-0.61), and cancer-related (HR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.77-0.92) mortality. Conclusions and Relevance: Maintaining higher LTPA levels and increasing LTPA in later adulthood were associated with comparable low risk of mortality, suggesting that midlife is not too late to start physical activity. Inactive adults may be encouraged to be more active, whereas young adults who are already active may strive to maintain their activity level as they get older. ",
        "An Athletic Coach-Delivered Middle School Gender Violence Prevention Program: A Cluster Randomized Clinical Trial. Importance: Adolescent relationship abuse (ARA) and sexual violence (SV) reported among adolescents point to the need for prevention among middle school-age youths. Objective: To test an athletic coach-delivered relationship abuse and sexual violence prevention program among middle-school male athletes. Design, Setting, and Participants: An unblinded cluster randomized clinical trial from spring 2015 to fall 2017 at 41 middle schools (38 clusters). The study included 973 male middle school athletes (ages 11-14 years; grades 6-8; participation rate 50%) followed up for 1 year (retention 86%). Interventions: Coaching Boys Into Men (CBIM) is a prevention program that trains athletic coaches to talk to male athletes about (1) respectful relationship behaviors, (2) promoting more gender-equitable attitudes, and (3) positive bystander intervention when harmful behaviors among peers are witnessed. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was change in positive bystander behaviors (ie, intervening in peers' disrespectful or harmful behaviors); secondary outcomes were changes in recognition of what constitutes abusive behavior, intentions to intervene, gender-equitable attitudes, and reduction in recent ARA/SV perpetration (at end of sports season and 1-year follow up). Results: Of the 973 participants, 530 were white (54.5%), 282 were black (29.0%), 14 were Hispanic (1.4%), and the remainder were multiracial, other race/ethnicity, or not reported. Positive bystander behaviors increased at end of sports season and at 1-year follow-up (relative risk, 1.51; 95% CI, 1.06-2.16 and 1.53; 95% CI, 1.10-2.12, respectively) as did recognition of abuse (mean risk difference, 0.14; 95% CI, 0.01-0.27 and 0.14; 95% CI, 0.00-0.28, respectively). At 1-year follow-up, among those who ever dated, athletes on teams receiving CBIM had lower odds of reporting recent ARA/SV perpetration (odds ratio, 0.24; 95% CI, 0.09-0.65). Gender attitudes and intentions to intervene did not differ between study arms. In exploratory intensity-adjusted and per protocol analyses, athletes on teams receiving CBIM were more likely to report positive bystander behaviors and to endorse equitable gender attitudes and less likely to report ARA and sexual harassment perpetration 1 year later. Conclusions and Relevance: An athletic coach-delivered program for middle school male athletes is an effective strategy for reducing relationship abuse among younger adolescents. Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02331238. ",
        "Association of Relative Age in the School Year With Diagnosis of Intellectual Disability, Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder, and Depression. Importance: Young relative age within the school year has previously been associated with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) diagnosis and, based on limited evidence, diagnosis of intellectual disability. No study to date has examined the association between relative age and diagnosis of depression. Objectives: To estimate the associations with intellectual disability and ADHD and investigate a potential novel association between relative age and childhood depression. Design, Setting, and Participants: This population-based cohort study of 1\u202f042\u202f106 children aged 4 to 15 years used electronic record data collected before January 3, 2017, from more than 700 general practices contributing to the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression modeling was used to explore the association between relative age and the incidence of intellectual disability, ADHD, and depression before age 16 years. Data were analyzed between July 2017 and January 2019. Exposures: Relative age within school year determined by month of birth and categorized into four 3-month groups. Main Outcomes and Measures: Intellectual disability, ADHD, and depression. Results: In the total cohort of 1\u202f042\u202f106 children, 532\u202f876 were male (51.1%) and the median age at study entry was 4.0 years (interquartile range, 4.0-5.0). There was evidence that being born in the last quarter of the school year (ie, being the youngest group in a school year) was associated with diagnosis of intellectual disability (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 1.30; 95% CI, 1.18-1.42), ADHD (aHR, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.28-1.45), and depression (aHR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.08-1.59) compared with being born in the first quarter. A graded association was seen with intermediate age groups at a smaller increased risk of each diagnosis compared with the oldest group, with aHRs for intellectual disability for those born in the second quarter of 1.06 (95% CI, 0.96-1.17) and for those born in the third quarter of 1.20 (95% CI, 1.09-1.32); aHRs for ADHD for those born in the second quarter of 1.15 (95% CI, 1.08-1.23) and for those born in the third quarter of 1.31 (95% CI, 1.23-1.40); and aHRs for depression for those born in the second quarter of 1.05 (95% CI, 0.85-1.29) and for those born in the third quarter of 1.13 (95% CI, 0.92-1.38). Conclusions and Relevance: In this study, relative youth status in the school year is associated with an increased risk of diagnosis of ADHD, intellectual disability, and depression in childhood. Further research into clinical and policy interventions to minimize these associations appears to be needed. ",
        "Association of Behavior in Boys From Low Socioeconomic Neighborhoods With Employment Earnings in Adulthood. Importance: Identifying early childhood behavioral problems associated with economic success/failure is essential for the development of targeted interventions that enhance economic prosperity through improved educational attainment and social integration. Objective: To test the association between kindergarten teacher-rated assessments of inattention, hyperactivity, opposition, aggression, and prosociality in boys with their employment earnings at age 35 to 36 years as measured by government tax return data. Design, Setting, and Participants: A 30-year prospective follow-up study analyzing low socioeconomic neighborhoods in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. Boys aged 5 to 6 years attending kindergarten in low socioeconomic neighborhoods were recruited. Teacher-rated behavioral assessments were obtained for 1040 boys. Data were collected from April 1984 to December 2015. Analysis began January 2017. Main Outcomes and Measures: Mixed-effects linear regression models were used to examine the association between teacher ratings of inattention, hyperactivity, opposition, aggression, and prosociality at age 6 years and individual earnings obtained from government tax returns at age 35 to 36 years. The IQ of the child and family adversity were adjusted for in the analysis. Results: Complete data were available for 920 study participants (mean age at follow-up was 36.3 years). Mean (SD) personal earnings at follow-up were $28\u202f865.53 ($24\u202f103.45) (range, $0-$142\u202f267.84). A 1-unit increase in inattention (mean\u2009[SD], 2.66\u2009[2.34]; range, 0-8) at age 6 years was associated with decrease in earnings at age 35 to 36 years of $1295.13 (95% CI, -$2051.65 to -$538.62), while a unit increase in prosociality (mean [SD], 8.0\u2009[4.96]; range, 0-20) was associated with an increase in earnings of $406.15 (95% CI, $172.54-$639.77). Hyperactivity, opposition, and aggression were not significantly associated with earnings. Child IQ was associated with higher earnings and family adversity with lower earnings in all models. A 1-SD reduction in inattention at age 6 years was associated with a theoretical increase in annual earnings of $3040.41, a similar magnitude to an equivalent increase in IQ. Conclusions and Relevance: Teacher ratings of inattention and prosociality in kindergarten boys from low socioeconomic neighborhoods are associated with earnings in adulthood after adjustment for hyperactivity, aggression, and opposition, which were not associated with earnings. Interventions beginning in kindergarten that target boys' inattention and enhance prosociality could positively impact workforce integration and earnings. ",
        "Association of Nonadherence to Cancer Screening Examinations With Mortality From Unrelated Causes: A Secondary Analysis of the PLCO Cancer Screening Trial. Importance: Patient nonadherence to chronic disease prevention guidelines is associated with increased mortality. Nonadherence to offered cancer screening tests may be associated with mortality among middle-aged and older adults. Objective: To evaluate the association between nonadherence to cancer screening tests and mortality in the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening trial, excluding mortality from cancers studied in the trial. Design, Setting, and Participants: Randomization at 10 US screening centers occurred from November 8, 1993, to July 2, 2001. Original follow-up was through 13 years or December 31, 2009. Participants were re-consented to further follow-up starting May 18, 2011, and were observed until December 31, 2012. Protocol screening tests for the PLCO Cancer Screening trial intervention arm participants (N\u2009=\u200977\u202f443) included chest radiographs and flexible sigmoidoscopy for both sexes, prostate-specific antigen tests and digital rectal examinations for men, and cancer antigen 125 tests and transvaginal ultrasonography for women. At baseline, participants completed a self-administered questionnaire. The cohort was classified into those receiving all sex-specified PLCO Cancer Screening trial screening tests at baseline (fully adherent), those receiving some but not all baseline tests (partially adherent), and those receiving no baseline tests (nonadherents). Secondary analysis was ad hoc in the original trial protocol. Statistical analysis was conducted from November 24, 2017, to August 29, 2018. Main Outcomes and Measures: Mortality was ascertained via mailed annual study update questionnaires and searches of the National Death Index. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to analyze the association between mortality and adherence, controlling for various covariates. Results: Of 77\u202f443 participants in the intervention arm, 64\u202f567 (29\u202f537 women and 35\u202f030 men; mean [SD] age, 62.3 [5.3] years) were included in the analysis based on consenting to trial participation before randomization and being eligible for all screening tests. Overall, 55\u202f065 participants (85.3%) were adherent, 2548 (3.9%) were partially adherent, and 6954 (10.8%) were nonadherent with the baseline screening protocol. Within 10 years of follow-up, the hazard ratio of mortality, excluding deaths from cancers studied in the PLCO Cancer Screening trial and controlling only for age, sex, and race/ethnicity (model 1), was 1.73 (95% CI, 1.60-1.89) for nonadherent compared with fully adherent participants and 1.36 (95% CI, 1.19-1.54) for partially compared with fully adherent participants. After adjustment for medical risk factors for mortality and behavioral-related factors (model 2), the hazard ratio decreased to 1.46 (95% CI, 1.34-1.59) for nonadherent compared with fully adherent participants. Conclusions and Relevance: Among participants in a screening trial for multiple cancers, a nonadherence behavior profile marked by nonadherence to protocol screenings was associated with higher overall mortality (excluding deaths from cancers studied in the trial). The generalizability of this finding to routine clinical practice should be assessed. Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT00002540. ",
        "Complication Rates and Downstream Medical Costs Associated With Invasive Diagnostic Procedures for Lung Abnormalities in the Community Setting. Importance: The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services added lung cancer screening with low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) as a Medicare preventive service benefit in 2015 following findings from the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) that showed a 16% reduction in lung cancer mortality associated with LDCT. A challenge in developing and promoting a national lung cancer screening program is the high false-positive rate of LDCT because abnormal findings from thoracic imaging often trigger subsequent invasive diagnostic procedures and could lead to postprocedural complications. Objective: To determine the complication rates and downstream medical costs associated with invasive diagnostic procedures performed for identification of lung abnormalities in the community setting. Design, Setting, and Participants: A retrospective cohort study of non-protocol-driven community practices captured in MarketScan Commercial Claims & Encounters and Medicare supplemental databases was conducted. A nationally representative sample of 344\u202f510 patients aged 55 to 77 years who underwent invasive diagnostic procedures between 2008 and 2013 was included. Main Outcomes and Measures: One-year complication rates were calculated for 4 groups of invasive diagnostic procedures. The complication rates and costs were further stratified by age group. Results: Of the 344\u202f510 individuals aged 55 to 77 years included in the study, 174\u202f702 comprised the study group (109 363 [62.6%] women) and 169\u202f808 served as the control group (106 007 [62.4%] women). The estimated complication rate was 22.2% (95% CI, 21.7%-22.7%) for individuals in the young age group and 23.8% (95% CI, 23.0%-24.6%) for those in the Medicare group; the rates were approximately twice as high as those reported in the NLST (9.8% and 8.5%, respectively). The mean incremental complication costs were $6320 (95% CI, $5863-$6777) for minor complications to $56 845 (95% CI, $47 953-$65 737) for major complications. Conclusions and Relevance: The rates of complications after invasive diagnostic procedures were higher than the rates reported in clinical trials. Physicians and patients should be aware of the potential risks of subsequent adverse events and their high downstream costs in the shared decision-making process. ",
        "Changes in Sexual Functioning in Women and Men in the 5 Years After Bariatric Surgery. Importance: Short-term improvements in sexual functioning are reported after bariatric surgery, but to our knowledge, little is known about the durability of these improvements. Objective: To determine the percentage of adults with impairment in sexual functioning who experience durable improvements in sexual functioning after bariatric surgery and to identify factors associated with improvements. Design, Setting, and Participants: The Longitudinal Assessment of Bariatric Surgery-2 is an observational cohort study conducted at 10 hospitals in 6 US clinical centers. Adults undergoing their first bariatric procedure were recruited from 2005 through 2009, data were collected through August 2014. Data analysis was conducted from 2016 to April 2018. Interventions: Participants completed assessments before the procedure and annually thereafter for 5 years. Main Outcomes and Measures: A self-administered questionnaire was used to assess clinically meaningful differences before and after surgery in past-month sexual satisfaction, desire, and activity and physical health limitations to sexual activity among subgroups who reported sexual functioning at less than domain-specific thresholds before surgery. Results: Of 2215 participants eligible for sexual function follow-up, 2036 (91.9%) completed 1 or more follow-up assessment (1431 [64.6%] at year 5), of whom 1607 (78.9%) were women. At the presurgery assessment, median (interquartile range) age was 47 (37-55) years, and the median (interquartile range) body mass index was 45.8 (41.7-51.3). Among those who were not satisfied with their sexual life before surgery (1015 of 1456 women [69.7%]; 304 of 409 men [74.3%]), 56.0% of women (95% CI, 52.5%-59.5%) and 49.2% of men (95% CI, 42.4%-55.9%) experienced clinically meaningful improvements at year 1; these percentages did not significantly differ during further follow-up. Among those who reported physical limitations to sexual activity at baseline (892 of 1490 women [59.9%] and 267 of 406 men [65.8%]), the percentage experiencing improvement in this domain decreased during follow-up, but 73.6% (95% CI, 69.3%-78.0%) of women and 67.6% (95% CI, 59.6%-75.6%) of men continued to report improvements at year 5. Greater postsurgical reduction in depressive symptoms was independently associated with improvement in 4 domains of sexual life among women (frequency of sexual desire: adjusted relative risk [aRR] per 5-point decrease in Beck Depression Inventory score, 1.12 [95% CI, 1.07-1.18]; P\u2009<\u2009.001; frequency of sexual activity: aRR, 1.13 [95% CI, 1.08-1.18]; P\u2009<\u2009.001; the degree to which physical health limited sexual activity: aRR, 1.19 [95% CI, 1.14-1.23]; P\u2009<\u2009.001; and satisfaction with sexual life: aRR, 1.25 [95% CI, 1.19-1.31]; P\u2009<\u2009.001) and 2 domains among men (physical health limitations: aRR, 1.14 [95% CI, 1.04-1.26]; P\u2009=\u2009.008 and satisfaction with sexual life: aRR, 1.55 [95% CI, 1.33-1.81]; P\u2009<\u2009.001). Surgical procedure was not associated with improvement. Conclusions and Relevance: Per this study, approximately half of women and men who were not satisfied with their sexual life prior to bariatric surgery experienced improvements in satisfaction in 5 years of follow-up.

        "Assessment of Patient-Centered Approaches to Collect Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity Information in the Emergency Department: The EQUALITY Study. Importance: Health care and government organizations call for routine collection of sexual orientation and gender identity (SOGI) information in the clinical setting, yet patient preferences for collection methods remain unknown. Objective: To assess of the optimal patient-centered approach for SOGI collection in the emergency department (ED) setting. Design, Setting, and Participants: This matched cohort study (Emergency Department Query for Patient-Centered Approaches to Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity [EQUALITY] Study) of 4 EDs on the east coast of the United States sequentially tested 2 different SOGI collection approaches between February 2016 and March 2017. Multivariable ordered logistic regression was used to assess whether either SOGI collection method was associated with higher patient satisfaction with their ED experience. Eligible adults older than 18 years who identified as a sexual or gender minority (SGM) were enrolled and then matched 1 to 1 by age (aged \u22655 years) and illness severity (Emergency Severity Index score \u00b11) to patients who identified as heterosexual and cisgender (non-SGM), and to patients whose SOGI information was missing (blank field). Patients who identified as SGM, non-SGM, or had a blank field were invited to complete surveys about their ED visit. Data analysis was conducted from April 2017 to November 2017. Interventions: Two SOGI collection approaches were tested: nurse verbal collection during the clinical encounter vs nonverbal collection during patient registration. The ED physicians, physician assistants, nurses, and registrars received education and training on sexual or gender minority health disparities and terminology prior to and throughout the intervention period. Main Outcomes and Measures: A detailed survey, developed with input of a stakeholder advisory board, which included a modified Communication Climate Assessment Toolkit score and additional patient satisfaction measures. Results: A total of 540 enrolled patients were analyzed; the mean age was 36.4 years and 66.5% of those who identified their gender were female. Sexual or gender minority patients had significantly better Communication Climate Assessment Toolkit scores with nonverbal registrar form collection compared with nurse verbal collection (mean [SD], 95.6 [11.9] vs 89.5 [20.5]; P\u2009=\u2009.03). No significant differences between the 2 approaches were found among non-SGM patients (mean [SD], 91.8 [18.9] vs 93.2 [13.6]; P\u2009=\u2009.59) or those with a blank field (92.7 [15.9] vs 93.6 [14.7]; P\u2009=\u2009.70). After adjusting for age, race, illness severity, and site, SGM patients had 2.57 (95% CI, 1.13-5.82) increased odds of a better Communication Climate Assessment Toolkit score category during form collection compared with verbal collection. Conclusions and Relevance: Sexual or gender minority patients reported greater comfort and improved communication when SOGI was collected via nonverbal self-report. Registrar form collection was the optimal patient-centered method for collecting SOGI information in the ED. ",
        "Association of Chronic Rhinosinusitis With Depression and Anxiety in a Nationwide Insurance Population. Importance: Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is associated with a decreased quality of life, affecting physical and emotional aspects of daily function, the latter of which could manifest as depression and anxiety. Objective: To evaluate the risk of depression and anxiety in CRS, depending on the CRS phenotype (CRS without nasal polyps [CRSsNP] and CRS with nasal polyps [CRSwNP]). Design, Setting, and Participants: This retrospective nationwide cohort study used population-based insurance data (consisting of data from approximately 1 million patients). The study population included 16\u202f224 patients with CRS and 32\u202f448 individuals without CRS, with propensity score matching between groups according to sociodemographic factors and enrollment year. Data were collected from January 1, 2002, through December 31, 2013, and analyzed from July 1 through November 15, 2018. Main Outcomes and Measures: Survival analysis, the log-rank test, and Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to calculate the incidence, survival rate, and hazard ratio (HR) of depression and anxiety for each group. Results: Among the 48 672 individuals included in the study population (58.8% female), the overall incidence of depression during the 11-year follow-up was 1.51-fold higher in the CRS group than in the non-CRS group (24.2 vs 16.0 per 1000 person-years; adjusted HR, 1.54; 95% CI, 1.48-1.61). The incidence of anxiety was also higher in the CRS group than in the comparison group (42.2 vs 27.8 per 1000 person-years; adjusted HR, 1.57; 95% CI, 1.52-1.62). Moreover, the adjusted HRs of developing depression (CRSsNP, 1.61 [95% CI, 1.54-1.69]; CRSwNP, 1.41 [95% CI, 1.32-1.50]) and anxiety (CRSsNP, 1.63 [95% CI, 1.57-1.69]; CRSwNP, 1.45 [95% CI, 1.38-1.52]) were greater in patients with CRSsNP than in those with CRSwNP. Conclusions and Relevance: This observational study suggests that CRS is associated with an increased incidence of depression and anxiety. Specifically, findings from this study found that patients without nasal polyps showed a higher risk of developing depression and anxiety than those with nasal polyps. ",
        "Recovery After Mild Traumatic Brain Injury in Patients Presenting to US Level I Trauma Centers: A Transforming Research and Clinical Knowledge in Traumatic Brain Injury (TRACK-TBI) Study. Importance: Most traumatic brain injuries (TBIs) are classified as mild (mTBI) based on admission Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) scores of 13 to 15. The prevalence of persistent functional limitations for these patients is unclear. Objectives: To characterize the natural history of recovery of daily function following mTBI vs peripheral orthopedic traumatic injury in the first 12 months postinjury using data from the Transforming Research and Clinical Knowledge in Traumatic Brain Injury (TRACK-TBI) study, and, using clinical computed tomographic (CT) scans, examine whether the presence (CT+) or absence (CT-) of acute intracranial findings in the mTBI group was associated with outcomes. Design, Setting, and Participants: TRACK-TBI, a cohort study of patients with mTBI presenting to US level I trauma centers, enrolled patients from February 26, 2014, to August 8, 2018, and followed up for 12 months. A total of 1453 patients at 11 level I trauma center emergency departments or inpatient units met inclusion criteria (ie, mTBI [n\u2009=\u20091154] or peripheral orthopedic traumatic injury [n\u2009=\u2009299]) and were enrolled within 24 hours of injury; mTBI participants had admission GCS scores of 13 to 15 and clinical head CT scans. Patients with peripheral orthopedic trauma injury served as the control (OTC) group. Exposures: Participants with mTBI or OTC. Main Outcomes and Measures: The Glasgow Outcome Scale Extended (GOSE) scale score, reflecting injury-related functional limitations across broad life domains at 2 weeks and 3, 6, and 12 months postinjury was the primary outcome. The possible score range of the GOSE score is 1 (dead) to 8 (upper good recovery), with a score less than 8 indicating some degree of functional impairment. Results: Of the 1453 participants, 953 (65.6%) were men; mean (SD) age was 40.9 (17.1) years in the mTBI group and 40.9 (15.4) years in the OTC group. Most participants (mTBI, 87%; OTC, 93%) reported functional limitations (GOSE <8) at 2 weeks postinjury. At 12 months, the percentage of mTBI participants reporting functional limitations was 53% (95% CI, 49%-56%) vs 38% (95% CI, 30%-45%) for OTCs. A higher percentage of CT+ patients reported impairment (61%) compared with the mTBI CT- group (49%; relative risk [RR], 1.24; 95% CI, 1.08-1.43) and a higher percentage in the mTBI CT-group compared with the OTC group (RR, 1.28; 95% CI, 1.02-1.60). Conclusions and Relevance: Most patients with mTBI presenting to US level I trauma centers report persistent, injury-related life difficulties at 1 year postinjury, suggesting the need for more systematic follow-up of patients with mTBI to provide treatments and reduce the risk of chronic problems after mTBI.

        "Trends in Sedentary Behavior Among the US Population, 2001-2016. Importance: Prolonged sitting, particularly watching television or videos, has been associated with increased risk of multiple diseases and mortality. However, changes in sedentary behaviors over time have not been well described in the United States. Objective: To evaluate patterns and temporal trends in sedentary behaviors and sociodemographic and lifestyle correlates in the US population. Design, Setting, and Participants: A serial, cross-sectional analysis of the US nationally representative data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) among children aged 5 through 11 years (2001-2016); adolescents, 12 through 19 years (2003-2016); and adults, 20 years or older (2003-2016). Exposures: Survey cycle. Main Outcomes and Measures: Prevalence of sitting watching television or videos for 2 h/d or more, computer use outside work or school for 1 h/d or more, and total sitting time (h/d in those aged \u226512 years). Results: Data on 51\u202f896 individuals (mean, 37.2 years [SE, 0.19]; 25\u202f968 [50%] female) were analyzed from 2001-2016 NHANES data, including 10\u202f359 children, 9639 adolescents, and 31\u202f898 adults. The estimated prevalence of sitting watching television or videos for 2 h/d or more was high among all ages (children, 62% [95% CI, 57% to 67%]; adolescents, 59% [95% CI, 54% to 65%]; adults, 65% [95% CI, 61% to 69%]; adults aged 20-64 years, 62% [95% CI, 58% to 66%]; and \u226565 years, 84% [95% CI, 81% to 88%] in the 2015-2016 cycle). From 2001 through 2016, the trends decreased among children over time (difference, -3.4% [95% CI, -11% to 4.5%]; P for trend =.004), driven by non-Hispanic white children; were stable among adolescents (-4.8% [95% CI, -12% to 2.3%]; P for trend =.60) and among adults aged 20 through 64 years (-0.7% [95% CI, -5.6% to 4.1%]; P for trend =.82); but increased among adults aged 65 years or older (difference, 3.5% [95% CI, -1.2% to 8.1%]; P for trend =.03). The estimated prevalence of computer use outside school or work for 1 h/d or more increased in all ages (children, 43% [95% CI, 40% to 46%] to 56% [95% CI, 49% to 63%] from 2001 to 2016; difference, 13% [95% CI, 5.6% to 21%]; P for trend <.001; adolescents, 53% [95% CI, 47% to 58%] to 57% [95% CI, 53% to 62%] from 2003 to 2016, difference, 4.8% [95% CI, -1.8% to 11%]; P for trend =.002; adults, 29% [27% to 32%] to 50% [48% to 53%] from 2003 to 2016, difference, 21% [95% CI, 18% to 25%]; P for trend <.001). From 2007 to 2016, total hours per day of sitting time increased among adolescents (7.0 [95% CI, 6.7 to 7.4] to 8.2 [95% CI, 7.9 to 8.4], difference, 1.1 [95% CI, 0.7 to 1.5]) and adults (5.5 [95% CI, 5.2 to 5.7] to 6.4 [95% CI, 6.2 to 6.6]; difference, 1.0 [95% CI, 0.7 to 1.3]; P for trend <.001 for both). Conclusions and Relevance: In this nationally representative survey of the US population from 2001 through 2016, the estimated prevalence of sitting watching television or videos for at least 2 hours per day generally remained high and stable. The estimated prevalence of computer use during leisure-time increased among all age groups, and the estimated total sitting time increased among adolescents and adults. ",
        "Association of Positive Airway Pressure Prescription With Mortality in Patients With Obesity and Severe Obstructive Sleep Apnea: The Sleep Heart Health Study. Importance: The association of positive airway pressure (PAP) with reduced mortality in patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) remains uncertain. Objective: To investigate the association between PAP prescription and mortality. Design, Setting, and Participants: This multicenter, population-based cohort study evaluated data from the Sleep Heart Health Study (SHHS), a long-term observational cohort study that included participants between 1995 and 1998, with a mean follow-up of 11.1 years. Analyses were performed in September 2018. Within the SHHS, we compared patients with obesity and severe OSA with (n\u2009=\u200981) and without (n\u2009=\u2009311) prescription of PAP therapy, after matching patients from each group by age, sex, and apnea-hypopnea index. Exposures: Self-reported use of PAP. Main Outcomes and Measures: All-cause mortality. Results: Of 392 study participants, 316 (80.6%) were men, and mean (SD) age was 63.1 (11.0) years. Ninety-six deaths occurred; 12 among the prescribed-PAP group and 84 among the nonprescribed-PAP group, yielding crude incidence rates of 12.8 vs 24.7 deaths per 1000 person-years. In Cox multivariate analysis, the hazard ratio (HR) of all-cause mortality for prescribed PAP therapy was 0.38 (95% CI, 0.18-0.81). After propensity matching, the HR of all-cause mortality for prescribed PAP therapy was 0.58 (95% CI, 0.35-0.96). According to survival curves, the difference in mortality appears 6 to 7 years after initiation of PAP therapy. Conclusions and Relevance: Positive airway pressure prescription is associated with reduced all-cause mortality, and this association appears several years after PAP initiation. If replicated, these findings may have strong clinical implications. ",
        "Association of Unrecognized Obstructive Sleep Apnea With Postoperative Cardiovascular Events in Patients Undergoing Major Noncardiac Surgery. Importance: Unrecognized obstructive sleep apnea increases cardiovascular risks in the general population, but whether obstructive sleep apnea poses a similar risk in the perioperative period remains uncertain. Objectives: To determine the association between obstructive sleep apnea and 30-day risk of cardiovascular complications after major noncardiac surgery. Design, Setting, and Participants: Prospective cohort study involving adult at-risk patients without prior diagnosis of sleep apnea and undergoing major noncardiac surgery from 8 hospitals in 5 countries between January 2012 and July 2017, with follow-up until August 2017. Postoperative monitoring included nocturnal pulse oximetry and measurement of cardiac troponin concentrations. Exposures: Obstructive sleep apnea was classified as mild (respiratory event index [REI] 5-14.9 events/h), moderate (REI 15-30), and severe (REI >30), based on preoperative portable sleep monitoring. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was a composite of myocardial injury, cardiac death, heart failure, thromboembolism, atrial fibrillation, and stroke within 30 days of surgery. Proportional-hazards analysis was used to determine the association between obstructive sleep apnea and postoperative cardiovascular complications. Results: Among a total of 1364 patients recruited for the study, 1218 patients (mean age, 67 [SD, 9] years; 40.2% women) were included in the analyses. At 30 days after surgery, rates of the primary outcome were 30.1% (41/136) for patients with severe OSA, 22.1% (52/235) for patients with moderate OSA, 19.0% (86/452) for patients with mild OSA, and 14.2% (56/395) for patients with no OSA. OSA was associated with higher risk for the primary outcome (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 1.49 [95% CI, 1.19-2.01]; P\u2009=\u2009.01); however, the association was significant only among patients with severe OSA (adjusted HR, 2.23 [95% CI, 1.49-3.34]; P\u2009=\u2009.001) and not among those with moderate OSA (adjusted HR, 1.47 [95% CI, 0.98-2.09]; P\u2009=\u2009.07) or mild OSA (adjusted HR, 1.36 [95% CI, 0.97-1.91]; P\u2009=\u2009.08) (P\u2009=\u2009.01 for interaction). The mean cumulative duration of oxyhemoglobin desaturation less than 80% during the first 3 postoperative nights in patients with cardiovascular complications (23.1 [95% CI, 15.5-27.7] minutes) was longer than in those without (10.2 [95% CI, 7.8-10.9] minutes) (P\u2009<\u2009.001). No significant interaction effects on perioperative outcomes were observed with type of anesthesia, use of postoperative opioids, and supplemental oxygen therapy. Conclusions and Relevance: Among at-risk adults undergoing major noncardiac surgery, unrecognized severe obstructive sleep apnea was significantly associated with increased risk of 30-day postoperative cardiovascular complications. Further research would be needed to assess whether interventions can modify this risk. ",
        "Association of Smoking and Other Factors With the Outcome of Mohs Reconstruction Using Flaps or Grafts. Importance: Smoking, a common lifestyle trait, is considered by many surgeons to be a major risk factor for postoperative complications. However, in the literature on local reconstruction, the association between smoking and the rate of postoperative complications after cutaneous tissue transfer is not well characterized. Objective: To study the outcomes of flaps and grafts used in Mohs micrographic surgery reconstruction with respect to smoking status and patient-specific and surgery-specific variables. Design, Setting, and Participants: This retrospective case-control study was conducted at a single tertiary referral center among 1008 patients who underwent Mohs reconstruction repaired by flap or graft between July 1, 2012, and June 30, 2016, and were selected via consecutive sampling. Cases with incomplete records or those in which a single flap or graft was used to repair multiple defects were excluded. Data analysis was performed from September 2017 to January 2018. Main Outcomes and Measures: Postoperative acute and long-term complications. Acute complications included postsurgical infection, dehiscence, hematoma, uncontrolled bleeding, and tissue necrosis that required medical counseling or intervention. Long-term complications included functional or cosmetic outcomes that prompted the patient to request or the surgeon to offer additional intervention. Results: Of the 1008 patients included in the study (396 women and 612 men), the median (SD) age was 70 (12) years (range, 21-90 years). A total of 128 patients (12.7%) were current smokers, 385 (38.2%) were former smokers, and 495 (49.1%) were never smokers. On multivariate logistic regression, current smoking (odds ratio [OR], 9.58; 95% CI, 3.63-25.3), former smoking (OR, 3.64; 95% CI, 1.41-9.38), larger defect size (OR, 2.25; 95% CI, 1.58-3.20), and the use of free cartilage graft (OR, 8.19; 95% CI, 2.02-33.1) were associated with increased risks of acute complications. For long-term complications, central face location (OR, 25.4; 95% CI, 6.16-106.5), use of interpolation flap or flap-graft combination (OR, 3.49; 95% CI, 1.81-6.74), larger flap size (OR, 1.42; 95% CI, 1.09-1.87), and basal cell carcinomas or other basaloid tumors (OR, 3.43; 95% CI, 1.03-11.5) were associated with an increased risk, whereas increased age (OR, 0.66 per 10-year interval; 95% CI, 0.54-0.80) was associated with decreased risk. Conclusions and Relevance: This study suggests that both current and former smokers are at increased risk for acute postsurgical complications but that smoking status is not associated with long-term complications. These findings may allow the surgeon to better quantify the magnitude of risk and provide helpful information for patient counseling. Level of Evidence: 3. ",
        "Association Between Soft Drink Consumption and Mortality in 10 European Countries. Importance: Soft drinks are frequently consumed, but whether this consumption is associated with mortality risk is unknown and has been understudied in European populations to date. Objective: To examine the association between total, sugar-sweetened, and artificially sweetened soft drink consumption and subsequent total and cause-specific mortality. Design, Setting, and Participants: This population-based cohort study involved participants (n\u2009=\u2009451\u202f743 of the full cohort) in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC), an ongoing, large multinational cohort of people from 10 European countries (Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom), with participants recruited between January 1, 1992, and December 31, 2000. Excluded participants were those who reported cancer, heart disease, stroke, or diabetes at baseline; those with implausible dietary intake data; and those with missing soft drink consumption or follow-up information. Data analyses were performed from February 1, 2018, to October 1, 2018. Exposure: Consumption of total, sugar-sweetened, and artificially sweetened soft drinks. Main Outcomes and Measures: Total mortality and cause-specific mortality. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs were estimated using multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression models adjusted for other mortality risk factors. Results: In total, 521 330 individuals were enrolled. Of this total, 451\u202f743 (86.7%) were included in the study, with a mean (SD) age of 50.8 (9.8) years and with 321\u202f081 women (71.1%). During a mean (range) follow-up of 16.4 (11.1 in Greece to 19.2 in France) years, 41\u202f693 deaths occurred. Higher all-cause mortality was found among participants who consumed 2 or more glasses per day (vs consumers of <1 glass per month) of total soft drinks (hazard ratio [HR],\u20091.17; 95% CI, 1.11-1.22; P\u2009<\u2009.001), sugar-sweetened soft drinks (HR, 1.08; 95% CI, 1.01-1.16; P\u2009=\u2009.004), and artificially sweetened soft drinks (HR,\u20091.26; 95% CI, 1.16-1.35; P\u2009<\u2009.001). Positive associations were also observed between artificially sweetened soft drinks and deaths from circulatory diseases (\u22652 glasses per day vs <1 glass per month; HR,\u20091.52; 95% CI, 1.30-1.78; P\u2009<\u2009.001) and between sugar-sweetened soft drinks and deaths from digestive diseases (\u22651 glass per day vs <1 glass per month; HR,\u20091.59; 95% CI, 1.24-2.05; P\u2009<\u2009.001). Conclusions and Relevance: This study found that consumption of total, sugar-sweetened, and artificially sweetened soft drinks was positively associated with all-cause deaths in this large European cohort; the results are supportive of public health campaigns aimed at limiting the consumption of soft drinks.

        "Association Between Receipt of a Medically Tailored Meal Program and Health Care Use. Importance: Whether interventions to improve food access can reduce health care use is unknown. Objective: To determine whether participation in a medically tailored meal intervention is associated with fewer subsequent hospitalizations. Design, Setting, and Participants: A retrospective cohort study was conducted using near/far matching instrumental variable analysis. Data from the 2011-2015 Massachusetts All-Payer Claims database and Community Servings, a not-for-profit organization delivering medically tailored meals (MTMs), were linked. The study was conducted from December 15, 2016, to January 16, 2019. Recipients of MTMs who had at least 360 days of preintervention claims data were matched to nonrecipients on the basis of demographic, clinical, and neighborhood characteristics. Interventions: Weekly delivery of 10 ready-to-consume meals tailored to the specific medical needs of the individual under the supervision of a registered dietitian nutritionist. Main Outcomes and Measures: Inpatient admissions were the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes were admission to a skilled nursing facility and health care costs (from medical and pharmaceutical claims). Results: There were 807 eligible MTM recipients. After matching, there were 499 MTM recipients, matched to 521 nonrecipients for a total of 1020 study participants (mean [SD] age, 52.7 [14.5] years; 568 [55.7%] female). Prior to matching and compared with nonrecipients in the same area, health care use, health care cost, and comorbidity were all significantly higher in recipients. For example, preintervention mean (SD) inpatient admissions were 1.6 (6.5) in MTM recipients vs 0.2 (0.8) in nonrecipients (P\u2009<\u2009.001), and mean health care costs were $80\u202f617 ($312\u202f337) vs $16\u202f138 ($68\u202f738) (P\u2009<\u2009.001). Recipients compared with nonrecipients were also significantly more likely to have HIV (21.9% vs 0.7%, P\u2009<\u2009.001), cancer (37.9% vs 11.3%, P\u2009<\u2009.001), and diabetes (33.7% vs 7.0%, P\u2009<\u2009.001). In instrumental variable analyses, MTM receipt was associated with significantly fewer inpatient admissions (incidence rate ratio [IRR], 0.51; 95% CI, 0.22-0.80; risk difference, -519; 95% CI, -360 to -678 per 1000 person-years). Similarly, MTM receipt was associated with fewer skilled nursing facility admissions (IRR, 0.28; 95% CI, 0.01-0.60; risk difference, -913; 95% CI, -689 to -1457 per 1000 person-years). The models estimated that, had everyone in the matched cohort received treatment owing to the instrument (and including the cost of program participation), mean monthly costs would have been $3838 vs $4591 if no one had received treatment owing to the instrument (difference, -$753; 95% CI, -$1225 to -$280). Conclusions and Relevance: Participation in a medically tailored meals program appears to be associated with fewer hospital and skilled nursing admissions and less overall medical spending. ",
        "Trends in Stroke Incidence Rates in Older US Adults: An Update From the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Cohort Study. Importance: Determining whether the previously reported decreased stroke incidence rates from 1987 to 2011 among US adults 65 years and older in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study continued to decrease subsequently can help guide policy and planning efforts. Objective: To evaluate whether stroke incidence declines among older adults in the ARIC study continued after 2011. Design, Setting, and Participants: ARIC is a community-based prospective cohort study including 15\u202f792 individuals aged 45 to 64 years at baseline (1987-1989), selected by probability sampling from residents of Forsyth County, North Carolina; Jackson, Mississippi (black individuals only); the northwestern suburbs of Minneapolis, Minneapolis; and Washington County, Maryland (ie, center). The present study included ARIC participants free of stroke at baseline, followed up through December 31, 2017. Data were collected through personal interviews and physical examinations during study visits, annual/semiannual telephone interviews, and active surveillance of discharges from local hospitals. Stroke events were adjudicated by study-physicians reviewers. Analysis began September 2018. Main Outcomes and Measures: The main outcome was stroke incidence rates, which were computed with 95% CIs stratifying the analysis by age and calendar time. Trends in adjusted incidence rates were assessed using Poisson regression incidence rate ratios. Models included calendar time, age, sex, race/center, and time-varying risk factors (hypertension, diabetes, coronary heart disease, cholesterol-lowering medication use, and smoking). Results: Of 14\u202f357 ARIC participants with 326\u202f654 person-years of follow-up, the mean (SD) age at baseline was 54.1 (5.8) years and 7955 (55.4%) were women. From 1987 to 2017, a total of 1340 incident strokes occurred among ARIC participants, and among them, 1028 (76.7%) occurred in participants 65 years and older. Crude incidence rates of stroke for participants 65 years and older decreased progressively from 1987 to 2017. Incidence rates, adjusted for age, sex, race/center, and time-varying risk factors, decreased by 32% (95% CI, 23%-40%) per 10 years in participants 65 years and older. Findings were consistent across decades, sex, and race. Conclusions and Relevance: Validated total stroke incidence rates in adults 65 years and older decreased over the last 30 years in the ARIC cohort. The decrease in rates previously reported for 1987 to 2011 extends for the subsequent 6 years in men and women as well as in white and black individuals. ",
        "Association of Restless Legs Syndrome With Risk of Suicide and Self-harm. Importance: Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a common neurologic disorder that has been previously found to be associated with higher odds of suicidal ideation. In the context of the increasing suicide rate in the United States, the evidence regarding the association between RLS and the risk of suicide and self-harm is limited. Objective: To investigate the association between RLS and risk of suicide and self-harm. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study was performed using Truven Health MarketScan national claims data from 2006 to 2014; the baseline data were from 2006 to 2008, and the follow-up data covered 6 years (January 1, 2009, to December 31, 2014). Included were 24\u202f179 nonpregnant participants with RLS and 145\u202f194 age- and sex-matched participants without RLS at baseline (2006-2008), who were free of suicide, self-harm, cardiovascular disease, or cancer at study baseline. Data analysis was performed from February 1, 2018, to January 1, 2019. Exposure: Diagnosis of RLS, as identified by the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision code. Main Outcomes and Measures: Incident suicide and self-harm event, identified by the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision diagnosis code. Results: Among 169\u202f373 participants in the current analysis, the mean (SD) age was 49.4 (9.1) years; 53\u202f426 (31.5%) participants were men. During a mean (SD) follow-up duration of 5.2 (2.2) years, 119 incident suicide and self-harm cases were identified. Individuals with RLS had a higher risk of suicide or self-harm compared with those without RLS (adjusted hazard ratio,\u20092.66; 95% CI, 1.70-4.15), after adjusting for lifestyle factors (eg, alcohol and obesity), presence of chronic diseases (eg, depression, insomnia, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, peripheral neuropathy, iron-deficiency anemia, and Parkinson disease), and use of medications. Excluding those with depression, insomnia, obstructive sleep apnea, and other common chronic conditions, the significant association between RLS and suicide or self-harm persisted (adjusted hazard ratio,\u20094.14; 95% CI, 2.17-7.92). Conclusions and Relevance: Restless legs syndrome was associated with a high risk of suicide and self-harm, and the risk was independent of most identified diseases and conditions. ",
        "Contextual Factors Associated With County-Level Suicide Rates in the United States, 1999 to 2016. Importance: Understanding geographic and community-level factors associated with suicide can inform targeted suicide prevention efforts. Objectives: To estimate suicide rates and trajectories, assess associated county-level contextual factors, and explore variation across the rural-urban continuum. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cross-sectional study included all individuals aged 25 to 64 years who died by suicide from January 1, 1999, to December 31, 2016, in the United States. Spatial analysis was used to map excess risk of suicide, and longitudinal random-effects models using negative binomial regression tested associations of contextual variables with suicide rates as well as interactions among county-level contextual variables. Data analyses were conducted between January 2019 and July 2019. Exposure: County of residence. Main Outcomes and Measures: Three-year county suicide rates during an 18-year period stratified by rural-urban location. Results: Between 1999 and 2016, 453\u202f577 individuals aged 25 to 64 years died by suicide in the United States. Decedents were primarily male (349\u202f082 [77.0%]) with 101\u202f312 (22.3%) aged 25 to 34 years, 120\u202f157 (26.5%) aged 35 to 44 years, 136\u202f377 (30.1%) aged 45 to 54 years, and 95\u202f771 (21.1%) aged 55 to 64 years. Suicide rates were higher and increased more rapidly in rural than in large metropolitan counties. The highest deprivation quartile was associated with higher suicide rates compared with the lowest deprivation quartile, especially in rural areas, although this association declined during the period studied (rural, 1999-2001: incidence rate ratio [IRR], 1.438; 95% CI, 1.319-1.568; P\u2009<\u2009.001; large metropolitan, 1999-2001: 1.208; 95% CI, 1.149-1.270; P\u2009<\u2009.001; rural, 2014-2016: IRR, 1.121; 95% CI, 1.032-1.219; P\u2009=\u2009.01; large metropolitan, 2014-2016: IRR, 0.942; 95% CI, 0.887-1.001; P\u2009=\u2009.06). The presence of more gun shops was associated with an increase in county-level suicide rates in all county types except the most rural (rural: IRR, 1.001; 95% CI, 0.999-1.004; P\u2009=\u2009.40; micropolitan: IRR, 1.005; 95% CI, 1.002-1.007; P\u2009<\u2009.001; small metropolitan: IRR, 1.010; 95% CI, 1.006-1.014; P\u2009<\u2009.001; large metropolitan: IRR, 1.012; 95% CI, 1.006-1.018; P\u2009<\u2009.001). High social capital was associated with lower suicide rates than low social capital (IRR, 0.917; 95% CI, 0.891-0.943; P\u2009<\u2009.001). High social fragmentation, an increasing percentage of the population without health insurance, and an increasing percentage of veterans in a county were associated with higher suicide rates (high social fragmentation: IRR, 1.077; 95% CI, 1.050-1.103; P\u2009<\u2009.001; percentage of population without health insurance: IRR, 1.005; 95% CI, 1.004-1.006; P\u2009<\u2009.001; percentage of veterans: IRR, 1.025; 95% CI, 1.021-1.028; P\u2009<\u2009.001). Conclusions and Relevance: This study found that suicide rates have increased across the nation and most rapidly in rural counties, which may be more sensitive to the impact of social deprivation than more metropolitan counties. Improving social connectedness, civic opportunities, and health insurance coverage as well as limiting access to lethal means have the potential to reduce suicide rates across the rural-urban continuum.

        "Perceptions of Surgery Residents About Parental Leave During Training. Importance: To our knowledge, there has been little research conducted on the attitudes of residents toward their pregnant peers and parental leave. Objective: To examine the perceptions of current surgery residents regarding parental leave. Design, Setting, and Participants: A 36-item survey was distributed to current US general surgery residents and residents in surgical subspecialties through the Association of Program Directors in Surgery listserv and social media platforms. Questions were associated with general information/demographics, parental leave, having children, and respondents' knowledge regarding the current parental leave policy as set by the American Board of Surgery. The study was conducted from August to September 2018 and the data were analyzed in October 2018. Main Outcomes and Measures: Main outcomes included the attitudes of residents toward pregnancy and parental leave, parental leave policy, and the association of parental leave with residency programs. Results: A total of 2188 completed responses were obtained; of these, 1049 (50.2%) were women, 1572 (75.8%) were white, 164 (7.9%) were Hispanic/Latinx, 75 (3.6%) were African American, 2 (0.1%) were American Indian or Alaskan Native, 263 (12.7%) were Asian, and 5 (0.2%) were Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander. From the number of residents who had/were expecting children (581 [28.6%]), 474 (81.6%) had or were going to have a child during the clinical years of residency. Many residents (247 [42.5%]) took fewer than 2 weeks of parental leave. Many residents did not feel supported in taking parental leave (177 [30.4%] did not feel supported by other residents and 190 [32.71%] did not feel supported by the faculty). Only 83 respondents (3.8%%) correctly identified the current American Board of Surgery parental leave policy. Residents who took parental leave identified a lack of a universal leave policy, strain on the residency program, a loss of education/training time, a lack of flexibility of programs, and a perceived or actual lack of support from faculty/peers as the top 5 biggest obstacles to taking leave during the clinical years of residency. Conclusions and Relevance: Most of the modifiable factors that inhibit residents from having children during residency are associated with policies (eg, a lack of universal leave policy and lack of flexibility) and personnel (eg, a strain on the residency program and lack of support from peers/faculty). These data suggest that policies at the level of the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education or Resident Review Committee (RRC), as well as education and the normalization of pregnancy during training, may be effective interventions.

        "Association of Accelerometer-Measured Light-Intensity Physical Activity With Brain Volume: The Framingham Heart Study. Importance: Dementia risk may be attenuated by physical activity (PA); however, the specific activity levels optimal for dementia prevention are unclear. Moreover, most older adults are unable to meet the nationally recommended PA guidelines, set at 150 minutes of moderate to vigorous PA per week. Objective: To assess the association of total steps walked per day and total dose (intensity\u2009\u00d7\u2009duration) of PA with brain volumes on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) among Framingham Heart Study participants. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cross-sectional, community-based cohort study of the association of accelerometry-determined PA with brain MRI measures in Framingham, Massachusetts, included the Framingham Heart Study third-generation (examination 2, 2008-2011) and offspring (examination 9, 2011-2014) cohorts. Of 4021 participants who agreed to wear an accelerometer and had valid data (\u226510 hours/day for \u22653 days), 1667 participants who did not undergo brain MRI (n\u2009=\u20091604) or had prevalent dementia or stroke (n\u2009=\u200963) were excluded. Data analysis began in 2016 and was completed in February 2019. Exposures: Physical activity achieved using accelerometry-derived total activity (steps per day) and 2 intensity levels (light intensity and moderate to vigorous intensity). Main Outcomes and Measures: Differences in total brain volume and other MRI markers of brain aging. Results: The study sample of 2354 participants had a mean (SD) age of 53 (13) years, 1276 (54.2%) were women, and 1099 (46.7%) met the PA guidelines. Incremental light-intensity PA was associated with higher total brain volume; each additional hour of light-intensity PA was associated with approximately 1.1 years less brain aging (\u03b2 estimate, 0.22; SD, 0.07; P\u2009=\u2009.003). Among individuals not meeting the PA guidelines, each hour of light-intensity PA (\u03b2 estimate, 0.28; SD, 0.11; P\u2009=\u2009.01) and achieving 7500 steps or more per day (\u03b2 estimate, 0.44; SD, 0.18; P\u2009=\u2009.02) were associated with higher total brain volume, equivalent to approximately 1.4 to 2.2 years less brain aging. After adjusting for light-intensity PA, neither increasing moderate to vigorous PA levels nor meeting the threshold moderate to vigorous PA level recommended by the PA guidelines were significantly associated with total brain volume. Conclusions and Relevance: Every additional hour of light-intensity PA was associated with higher brain volumes, even among individuals not meeting current PA guidelines. These data are consistent with the notion that the potential benefits of PA on brain aging may accrue at a lower, more achievable level of intensity or duration. ",
        "Association of Number of Indoor Tanning Salons With Neighborhoods With Higher Concentrations of Male-Male Partnered Households. Importance: Both indoor tanning and skin cancer are more common among sexual-minority men, defined as gay and bisexual men, than among heterosexual men. Convenient access to indoor tanning salons may influence use patterns. Objective: To investigate whether indoor tanning salons are disproportionately located in areas with higher concentrations of gay men. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cross-sectional study used geographic information systems to integrate census data and business location data obtained from ArcGIS and Google Maps for the 10 US cities with the largest lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender populations in 2010, ie, Los Angeles, California; Chicago, Illinois; San Francisco, California; Seattle, Washington; San Diego, California; Dallas, Texas; Phoenix, Arizona; Washington, DC; Portland, Oregon; and Denver, Colorado. The association of indoor tanning salon locations with proportions of gay men, using the concentration of male-male partnered households as a proxy measure for the latter, was examined. Data analysis was performed in October 2018. Exposures: Census tracts with at least 1%, 5%, or 10% male-male partnered households, adjusting for median household income, percentage young women, and percentage non-Hispanic white residents. Main Outcomes and Measures: Presence of 1 or more indoor tanning salons within census tracts. Results: Across the 10 cities and 4091 census tracts in this study, there were 482\u202f823 unmarried partnered households, of which 35\u202f164 (7.3%) were male-male. The median (interquartile range) percentage of male-male partnered households per census tract was 0% (0%-10.6%). Odds of indoor tanning salon presence in areas with at least 10% male-male households were more than twice those of areas with less than 10% male-male households (odds ratio, 2.17; 95% CI, 1.59-2.97). When sensitivity analyses using a 1-mile euclidian buffer around each tanning salon were conducted, this association remained significant (odds ratio, 2.48; 95% CI, 2.14-2.88). After adjusting for median household income, percentage young women, and percentage non-Hispanic white residents, the odds of an indoor tanning salon being within 1 mile of a census tract with at least 10% male-male households remained twice that of census tracts with less than 10% male-male households (odds ratio, 2.00; 95% CI, 1.71-2.35). Conclusions and Relevance: In this study, indoor tanning salons were more likely to be located near neighborhoods with higher concentrations of male-male partnered households, possibly contributing to the disproportionate use of indoor tanning by sexual-minority men.

        "Prevalence of Sexual Initiation Before Age 13 Years Among Male Adolescents and Young Adults in the United States. Importance: Despite similar sexual activity rates among male and female adolescents, males are more likely to have their first sexual intercourse before age 13 years. The developmental needs and pathways to healthy trajectories for young males remain unknown. Objective: To examine the prevalence of sexual intercourse before age 13 years among male adolescents; the variation by race/ethnicity, location, and maternal educational level; and the wantedness of this first sexual experience. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cross-sectional analysis was conducted from September 2017 to June 2018, using pooled 2011, 2013, and 2015 data from the school-based Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (YRBSS) and the 2006 to 2015 data of males aged 15 to 24 years from the household-based National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG). The percentage of males reporting sexual onset before age 13 years was estimated using survey-weighted logistic regression to test for differences by race/ethnicity within each national survey and within metropolitan areas (for YRBSS, high school and middle school samples). Among NSFG survey respondents, differences in wantedness of first sexual intercourse by age at first sexual intercourse were examined, along with the associations between sexual initiation and socioeconomic covariates. Main Outcomes and Measures: Sexual onset before age 13 years. Results: Data from a total of 19\u202f916 male high school students (from YRBSS) and 7739 males aged 15 to 24 years (from NSFG) were included in the analysis. The sample was largely composed of non-Hispanic white males: 8789 (57.1%) from the YRBSS and 3737 (58.0%) from the NSFG. Sexual onset before age 13 years was reported nationally by 7.6% (95% CI, 6.8%-8.4%) of male high school students and 3.6% (95% CI, 3.0%-4.2%) of males aged 15 to 24 years. The proportion of male students who reported having sexual intercourse before age 13 years varied across metropolitan sites, from 5% (95% CI, 4%-7%) in San Francisco, California, to 25% (95% CI, 23%-28%) in Memphis, Tennessee, with elevated rates among non-Hispanic black and Hispanic males in most metropolitan areas. In the NSFG data set, respondents whose mothers had a college degree or higher educational level were statistically significantly less likely (OR,\u20090.31; 95% CI, 0.19-0.49) to report having sexual intercourse before age 13 years compared with those whose mothers did not have a college degree. Among males who reported having their first sexual experience before age 13 years, 8.5% (95% CI, 3.8%-17.8%) described their first sexual intercourse as unwanted. Conclusions and Relevance: Rates of sexual onset before age 13 years among young males varied by race/ethnicity, location, and maternal educational level, presenting important implications for the provision of early, inclusive, and comprehensive sex education and sexual and reproductive health care to male children and adolescents.

        "Associations of Parental Marijuana Use With Offspring Marijuana, Tobacco, and Alcohol Use and Opioid Misuse. Importance: Marijuana use is increasing among adults and often co-occurs with other substance use; therefore, it is important to examine whether parental marijuana use is associated with elevated risk of substance use among offspring living in the same household. Objective: To examine associations of parental marijuana use with offspring marijuana, tobacco, and alcohol use and opioid misuse. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cross-sectional study used survey data from the 2015 through 2018 National Surveys on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH), which provide nationally representative data on adolescents or young adults living with a parent (the mother or the father). Annual average percentages were based on survey sampling weights. Final analyses were conducted September 21 through 23, 2019. Exposures: Parental marijuana use status. Main Outcomes and Measures: Offspring self-reported use of marijuana, tobacco, or alcohol or misuse of opioids. Results: Survey respondents included 24\u202f900 father-offspring or mother-offspring dyads sampled from the same household. Among mothers living with adolescent offspring, 8.2% (95% CI, 7.3%-9.2%) had past-year marijuana use, while 7.6% (95% CI, 6.2%-9.2%) of mothers living with young adult offspring had past-year marijuana use. Among fathers living with adolescent offspring, 9.6% (95% CI, 8.5%-10.8%) had past-year marijuana use, and 9.0% (95% CI, 7.4%-10.9%) of fathers living with young adult offspring had past-year marijuana use. Compared with adolescents whose mothers never used marijuana, adjusted relative risk (ARR) of past-year marijuana use was higher among those whose mothers had lifetime (without past-year) marijuana use (ARR, 1.3; 95% CI, 1.1-1.6; P\u2009=\u2009.007), less than 52 days of past-year marijuana use (ARR, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.1-2.7; P\u2009=\u2009.02), or 52 days or more of past-year marijuana use (ARR, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.1-2.2; P\u2009=\u2009.02). Compared with young adults whose mothers never used marijuana, adjusted risk of past-year marijuana use was higher among those whose mothers had lifetime (without past-year) marijuana use (ARR, 1.4; 95% CI, 1.1-1.7; P\u2009=\u2009.001), less than 52 days of past-year marijuana use (ARR, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.0-2.3; P\u2009=\u2009.049), or 52 days or more of past-year marijuana use (ARR, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.3-2.5; P\u2009=\u2009.002). Compared with adolescents whose fathers never used marijuana, adolescents whose fathers had less than 52 days of past-year marijuana use were more likely to use marijuana (ARR, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.2-2.7; P\u2009=\u2009.006). Compared with young adults whose fathers never used marijuana, young adults whose fathers had 52 days or more of past-year marijuana use were more likely to use marijuana (ARR, 2.1; 95% CI, 1.6-2.9; P\u2009<\u2009.001). Compared with their peers whose parents never used marijuana and after adjusting for covariates, the adjusted risk of past-year tobacco use was higher among adolescents whose mothers had lifetime marijuana use (ARR, 1.3; 95% CI, 1.0-1.6; P\u2009=\u2009.03), less than 52 days of past-year marijuana use (ARR, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.0-2.1; P\u2009=\u2009.04), or 52 days or more of past-year marijuana use (ARR, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.1-2.3; P\u2009=\u2009.03); adolescents whose fathers had lifetime marijuana use (ARR, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.1-1.9; P\u2009=\u2009.004) or 52 days or more of past-year marijuana use (ARR, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.2-2.7; P\u2009=\u2009.006); young adults whose mothers had lifetime marijuana use (ARR, 1.2; 95% CI, 1.0-1.4; P\u2009=\u2009.04); and young adults whose fathers had 52 days or more of past-year marijuana use (ARR, 1.4; 95% CI, 1.0-1.9; P\u2009=\u2009.046). Compared with their peers whose parents had no past marijuana use and after adjusting for covariates, risk of past-year alcohol use was higher among adolescents whose mothers had lifetime marijuana use (ARR, 1.2; 95% CI, 1.1-1.4; P\u2009=\u2009.004), less than 52 days of past-year marijuana use (ARR, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.2-1.9; P\u2009=\u2009.002), or 52 days or more of past-year marijuana use (ARR, 1.3; 95% CI, 1.0-1.7; P\u2009=\u2009.04). After adjusting for covariates, parental marijuana use was not associated with opioid misuse by offspring. Conclusions and Relevance: In this cross-sectional study, parental marijuana use was associated with increased risk of substance use among adolescent and young adult offspring living in the same household. Screening household members for substance use and counseling parents on risks posed by current and past marijuana use are warranted. ",
        "Association of Adolescent Hypertension With Future End-stage Renal Disease. Importance: Hypertension is a leading risk factor of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. The role of nonmalignant hypertension as the sole initiating factor of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in non-African American populations has recently been questioned. Objective: To investigate the association between hypertension and future ESRD in otherwise healthy adolescents. Design, Setting, and Participants: This retrospective cohort study examined the data of 16- to 19-year-old healthy candidates for military service in the Israel Defense Forces between January 1, 1967, and December 31, 2013. Data were obtained from the central conscription registry of the Israel Defense Forces and the ESRD registry of the Israel Ministry of Health. Participants underwent a comprehensive medical assessment prior to their military service. Individuals with evidence of renal damage or kidney-related risk factors were excluded. The data analysis was conducted from February 12, 2017, to October 16, 2018. Main Outcomes and Measures: End-stage renal disease as recorded by the Israeli ESRD registry, including hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis, renal transplant diagnosed between January 1, 1990, and December 31, 2014. Results: The cohort included 2\u202f658\u202f238 adolescents (1 596 709 [60.1%] male with a mean [SD] age of 17.4 [0.5] years), of whom 7997 (0.3%) had an established hypertension diagnosis. Half of the individuals in the hypertensive group were overweight (1559 [20.1%]) or obese (2243 [28.9%]), and most (7235 [90.5%]) were male. During a median follow-up of 19.6 years (52\u202f287\u202f945 person-years), 2189 individuals developed ESRD, with an incidence rate of 3.9 per 100\u202f000 person-years. Adolescent hypertension was found to be associated with future ESRD (crude hazard ratio [HR], 5.07; 95% CI, 3.73-6.88). In a multivariable model adjusted for sex, age, years of education, body mass index, and other sociodemographic variables, the HR was 1.98 (95% CI, 1.42-2.77). When excluding participants with severe hypertension, the association with ESRD remained statistically significant (HR, 1.93; 95% CI, 1.37-2.70). In the subanalysis of nonoverweight adolescents, the association between hypertension and ESRD was statistically significant as well (HR, 2.11; 95% CI, 1.05-4.24). Conclusions and Relevance: Hypertension appears to be associated with a doubling of the risk of future ESRD in an otherwise healthy adolescent population. ",
        "Association of Sexting With Sexual Behaviors and Mental Health Among Adolescents: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis. Importance: Sexting is the exchange of sexual messages, photographs, or videos via technological devices and is common and increasing among youth. Although various studies have examined the association between sexting, sexual behaviors, and mental health, results are mixed. Objective: To provide a meta-analytic synthesis of studies examining the associations between sexting, sexual behavior, and mental health using sex, age, publication date, and study methodological quality as moderators. Data Sources: Electronic searches were conducted in April 2018 in MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Embase, and Web of Science, yielding 1672 nonduplicate records. Study Selection: Studies were included if participants were younger than 18 years and an association between sexting and sexual behaviors or mental health risk factors was examined. Data Extraction and Synthesis: All relevant data were extracted by 2 independent reviewers. Random-effects meta-analyses were used to derive odds ratios (ORs). Main Outcomes and Measures: Sexual behavior (sexual activity, multiple sexual partners, lack of contraception use) and mental health risk factors (anxiety/depression, delinquent behavior, and alcohol, drug use, and smoking). Results: Participants totaled 41\u202f723 from 23 included studies. The mean (range) age was 14.9 (11.9-16.8) years, and 21\u202f717 (52.1%) were female. Significant associations were observed between sexting and sexual activity (16 studies; OR, 3.66; 95% CI, 2.71-4.92), multiple sexual partners (5 studies; OR, 5.37; 95% CI, 2.72-12.67), lack of contraception use (6 studies; OR, 2.16; 95% CI, 1.08-4.32), delinquent behavior (3 studies; OR, 2.50; 95% CI, 1.29-4.86), anxiety/depression (7 studies; OR, 1.79; 95% CI, 1.41-2.28), alcohol use (8 studies; OR, 3.78; 95% CI, 3.11-4.59), drug use (5 studies; OR, 3.48; 95% CI, 2.24-5.40), and smoking behavior (4 studies; OR, 2.66; 95% CI, 1.88-3.76). Moderator analyses revealed that associations between sexting, sexual behavior, and mental health factors were stronger in younger compared to older adolescents. Conclusions and Relevance: Results of this meta-analysis suggest that sexting is associated with sexual behavior and mental health difficulties, especially in younger adolescents. Longitudinal research is needed to assess directionality of effects and to analyze the mechanisms by which sexting and its correlates are related. Educational campaigns to raise awareness of digital health, safety, and security are needed to help youth navigate their personal, social, and sexual development in a technological world. ",
        "Condom Use With Long-Acting Reversible Contraception vs Non-Long-Acting Reversible Contraception Hormonal Methods Among Postpartum Adolescents. Importance: Increased use of long-acting reversible contraception (LARC; intrauterine devices [IUDs] and implants) has likely contributed to declining US teenage pregnancy and birth rates, yet sexually transmitted infection (STI) rates among teenagers remain high. While LARC methods are highly effective for pregnancy prevention, they, as with all nonbarrier methods, do not protect against STIs, including HIV. Studies of the general adolescent population suggest condom use is lower among LARC vs non-LARC hormonal methods users (birth control pill, contraceptive patch, vaginal ring, or injection). Despite the high use of LARC among postpartum teenagers, no studies have examined whether condom use differs by contraceptive method in this population. Objective: To compare condom use among sexually active postpartum teenagers using LARC vs those using non-LARC hormonal methods. Design, Setting, and Participants: Cross-sectional analysis using 2012 to 2015 data from the Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS), a multisite and population-based surveillance system that collects data on maternal attitudes, behaviors, and experiences before, during, and shortly after pregnancy. We used data from 37 sites. Using multivariable survey-weighted logistic regression, we assessed the association of condom use by contraceptive methods. Participants were teenage mothers (\u226419 years) with a recent live birth reporting LARC or non-LARC hormonal method use. Data were analyzed between March 2018 and April 2018. Main Outcomes and Measures: Condom use with LARC vs condom use with non-LARC hormonal methods. Results: Among the 5480 (weighted N\u2009=\u2009245\u202f847) postpartum teenage mothers in our sample, most were aged 18 to 19 years, unmarried, had current Medicaid coverage, were first-time mothers, had reported their pregnancy was unintended, and almost half were non-Hispanic white. Overall, condom use was reported by 28.8% of these teenagers. Users of LARC compared with non-LARC hormonal methods were half as likely to use condoms (17.8% vs 35.6%; adjusted prevalence ratio [aPR], 0.50; 95% CI, 0.41-0.60). Users of IUDs (15.1%) were less likely to report condom use than those using an implant (21.5%; aPR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.51-0.98), patch, ring, or injection users (24.9%; aPR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.47-0.79), and pill users (47.2%; aPR, 0.32; 95% CI, 0.25-0.40). Conclusions and Relevance: Self-reported condom use was low overall among postpartum teenage mothers and lower among users of LARC vs non-LARC hormonal methods. Given the high rates of STIs among teenage mothers combined with higher use of LARC among postpartum teenaged mothers, interventions to promote condom use for STI/HIV prevention during the postpartum period are critically important.

        "Trends in Suicide Among Youth Aged 10 to 19 Years in the United States, 1975 to 2016. Importance: Suicide is a leading cause of death among youth aged 10 to 19 years in the United States, with rates traditionally higher in male than in female youth. Recent national mortality data suggest this gap may be narrowing, which warrants investigation. Objective: To investigate trends in suicide rates among US youth aged 10 to 19 years by age group, sex, race/ethnicity, and method of suicide. Design, Setting, and Participants: Cross-sectional study using period trend analysis of US suicide decedents aged 10 to 19 years from January 1, 1975, to December 31, 2016. Data were analyzed for periods defined by statistically significant changes in suicide rate trends. Suicide rates were calculated using population estimates. Main Outcomes and Measures: Period trends in suicide rates by sex and age group were assessed using joinpoint regression. Incidence rate ratios (IRRs) were estimated using negative binomial regression comparing male and female suicide rates within periods. Results: From 1975 to 2016, we identified 85\u202f051 youth suicide deaths in the United States (68\u202f085 male [80.1%] and 16\u202f966 female [19.9%]) with a male to female IRR of 3.82 (95% CI, 3.35-4.35). Following a downward trend until 2007, suicide rates for female youth showed the largest significant percentage increase compared with male youth (12.7% vs 7.1% for individuals aged 10-14 years; 7.9% vs 3.5% for individuals aged 15-19 years). The male to female IRR decreased significantly across the study period for youth aged 10 to 14 years (3.14 [95% CI, 2.74-3.61] to 1.80 [95% CI, 1.53-2.12]) and 15 to 19 years (4.15 [95% CI, 3.79-4.54] to 3.31 [95% CI, 2.96-3.69]). Significant declining trends in the male to female IRR were found in non-Hispanic white youth aged 10 to 14 years (3.27 [95% CI, 2.68-4.00] to 2.04 [95% CI, 1.45-2.89]) and non-Hispanic youth of other races aged 15 to 19 years (4.02 [95% CI, 3.29-4.92] to 2.35 [95% CI, 2.00-2.76]). The male to female IRR for firearms increased significantly for youth aged 15 to 19 years (\u03c72\u2009=\u20097.74; P\u2009=\u2009.02 for sex \u00d7 period interaction). The male to female IRR of suicide by hanging or suffocation decreased significantly for both age groups (10-14 years: \u03c72\u2009=\u200988.83; P\u2009<\u2009.001 for sex \u00d7 period interaction and 15-19 years: \u03c72\u2009=\u200982.15; P\u2009<\u2009.001 for sex \u00d7 period interaction). No significant change was found in the male to female IRR of suicide by poisoning across the study period. Conclusions and Relevance: A significant reduction in the historically large gap in youth suicide rates between male and female individuals underscores the importance of interventions that consider unique differences by sex. Future research examining sex-specific factors associated with youth suicide is warranted. ",
        "Associations of Fish Oil Supplement Use With Testicular Function in Young Men. Importance: Many young men have poor semen quality, and the causes are often unknown. Supplement intake of \u03c9-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid has been found to improve semen quality among men with infertility, but the association with semen quality among healthy men is unknown. Objective: To determine if intake of \u03c9-3 fatty acid supplements is associated with testicular function as measured by semen quality and reproductive hormone levels among healthy men. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cross-sectional study included young Danish men from the general population recruited between January 1, 2012, and December 31, 2017, at compulsory examinations to determine their fitness for military service. Young unselected men were approached after the examination and invited to participate in a study of reproductive function, regardless of their fitness for military service. Data analysis was conducted from September 1, 2018, to June 30, 2019. Exposures: Intake of supplements, including fish oil, during the past 3 months. Main Outcomes and Measures: Semen quality, measured as volume, concentration, total sperm count, percentage of morphologically normal spermatozoa, and motility, and serum reproductive hormone levels, measured as follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, testosterone, free testosterone, and inhibin B levels. Results: Among 1679 young Danish men (median [interquartile range] age, 18.9 [18.7-19.4] years) recruited to participate, 98 men (5.8%) reported use of fish oil supplements during the past 3 months, of whom 53 (54.1%) reported intake on 60 or more days. After adjustment and compared with men with no supplement intake, men with fish oil supplement intake on fewer than 60 days had semen volume that was 0.38 (95% CI, -0.03 to 0.80) mL higher, and men with fish oil supplement intake on 60 or more days had semen volume that was 0.64 (95% CI, 0.15 to 1.12) mL higher (P for trend\u2009<\u2009.001). Similarly, testicular size in men with supplement intake on fewer than 60 days was 0.8 (95% CI, -0.2 to 1.9) mL larger and in men with fish oil supplement intake on 60 or more days was 1.5 (95% CI, 0.2 to 2.8) mL larger compared with men with no supplement intake (P for trend\u2009=\u2009.007). After adjustment, men with fish oil supplement intake had a 20% (95% CI, 9%-31%) lower follicle-stimulating hormone level and 16% (95% CI, 8%-24%) lower luteinizing hormone level compared with men with no supplement intake. There were no associations of intake of other supplements with measures of testicular function. Conclusions and Relevance: These findings suggest that intake of fish oil supplements was associated with better testicular function, which is less likely to be due to confounding by indication, as no associations of intake of other supplements with testicular function were found. This cross-sectional study did not examine the actual content of \u03c9-3 fatty acids in the supplements; therefore, these findings need confirmation in well-designed randomized clinical trials among unselected men.

        "Exposure to Court-Ordered Tobacco Industry Antismoking Advertisements Among US Adults. Importance: In 2006, US District Judge Gladys Kessler ordered tobacco companies to make corrective statements through paid advertisements informing the public of their deceptive practices. This landmark ruling and its subsequent execution represent the first time the tobacco industry sponsored a nationwide corrective advertising campaign against its own products. Objective: To assess the reach of the court-ordered antismoking advertisements within the US adult population, stratified by demographic characteristics and tobacco use. Design, Setting, and Participants: This nationally representative, population-based cross-sectional survey of US adults included respondents to the 2018 Health Information National Trends Survey 5, Cycle 2. Respondents were representatives of households selected by equal-probability sampling of the Marketing Systems Group database of addresses that included all nonvacant US residential addresses. Data collection was conducted from January to May 2018, and analysis took place from December 2018 to April 2019. Main Outcomes and Measures: Self-reported exposure to court-ordered antismoking advertisements. Results: The overall sample of 3484 respondents included 2054 women (weighted percentage, 50.8%), 1976 non-Hispanic white respondents (weighted percentage, 59.9%), 2952 respondents who lived in urban US areas (weighted percentage, 84.9%), and 450 current smokers (weighted percentage, 15.6%). Estimated exposure to court-ordered antismoking advertisements was 40.6% (95% CI, 37.5%-43.7%) among the full sample and 50.5% (95% CI, 41.4%-59.6%) among current smokers. Exposure was lowest among those aged 18 to 34 years (37.4%; 95% CI, 28.0%-46.8%), those with a high school education or less (34.5%; 95% CI, 29.3%-39.8%), and those with household annual income less than $35 000 (37.5%; 95% CI, 32.0%-42.9%). Among current smokers, Hispanic respondents had lower exposure rates (42.2%; 95% CI, 18.5%-65.9%) than non-Hispanic white respondents (51.7%; 95% CI, 40.4%-63.1%). As the advertising campaign's duration increased, exposure rates increased. Individuals with a high school education or less had lower odds of antismoking advertisement exposure than those with college or postgraduate degrees (adjusted odds ratio, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.48-0.94). Current smokers had higher odds of exposure than never smokers (adjusted odds ratio, 1.81; 95% CI, 1.17-2.80). Among those exposed to antismoking advertisements, 70.5% saw multiple antismoking messages. Conclusions and Relevance: Approximately 1 of 2 smokers reported exposure to the federal court-ordered antismoking advertisements. However, exposure was relatively lower among several subgroups, including individuals aged 18 to 34 years, only one-third of whom reported exposure. Increasing the duration of antismoking advertisements as well as expanding their coverage to youth-oriented media may increase their potential public health impact. ",
        "Risk Assessment, Genetic Counseling, and Genetic Testing for BRCA-Related Cancer in Women: Updated Evidence Report and Systematic Review for the US Preventive Services Task Force. Importance: Pathogenic mutations in breast cancer susceptibility genes BRCA1 and BRCA2 increase risks for breast, ovarian, fallopian tube, and peritoneal cancer in women; interventions reduce risk in mutation carriers. Objective: To update the 2013 US Preventive Services Task Force review on benefits and harms of risk assessment, genetic counseling, and genetic testing for BRCA1/2-related cancer in women. Data Sources: Cochrane libraries; MEDLINE, PsycINFO, EMBASE (January 1, 2013, to March 6, 2019, for updates; January 1, 1994, to March 6, 2019, for new key questions and populations); reference lists. Study Selection: Discriminatory accuracy studies, randomized clinical trials (RCTs), and observational studies of women without recently diagnosed BRCA1/2-related cancer. Data Extraction and Synthesis: Data on study methods, setting, population characteristics, eligibility criteria, interventions, numbers enrolled and lost to follow-up, outcome ascertainment, and results were abstracted. Two reviewers independently assessed study quality. Main Outcomes and Measures: Cancer incidence and mortality; discriminatory accuracy of risk assessment tools for BRCA1/2 mutations; benefits and harms of risk assessment, genetic counseling, genetic testing, and risk-reducing interventions. Results: For this review, 103 studies (110 articles; N\u2009=\u200992\u202f712) were included. No studies evaluated the effectiveness of risk assessment, genetic counseling, and genetic testing in reducing incidence and mortality of BRCA1/2-related cancer. Fourteen studies (n\u2009=\u200943\u202f813) of 8 risk assessment tools to guide referrals to genetic counseling demonstrated moderate to high accuracy (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.68-0.96). Twenty-eight studies (n\u2009=\u20098060) indicated that genetic counseling was associated with reduced breast cancer worry, anxiety, and depression; increased understanding of risk; and decreased intention for testing. Twenty studies (n\u2009=\u20094322) showed that breast cancer worry and anxiety were higher after testing for women with positive results and lower for others; understanding of risk was higher after testing. In 8 RCTs (n\u2009=\u200954\u202f651), tamoxifen (relative risk [RR], 0.69 [95% CI, 0.59-0.84]; 4 trials), raloxifene (RR, 0.44 [95% CI, 0.24-0.80]; 2 trials), and aromatase inhibitors (RR, 0.45 [95% CI, 0.26-0.70]; 2 trials) were associated with lower risks of invasive breast cancer compared with placebo; results were not specific to mutation carriers. Mastectomy was associated with 90% to 100% reduction in breast cancer incidence (6 studies; n\u2009=\u20092546) and 81% to 100% reduction in breast cancer mortality (1 study; n\u2009=\u2009639); oophorectomy was associated with 69% to 100% reduction in ovarian cancer (2 studies; n\u2009=\u20092108); complications were common with mastectomy. Conclusions and Relevance: Among women without recently diagnosed BRCA1/2-related cancer, the benefits and harms of risk assessment, genetic counseling, and genetic testing to reduce cancer incidence and mortality have not been directly evaluated by current research.

        "Parent-Toddler Social Reciprocity During Reading From Electronic Tablets vs Print Books. Importance: Although the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends parent-child joint engagement with digital media, recent evidence suggests this may be challenging when tablets contain interactive enhancements. Objective: To examine parent-toddler social reciprocity while reading enhanced (eg, with sound effects, animation) and basic tablet-based books compared with print books. Design, Setting, and Participants: This within-participants comparison included 37 parent-toddler dyads in a counterbalanced crossover, video-recorded laboratory design at the University of Michigan from May 31 to November 7, 2017. The volunteer sample was recruited from an online research registry and community sites. Dyads included children aged 24 to 36 months with no developmental delay or serious medical condition, parents who were the legal guardians and read English sufficiently for consent, and parents and children without uncorrected hearing or vision impairments. Data were analyzed from October 18, 2017, through April 30, 2018. Exposures: Reading an enhanced tablet-based book, a basic tablet-based book, and a print book in counterbalanced order for 5 minutes each. Main Outcomes and Measures: Video recordings were coded continuously for nonverbal aspects of parent-toddler social reciprocity, including body position (child body posture limiting parental book access coded in 10-second intervals), control behaviors (child closing the book, child grabbing the book or tablet, parent or child pivoting their body away from the other), and intrusive behaviors (parent or child pushing the other's hand away). Coding intracorrelation coefficients were greater than 0.75. Poisson regression was used to compare each outcome by book format. Results: Among the 37 parent-child dyads, mean (SD) parent age was 33.5 (4.0) years; 30 (81%) were mothers, and 28 (76%) had a 4-year college degree or greater educational attainment. Mean (SD) age of children was 29.2 (4.2) months, 20 (54%) were boys, 21 (57%) were white non-Hispanic, and 6 (16%) were black non-Hispanic. Compared with print books, greater frequency of child body posture limiting parental book access (mean [SD], 7.9 [1.9; P\u2009=\u2009.01] for enhanced; 8.4 [1.8; P\u2009=\u2009.006] for basic), child closing the book (mean [SD], 1.2 [0.4; P\u2009=\u2009.007] for enhanced; 1.2 [0.5; P\u2009<\u2009.001] for basic), parent pivoting (mean [SD], 0.4 [0.2; P\u2009=\u2009.05] for enhanced; 0.9 [0.4; P\u2009=\u2009.004] for basic), child pushing parent's hand (mean [SD], 0.6 [0.2; P\u2009<\u2009.001] for enhanced; 0.4 [0.2; P\u2009=\u2009.002] for basic), and parent pushing child's hand (mean [SD], 1.7 [0.3; P\u2009<\u2009.001] for enhanced; 2.4 [0.5; P\u2009<\u2009.001] for basic) occurred while reading enhanced and basic tablet-based books. Child pivots occurred more frequently while reading basic tablet-based books than print (mean [SD], 1.0 [0.3] vs 0.3 [0.1]; P\u2009=\u2009.005). Conclusions and Relevance: In this study, toddlers and parents engaged in more frequent social control behaviors and less social reciprocity when reading tablet-based vs print books. These findings suggest that toddlers may have difficulty engaging in shared tablet experiences with their parents. ",
        "Effect of Increased Daily Water Intake in Premenopausal Women With Recurrent Urinary Tract Infections: A Randomized Clinical Trial. Importance: Increased hydration is often recommended as a preventive measure for women with recurrent cystitis, but supportive data are sparse. Objective: To assess the efficacy of increased daily water intake on the frequency of recurrent cystitis in premenopausal women. Design, Setting, and Participants: Randomized, open-label, controlled, 12-month trial at a clinical research center (years 2013-2016). Among 163 healthy women with recurrent cystitis (\u22653 episodes in past year) drinking less than 1.5 L of fluid daily assessed for eligibility, 23 were excluded and 140 assigned to water or control group. Assessments of daily fluid intake, urinary hydration, and cystitis symptoms were performed at baseline, 6- and 12-month visits, and monthly telephone calls. Interventions: Participants were randomly assigned to drink, in addition to their usual fluid intake, 1.5 L of water daily (water group) or no additional fluids (control group) for 12 months. Main Outcomes and Measures: Primary outcome measure was frequency of recurrent cystitis over 12 months. Secondary outcomes were number of antimicrobial regimens used, mean time interval between cystitis episodes, and 24-hour urinary hydration measurements. Results: The mean (SD) age of the 140 participants was 35.7 (8.4) years, and the mean (SD) number of cystitis episodes in the previous year was 3.3 (0.6). During the 12-month study period, the mean (SD) number of cystitis episodes was 1.7 (95% CI, 1.5-1.8) in the water group compared with 3.2 (95% CI, 3.0-3.4) in the control group, with a difference in means of 1.5 (95% CI, 1.2-1.8; P\u2009<\u2009.001). Overall, there were 327 cystitis episodes, 111 in the water group and 216 in the control group. The mean number of antimicrobial regimens used to treat cystitis episodes was 1.9 (95% CI, 1.7-2.2) and 3.6 (95% CI, 3.3-4.0), respectively, with a difference in means of 1.7 (95% CI, 1.3-2.1; P\u2009<\u2009.001). The mean time interval between cystitis episodes was 142.8 (95% CI, 127.4-160.1) and 84.4 (95% CI, 75.4-94.5) days, respectively, with a difference in means of 58.4 (95% CI, 39.4-77.4; P\u2009<\u2009.001). Between baseline and 12 months, participants in the water group, compared with those in the control group, had increased mean (SD) urine volume (1.4 [0.04] vs 0.1 [0.04] L; P\u2009<\u2009.001) and voids (2.4 [0.2] vs -0.1 [0.2]; P\u2009<\u2009.001) and decreased urine osmolality (-402.8 [19.6] vs -24.0 [19.5] mOsm/kg; P\u2009<\u2009.001). Conclusions and Relevance: Increased water intake is an effective antimicrobial-sparing strategy to prevent recurrent cystitis in premenopausal women at high risk for recurrence who drink low volumes of fluid daily.

        "Association of Cardiac Rehabilitation With Decreased Hospitalization and Mortality Risk After Cardiac Valve Surgery. Importance: National guidelines recommend cardiac rehabilitation (CR) after cardiac valve surgery, and CR is covered by Medicare for this indication. However, few data exist regarding current CR enrollment after valve surgery. Objective: To characterize CR enrollment after cardiac valve surgery and its association with outcomes, including hospitalizations and mortality. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study of patients undergoing valve surgery was conducted in calendar year 2014, with follow-up through 2015. The study included all fee-for-service Medicare beneficiaries undergoing open cardiac valve surgery in 2014. Patients identified by inpatient diagnosis codes for open aortic, mitral, tricuspid, and pulmonary valve surgery were included. Data analysis occurred from January 2018 to March 2019. Exposures: Logistic regression was used to evaluate sociodemographic and clinical factors associated with CR enrollment. Main Outcomes and Measures: We used Andersen-Gill models to evaluate the association of CR enrollment with 1-year hospitalization risk and Cox regression models to evaluate the association of CR enrollment with 1-year mortality risk. Results: A total of 41\u202f369 Medicare beneficiaries (median [interquartile range] age, 73 [68-79] years; 16\u202f935 [40.9%] female) underwent open valve surgery in the United States in 2014. Fewer than half of patients (17\u202f855 [43.2%]) who had valve surgery enrolled in CR programs. Several racial/ethnic groups had lower odds of enrolling in CR programs after valve surgery compared with white patients, including Asian patients (odds ratio [OR], 0.36 [95% CI, 0.28-0.47]), black patients (OR, 0.60 [95% CI, 0.54-0.67]), and Hispanic patients (OR, 0.36 [95% CI, 0.28-0.46]). Patients undergoing concomitant coronary artery bypass grafting had higher odds of CR enrollment (OR, 1.26 [95% CI, 1.20-1.31]) than those without the concomitant coronary artery bypass graft procedure, as did patients in the Midwest census region (OR, 2.40 [95% CI, 2.28-2.54]) compared with those in the South (reference). Cardiac rehabilitation enrollment was associated with fewer hospitalizations within 1 year of discharge (hazard ratio, 0.66 [95% CI, 0.63-0.69] after multivariable adjustment). Enrollment was also associated with a 4.2% absolute decrease in 1-year mortality risk (hazard ratio, 0.39 [95% CI, 0.35-0.44] after multivariable adjustment). Conclusions and Relevance: Fewer than half of Medicare beneficiaries undergoing cardiac valve surgery enroll in CR programs, and there are marked racial/ethnic disparities among those that do. Cardiac rehabilitation is associated with decreased 1-year cumulative hospitalization and mortality risk after valve surgery. These results invite further study on barriers to CR enrollment in this population. ",
        "Financial Implications of 12-Month Dispensing of Oral Contraceptive Pills in the Veterans Affairs Health Care System. Importance: The Veterans Affairs (VA) health care system is the largest integrated health care system in the United States. Like most US health plans, the VA currently stipulates a 3-month maximum dispensing limit for all medications, including oral contraceptive pills (OCPs). However, 12-month OCP dispensing has been shown to improve continuation of use, decrease coverage gaps, and reduce unintended pregnancy in other practice settings. Objective: To estimate the financial and reproductive health implications for the VA of implementing a 12-month OCP dispensing option, with the goal of informing policy change. Design, Setting, and Participants: A decision model from the VA payer perspective was developed to estimate incremental costs to the health care system of allowing the option to receive a 12-month supply of OCPs up front, compared with the standard 3-month maximum, during a 1-year time horizon. A model cohort of 24\u202f309 reproductive-aged, heterosexually active, female VA enrollees who wish to avoid pregnancy for at least 1 year was assumed. Probabilities of continuation of OCP use, coverage gaps, pregnancy, and pregnancy outcomes were drawn from published data. Costs of OCP provision and pregnancy-related care and the number of women using OCPs were drawn from VA administrative data. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to assess model robustness. Main Outcomes and Measures: Incremental per-woman and total costs to the VA of allowing for 12-month dispensing of OCPs compared with standard 3-month dispensing. Results: The 12-month OCP dispensing option, modeled from the VA health system perspective using a cohort of 240 309 women, resulted in anticipated VA annual cost savings of $87.12 per woman compared with the cost of 3-month dispensing, or an estimated total savings of $2\u202f117\u202f800 annually. Cost savings resulted from an absolute reduction of 24 unintended pregnancies per 1000 women per year with 12-month dispensing, or 583 unintended pregnancies averted annually. Expected cost savings with 12-month dispensing were sensitive to changes in the probability of OCP coverage gaps with 3-month dispensing, the probability of pregnancy during coverage gaps, and the proportion of pregnancies paid for by the VA. When simultaneously varying all variables across plausible ranges, the 12-month strategy was cost saving in 95.4% of model iterations. Conclusions and Relevance: Adoption of a 12-month OCP dispensing option is expected to produce substantial cost savings for the VA while better supporting reproductive autonomy and reducing unintended pregnancy among women veterans.

        "Longitudinal Associations of Self-reported Vision Impairment With Symptoms of Anxiety and Depression Among Older Adults in the United States. Importance: Vision impairment (VI) and mental health conditions are highly prevalent among older adults and are major causes of morbidity and health care expenditures. However, there are few nationally representative data from the United States on the longitudinal association between VI and depressive symptoms, and no such data on anxiety symptoms. Objective: To evaluate the longitudinal association and directionality of the association between self-reported VI and clinically significant symptoms of depression and anxiety in older US adults. Design, Setting, and Participants: The National Health and Aging Trends Study, a nationally representative US survey administered annually from 2011 to 2016 to a cohort of Medicare beneficiaries 65 years and older. A total of 7584 participants with complete data on self-reported VI status at baseline were included. Data analysis was performed from February to October 2018. Main Outcomes and Measures: Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to evaluate the longitudinal associations between self-reported VI and depression and anxiety symptoms, adjusting for sociodemographics and medical comorbidities and accounting for the complex survey design. Results: There were 7584 participants included in this study. At baseline, the survey-weighted proportion of participants who were women was 56.6%; 53.0% were aged 65 to 74 years, and 8.9% (95% CI, 8.1%-9.8%) had self-reported VI. Symptoms of depression were significantly more common in participants with self-reported VI than those without self-reported VI (31.2%; 95% CI, 27.0%-35.6% vs 12.9%; 95% CI, 11.9%-14.0%; P\u2009<\u2009.001), as were symptoms of anxiety (27.2%; 95% CI, 23.7%-30.9% vs 11.1%; 95% CI,10.2%-12.0%, P\u2009<\u2009.001). Baseline self-reported vision status was significantly associated with future report of depression (hazard ratio [HR], 1.33; 95% CI, 1.15-1.55) but not anxiety (HR, 1.06; 95% CI, 0.85-1.31) symptoms. Baseline depression (HR, 1.37; 95% CI, 1.08-1.75) and anxiety (HR, 1.55; 95% CI, 1.19-2.02) symptoms were both significantly associated with future reports of self-reported VI. In a sensitivity analysis excluding data provided by proxy respondents, statistical significance was unchanged and the effect size was similar for all statistical models. Conclusions and Relevance: Older US adults with self-reported VI were more likely to report symptoms of depression in the future, while those who had symptoms of either depression or anxiety were more likely to report VI in the future. This investigation suggests that there is a significant bidirectional and longitudinal association between self-reported VI and mental health symptoms. Furthermore, the study suggests the need for effective strategies to screen for and address depression and anxiety among older US adults with VI. ",
        "Association of Perceived Discrimination With Emotional Well-being in Older Adults With Visual Impairment. Importance: A significant proportion of individuals with visual impairment report experiences of discrimination. However, evidence comparing perceived discrimination among people with visual impairment with the general population is lacking. In addition, poorer mental health and well-being have been detected in this population, but the association between discrimination and well-being in those with visual impairment is unknown. Objective: To investigate perceived discrimination among people with visual impairment and its association with well-being in a population-based sample of older adults. Design, Setting, and Participants: This study collected data from 7677 participants 50 years or older from the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing, a representative sample of older men and women in England. Experiences of perceived discrimination were reported from July 2010 to June 2011. Depressive symptoms, life satisfaction, quality of life, and loneliness were assessed from July 2010 to June 2011 and May 2016 to June 2017. Data analysis was performed from September 27, 2018, to October 10, 2018. Exposures: Self-rated eyesight, categorized as poor (ratings of fair, poor, or blind) or good (good, very good, or excellent), which was not previously validated for this population. Main Outcomes and Measures: We used logistic regression to analyze differences in perceived discrimination between participants reporting poor vs good eyesight and cross-sectional and prospective associations between perceived discrimination and well-being in those with poor eyesight. Results: A total of 7677 participants (mean [SD] age, 66.71 [9.17] years; 4023 [52.4%] female) were included in the study. Participants with poor eyesight had increased odds of reporting perceived discrimination compared with those with good eyesight (odds ratio [OR], 1.41; 95% CI, 1.23-1.63; P\u2009<\u2009.001). Cross-sectionally, participants who reported poor eyesight and discrimination had increased odds of depressive symptoms (OR, 2.14; 95% CI, 1.57-2.92; P\u2009<\u2009.001) and loneliness (OR, 2.17; 95% CI, 1.61-2.92; P\u2009<\u2009.001) and lower quality of life (B\u2009=\u2009-4.06; 95% CI, -5.29 to -2.84; P\u2009<\u2009.001) and life satisfaction (B\u2009=\u2009-2.37; 95% CI, -3.28 to -1.46; P\u2009<\u2009.001) compared with poor eyesight and no reported discrimination. Prospectively, perceived discrimination was associated with increased risk of depressive symptoms among participants reporting poor eyesight at 6-year follow-up (OR, 1.72; 95% CI, 1.08-2.76; P\u2009=\u2009.02). Conclusions and Relevance: These findings suggest that older adults with impaired vision are at increased risk of perceived discrimination. Those who reported experiencing discrimination had higher levels of depressive symptoms and loneliness and lower quality of life and life satisfaction. Action to address discrimination may help mitigate the increased risk of poor well-being in this population. ",
        "Waste in the US Health Care System: Estimated Costs and Potential for Savings. Importance: The United States spends more on health care than any other country, with costs approaching 18% of the gross domestic product (GDP). Prior studies estimated that approximately 30% of health care spending may be considered waste. Despite efforts to reduce overtreatment, improve care, and address overpayment, it is likely that substantial waste in US health care spending remains. Objectives: To estimate current levels of waste in the US health care system in 6 previously developed domains and to report estimates of potential savings for each domain. Evidence: A search of peer-reviewed and \"gray\" literature from January 2012 to May 2019 focused on the 6 waste domains previously identified by the Institute of Medicine and Berwick and Hackbarth: failure of care delivery, failure of care coordination, overtreatment or low-value care, pricing failure, fraud and abuse, and administrative complexity. For each domain, available estimates of waste-related costs and data from interventions shown to reduce waste-related costs were recorded, converted to annual estimates in 2019 dollars for national populations when necessary, and combined into ranges or summed as appropriate. Findings: The review yielded 71 estimates from 54 unique peer-reviewed publications, government-based reports, and reports from the gray literature. Computations yielded the following estimated ranges of total annual cost of waste: failure of care delivery, $102.4 billion to $165.7 billion; failure of care coordination, $27.2 billion to $78.2 billion; overtreatment or low-value care, $75.7 billion to $101.2 billion; pricing failure, $230.7 billion to $240.5 billion; fraud and abuse, $58.5 billion to $83.9 billion; and administrative complexity, $265.6 billion. The estimated annual savings from measures to eliminate waste were as follows: failure of care delivery, $44.4 billion to $93.3 billion; failure of care coordination, $29.6 billion to $38.2 billion; overtreatment or low-value care, $12.8 billion to $28.6 billion; pricing failure, $81.4 billion to $91.2 billion; and fraud and abuse, $22.8 billion to $30.8 billion. No studies were identified that focused on interventions targeting administrative complexity. The estimated total annual costs of waste were $760 billion to $935 billion and savings from interventions that address waste were $191 billion to $282 billion. Conclusions and Relevance: In this review based on 6 previously identified domains of health care waste, the estimated cost of waste in the US health care system ranged from $760 billion to $935 billion, accounting for approximately 25% of total health care spending, and the projected potential savings from interventions that reduce waste, excluding savings from administrative complexity, ranged from $191 billion to $282 billion, representing a potential 25% reduction in the total cost of waste. Implementation of effective measures to eliminate waste represents an opportunity reduce the continued increases in US health care expenditures. ",
        "Association of Step Volume and Intensity With All-Cause Mortality in Older Women. Importance: A goal of 10\u202f000 steps/d is commonly believed by the public to be necessary for health, but this number has limited scientific basis. Additionally, it is unknown whether greater stepping intensity is associated with health benefits, independent of steps taken per day. Objective: To examine associations of number of steps per day and stepping intensity with all-cause mortality. Design, Setting, and Participants: This prospective cohort study included 18\u202f289 US women from the Women's Health Study who agreed to participate by wearing an accelerometer during waking hours for 7 days between 2011 and 2015. A total of 17\u202f708 women wore and returned their devices; data were downloaded successfully from 17\u202f466 devices. Of these women, 16\u202f741 were compliant wearers (\u226510 h/d of wear on \u22654 days) and included in the analyses, which took place between 2018 and 2019. Exposures: Steps per day and several measures of stepping intensity (ie, peak 1-minute cadence; peak 30-minute cadence; maximum 5-minute cadence; time spent at a stepping rate of \u226540 steps/min, reflecting purposeful steps). Main Outcomes and Measures: All-cause mortality. Results: Of the 16\u202f741 women who met inclusion criteria, the mean (SD) age was 72.0 (5.7) years. Mean step count was 5499 per day, with 51.4%, 45.5%, and 3.1% of time spent at 0, 1 to 39 (incidental steps), and 40 steps/min or greater (purposeful steps), respectively. During a mean follow-up of 4.3 years, 504 women died. Median steps per day across low-to-high quartiles of distribution were 2718, 4363, 5905, and 8442, respectively. The corresponding quartile hazard ratios (HRs) associated with mortality and adjusted for potential confounders were 1.00 (reference), 0.59 (95% CI, 0.47-0.75), 0.54 (95% CI, 0.41-0.72), and 0.42 (95% CI, 0.30-0.60), respectively (P\u2009<\u2009.01). In spline analysis, HRs were observed to decline progressively with higher mean steps per day until approximately 7500 steps/d, after which they leveled. For measures of stepping intensity, higher intensities were associated with significantly lower mortality rates; however, after adjusting for steps per day, all associations were attenuated, and most were no longer significant (highest vs lowest quartile for peak 1-minute cadence, HR\u2009=\u20090.87 [95% CI, 0.68-1.11]; peak 30-minute cadence, HR\u2009=\u20090.86 [95% CI, 0.65-1.13]; maximum 5-minute cadence, HR\u2009=\u20090.80 [95% CI, 0.62-1.05]; and time spent at a stepping rate of \u226540 steps/min, HR\u2009=\u20091.27 [95% CI, 0.96-1.68]; P\u2009>\u2009.05). Conclusions and Relevance: Among older women, as few as approximately 4400 steps/d was significantly related to lower mortality rates compared with approximately 2700 steps/d. With more steps per day, mortality rates progressively decreased before leveling at approximately 7500 steps/d. Stepping intensity was not clearly related to lower mortality rates after accounting for total steps per day. ",
        "Association of Maternal Lactation With Diabetes and Hypertension: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis. Importance: Lactation has been shown to be associated with lower rates of diabetes and hypertension in mothers. However, the strength of association has varied between studies, and sample sizes are relatively small. Objective: To conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to determine whether lactation is associated with a lower risk of diabetes and hypertension. Data Sources: Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, Cochrane CENTRAL, and CINAHL databases were searched from inception to July 2018 with manual search of the references. Study Selection: Studies of adult women that specified duration of breastfeeding for at least 12 months, evaluated primary hypertension and diabetes as outcomes, were full-text articles in English, and reported statistical outcomes as odds ratios were included. Data Extraction and Synthesis: Study characteristics were independently extracted using a standard spreadsheet template and the data were pooled using the random-effects model. The Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) guideline for reporting was followed. Main Outcomes and Measures: Diabetes and hypertension. Results: The search yielded 1558 articles, from which a total of 6 studies met inclusion criteria for association between breastfeeding and diabetes and/or hypertension. The 4 studies included in the meta-analysis for the association between lactation and diabetes had a total of 206\u202f204 participants, and the 5 studies included in the meta-analysis for the association between lactation and hypertension had a total of 255\u202f271 participants. Breastfeeding for more than 12 months was associated with a relative risk reduction of 30% for diabetes (pooled odds ratio, 0.70 [95% CI, 0.62-0.78]; P\u2009<\u2009.001) and a relative risk reduction of 13% for hypertension (pooled odds ratio, 0.87 [95% CI, 0.78-0.97]; P\u2009=\u2009.01). Conclusions and Relevance: This study suggests that education about the benefits of breastfeeding for prevention of diabetes and hypertension in women is a low-risk intervention that can be easily included in daily practice and may have a positive impact on cardiovascular outcomes in mothers.

        "Effect of Immersive Virtual Reality Education Before Chest Radiography on Anxiety and Distress Among Pediatric Patients: A Randomized Clinical Trial. Importance: Pediatric patients often encounter anxiety and distress in hospital settings, and virtual reality education, providing a vivid, immersive, and realistic experience, has been introduced to mitigate these anxiety responses. Objective: To evaluate whether virtual reality education for pediatric patients before chest radiography could reduce anxiety and distress in children and improve the radiographic process. Design, Setting, and Participants: This prospective randomized clinical trial was conducted in a tertiary academic hospital in Seongnam, Republic of Korea. Participants (n\u2009=\u2009112) were children aged 4 to 8 years who underwent chest radiography between July 20, 2018, and September 11, 2018. Analysis was performed from October 2, 2018, to April 23, 2019. Interventions: Children were randomized to simple verbal instruction (control group) or 3-minute virtual reality education explaining the process of chest radiography in detail and leading to appropriate cooperation (virtual reality group). Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was anxiety and distress among pediatric patients based on behavioral observations using the amended version of the Observational Scale of Behavioral Distress scale for radiology procedures (total score of 30, with a score <5 indicating less distressed and a score \u22655 indicating more distressed). Secondary outcomes were the need of parental presence, parental satisfaction score, procedure time, number of repeated images, and process difficulty score. Results: Of 99 children included in the final analysis, 50 (50.5%) were allocated to the control group (mean [SD] age, 5.6 [1.2] years; 26 boys [52.0%]) and 49 (49.5%) to the virtual reality group (mean [SD] age, 5.8 [1.3] years; 32 boys [65.3%]). The mean (SD) score for anxiety and distress (2.0 [3.7] vs 5.0 [6.1]; mean difference, 3.0 [95% CI, 1.0-5.0]; P\u2009=\u2009.004), need for parental presence (8 cases with parents present [16.3%] vs 18 cases with parents present [36.0%]), and mean (SD) procedure time (55.1 [21.6] seconds vs 75.0 [42.0] seconds) were lower in the virtual reality group than in the control group. The mean (SD) score for parental satisfaction (9.4 [1.4] vs 8.6 [2.0]) was higher in the virtual reality group than in the control group. Conclusions and Relevance: Virtual reality education before chest radiography improved the radiography experience among pediatric patients by reducing anxiety, distress, and procedure time while increasing parents' satisfaction.

        "Association Between Forced Sexual Initiation and Health Outcomes Among US Women. Importance: The #MeToo movement has highlighted how frequently women experience sexual violence. However, to date, no recent studies have assessed the prevalence of forced sex during girls' and women's first sexual encounter or its health consequences. Objective: To estimate the prevalence of forced sexual initiation among US women and its association with subsequent reproductive, gynecologic, and general health outcomes. Design, Setting, and Participants: A cross-sectional analysis of the 2011-2017 National Survey of Family Growth was conducted, including a population-based sample of 13 310 US women. The study was conducted from September 2011 to September 2017. Exposures: Self-reported forced vs voluntary first sexual intercourse. Main Outcomes and Measures: Prevalence of forced sexual initiation, age of woman and partner/assailant at first sexual encounter, and odds ratios (ORs) (adjusted for sociodemographic characteristics) for having an unwanted first pregnancy or abortion, development of painful pelvic conditions, and other reproductive and general health measures. Results: A total of 13\u202f310 women between the ages of 18 and 44 years were included in the study. After survey weights were applied, 6.5% (95% CI, 5.9%-7.1%) of respondents reported experiencing forced sexual initiation, equivalent to 3 351 733 women in this age group nationwide. Age at forced sexual initiation averaged 15.6 (95% CI, 15.3-16.0) years vs 17.4 (95% CI, 17.3-17.5) years for voluntary sexual initiation (P\u2009<\u2009.001). The mean age of the partner/assailant at first sexual encounter was 6 years older for women with forced vs voluntary sexual initiation (27.0; 95% CI, 24.8-29.2 years vs 21.0; 95% CI, 20.6-21.3 years). Compared with women with voluntary sexual initiation, women with forced sexual initiation were more likely to experience an unwanted first pregnancy (30.1% vs 18.9%; adjusted OR [aOR], 1.9; 95% CI, 1.5-2.4) or an abortion (24.1% vs 17.3%; aOR, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.2-2.0), endometriosis (10.4% vs 6.5%; aOR, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.1-2.3), pelvic inflammatory disease (8.1% vs 3.4%; aOR, 2.2; 95% CI, 1.5-3.4), and problems with ovulation or menstruation (27.0% vs 17.1%; aOR, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.4-2.3). Survivors of forced sexual initiation more frequently reported illicit drug use (2.6% vs 0.7%; aOR, 3.6; 95% CI, 1.8-7.0), fair or poor health (15.5% vs 7.5%; aOR, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.5-2.7), and difficulty completing tasks owing to a physical or mental health condition (9.0% vs 3.2%; aOR, 2.8; 95% CI, 2.0-3.9). Conclusions and Relevance: Forced sexual initiation in women appears to be common and associated with multiple adverse reproductive and general health outcomes. These findings highlight the possible need for public health measures and sociocultural changes to prevent sexual violence, particularly forced sexual initiation. ",
        "Clinical Practices for Measles-Mumps-Rubella Vaccination Among US Pediatric International Travelers. Importance: The US population is experiencing a resurgence of measles, with more than 1000 cases during the first 6 months of 2019. Imported measles cases among returning international travelers are the source of most US measles outbreaks, and these importations can be reduced with pretravel measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccination of pediatric travelers. Although it is estimated that children account for less than 10% of US international travelers, pediatric travelers account for 47% of all known measles importations. Objective: To examine clinical practice regarding MMR vaccination of pediatric international travelers and to identify reasons for nonvaccination of pediatric travelers identified as MMR eligible. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cross-sectional study of pediatric travelers (ages \u22656 months and <18 years) attending pretravel consultation at 29 sites associated with Global TravEpiNet (GTEN), a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention-supported consortium of clinical sites that provide pretravel consultations, was performed from January 1, 2009, through December 31, 2018. Main Outcomes and Measures: Measles-mumps-rubella vaccination among MMR vaccination-eligible pediatric travelers. Results: Of 14\u202f602 pretravel consultations for pediatric international travelers, 2864 travelers (19.6%; 1475 [51.5%] males; 1389 [48.5%] females) were eligible to receive pretravel MMR vaccination at the time of the consultation: 365 of 398 infants aged 6 to 12 months (91.7%), 2161 of 3623 preschool-aged travelers aged 1 to 6 years (59.6%), and 338 of 10\u202f581 school-aged travelers aged 6 to 18 years (3.2%). Of 2864 total MMR vaccination-eligible travelers, 1182 (41.3%) received the MMR vaccine and 1682 (58.7%) did not. The MMR vaccination-eligible travelers who did not receive vaccine included 161 of 365 infants (44.1%), 1222 of 2161 preschool-aged travelers (56.5%), and 299 of 338 school-aged travelers (88.5%). We observed a diversity of clinical practice at different GTEN sites. In multivariable analysis, MMR vaccination-eligible pediatric travelers were less likely to be vaccinated at the pretravel consultation if they were school-aged (model 1: odds ratio [OR], 0.32 [95% CI, 0.24-0.42; P\u2009<\u2009.001]; model 2: OR, 0.26 [95% CI, 0.14-0.47; P\u2009<\u2009.001]) or evaluated at specific GTEN sites (South: OR, 0.06 [95% CI, 0.01-0.52; P\u2009<\u2009.001]; West: OR, 0.10 [95% CI, 0.02-0.47; P\u2009<\u2009.001]). The most common reasons for nonvaccination were clinician decision not to administer MMR vaccine (621 of 1682 travelers [36.9%]) and guardian refusal (612 [36.4%]). Conclusions and Relevance: Although most infant and preschool-aged travelers evaluated at GTEN sites were eligible for pretravel MMR vaccination, only 41.3% were vaccinated during pretravel consultation, mostly because of clinician decision or guardian refusal. Strategies may be needed to improve MMR vaccination among pediatric travelers and to reduce measles importations and outbreaks in the United States. ",
        "Association of Feeding Evaluation With Frenotomy Rates in Infants With Breastfeeding Difficulties. Importance: Inpatient surgical release of lingual frenulums rose 10-fold between 1997 and 2012 despite insufficient evidence that frenotomy for ankyloglossia is associated with improvements in breastfeeding. Clear indications for surgical release remain murky, and best practice guidelines have yet to be developed. Objective: To determine whether infants referred for frenotomy to treat breastfeeding difficulties should undergo procedures after comprehensive feeding examination, during which the primary cause of feeding issues was identified, and targeted intervention was provided. Design, Setting, and Participants: This observational quality improvement study followed mother-infant dyads between March and December of 2018 who were referred to our tertiary care center for difficulty with breastfeeding. All infants underwent a comprehensive feeding evaluation by speech and language pathologists who examined the infants' ability to breastfeed prior to a surgical consultation for initial frenotomy. Data analysis was performed between January 2019 and May 2019. Interventions: A multidisciplinary feeding evaluation that examined infants' oral structure and function and their ability to breastfeed and that offered techniques for mothers to address any feeding difficulties prior to surgical intervention was developed. Infants either found success in feeding and weight gain through this program or underwent procedures. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was the percentage of frenotomy procedures following implementation of a multidisciplinary feeding team evaluation. The secondary outcome was the percentage of infants referred for lingual frenotomy who later had either combined lingual and labial frenotomy or labial frenotomy alone. Results: Included in the study were 115 patients (median age, 34 days [interquartile range, 19-56 days], 68 (59%) were male) referred for surgical division of the lingual frenum. Following the development of a program with feeding examination with a pediatric speech and language pathologist, 72 (62.6%) patients subsequently did not undergo surgical procedures. Although all of the referrals were for lingual frenotomy, 10 (8.7%) underwent labial frenotomy alone and 32 (27.8%) underwent both labial and lingual frenotomy. Conclusions and Relevance: The majority of patients referred for ankyloglossia may benefit from alternative intervention strategies following comprehensive feeding evaluation. Close collaboration and formation of multidisciplinary teams are imperative for treating these children. ",
        "Breastfeeding Trends by Race/Ethnicity Among US Children Born From 2009 to 2015. Importance: Large racial/ethnic disparities in breastfeeding are associated with adverse health outcomes. Objectives: To examine breastfeeding trends by race/ethnicity from 2009 to 2015 and changes in breastfeeding gaps comparing racial/ethnic subgroups with white infants from 2009-2010 to 2014-2015. Design, Setting, and Participants: This study used data from 167\u202f842 infants from the National Immunization Survey-Child (NIS-Child), a random-digit-dialed telephone survey among a complex, stratified, multistage probability sample of US households with children aged 19 to 35 months at the time of the survey. This study analyzed data collected from January 1, 2011, through December 31, 2017, for children born between 2009 and 2015. Exposures: Child's race/ethnicity categorized as Hispanic or non-Hispanic white, black, Asian, or American Indian or Alaskan Native. Main Outcomes and Measures: Breastfeeding rates, including ever breastfeeding, exclusive breastfeeding through 6 months, and continuation of breastfeeding at 12 months. Results: This study included 167\u202f842 infants (mean [SD] age, 2.33 [0.45] years; 86\u202f321 [51.4%] male and 81\u202f521 [48.6%] female). Overall unadjusted breastfeeding rates increased from 2009 to 2015 by 7.1 percentage points for initiation, 9.2 percentage points for exclusivity, and 11.3 percentage points for duration, with considerable variation by race/ethnicity. Most racial/ethnic groups had significant increases in breastfeeding rates. From 2009-2010 to 2014-2015, disparities in adjusted breastfeeding rates became larger between black and white infants. For example, the difference for exclusive breastfeeding through 6 months between black and white infants widened from 0.5 to 4.5 percentage points with a 4.0% difference in difference (P\u2009<\u2009.001) from 2009-2010 to 2014-2015. In contrast, the breastfeeding differences between Hispanic, Asian, and American Indian or Alaskan Native infants and white infants became smaller or stayed the same except for continued breastfeeding at 12 months among Asians. For example, the difference in continued breastfeeding at 12 months between Hispanic and white infants decreased from 7.8 to 3.8 percentage points between 2 periods, yielding a -4.0% difference in difference (P\u2009<\u2009.001). Because of positive trends among all race/ethnicities, these reduced differences were likely associated with greater increases among white infants throughout the study years. Conclusions and Relevance: Despite breastfeeding improvements among each race/ethnicity group, breastfeeding disparities between black and white infants became larger when breastfeeding improvements decreased even further among black infants in 2014-2015. The reduced breastfeeding gaps among all other nonwhite groups may be associated with greater increases among white infants. More efforts appear to be needed to improve breastfeeding rates among black infants. ",
        "Association of Bulimia Nervosa With Long-term Risk of Cardiovascular Disease and Mortality Among Women. Importance: Bulimia nervosa is associated with short-term cardiovascular complications in women, but its long-term consequences on cardiovascular health are unknown. Objective: To study the association of bulimia nervosa with the long-term risk of cardiovascular disease and mortality in women. Design, Setting, and Participants: In this longitudinal cohort study, 416 709 women hospitalized in Quebec, Canada, including women hospitalized for bulimia nervosa and those for pregnancy-related events as a comparison group, were followed up for 12 years from 2006 to 2018 to identify incidences of cardiovascular disease and death. Exposures: At least 1 hospitalization for bulimia nervosa. Main Outcomes and Measures: The study participants were followed up to identify future incidences of cardiovascular disease and deaths. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs to assess the association of bulimia nervosa with future outcomes after adjustment for patient characteristics. Results: The study population comprised 818 women who were hospitalized for bulimia nervosa (mean [SD] age, 28.3 [13.4] years) and 415\u202f891 hospitalized for pregnancy-related events (mean [SD] age, 28.3 [5.4] years). Patients were followed up for a total of 2\u202f957\u202f677 person-years. The women hospitalized for bulimia nervosa had a greater incidence of cardiovascular disease compared with those hospitalized for pregnancy-related events (10.34 [95% CI, 7.77-13.76] vs 1.02 [95% CI, 0.99-1.06] per 1000 person-years). Incidence of future cardiovascular disease was even higher for women with 3 or more bulimia admissions (25.13 [95% CI, 13.52-46.70] per 1000 person-years). Women hospitalized for bulimia nervosa had 4.25 (95% CI, 2.98-6.07) times the risk of any cardiovascular disease and 4.72 (95% CI, 2.05-10.84) times the risk of death compared with women hospitalized for pregnancy-related events. Bulimia nervosa was found to be associated with ischemic heart disease (HR, 6.63; 95% CI, 3.34-13.13), atherosclerosis (HR, 6.94; 95% CI, 3.08-15.66), and cardiac conduction defects (HR, 2.99; 95% CI, 1.57-5.71). Bulimia was also associated with 21.93 (95% CI, 9.29-51.74) times the risk of myocardial infarction at 2 years of follow-up and 14.13 (95% CI, 6.02-33.18) times the risk at 5 years of follow-up. Conclusions and Relevance: This study's findings suggest that bulimia nervosa may be associated with the long-term risk of any cardiovascular disease, such as ischemic cardiac events and conduction disorders, as well as with death among women. The findings also suggest that women with a history of bulimia nervosa should be screened regularly for ischemic cardiovascular disease and may benefit from prevention of and treatment for cardiovascular risk factors.

        "Clinicians' Perspectives on Barriers to Discussing Infertility and Fertility Preservation With Young Women With Cancer. Importance: Infertility can be a devastating adverse effect of cancer treatment for young women. Fertility preservation may be an important and influential factor in treatment decisions. Despite American Society of Clinical Oncology guidelines recommending discussion around potential infertility with patients, nearly 50% of young women with cancer remain uninformed. Objective: To understand and describe from clinicians' perspectives the barriers to discussing infertility and fertility preservation with young women with cancer. Design, Setting, and Participants: This qualitative study used purposeful, maximum variation, and snowball sampling strategies to recruit 22 clinicians from cancer centers and community hospitals in 5 Canadian provinces, 5 practice areas, and 12 practice sites. Eligibility criteria included clinicians who regularly treat young women with cancer who might need fertility preservation. Telephone interviews that lasted between 30 to 75 minutes were conducted between May and November 2014 using a semistructured interview guide. Thematic analysis was used to discern the nature of barriers, and the Cabana framework was used to organize and interpret these findings. Analysis was conducted from May 2014 until May 2015. Main Outcomes and Measures: Clinician perspectives on what influences their nonadherence to American Society of Clinical Oncology guidelines, which recommend discussing fertility preservation with patients. Results: A total of 22 clinicians were interviewed, including 8 medical oncologists, 4 surgical oncologists, 4 fertility specialists, 3 hematology and oncology specialists, and 3 nurse practitioners or clinician nurse specialists. Seventeen clinicians were women and 5 clinicians were men; the median (range) time in practice was 10 (0.67-37) years. Analysis suggested that clinicians' unfamiliarity with infertility risks, fertility preservation technologies, referral processes, and procedures, as well as environmental factors and their perceptions of fertility preservation, influenced their practices regarding fertility discussions. Conclusions and Relevance: The findings of this qualitative study suggest that the individual and environmental challenges that clinicians experience might negatively affect their willingness and ability to raise fertility-related issues with young women with cancer. Multiple strategies are needed to address these challenges to improve overall care of young women with cancer. ",
        "Comparison of Hospitals Affiliated With PPS-Exempt Cancer Centers, Other Hospitals Affiliated With NCI-Designated Cancer Centers, and Other Hospitals That Provide Cancer Care. Importance: Congress has exempted 11 specialized cancer centers in the United States from the Prospective Payment System (PPS). These centers are also exempt from reporting many of the process-of-care and outcome measures to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services that are required for hospitals in the PPS. It is not known how hospitals affiliated with PPS-exempt cancer centers differ from other hospitals affiliated with National Cancer Institute cancer centers (NCI-CCs) or other US hospitals that provide cancer care. Objective: To examine differences between hospitals affiliated with PPS-exempt cancer centers, other hospitals affiliated with NCI-CCs, and other hospitals that provide cancer care on metrics that could be used in public reporting. Design, Setting, and Participants: This retrospective cohort study compared hospital characteristics and cancer-related services using data from the American Hospital Association Annual Survey and US News Best Hospitals rankings. With a 100% sample of Medicare beneficiaries who underwent 1 of 9 cancer operations (brain tumor resection, colorectal resection, cystectomy, esophagectomy, gastrectomy, liver resection, lung resection, pancreatic resection, prostatectomy) from January 1, 2011, to May 31, 2015, we used hierarchical logistic regression methods to compare differences in 18 postoperative outcomes. Data analysis was conducted from February 2018 to August 2018. Main Outcomes and Measures: This study evaluated hospital characteristics, including cancer-specific services, patient comorbidity burden, and cancer surgery postoperative outcomes, from PPS-exempt cancer centers, NCI-affiliated cancer centers, and other US hospitals that provide cancer care. Results: Hospitals affiliated with PPS-exempt cancer centers (n\u2009=\u200915) and NCI-CCs (n\u2009=\u200954) were similar in hospital characteristics, basic cancer-related services, and patient comorbidity burden. Compared with NCI-CCs, PPS-exempt cancer centers had significantly higher US News reputation scores (mean [SD], 17.5 [24.0] vs 2.6 [4.8]; P\u2009<\u2009.001) but no differences in oncology patient volume, patient safety ratings, comorbidity burden, nurse staffing, US News total cancer scores, or US News survival scores. Hospitals affiliated with PPS-exempt cancer centers and NCI-CCs had similar adjusted postoperative outcomes for 15 of 18 measures, including mortality, readmission, and surgical site infections. Compared with hospitals affiliated with PPS-exempt cancer centers, patients treated at NCI-CCs were more likely to have postoperative sepsis (3.1% vs 1.7%; P\u2009=\u2009.002), acute renal failure (6.2% vs 3.9%; P\u2009=\u2009.01), and urinary tract infection (6.4% vs 4.0%; P\u2009=\u2009.002). Compared with the other hospitals that provide cancer care (n\u2009=\u20093578), PPS-exempt cancer center status was associated with improved outcomes for 7 of 18 measures, including mortality, sepsis, acute renal failure, pulmonary failure, and failure to rescue. Conclusions and Relevance: Hospitals affiliated with PPS-exempt cancer centers and NCI-CCs had generally similar hospital characteristics, patient comorbidity burden, and cancer surgery outcomes. These findings raise questions about why some cancer centers are designated as PPS-exempt and why most hospitals are not required to publicly report cancer-specific quality metrics. ",
        "Receipt of Addiction Treatment After Opioid Overdose Among Medicaid-Enrolled Adolescents and Young Adults. Importance: Nonfatal opioid overdose may be a critical touch point when youths who have never received a diagnosis of opioid use disorder can be engaged in treatment. However, the extent to which youths (adolescents and young adults) receive timely evidence-based treatment following opioid overdose is unknown. Objective: To identify characteristics of youths who experience nonfatal overdose with heroin or other opioids and to assess the percentage of youths receiving timely evidence-based treatment. Design, Setting, and Participants: This retrospective cohort study used the 2009-2015 Truven-IBM Watson Health MarketScan Medicaid claims database from 16 deidentified states representing all US census regions. Data from 4\u202f039\u202f216 Medicaid-enrolled youths aged 13 to 22 years were included and were analyzed from April 20, 2018, to March 21, 2019. Exposures: Nonfatal incident and recurrent opioid overdoses involving heroin or other opioids. Main Outcomes and Measures: Receipt of timely addiction treatment (defined as a claim for behavioral health services, for buprenorphine, methadone, or naltrexone prescription or administration, or for both behavioral health services and pharmacotherapy within 30 days of incident overdose). Sociodemographic and clinical characteristics associated with receipt of timely treatment as well as with incident and recurrent overdoses were also identified. Results: Among 3791 youths with nonfatal opioid overdose, 2234 (58.9%) were female, and 2491 (65.7%) were non-Hispanic white. The median age was 18 years (interquartile range, 16-20 years). The crude incident opioid overdose rate was 44.1 per 100\u202f000 person-years. Of these 3791 youths, 1001 (26.4%) experienced a heroin overdose; the 2790 (73.6%) remaining youths experienced an overdose involving other opioids. The risk of recurrent overdose among youths with incident heroin involvement was significantly higher than that among youths with other opioid overdose (adjusted hazard ratio, 2.62; 95% CI, 2.14-3.22), and youths with incident heroin overdose experienced recurrent overdose at a crude rate of 20\u202f700 per 100\u202f000 person-years. Of 3606 youths with opioid-related overdose and continuous enrollment for at least 30 days after overdose, 2483 (68.9%) received no addiction treatment within 30 days after incident opioid overdose, whereas only 1056 youths (29.3%) received behavioral health services alone, and 67 youths (1.9%) received pharmacotherapy. Youths with heroin overdose were significantly less likely than youths with other opioid overdose to receive any treatment after their overdose (adjusted odds ratio, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.49-0.83). Conclusions and Relevance: After opioid overdose, less than one-third of youths received timely addiction treatment, and only 1 in 54 youths received recommended evidence-based pharmacotherapy. Interventions are urgently needed to link youths to treatment after overdose, with priority placed on improving access to pharmacotherapy. ",
        "Changes in Age Distribution of Obesity-Associated Cancers. Importance: Recent studies have documented an association between overweight and obesity and certain cancers, as well as an increased incidence of obesity-associated cancers (OACs) in younger individuals. However, although important for cancer-control efforts, it is not known which subgroups of the population are most affected by these changes. Objective: To examine temporal shifts in age distribution of OACs and non-OACs across race/ethnicity- and sex-specific strata. Design, Setting, and Participants: This population-based, cross-sectional study assessed individuals residing in Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results sites who were diagnosed with incident OACs and non-OACs from January 1, 2000, to December 31, 2016. Data analysis was performed from August 1, 2018, to June 30, 2019. Exposure: Study years. Main Outcomes and Measures: Changes in the age distribution of incident cases across race/ethnicity- and sex-specific strata over time. For all OACs and non-OACs, changes in the incidence rates, the number of incident cases, and the distribution of the cases across population subgroups were studied. Race/ethnicity- and sex-stratified logistic regression analysis was performed to determine whether the annual change in the odds associated with an age group increased (or decreased) to a greater (or lesser) extent in OACs than in non-OACs. Heat maps were created to highlight the change in the number of cases during the study period for each OAC and select non-OACs. Results: The study population included 2\u202f665\u202f574 incident OAC cases (70.3% women) and 3\u202f448\u202f126 incident non-OAC cases (32.0% women). From 2000 to 2016, the distribution by age showed that the percentage of incident cases increased in the 50- to 64-year age group for both OACs and non-OACs. The increase in the number of OACs in this age group ranged from 25.3% in non-Hispanic white women to 197.8% in Hispanic men. The change in the number of OACs in the 20- to 49-year age group ranged from -5.9% in non-Hispanic white women to 94.6% in Hispanic women, and the increase in the number of OACs in the 65 years or older group ranged from 2.5% in non-Hispanic white women to 102.0% in Hispanic women. Logistic regression analysis revealed a greater annual increase in the odds for OACs than for non-OACs for individuals in the 50- to 64-year age group but a decrease for individuals in the 65 years or older group. Among men in the 50- to 64-year age group, the OAC to non-OAC ratio of odds ratios (ORs) ranged from 1.005 (95% CI, 1.002-1.008) in non-Hispanic black men to 1.013 (95% CI, 1.012-1.014) in non-Hispanic white men, implying that the annual increase was 0.5% higher for OACs than for non-OACs in non-Hispanic black men and 1.3% higher for OACs than for non-OACs in non-Hispanic white men. Among women in the 50- to 64-year age group, the OAC to non-OAC ratio of ORs ranged from 1.002 (95% CI, 0.999-1.006) in Hispanic women to 1.005 (95% CI, 1.002-1.009) in non-Hispanic black women. In men and women aged 65 or older, the OAC vs non-OAC ratio of ORs was consistently less than 1.000 for all race/ethnicity groups, indicating that whereas the OAC group experienced a decrease in this age group, the non-OACs experienced either a smaller decrease or an increase over time. Conclusions and Relevance: This study indicates that from 2000 to 2016, a shift toward younger age groups occurred in incident OACs. The findings have important public health implications and suggest that interventions to reduce obesity and to implement individualized screening programs are needed. ",
        "Evaluating Progression-Free Survival as a Surrogate Outcome for Health-Related Quality of Life in Oncology: A Systematic Review and Quantitative Analysis. Importance: Progression-free survival (PFS) has become a commonly used outcome to assess the efficacy of new cancer drugs. However, it is not clear if delay in progression leads to improved quality of life with or without overall survival benefit. Objective: To evaluate the association between PFS and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in oncology through a systematic review and quantitative analysis of published randomized clinical trials. Eligible trials addressed oral, intravenous, intraperitoneal, or intrapleural chemotherapy or biological treatments, and reported PFS or health-related quality of life. Data Sources: For this systematic review and quantitative analysis of randomized clinical trials of patients with cancer, we searched Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials from January 1, 2000, through May 4, 2016. Study Selection: Paired reviewers independently screened citations, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias of included studies. Data Extraction and Synthesis: We examined the association of difference in median PFS duration (in months) between treatment groups with difference in global, physical, and emotional HRQoL scores between groups (standardized to a range of 0-100, with higher scores representing better HRQoL) using weighted simple regressions. Main Outcome and Measure: The association between PFS duration and HRQoL. Results: Of 35\u202f960 records screened, 52 articles reporting on 38 randomized clinical trials involving 13\u202f979 patients across 12 cancer types using 6 different HRQoL instruments were included. The mean (SD) difference in median PFS between the intervention and the control arms was 1.91 (3.35) months. The mean (SD) differences in change of HRQoL adjusted to per-month values were -0.39 (3.59) for the global domain, 0.26 (5.56) for the physical domain, and 1.08 (3.49) for the emotional domain. The slope of the association between the difference in median PFS and the difference in change for global HRQoL (n\u2009=\u200930 trials) was 0.12 (95% CI, -0.27 to 0.52); for physical HRQoL (n\u2009=\u200920 trials) it was -0.20 (95% CI, -0.62 to 0.23); and for emotional HRQoL (n\u2009=\u200913 trials) it was 0.78 (95% CI, -0.05 to 1.60). Conclusions and Relevance: We failed to find a significant association between PFS and HRQoL in cancer clinical trials. These findings raise questions regarding the assumption that interventions prolonging PFS also improve HRQoL in patients with cancer. Therefore, to ensure that patients are truly obtaining important benefit from cancer therapies, clinical trial investigators should measure HRQoL directly and accurately, ensuring adequate duration and follow-up.

        "Attributable Failure of First-line Cancer Treatment and Incremental Costs Associated With Smoking by Patients With Cancer. Importance: Previous studies have shown that continued smoking among patients with cancer can increase overall and cancer-specific mortality, risk for second primary cancer, and risk for toxic effects of cancer treatment. To our knowledge, there have been no efforts to estimate additional costs for cancer treatment attributed to smoking. Objective: To model attributable incremental costs of subsequent cancer treatment associated with continued smoking by patients with cancer. Design, Setting, and Participants: For this economic evaluation, a model was developed in 2018 using data from a 2014 US Surgeon General's report that considered expected failure rates of first-line cancer treatment in nonsmoking patients, smoking prevalence, odds ratio of first-line cancer treatment failure attributed to smoking compared with nonsmoking, and cost of cancer treatment after failure of first-line cancer treatment. Main Outcomes and Measures: Attributable failures of first-line cancer treatment and incremental cost for subsequent treatment associated with continued smoking among patients with cancer. Results: Attributable treatment failures were higher under conditions in which high first-line cure rates were expected in nonsmoking patients compared with conditions in which low cure rates were expected. Peak attributable failures occurred under the conditions in which expected cure rates among nonsmoking patients ranged from 50% to 65%. Under the conditions of a 30% expected treatment failure rate among nonsmoking patients, 20% smoking prevalence, 60% increased risk of failure of first-line cancer treatment, and $100\u202f000 mean added cost of treating a first-line cancer treatment failure, the additional incremental cost per 1000 total patients was estimated to be $2.1 million, reflecting an additional cost of $10\u202f678 per smoking patient. Extrapolation of cost to 1.6 million patients with cancer diagnosed annually reflects a potential $3.4 billion in incremental cost. Conclusions and Relevance: The findings suggest that continued smoking among patients with cancer and the increase in attributable first-line cancer treatment failure is associated with significant incremental costs for subsequent cancer treatments. Additional work appears to be needed to identify optimal methods to mitigate these incremental costs. ",
        "Differential Safety Between Top-Ranked Cancer Hospitals and Their Affiliates for Complex Cancer Surgery. Importance: Leading cancer hospitals have increasingly shared their brands with other hospitals through growing networks of affiliations. However, the brand of top-ranked cancer hospitals may evoke distinct reputations for safety and quality that do not extend to all hospitals within these networks. Objective: To assess perioperative mortality of Medicare beneficiaries after complex cancer surgery across hospitals participating in networks with top-ranked cancer hospitals. Design, Setting, and Participants: A cross-sectional study was performed of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services 100% Medicare Provider and Analysis Review file from January 1, 2013, to December 31, 2016, for top-ranked cancer hospitals (as assessed by U.S. News and World Report) and affiliated hospitals that share their brand. Participants were 29\u202f228 Medicare beneficiaries older than 65 years who underwent complex cancer surgery (lobectomy, esophagectomy, gastrectomy, colectomy, and pancreaticoduodenectomy [Whipple procedure]) between January 1, 2013, and October 1, 2016. Exposures: Undergoing complex cancer surgery at a top-ranked cancer hospital vs an affiliated hospital. Main Outcomes and Measures: Risk-adjusted 90-day mortality estimated using hierarchical logistic regression and comparison of the relative safety of hospitals within each cancer network estimated using standardized mortality ratios. Results: A total of 17\u202f300 patients (59.2%; 8612 women and 8688 men; mean [SD] age, 74.7 [6.2] years) underwent complex cancer surgery at 59 top-ranked hospitals and 11\u202f928 patients (40.8%; 6287 women and 5641 men; mean [SD] age, 76.2 [6.9] years) underwent complex cancer surgery at 343 affiliated hospitals. Overall, surgery performed at affiliated hospitals was associated with higher 90-day mortality (odds ratio, 1.40; 95% CI, 1.23-1.59; P\u2009<\u2009.001), with odds ratios that ranged from 1.32 (95% CI, 1.12-1.56; P\u2009=\u2009.001) for colectomy to 2.04 (95% CI, 1.41-2.95; P\u2009<\u2009.001) for gastrectomy. When the relative safety of each top-ranked cancer hospital was compared with its collective affiliates, the top-ranked hospital was safer than the affiliates in 41 of 49 studied networks (83.7%; 95% CI, 73.1%-93.3%). Conclusions and Relevance: The likelihood of surviving complex cancer surgery appears to be greater at top-ranked cancer hospitals compared with the affiliated hospitals that share their brand. Further investigation of performance across trusted cancer networks could enhance informed decision making for complex cancer care. ",
        "Association Between Recreational Marijuana Legalization in the United States and Changes in Marijuana Use and Cannabis Use Disorder From 2008 to 2016. Importance: Little is known about changes in marijuana use and cannabis use disorder (CUD) after recreational marijuana legalization (RML). Objectives: To examine the associations between RML enactment and changes in marijuana use, frequent use, and CUD in the United States from 2008 to 2016. Design, Setting, and Participants: This survey study used repeated cross-sectional survey data from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (2008-2016) conducted in the United States among participants in the age groups of 12 to 17, 18 to 25, and 26 years or older. Interventions: Multilevel logistic regression models were fit to obtain estimates of before-vs-after changes in marijuana use among respondents in states enacting RML compared to changes in other states. Main Outcomes and Measures: Self-reported past-month marijuana use, past-month frequent marijuana use, past-month frequent use among past-month users, past-year CUD, and past-year CUD among past-year users. Results: The study included 505\u202f796 respondents consisting of 51.51% females and 77.24% participants 26 years or older. Among the total, 65.43% were white, 11.90% black, 15.36% Hispanic, and 7.31% of other race/ethnicity. Among respondents aged 12 to 17 years, past-year CUD increased from 2.18% to 2.72% after RML enactment, a 25% higher increase than that for the same age group in states that did not enact RML (odds ratio [OR], 1.25; 95% CI, 1.01-1.55). Among past-year marijuana users in this age group, CUD increased from 22.80% to 27.20% (OR, 1.27; 95% CI, 1.01-1.59). Unmeasured confounders would need to be more prevalent in RML states and increase the risk of cannabis use by 1.08 to 1.11 times to explain observed results, indicating results that are sensitive to omitted variables. No associations were found among the respondents aged 18 to 25 years. Among respondents 26 years or older, past-month marijuana use after RML enactment increased from 5.65% to 7.10% (OR, 1.28; 95% CI, 1.16-1.40), past-month frequent use from 2.13% to 2.62% (OR, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.08-1.41), and past-year CUD from 0.90% to 1.23% (OR, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.08-1.71); these results were more robust to unmeasured confounding. Among marijuana users in this age group, past-month frequent marijuana use and past-year CUD did not increase after RML enactment. Conclusions and Relevance: This study's findings suggest that although marijuana legalization advanced social justice goals, the small post-RML increase in risk for CUD among respondents aged 12 to 17 years and increased frequent use and CUD among adults 26 years or older in this study are a potential public health concern. To undertake prevention efforts, further studies are warranted to assess how these increases occur and to identify subpopulations that may be especially vulnerable. ",
        "Sleep Duration and Sleep Quality in Caregivers of Patients With Dementia: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis. Importance: In the United States, 16 million family caregivers provide long-term care for patients with dementia. Although one's physical, mental, and cognitive health depends on sleep, many caregivers experience chronic stress, and stress is typically associated with worse sleep quantity and quality. Objective: To quantify the extent, nature, and treatability of sleep problems in dementia caregivers. Data Sources: PubMed and Scopus databases were systematically searched for articles published through June 2018 using the following keywords: caregiver or spouse or caretaker AND sleep or circadian AND dementia or Alzheimer. Backward citation tracking was performed, and corresponding authors were contacted for additional data to conduct meta-analyses and pooled analyses. Study Selection: Two reviewers independently screened 805 studies to identify those that reported sleep duration or sleep quality in caregivers of patients with dementia. Data Extraction and Synthesis: Following the PRISMA guidelines, 2 reviewers independently extracted data from all studies and conducted National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute study quality assessments. Meta-analyses with random-effects models were performed to evaluate sleep duration, sleep quality, and sleep interventions in dementia caregivers. Main Outcomes and Measures: Sleep quality and total sleep time were measured by polysomnography, actigraphy, and self-report. Results: Thirty-five studies were analyzed with data from 3268 caregivers (pooled mean age [SD of sample means], 63.48 [5.99] years; 76.7% female) were analyzed. Relative to age-matched control noncaregiver adults, caregivers had lower sleep durations akin to losing 2.42 to 3.50 hours each week (Hedges g\u2009=\u2009-0.29; 95% CI, -0.48 to -0.09; P\u2009=\u2009.01). Sleep quality was significantly lower in caregivers (Hedges g\u2009=\u2009-0.66; 95% CI, -0.89 to -0.42; P\u2009<\u2009.001), but caregivers who underwent sleep intervention trials had better sleep quality than caregivers who did not receive a sleep intervention (Hedges g\u2009=\u20090.35; 95% CI, 0.20-0.49; P\u2009<\u2009.001). Conclusions and Relevance: Sleep debt is known to have cumulative associations with physical, mental, and cognitive health; therefore, poor sleep quality in dementia caregivers should be recognized and addressed. Although the caregiving role is stressful and cognitively demanding by its nature, better sleep quality was observed in caregivers who received low-cost behavioral interventions. ",
        "Association of Intraocular Cataract Lens Replacement With Circadian Rhythms, Cognitive Function, and Sleep in Older Adults. Importance: Cataract is associated with a progressive decline in light transmission due to the clouding and yellowing of the natural crystalline lens. While the downstream effects of aging lenses include long-term disruption of circadian rhythms, cognitive function, and sleep regulation, it remains unknown whether there is an association of intraocular cataract lens (IOLs) replacement with circadian rhythms, cognition, and sleep. Objective: To test whether IOL replacement (blue blocking [BB] or ultraviolet [UV] only blocking) in older patients with previous cataract is associated with the beneficial light effects on the circadian system, cognition, and sleep regulation. Design, Setting, and Participants: Cross-sectional study at the Centre for Chronobiology, University of Basel in Switzerland from February 2012 to April 2014, analyzed between June 2012 and September 2018. Sixteen healthy older controls and 13 patients with previous cataract and IOL replacement participated without medication and no medical and sleep comorbidities. Exposures: Three and a half hours of prior light control (dim-dark adaptation), followed by 2 hours of evening blue-enriched (6500 K) or non-blue-enriched light exposure (3000 K and 2500 K), 30 minutes in dim post-light exposure,\u20098 hours of sleep opportunity, and 2 hours of morning dim light following sleep. Main Outcomes and Measures: Salivary melatonin, cognitive tests, and sleep structure and electroencephalographic activity to test the association of IOLs with markers of circadian rhythmicity, cognitive performance, and sleep regulation, respectively. Results: The participants included 16 healthy older controls with a mean (standard error of the mean [SEM]) of 63.6\u2009(5.6) years; 8 women and 13 patients with previous cataract (mean [SEM] age, 69.9\u2009[5.2] years; 10 women); 5 patients had UV IOLs and 8 had BB IOLs. Patients with previous cataract and IOLs had an attenuated increase in melatonin levels during light exposure (mean [SEM] increase in the BB group: 23.3%\u2009[2.6%] and in the UV lens group: 19.1%\u2009[2.1%]) than controls (mean [SEM] increase, 48.8%\u2009[5.2%]) (difference between means, 27.7; 95% CI, 15.4%-41.7%; P\u2009<\u2009.001). Cognitive function, indexed by sustained attention performance, was improved in patients with UV lens (mean [SEM], 276.9\u2009[11.1] milliseconds) compared with patients with BB lens (mean [SEM], 348.3\u2009[17.8] milliseconds) (difference between means, 71.4; 95% CI, 29.5%-113.1%; P\u2009=\u2009.002) during light exposure and in the morning after sleep. Patients with UV lens had increased slow-wave sleep (mean [SEM] increase, 13%\u2009[3.4%]) compared with controls (mean [SEM] increase, 5.2%\u2009[0.8%]) (percentage of total sleep time; difference between means, 7.9; 95% CI, 2.4%-13.4%; P\u2009=\u2009.02) and frontal non-rapid eye movement slow-wave activity (0.75-4.5 Hz) during the first sleep cycle (mean [SEM], 79.9\u2009[13.6] \u03bcV2/Hz) compared with patients with BB lens (mean [SEM], 53.2\u2009[10.7] \u03bcV2/Hz) (difference between means, 26.7; 95% CI, 9.2-48.9; P\u2009=\u2009.03). Conclusions and Relevance: These in-laboratory empirical findings suggest that optimizing the spectral lens transmission in patients with previous cataract may minimize the adverse age-related effects on circadian rhythms, cognition, and sleep.

        "Association of Cataract Surgical Outcomes With Late Surgeon Career Stages: A Population-Based Cohort Study. Importance: Evidence suggests that the quality of some aspects of care provided by physicians may decrease during their late career stage. However, to our knowledge, data regarding the association of advancing surgeon career phase with cataract surgical outcomes have been lacking. Objective: To investigate whether an increase in cataract surgical adverse events occurs during later surgeon career stages. Design, Setting, and Participants: This population-based study of 499\u202f650 cataract operations performed in Ontario, Canada, between January 1, 2009, and December 31, 2013, investigated the association between late surgeon career stage and the risk of surgical adverse events. Linked health care databases were used to study cataract surgical complications while controlling for patient-, surgeon-, and institution-level covariates. All ophthalmologists who performed cataract surgery in Ontario within the study period were included in the analysis. Exposures: Isolated cataract surgery performed by surgeons at early, mid, and late career stages. Main Outcomes and Measures: Four serious adverse events were evaluated: dropped lens fragments, posterior capsule rupture, suspected endophthalmitis, and retinal detachment. Results: Of 416\u202f502 participants, 244\u202f670 (58.7%) were women, 90\u202f429 (21.7%) were age 66 to 70 years, 111\u202f530 (26.8%) were age 71 to 75 years, 90\u202f809 (21.8%) were age 76 to 80 years, and 123\u202f734 (29.7%) were 81 years or older. Late-career surgeons performed 143\u202f108 of 499\u202f650 cataract operations (28.6%) during the study period. Late surgeon career stage was not associated with an increased overall risk of surgical adverse events (odds ratio [OR] vs midcareer, 1.06; 95% CI, 0.85-1.32). In a sensitivity analysis with surgeon volume removed from the model, late career stage was still not associated with overall adverse surgical events (OR, 1.10; 95% CI, 0.88-1.38). Among individual complications, late surgeon career stage was associated with an increased risk of dropped lens fragment (OR, 2.30; 95% CI, 1.50-3.54) and suspected endophthalmitis (OR, 1.41; 95% CI, 1.01-1.98). These corresponded with small absolute risk differences of 0.11% (95% CI, 0.085%-0.130%) and 0.045% (95% CI, 0.028%-0.063%) for dropped lens fragment and suspected endophthalmitis, respectively. Conclusions and Relevance: These findings suggest that later-career surgeons are performing a substantial proportion of cataract operations with overall low surgical adverse event rates. Future studies might extend evaluations to the frequency of secondary surgical interventions as additional measures of surgical care quality. ",
        "Infant and Youth Mortality Trends by Race/Ethnicity and Cause of Death in the United States. Importance: The United States has higher infant and youth mortality rates than other high-income countries, with striking disparities by racial/ethnic group. Understanding changing trends by age and race/ethnicity for leading causes of death is imperative for focused intervention. Objective: To estimate trends in US infant and youth mortality rates from 1999 to 2015 by age group and race/ethnicity, identify leading causes of death, and compare mortality rates with Canada and England/Wales. Design, Setting, and Participants: This descriptive study analyzed death certificate data from the US National Center for Health Statistics, Statistics Canada, and the UK Office of National Statistics for all deaths among individuals younger than 25 years. The study took place from January 1, 1999, to December 31, 2015, and analyses started in September 2017. Exposures: Race/ethnicity. Main Outcomes and Measures: Average annual percent changes in mortality rates from 1999 to 2015 and absolute rate change between 1999 to 2002 and 2012 to 2015 for each age group, race/ethnicity, and cause of death. Results: Among individuals from birth to age 24 years, 1\u202f169\u202f537 deaths occurred in the United States, 80\u202f540 in Canada, and 121\u202f183 in England/Wales from 1999 to 2015. In the United States, 64% of deaths occurred in male individuals and 52.6% occurred in white individuals (25.1% deaths occurred in black individuals and 17.9% in Latino individuals). All-cause mortality declined for all age groups (infants younger than 1 year [38.5% of deaths], children aged 1-9 years [10.6%], early adolescents aged 10-14 years [5%], late adolescents aged 15-19 years [17.7%], and young adults aged 20-24 years [28.1%]) in the United States, Canada, and England/Wales from 1999 to 2015. However, rates were highest in the United States. Within the United States, annual declines in all-cause mortality rates occurred among all age groups of black, Latino, and white individuals, except for white individuals aged 20 to 24 years, whose rates remained stable. Mortality rates declined across most major causes of death from 1999 to 2002 and 2012 to 2015, with notable declines observed for sudden infant death syndrome, unintentional injury death, and homicides. Among infants, unintentional suffocation and strangulation in bed increased (difference between 2012-2015 and 1999-2002 range, 6.11-29.03 per 100\u202f000). Further, suicide rates among Latino and white individuals aged 10 to 24 years (range, 0.21-2.63 per 100\u202f000) and black individuals aged 10 to 19 years (range, 0.10-0.45 per 100\u202f000) increased, as did unintentional injury deaths in white young adults (0.79 per 100\u202f000). The rise in unintentional injury deaths is attributed to increases in drug poisonings and was also observed in black and Latino young adults. Conclusions and Relevance: Mortality rates in the United States have generally declined for infants and youths from 1999 to 2015 owing to reductions in sudden infant death syndrome, unintentional injury death, and homicides. However, US mortality rates remain higher than Canada and England/Wales, with particularly elevated rates among black and American Indian/Alaskan Native youth. Further, there is a concerning increase in suicide and drug poisoning death rates among US adolescents and young adults. ",
        "United States State-Level Variation in the Use of Neuraxial Analgesia During Labor for Pregnant Women. Importance: Neuraxial labor analgesia is recognized as the most effective method of providing pain relief during labor. Little is known about variation in the rates of neuraxial analgesia across US states. Identifying the presence and extent of variation may provide insights into practice variation and may indicate where access to neuraxial analgesia is inadequate. Objective: To test the hypothesis that variation exists in neuraxial labor analgesia use among US states. Design, Setting, and Participants: Retrospective, population-based, cross-sectional analysis using US birth certificate data. Participants were 2\u202f625\u202f950 women who underwent labor in 2015. Main Outcomes and Measures: State-specific prevalence of neuraxial analgesia per 100 women who underwent labor and variability in neuraxial analgesia use among states, assessed using multilevel multivariable regression modeling with the median odds ratio and the intraclass correlation coefficient to evaluate variation by state. Results: In the study population of 2\u202f625\u202f950 women, 0.1% (n\u2009=\u20092010) were younger than 15 years, 7.0% (n\u2009=\u2009183 546) were between the ages of 15 and 19 years, 23.6% (n\u2009=\u2009620 118) were between the ages of 20 and 24 years, 29.6% (n\u2009=\u2009777 957) were between the ages of 25 and 29 years, 26.0% (n\u2009=\u2009683 656) were between the ages of 30 and 34 years, 11.4% (n\u2009=\u2009298 237) were between the ages of 35 and 39 years, 2.2% (n\u2009=\u200957 130) were between the ages of 40 and 44 years, and 0.1% (n\u2009=\u20093296) were between the ages of 45 and 54 years. More than 90% were privately insured or insured with Medicaid. Neuraxial analgesia was used by 73.1% (n\u2009=\u20091\u202f920\u202f368) of women. After adjustment for antepartum, obstetric, and intrapartum factors, Maine had the lowest neuraxial analgesia prevalence (36.6%; 95% CI, 33.2%-40.1%) and Nevada the highest (80.1%; 95% CI, 78.3%-81.7%). The adjusted median odds ratio was 1.5 (95% CI, 1.4-1.6), and the intraclass correlation coefficient was 5.4% (95% CI, 4.0%-7.9%). Conclusions and Relevance: Results of this study suggest that a small portion of the overall variation in neuraxial analgesia use is explained by US states. Unmeasured patient-level and hospital-level factors likely account for a large portion of the variation between states. Efforts should be made to understand what the main reasons are for this variation and whether the variation influences maternal or perinatal outcomes. ",
        "Association of Cumulative Socioeconomic and Health-Related Disadvantage With Disparities in Smoking Prevalence in the United States, 2008 to 2017. Importance: Understanding emerging patterns of smoking disparities among disadvantaged populations can guide tobacco control policy. Objective: To estimate disparities in smoking prevalence associated with the number of socioeconomic and health-related disadvantages faced by a population among US adults from 2008 to 2017. Design, Setting, and Participants: Nationally representative cross-sectional annual household-based probability sample of US noninstitutionalized residents. Polytomous regression estimated associations of disadvantage variables, survey year, and their interaction with the following 3 pairwise contrasts: current vs never smoking (estimate of overall disparities), current vs former smoking (unique contribution of disparities in smoking cessation), and former vs never smoking (unique contribution of disparities in smoking initiation). The setting was in-home face-to-face interviews. Participants were respondents in 2008 to 2017 survey years who were aged 25 years or older (N\u2009=\u2009279 559). Exposures: Self-reported past-year unemployment, income below the federal poverty line, absence of high school diploma, disability/limitation interfering with daily functions, serious psychological distress on the Kessler 6-item screen, and at least 60 past-year heavy drinking days, each coded yes or no. These indicators were summed in a cumulative disadvantage index (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 or 6). Main Outcomes and Measures: Self-reported current, former (ever smoked \u2265100 cigarettes, had since quit, and not currently smoking), and never (<100 cigarettes) smoking. Results: Among 278 048 respondents (mean [SD] age, 51.9 [16.8] years; 55.7% female) with data on smoking history (99.5% of the sample), the mean current smoking prevalence across 2008 to 2017 compared with populations without disadvantages was successively higher among populations with 1 disadvantage (21.4% vs 13.8%; current vs never smoking adjusted odds ratio [OR], 2.34; 95% CI, 2.27-2.43), 2 disadvantages (26.6% vs 13.8%; OR, 3.55; 95% CI, 3.39-3.72), 3 disadvantages (35.1% vs 13.8%; OR, 5.35; 95% CI, 5.05-5.66), 4 disadvantages (45.7% vs 13.8%; OR, 8.59; 95% CI, 7.91-9.34), or 5 or 6 disadvantages (58.2% vs 13.8%; OR, 14.70; 95% CI, 12.30-17.50). In current vs former and former vs never smoking status contrasts, ORs were lower but also showed successively greater associations with increasing cumulative disadvantage. Current (vs never) smoking odds significantly declined each year among populations with 0 (OR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.94-0.96), 1 (OR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.95-0.97), or 2 (OR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.97-0.99) disadvantages but did not change across 2008 to 2017 among those with 3 or more disadvantages. Conclusions and Relevance: Results of this study demonstrate that US disparities in smoking prevalence from 2008 to 2017 were successively larger with each additional disadvantage faced, were expressed in higher smoking initiation odds and lower smoking cessation odds, and widened over time.

        "Association of Team Sports Participation With Long-term Mental Health Outcomes Among Individuals Exposed to Adverse Childhood Experiences. Importance: Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) are associated with long-term poor mental health. Less is known about factors that improve long-term mental health among those with ACEs. Objective: To evaluate, among those exposed to ACEs, whether team sports participation during adolescence is associated with better mental health in adulthood and whether the association between team sports participation and mental health varies by sex. Design, Setting, and Participants: This study used data from 9668 individuals who participated in waves 1 (1994-1995) and 4 (2008) of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health. Individuals were included if they had complete data on exposure to ACEs (physical and sexual abuse, emotional neglect, parental alcohol misuse, parental incarceration, and living with a single parent) and a valid sample weight. Statistical analysis was performed from November 6, 2017, to January 4, 2019. Main Outcomes and Measures: The association between team sports participation in grades 7 to 12 (wave 1) and diagnosis of depression and/or anxiety and current depressive symptoms (determined by Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale-10 scores) at ages 24 to 32 years (wave 4) among individuals exposed to ACEs. Multivariable logistic regression models were weighted based on propensity scores for factors associated with team sports participation and controlled for individual, family, and school characteristics. Interaction terms tested whether associations between team sports participation and mental health varied by sex. Results: Of 9668 individuals included in the study (4470 male [50.0%]; mean [SD] age, 15.2 [1.75] years), 4888 (49.3%) reported 1 or more ACE and 2084 (21.3%) reported 2 or more ACEs. Among those with ACEs, team sports participation during adolescence was significantly associated with lower odds of receiving a diagnosis of depression (unadjusted rate, 16.8% vs 22.0%; propensity score-weighted [PSW] adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 0.76; 95% CI, 0.59-0.97) or anxiety (11.8% vs 16.8%; PSW aOR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.56-0.89) and having current depressive symptoms (21.9% vs 27.5%; PSW aOR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.71-1.01). There were no significant differences in associations between team sports participation and mental health by sex. Stratified analyses showed significant associations for all outcomes among males (depression: PSW aOR, 0.67 [95% CI, 0.46-0.99]; anxiety: PSW aOR, 0.66 [95% CI, 0.45-0.96]; depressive symptoms: PSW aOR, 0.75 [95% CI 0.56-0.99]) but only 1 outcome among females (anxiety: PSW aOR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.54-0.98). Conclusions and Relevance: Among individuals affected by ACEs, team sports participation in adolescence was associated with better adult mental health. Team sports may be an important and scalable resilience builder. ",
        "Association of Slight to Mild Hearing Loss With Behavioral Problems and School Performance in Children. Importance: Children with severe hearing loss are known to have more behavioral problems and may perform worse at school than children without. Few large-scale studies of slight to mild hearing loss are available. Objective: To examine the relevance of slight to mild hearing loss by studying its association with behavioral problems and school performance. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cross-sectional study was performed within an ongoing prospective birth cohort study in Rotterdam, the Netherlands. Participants were part of a population-based sample of children. Between ages 9 and 11 years, 5355 children underwent audiometric and behavioral evaluations. Children were excluded if they had missing data for either audiometry or both outcomes. Data were collected from April 2012 through October 2015. Data were analyzed from March to June 2018. Exposures: Audiometric evaluation included pure-tone audiometry tests and speech-in-noise testing. Main Outcomes and Measures: Child behavior was rated by the primary caregiver using the Child Behavior Checklist at ages 9 to 11 years (n\u2009=\u20094471). School performance was measured with a standardized test at age 12 years (n\u2009=\u20092399). Results: The final sample included 4779 participants who were a mean (SD) age of 9.8 (0.3) years. The sample had nearly equal distribution between boys (n\u2009=\u20092200; 49.2%) and girls (n\u2009=\u20092271; 50.8%). Associations of hearing thresholds with behavioral problems differed between boys and girls. Among boys, higher pure-tone hearing thresholds at low frequencies were associated with higher total problem, social problem, and attention problem scores (total problems for the better-hearing ear: \u03b2\u2009=\u20090.01; 95% CI, 0-0.02). Higher speech reception thresholds were associated with higher attention problem scores among girls (\u03b2\u2009=\u20090.04; 95% CI, 0-0.08). Higher speech reception thresholds were associated with poorer school performance scores for both boys and girls (\u03b2\u2009=\u2009-0.06; 95% CI, -0.10 to -0.02). Conclusions and Relevance: Higher hearing thresholds during pure-tone audiometric and speech-in-noise testing were associated with higher behavioral problem scores and poorer school performance. This supports the relevance of slight to mild hearing loss with these outcomes in school-aged children. ",
        "Association of Childhood Lead Exposure With Adult Personality Traits and Lifelong Mental Health. Importance: Millions of adults now entering middle age were exposed to high levels of lead, a developmental neurotoxin, as children. Although childhood lead exposure has been linked to disrupted behavioral development, the long-term consequences for adult mental and behavioral health have not been fully characterized. Objective: To examine whether childhood lead exposure is associated with greater psychopathology across the life course and difficult adult personality traits. Design, Setting, and Participants: This prospective cohort study was based on a population-representative birth cohort of individuals born between April 1, 1972, and March 31, 1973, in Dunedin, New Zealand, the Dunedin Multidisciplinary Health and Development Study. Members were followed up in December 2012 when they were 38 years of age. Data analysis was performed from March 14, 2018, to October 24, 2018. Exposures: Childhood lead exposure ascertained as blood lead levels measured at 11 years of age. Blood lead levels were unrelated to family socioeconomic status. Main Outcomes and Measures: Primary outcomes were adult mental health disorder symptoms assessed through clinical interview at 18, 21, 26, 32, and 38 years of age and transformed through confirmatory factor analysis into continuous measures of general psychopathology and internalizing, externalizing, and thought disorder symptoms (all standardized to a mean [SD] of 100 [15]) and adult personality assessed through informant report using the Big Five Personality Inventory (assessing neuroticism, extraversion, openness to experience, agreeableness, and conscientiousness) at 26, 32, and 38 years of age (all scores standardized to a mean [SD] of 0 [1]). Hypotheses were formulated after data collection; an analysis plan was posted in advance. Results: Of 1037 original study members, 579 (55.8%) were tested for lead exposure at 11 years of age (311 [53.7%] male). The mean (SD) blood lead level was 11.08 (4.96) \u03bcg/dL. After adjusting for study covariates, each 5-\u03bcg/dL increase in childhood blood lead level was associated with a 1.34-point increase (95% CI, 0.11-2.57; P\u2009=\u2009.03) in general psychopathology, driven by internalizing (b\u2009=\u20091.41; 95% CI, 0.19-2.62; P\u2009=\u2009.02) and thought disorder (b\u2009=\u20091.30; 95% CI, 0.06-2.54; P\u2009=\u2009.04) symptoms. Each 5-\u03bcg/dL increase in childhood blood lead level was also associated with a 0.10-SD increase in neuroticism (95% CI, 0.02-0.08; P\u2009=\u2009.02), a 0.09-SD decrease in agreeableness (95% CI, -0.18 to -0.01; P\u2009=\u2009.03), and a 0.14-SD decrease in conscientiousness (95% CI, -0.25 to -0.03; P\u2009=\u2009.01). There were no statistically significant associations with informant-rated extraversion (b\u2009=\u2009-0.09; 95% CI, -0.17 to 0.004; P\u2009=\u2009.06) and openness to experience (b\u2009=\u2009-0.07; 95% CI, -0.17 to 0.03; P\u2009=\u2009.15). Conclusions and Relevance: In this multidecade, longitudinal study of lead-exposed children, higher childhood blood lead level was associated with greater psychopathology across the life course and difficult adult personality traits. Childhood lead exposure may have long-term consequences for adult mental health and personality. ",
        "Associations of Harsh Physical Punishment and Child Maltreatment in Childhood With Antisocial Behaviors in Adulthood. Importance: Inquiry into what childhood experiences are associated with antisocial behaviors in adulthood is necessary for prioritizing and informing efforts for effective prevention. Objective: To examine whether harsh physical punishment in the absence of child maltreatment and child maltreatment with and without harsh physical punishment are associated with antisocial behaviors in adulthood. Design, Setting, and Participants: Cross-sectional study using data on the general US population obtained from the National Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions Wave 3 from April 2012 to June 2013. Participants were civilian, noninstitutionalized adults 18 years and older. This study used a multistage probability sampling design (response rate, 60.1%). Data were analyzed from January 25 to November 27, 2018. Exposures: Harsh physical punishment included pushing, grabbing, shoving, slapping, and hitting. Child maltreatment included physical abuse, sexual abuse, emotional abuse, physical neglect, emotional neglect, and exposure to intimate partner violence. Main Outcomes or Measures: Lifetime antisocial personality disorder behaviors since age 15 years were assessed using the Alcohol Use Disorder and Associated Disabilities Interview Schedule-5 based on Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Fifth Edition) criteria. Results: The number of study participants was 36\u202f309, with 15 862 men (weighted percentage, 48.1%) and 20 447 women (weighted percentage, 51.9%); mean (SE) age was 46.54 (0.19) years. The prevalence of harsh physical punishment and child maltreatment was 18.1% and 46.7%, respectively. Harsh physical punishment only (adjusted \u03b2, 0.62; 95% CI,\u20090.50-0.75), child maltreatment only (adjusted \u03b2, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.60-0.69), and harsh physical punishment and child maltreatment (adjusted \u03b2, 1.46; 95% CI, 1.38-1.54) were associated with adult antisocial behaviors. It is estimated that harsh physical punishment and/or child maltreatment might account for approximately 45.5% of antisocial behaviors among men in the United States and 47.3% antisocial behaviors among women in the United States. Conclusions and Relevance: Harsh physical punishment and child maltreatment appear to be associated with adult antisocial behaviors. Preventing harsh physical punishment and child maltreatment in childhood may reduce antisocial behaviors among adults in the United States. ",
        "Association of Rotavirus Vaccination With Inpatient and Emergency Department Visits Among Children Seeking Care for Acute Gastroenteritis, 2010-2016. Importance: Rotavirus vaccines have been recommended for universal US infant immunization for more than 10 years, and understanding their effectiveness is key to the continued success of the US rotavirus vaccine immunization program. Objective: To assess the association of RotaTeq (RV5) and Rotarix (RV1) with inpatient and emergency department (ED) visits for rotavirus infection. Design, Setting, and Participants: This case-control vaccine effectiveness study was performed at inpatient and ED clinical settings in 7 US pediatric medical institutions from November 1, 2009, through June 30, 2016. Children younger than 5 years seeking medical care for acute gastroenteritis were enrolled. Clinical and epidemiologic data, vaccination verification, and results of stool sample tests for laboratory-confirmed rotavirus were collected. Data were analyzed from November 1, 2009, through June 30, 2016. Main Outcomes and Measures: Rotavirus vaccine effectiveness for preventing rotavirus-associated inpatient and ED visits over time for each licensed vaccine, stratified by clinical severity and age. Results: Among the 10 813 children included (5927 boys [54.8%] and 4886 girls [45.2%]; median [range] age, 21 [8-59] months), RV5 and RV1 analyses found that compared with controls, rotavirus-positive cases were more often white (RV5, 535 [62.2%] vs 3310 [57.7%]; RV1, 163 [43.1%] vs 864 [35.1%]), privately insured (RV5, 620 [72.1%] vs 4388 [76.5%]; RV1, 305 [80.7%] vs 2140 [87.0%]), and older (median [range] age for RV5, 26 [8-59] months vs 21 [8-59] months; median [range] age for RV1, 22 [8-59] months vs 19 [8-59] months) but did not differ by sex. Among 1193 rotavirus-positive cases and 9620 rotavirus-negative controls, at least 1 dose of any rotavirus vaccine was 82% (95% CI,\u200977%-86%) protective against rotavirus-associated inpatient visits and 75% (95% CI,\u200971%-79%) protective against rotavirus-associated ED visits. No statistically significant difference during this 7-year period was observed for either rotavirus vaccine. Vaccine effectiveness against inpatient and ED visits was 81% (95% CI,\u200978%-84%) for RV5 (3 doses) and 78% (95% CI,\u200972%-82%) for RV1 (2 doses) among the study population. A mixed course of both vaccines provided 86% (95% CI,\u200974%-93%) protection. Rotavirus patients who were not vaccinated had severe infections 4 times more often than those who were vaccinated (74 of 426 [17.4%] vs 28 of 605 [4.6%]; P\u2009<\u2009.001), and any dose of rotavirus vaccine was 65% (95% CI,\u200956%-73%) effective against mild infections, 81% (95% CI,\u200976%-84%) against moderate infections, and 91% (95% CI,\u200985%-95%) against severe infections. Conclusions and Relevance: Evidence from this large postlicensure study of rotavirus vaccine performance in the United States from 2010 to 2016 suggests that RV5 and RV1 rotavirus vaccines continue to perform well, particularly in preventing inpatient visits and severe infections and among younger children.

        "Association of Atopic Dermatitis With Sleep Quality in Children. Importance: Pruritus, a hallmark of atopic dermatitis (AD), is thought to disrupt sleep, yet little is known about how variations in disease activity and severity of this common childhood condition may be associated with sleep patterns over time. Objective: To determine whether children with active AD have impaired sleep duration and quality at multiple time points throughout childhood and whether disease severity affects sleep outcomes. Design, Setting, and Participants: This longitudinal cohort study used data of children enrolled in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children, a population-based birth cohort in Avon, United Kingdom. Participants were children (N\u2009=\u200913\u202f988) alive at 1 year and followed up with repeated measures of self-reported AD and sleep through 16 years of age. This study was based on data collected from 1990 to 2008. Data analysis was performed from September 2017 to September 2018. Main Outcomes and Measures: Standardized measure of sleep duration and composite measure of sleep quality, including nighttime awakenings, early morning awakenings, difficulty falling asleep, and nightmares, were repeated at multiple time points between 2 and 16 years of age. Results: The study sample comprised 13\u202f988 children (7220 male [51.6%]) followed up for a median (interquartile range [IQR]) duration of 11 (5-14) years. Of this total, 4938 children (35.3%) met the definition of having atopic dermatitis between 2 and 16 years of age. Total sleep duration was similar between children with active AD and without AD at all ages, and the average estimated difference across childhood was a clinically negligible difference of 2 minutes less per day for children with AD (95% CI, -4 to 0 minutes). In contrast, children with active AD were more likely to report worse sleep quality at all time points, with a nearly 50% higher odds of experiencing more sleep-quality disturbances (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.48; 95% CI, 1.33 to 1.66). Children with more severe active disease (quite bad or very bad AD: aOR, 1.68; 95% CI, 1.42 to 1.98) and with comorbid asthma or allergic rhinitis (aOR, 1.79; 95% CI, 1.54 to 2.09) had worse sleep quality. However, even children with mild AD (OR, 1.40; 95% CI, 1.27 to 1.54) or inactive AD (OR, 1.41; 95% CI, 1.28 to 1.55) had statistically significantly increased odds of impaired sleep quality. Conclusions and Relevance: Atopic dermatitis appeared to be associated with impaired sleep quality throughout childhood; thus, it is suggested that clinicians should consider sleep quality among all children with AD, especially those with comorbid asthma or allergic rhinitis and severe disease, and that interventions to improve sleep quality are needed.

        "Association of Maternal Social Relationships With Cognitive Development in Early Childhood. Importance: This study examines how different types of social network structures are associated with early cognitive development in children. Objectives: To assess how social relationships and structures are associated with early cognitive development and to elucidate whether variations in the mother's social networks alter a child's early cognitive development patterns. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study used data from 1082 mother-child pairs in the University of Tennessee Health Science Center-Conditions Affecting Neurocognitive Development and Learning and Early Childhood project to examine the association between networks of different levels of complexity (triad, family, and neighborhood) and child cognitive performance after adjustment for the mother's IQ, birth weight, and age, and the father's educational level. The final model was adjusted for the household poverty level. Data were collected from December 2006 through January 2014 and analyzed from October through November 2018. Exposures: The child-mother relationship, child-mother-father triad, family setting, child's dwelling network, mother's social support network, and neighborhood networks. Main Outcomes and Measures: Measure of cognitive development of the child using Bayley Scales of Infant Development (BSID) at 2 years of age. Results: Of 1082 participants, 544 (50.3%) were males and 703 (65.1%) were African American; the mean (SD) age was 2.08 (0.12) years. Large family size had a negative association with early cognitive development, with a mean 2.21-point decrease in BSID coefficient score (95% CI, 0.40 to 4.02; P\u2009=\u2009.01). Mother's social support network size was positively associated early cognitive development, with a mean 0.40-point increase in BSID coefficient score (95% CI, 0.001 to 0.80; P\u2009=\u2009.05). Knowing many neighbors was not statistically significantly associated with early cognitive development, with a mean 1.39-point increase in BSID coefficient score (95% CI, -0.04 to 2.83; P\u2009=\u2009.06). Conclusions and Relevance: The findings suggest that maternal social relationships are associated with cognitive development in children and that social relationships beyond the mother-child-father triad are significantly associated with children's cognitive development. This study investigates the environmental influences on child health outcomes and, specifically, how early cognitive development is associated with social networks for the primary caregiver. ",
        "Effect of Exposure to Gun Violence in Video Games on Children's Dangerous Behavior With Real Guns: A Randomized Clinical Trial. Importance: Among resource-rich countries, the United States has the highest rate of child mortality by unintentional firearm use. Objective: To test whether children's exposure to violent video games increases dangerous behavior around firearms. Design, Setting, and Participants: This randomized clinical trial was set in a university laboratory and included pairs of children aged 8 to 12 years who knew each other. Of 313 participants who signed up, 250 were tested (2 arrived without partners, 61 did not arrive to participate). Of the 250 children tested, 8 were excluded (2 did not complete the study, 2 had participated in a related study, and 4 were outliers). Each child was paid $25. Data were collected July 1, 2017, to July 31, 2018. Interventions: In a 3-group randomized design, pairs of children played or watched 1 of 3 versions of the game Minecraft for 20 minutes: (1) violent with guns, (2) violent with swords, or (3) nonviolent. The pairs of children were then placed in a different room and were told they could play with toys and games for 20 minutes. A cabinet in the room contained 2 hidden disabled handguns with counters for trigger pulls. Play sessions were videotaped. Main Outcomes and Measures: Main outcomes were touching a handgun, seconds spent holding a handgun, and number of trigger pulls (including at oneself or the partner). Control variables included sex, age, trait aggressiveness, exposure to violent media, attitudes toward guns, presence of firearms in the home, interest in firearms, and whether the child had taken a firearm safety course. Results: Of 242 participants, 220 children (mean [SD] age, 9.9 [1.4] years; 129 [58.6%] boys) found a gun and were included in analysis. Among the 76 children who played the video game that included gun violence, 47 children (61.8%) touched a handgun. Among the 74 children who played the video game that included sword violence, 42 (56.8%) touched a handgun. Among the 70 children who played the nonviolent video game, 31 (44.3%) touched a handgun. Participants who played a violent version of the game were more likely to shoot at themselves or their partners than those who played a nonviolent game. Other risk factors for dangerous behavior around firearms included self-reported habitual exposure to violent media and trait aggressiveness. Self-reported exposure to violent media was positively associated with total trigger pulls (incidence rate ratio [IRR], 1.40; 95% CI, 1.00-1.98) and trigger pulls at oneself or one's partner (IRR, 1.88; 95% CI, 1.29-2.72). Trait aggression was positively associated with total trigger pulls (IRR, 13.52; 95% CI, 3.14-58.29), trigger pulls at oneself or one's partner (IRR, 25.69; 95% CI, 5.92-111.39), and time spent holding a handgun (IRR, 4.22; 95% CI, 1.62-11.02). One protective factor was having taken a firearm safety training course. Conclusions and Relevance: Exposure to violent video games increases children's dangerous behavior around firearms. Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT03259139. ",
        "Association of Concussion Symptoms With Testosterone Levels and Erectile Dysfunction in Former Professional US-Style Football Players. Importance: Small studies suggest that head trauma in men may be associated with low testosterone levels and sexual dysfunction through mechanisms that likely include hypopituitarism secondary to ischemic injury and pituitary axonal tract damage. Athletes in contact sports may be at risk for pituitary insufficiencies or erectile dysfunction (ED) because of the high number of head traumas experienced during their careers. Whether multiple symptomatic concussive events are associated with later indicators of low testosterone levels and ED is unknown. Objective: To explore the associations between concussion symptom history and participant-reported indicators of low testosterone levels and ED. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cross-sectional study of former professional US-style football players was conducted in Boston, Massachusetts, from January 2015 to March 2017. Surveys on past football exposures, demographic factors, and current health conditions were sent via electronic and postal mail to participants within and outside of the United States. Analyses were conducted in Boston, Massachusetts; the data analysis began in March 2018 and additional analyses were performed through June 2019. Of the 13\u202f720 male former players eligible to enroll who were contacted, 3506 (25.6%) responded. Exposures: Concussion symptom score was calculated by summing the frequency with which participants reported 10 symptoms, such as loss of consciousness, disorientation, nausea, memory problems, and dizziness, at the time of football-related head injury. Main Outcomes and Measures: Self-reported recommendations or prescriptions for low testosterone or ED medication served as indicators for testosterone insufficiency and ED. Results: In 3409 former players (mean [SD] age, 52.5 [14.1] years), the prevalence of indicators of low testosterone levels and ED was 18.3% and 22.7%, respectively. The odds of reporting low testosterone levels or ED indicators were elevated for previously established risk factors (eg, diabetes, sleep apnea, and mood disorders). Models adjusted for demographic characteristics, football exposures, and current health factors showed a significant monotonically increasing association of concussion symptom score with the odds of reporting the low testosterone indicator (highest vs lowest quartile, odds ratio, 2.39; 95% CI, 1.79-3.19; P\u2009<\u2009.001). The ED indicator showed a similar association (highest quartile vs lowest, odds ratio, 1.72; 95% CI, 1.30-2.27; P\u2009<\u2009.001). Conclusions and Relevance: Concussion symptoms at the time of injury among former football players were associated with current participant-reported low testosterone levels and ED indicators. These findings suggest that men with a history of head injury may benefit from discussions with their health care clinicians regarding testosterone deficiency and sexual dysfunction. ",
        "Association of Alcohol Consumption After Development of Heart Failure With Survival Among Older Adults in the Cardiovascular Health Study. Importance: More than 1 million older adults develop heart failure annually. The association of alcohol consumption with survival among these individuals after diagnosis is unknown. Objective: To determine whether alcohol use is associated with increased survival among older adults with incident heart failure. Design, Setting, and Participants: This prospective cohort study included 5888 community-dwelling adults aged 65 years or older who were recruited to participate in the Cardiovascular Health Study between June 12, 1989, and June 1993, from 4 US sites. Of the total participants, 393 individuals had a new diagnosis of heart failure within the first 9 years of follow-up through June 2013. The study analysis was performed between January 19, 2016, and September 22, 2016. Exposures: Alcohol consumption was divided into 4 categories: abstainers (never drinkers), former drinkers, 7 or fewer alcoholic drinks per week, and more than 7 drinks per week. Primary Outcomes and Measures: Participant survival after the diagnosis of incident heart failure. Results: Among the 393 adults diagnosed with incident heart failure, 213 (54.2%) were female, 339 (86.3%) were white, and the mean (SD) age was 78.7 (6.0) years. Alcohol consumption after diagnosis was reported in 129 (32.8%) of the participants. Across alcohol consumption categories of long-term abstainers, former drinkers, consumers of 1-7 drinks weekly and consumers of more than 7 drinks weekly, the percentage of men (32.1%, 49.0%, 58.0%, and 82.4%, respectively; P\u2009<\u2009.001 for trend), white individuals (78.0%, 92.7%, 92.0%, and 94.1%, respectively, P\u2009<.\u2009001 for trend), and high-income participants (22.0%, 43.8%, 47.3%, and 64.7%, respectively; P\u2009<\u2009.001 for trend) increased with increasing alcohol consumption. Across the 4 categories, participants who consumed more alcohol had more years of education (mean, 12 years [interquartile range (IQR), 8.0-10.0 years], 12 years [IQR, 11.0-14.0 years], 13 years [IQR, 12.0-15.0 years], and 13 years [IQR, 12.0-14.0 years]; P\u2009<\u2009.001 for trend). Diabetes was less common across the alcohol consumption categories (32.1%, 26.0%, 22.3%, and 5.9%, respectively; P\u2009=\u2009.01 for trend). Across alcohol consumption categories, there were fewer never smokers (58.3%, 44.8%, 35.7%, and 29.4%, respectively; P\u2009<\u2009.001 for trend) and more former smokers (34.5%, 38.5%, 50.0%, and 52.9%, respectively; P\u2009=\u2009.006 for trend). After controlling for other factors, consumption of 7 or fewer alcoholic drinks per week was associated with additional mean survival of 383 days (95% CI, 17-748 days; P\u2009=\u2009.04) compared with abstinence from alcohol. Although the robustness was limited by the small number of individuals who consumed more than 7 drinks per week, a significant inverted U-shaped association between alcohol consumption and survival was observed. Multivariable model estimates of mean time from heart failure diagnosis to death were 2640 days (95% CI, 1967-3313 days) for never drinkers, 3046 days (95% CI, 2372-3719 days) for consumers of 0 to 7 drinks per week, and 2806 (95% CI, 1879-3734 days) for consumers of more than 7 drinks per week (P\u2009=\u2009.02). Consumption of 10 drinks per week was associated with the longest survival, a mean of 3381 days (95% CI, 2806-3956 days) after heart failure diagnosis. Conclusions and Relevance: These findings suggest that limited alcohol consumption among older adults with incident heart failure is associated with survival benefit compared with long-term abstinence. These findings suggest that older adults who develop heart failure may not need to abstain from moderate levels of alcohol consumption. ",
        "Association of Time Since Injury to the First Clinic Visit With Recovery Following Concussion. Importance: Recovery after concussion varies, with adolescents taking longer (approximately 30 days) than adults. Many factors have been reported to influence recovery, including preinjury factors, perceptions about recovery, comorbid conditions, and sex. However, 1 factor that may play a role in recovery but has received little attention from researchers is the timeliness of clinical evaluation and care. Objective: To investigate the association of time since injury with initiation of clinical care on recovery time following concussion. Design, Setting, and Participants: This retrospective, cross-sectional study was conducted in a sports medicine clinic between August 2016 and March 2018. Eligible participants were aged 12 to 22 years and had a diagnosed, symptomatic concussion; patients were excluded if recovery data were incomplete. Participants were divided into 2 groups: those seen within 7 days of the injury (early) vs between 8 and 20 days of the injury (late). Data were analyzed between June 2019 and August 2019. Exposures: Time from injury (concussion) to initiation of clinical care. Main Outcomes and Measures: Recovery time; testing with the Post-Concussion Symptom Scale, Immediate Post-Concussion Assessment and Cognitive Testing, and Vestibular/Ocular Motor Screening instruments; demographic factors, medical history, and injury information. Results: A total of 416 individuals were eligible, and 254 (61.1%) were excluded, leaving 162 (38.9%) in analyses. The early group (98 patients) and late group (64 patients) did not differ in age (mean [SD] age, early, 15.3 [1.6] years; late, 15.4 [1.6] years), number of female patients (early, 51 of 98 [52.0%]; late, 40 of 64 [62.5%]), or other demographic, medical history, or injury information. The groups also were similar on symptom severity, cognitive, ocular, and vestibular outcomes at the first clinic visit. Results from a logistical regression supported being in the late group (adjusted odds ratio, 5.8 [95% CI, 1.9-17.6]; P\u2009=\u2009.001) and visual motion sensitivity symptoms greater than 2 (adjusted odds ratio, 4.5 [95% CI, 1.1-18.0]; P\u2009=\u2009.04) as factors significantly associated with recovery time. Conclusions and Relevance: Findings suggest that earlier initiation of clinical care is associated with faster recovery after concussion. Other factors may also influence recovery time. Further research is needed to determine the role of active rehabilitation and treatment strategies, as well as demographic factors, medical history, and injury characteristics on the current findings.

        "Differences in the Intended Meaning of Congestion Between Patients and Clinicians. Importance: Disagreement in the presumed meaning of common medical terms may impair communication between patients and caregivers. Objective: To clarify the intended meaning of the term congestion among otolaryngology clinic patients and to identify discrepancies in definitions between patients and otolaryngologists. Design, Setting, and Participants: In this cross-sectional survey study from an otolaryngology clinic at an academic center, a semantics-based questionnaire was provided to consecutive new patients during intake for a clinical encounter from December 2016 through February 2017, and to 31 otolaryngologists and 28 nonotolaryngologist physicians in February 2018. Respondent definitions for congestion were selected from a list of 16 proposed terms covering 4 general categories. Main Outcome and Measures: Symptom categories for term used to describe congestion by patients and clinicians. Results: Among 226 patient respondents (133 female [58.8%]; mean [SD] age, 54 [15.6] years), the most commonly selected definitions for congestion were from the obstructive (199; 88.1%) and mucus-related (196; 86.7%) symptom categories. More than 1 general category was selected by 208 patients (92.0%), whereas 11 patients (4.9%) described congestion only in terms of mucus-related symptoms. Definitions were limited to upper respiratory tract symptoms by 83 (36.7%) patients and lower respiratory tract symptoms by 2 (0.9%) patients. Among 31 otolaryngologists, congestion was most frequently defined in terms of obstructive symptoms (difference, 11.9%; 95% CI, 7.4%-16.5%). In contrast, patients more often described congestion in terms of pressure-related (difference, 38.8%; 95% CI, 7.5%-70.1%) or mucus-related (difference, 51.2%; 95% CI, 22.6%-79.9%) symptoms. A total of 22 otolaryngologists (71.0%) defined congestion using 1 to 4 symptoms, compared with only 69 patients (30.5%). Conclusions and Relevance: The definition of congestion appears to be highly variable and ambiguous for many patients. Moreover, the findings suggest that patients and otolaryngologists generally do not describe congestion using the same terms. ",
        "Assessment of Employee Susceptibility to Phishing Attacks at US Health Care Institutions. Importance: Cybersecurity is an increasingly important threat to health care delivery, and email phishing is a major attack vector against hospital employees. Objective: To describe the practice of phishing simulation and the extent to which health care employees are vulnerable to phishing simulations. Design, Setting, and Participants: Retrospective, multicenter quality improvement study of a convenience sample of 6 geographically dispersed US health care institutions that ran phishing simulations from August 1, 2011, through April 10, 2018. The specific institutions are anonymized herein for security and privacy concerns. Exposures: Simulated phishing emails received by employees at US health care institutions. Main Outcomes and Measures: Date of phishing campaign, campaign number, number of emails sent, number of emails clicked, and email content. Emails were classified into 3 categories (office related, personal, or information technology related). Results: The final study sample included 6 anonymized US health care institutions, 95 simulated phishing campaigns, and 2\u202f971\u202f945 emails, 422\u202f062 of which were clicked (14.2%). The median institutional click rates for campaigns ranged from 7.4% (interquartile range [IQR], 5.8%-9.6%) to 30.7% (IQR, 25.2%-34.4%), with an overall median click rate of 16.7% (IQR, 8.3%-24.2%) across all campaigns and institutions. In the regression model, repeated phishing campaigns were associated with decreased odds of clicking on a subsequent phishing email (adjusted OR, 0.511; 95% CI, 0.382-0.685 for 6-10 campaigns; adjusted OR, 0.335; 95% CI, 0.282-0.398 for >10 campaigns). Conclusions and Relevance: Among a sample of US health care institutions that sent phishing simulations, almost 1 in 7 simulated emails sent were clicked on by employees. Increasing campaigns were associated with decreased odds of clicking on a phishing email, suggesting a potential benefit of phishing simulation and awareness. With cyberattacks increasing against US health care systems, these click rates represent a major cybersecurity risk for hospitals. ",
        "Alcohol Consumption and Risk of Dementia and Cognitive Decline Among Older Adults With or Without Mild Cognitive Impairment. Importance: Substantial heterogeneity and uncertainty exist in the observed associations between alcohol consumption and dementia. Objective: To assess the association between alcohol consumption and dementia and the roles of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and apolipoprotein E \u03b54 (APOE E4) genotype in modifying this association. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study used data from the Ginkgo Evaluation of Memory Study, conducted from 2000 to 2008 among US community-dwelling participants. This study analyzed 3021 participants aged 72 years and older who were free of dementia. Data analysis was performed from 2017 to 2018. Exposures: Self-reported alcohol consumption, drinking frequency, and quantity. Main Outcomes and Measures: Using multivariable proportional hazards regression and linear mixed models, the risk of dementia and the rate of change over time in the Modified Mini-Mental State Examination were estimated. Results: Among 3021 participants, the median (interquartile range) age was 78 (76-80) years; 1395 (46.2%) were female. During a median (interquartile range) follow-up of 6.0 (4.9-6.5) years, 512 cases of dementia occurred. For 7.1 to 14.0 drinks per week compared with less than 1.0 drink per week, the hazard ratios for dementia were 0.63 (95% CI, 0.38-1.06) among 2548 participants without MCI and 0.93 (95% CI, 0.47-1.84) among\u2009473 participants with MCI. Among participants with MCI, the hazard ratio for dementia was 1.72 (95% CI, 0.87-3.40) for more than 14.0 drinks per week compared with less than 1.0 drink per week. The association of alcohol intake with dementia differed for participants with and without baseline MCI (P for interaction\u2009=\u2009.03). Among participants without MCI, daily low-quantity drinking was associated with lower dementia risk than infrequent higher-quantity drinking (hazard ratio, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.23-0.89; P =\u2009.02). Findings were consistent when stratified by sex, age, and APOE E4 genotype. Compared with drinking less than 1.0 drink per week, complete abstention (in participants without MCI) and the consumption of more than 14.0 drinks per week (in participants with MCI) were associated with lower Modified Mini-Mental State Examination scores (mean difference at follow-up compared with baseline, -0.46 point [95% CI, -0.87 to -0.04 point] and -3.51 points [95% CI, -5.75 to -1.27 points], respectively). Conclusions and Relevance: In this study, complete abstention and consuming more than 14.0 drinks per week (compared with drinking <1.0 drink per week) were associated with lower cognitive scores among participants aged 72 years and older. Particular caution is needed among individuals with MCI who continue to drink alcohol. ",
        "Association Between Caregiver Depression and Emergency Department Use Among Patients With Dementia. Importance: Current attempts to gauge the acute care needs of patients with dementia have not effectively addressed the role of caregivers, despite their extensive involvement in decisions about acute care management. Objective: To determine whether caregiver depression is associated with increased use of the emergency department (ED) among patients with dementia. Design, Setting, and Participants: This longitudinal cohort study used data from the Care Ecosystem study, a randomized clinical trial examining telephone-based supportive care for patients with dementia and their caregivers. Patients were 45 years or older with any type of dementia. A total of 780 caregiver-patient dyads were enrolled from March 20, 2015, until February 28, 2017, and 663 dyads contributed baseline and 6-month data and were included in the analysis. Exposures: Caregiver depression (9-item Patient Health Questionnaire score of \u226510). Secondary analyses examined caregiver burden and self-efficacy. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was the number of ED visits in a 6-month period. Results: Among the 663 caregivers (467 women and 196 men; mean [SD] age, 64.9 [11.8] years), 84 caregivers (12.7%) had depression at baseline. The mean incidence rate of ED visits was 0.9 per person-year. Rates of ED presentation were higher among dyads whose caregiver did vs did not have depression (1.5 vs 0.8 ED visits per person-year). In a Poisson regression model adjusting for patient age, sex, severity of dementia, number of comorbidities, and baseline ED use, as well as caregiver age and sex, caregiver depression continued to be associated with ED use, with a 73% increase in rates of ED use among dyads with caregivers with depression (adjusted incident rate ratio, 1.73; 95% CI, 1.30-2.30). Caregiver burden was associated with higher ED use in the unadjusted model, but this association did not reach statistical significance after adjustment (incident rate ratio, 1.19; 95% CI, 0.93-1.52). Caregiver self-efficacy was inversely proportional to the number of ED visits in the unadjusted and adjusted models (adjusted incident rate ratio, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.92-0.99). Conclusions and Relevance: Among patients with dementia, caregiver depression appears to be significantly associated with increased ED use, revealing a key caregiver vulnerability, which, if addressed with patient- and caregiver-centered dementia care, could improve health outcomes and lower costs for this high-risk population.

        "Effect of Collaborative Dementia Care via Telephone and Internet on Quality of Life, Caregiver Well-being, and Health Care Use: The Care Ecosystem Randomized Clinical Trial. Importance: Few health systems have adopted effective dementia care management programs. The Care Ecosystem is a model for delivering care from centralized hubs across broad geographic areas to caregivers and persons with dementia (PWDs) independently of their health system affiliations. Objective: To determine whether the Care Ecosystem is effective in improving outcomes important to PWDs, their caregivers, and payers beyond those achieved with usual care. Design, Setting, and Participants: A single-blind, randomized clinical trial with a pragmatic design was conducted among PWDs and their caregivers. Each PWD-caregiver dyad was enrolled for 12 months between March 20, 2015, and February 28, 2017. Data were collected until March 5, 2018. Study interventions and assessments were administered over the telephone and internet by clinical and research teams in San Francisco, California, and Omaha, Nebraska. Of 2585 referred or volunteer PWD-caregiver dyads in California, Iowa, or Nebraska, 780 met eligibility criteria and were enrolled. A total of 512 PWD-caregiver dyads were randomized to receive care through the Care Ecosystem and 268 dyads to receive usual care. All eligible PWDs had a dementia diagnosis; were enrolled or eligible for enrollment in Medicare or Medicaid; and spoke English, Spanish, or Cantonese. Analyses were intention-to-treat. Intervention: Telephone-based collaborative dementia care was delivered by a trained care team navigator, who provided education, support and care coordination with a team of dementia specialists (advanced practice nurse, social worker, and pharmacist). Main Outcomes and Measures: Primary outcome measure: Quality of Life in Alzheimer's Disease based on caregiver's rating of 13 aspects of PWD's well-being (including physical health, energy level, mood, living situation, memory, relationships, and finances) on a 4-point scale (poor to excellent). Secondary outcomes: frequencies of PWDs' use of emergency department, hospitalization, and ambulance services; caregiver depression (score on 9-Item Patient Health Questionnaire; higher scores indicate more severe depression); and caregiver burden (score on 12-Item Zarit Burden Interview; higher scores indicate more severe caregiver burden). Results: The 780 PWDs (56.3% female; mean [SD] age, 78.1 [9.9] years) and 780 caregivers (70.9% female; mean [SD] age, 64.7 [12.0] years) lived in California (n\u2009=\u2009452), Nebraska (n\u2009=\u2009284), or Iowa (n\u2009=\u200944). Of 780 dyads, 655 were still active at 12 months, and 571 completed the 12-month survey. Compared with usual care, the Care Ecosystem improved PWD quality of life (B, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.25-1.30; P\u2009=\u2009.04), reduced emergency department visits (B, -0.14; 95% CI, -0.29 to -0.01; P\u2009=\u2009.04), and decreased caregiver depression (B, -1.14; 95% CI, -2.15 to -0.13; P\u2009=\u2009.03) and caregiver burden (B, -1.90; 95% CI, -3.89 to -0.08; P\u2009=\u2009.046). Conclusions and Relevance: Effective care management for dementia can be delivered from centralized hubs to supplement usual care and mitigate the growing societal and economic burdens of dementia.

        "Assessment of Black Patients' Perception of Their Dermatology Care. Importance: The availability and quality of skin and hair care for black patients in the United States has been a subject of growing interest in dermatology. There is limited understanding of the perceptions of black patients about the care they receive from dermatologists and the factors affecting their care satisfaction. Objective: To elucidate black patients' perceptions of their dermatology experience in and outside of a skin of color clinic (SOCC). Design, Setting, and Participants: A cross-sectional study involving a survey and focus groups was conducted including adult black patients treated in an SOCC. Recruitment was conducted April through June 2015 through clinic-posted flyers. Participants engaged in 1 of 4 focus groups on July 14, 15, 29, or 30, 2015, and completed a survey. Data were analyzed March 2016 through June 2017. Main Outcomes and Measures: Planned outcomes of the focus groups were black patients' inductively generated themes on their perspectives and experiences in dermatology clinics. Planned outcomes of the survey were patients' ratings of SOCC and non-SOCC dermatologists in terms of interaction style, cultural awareness, and treatment satisfaction. Importance of patient-dermatologist racial concordance was a planned outcome in both measures. Given lack of existing prior research, no specific hypotheses were generated. Results: Of the 19 adult black patients who participated in the study, 18 (95%) were women, and the mean (SD) age was 50.0 (14.2) years. All patients reported positive experiences in the SOCC. Compared with non-SOCC dermatology treatment experiences, patients reported higher levels of overall satisfaction with SOCC dermatologists (t13\u2009=\u20092.85; P\u2009=\u2009.01). Patients perceived that SOCC dermatologists were better trained to care for black patients (t13\u2009=\u20094.42; P\u2009=\u2009.001); showed patients greater respect and dignity (t13\u2009=\u20093.37; P\u2009=\u2009.005), as well as understanding (t13\u2009=\u20092.56, P\u2009=\u2009.02); and were more trustworthy (t13\u2009=\u20093.47; P\u2009=\u2009.004). The majority of the comments in the focus groups (n\u2009=\u2009207) described 2 themes: dermatologists' interaction style (62/207; 30.0%) and knowledge about black skin and hair (42/207; 20.3%). Other themes were partnering with patients on outcomes (17/207; 8.2%), shared life experiences (14/207; 6.8%), and economic sensitivity (7/207; 3.4%). These themes accounted for a large part of the participants' discussion. Of all respondents, 71% (12/17) stated that they would prefer a black (or race concordant) dermatologist; this included 91% (10/11) of the race-concordant group and 33% (2/6) of the race-discordant group. Conclusions and Relevance: Participants reported that the SOCC dermatologists provided unique and uniformly beneficial care to black patients. Care satisfaction appeared most related to dermatologists' interpersonal style and specialized knowledge in care of black skin and hair. Findings suggest that black patients' dermatologic care satisfaction would increase if dermatologists underwent enhanced residency training in skin of color, cultural competency, cost-conscious care, and empathic communication skills, and if there were greater dermatology workforce diversity.

        "Prevalence and Disclosure of Potential Conflicts of Interest in Dermatology Patient Advocacy Organizations. Importance: Patient advocacy organizations are nonprofit organizations that represent patients with medical conditions. Although these organizations may increase disease awareness and influence health care policy, reports have suggested financial relationships between organizations and drug, device, and biotechnology companies, which may lead to potential conflicts of interest. The extent of these conflicts has not been explored among patient advocacy organizations in dermatology. Objective: To examine potential financial conflicts of interest and characterize disclosure practices among dermatology patient advocacy organizations. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cross-sectional study of the largest dermatology patient advocacy organizations using the Kaiser Health News database acquired data on total revenue from each organization's Form 990 for the year 2015. Tax forms and annual reports from 2017 were used for 2 organizations that were missing donor information for 2015. Annual reports, websites, and LinkedIn profiles were manually examined to ascertain donations and determine disclosure practices pertaining to financial support and board membership. Main Outcomes and Measures: The amount and minimum proportion of donations attributable to industry sponsorship among organizations as well as the proportion of organizations disclosing (1) industry-sponsored financial support, (2) the amount of industry-derived donations, and (3) current and past relationships between governing board members and industry sponsors. Results: This study identified 24 dermatology patient advocacy organizations with annual revenues that exceeded $500\u202f000. Of these, 5 (21%) had total donations that exceeded $5 million and 4 (17%) reported industry donations that exceeded $500\u202f000. Two organizations (8%) reported having at least 40% of total donations from industry sponsorship. Overall, 17 organizations (71%) reported receiving donations from industry on the annual report or the website and 12 (50%) reported the amount of donations in ranges. None of the organizations reported the exact amount or use of donations. On the basis of annual reports and websites, 3 organizations (13%) reported having a current or former industry executive on the organization's governing board. When this search was replicated using LinkedIn, this figure was at least 54%. Conclusions and Relevance: These findings suggest inconsistent disclosure of industry-derived financial support and board membership that may represent conflicts of interest. Policies that support the transparency and consistency of disclosure practices between industry and patient advocacy organizations appear to be needed to fully characterize the extent of conflicts of interest among patient advocacy organizations in dermatology and maintain trust in these important institutions.

        "Association Between Plant-Based Dietary Patterns and Risk of Type 2 Diabetes: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis. Importance: Accumulating epidemiologic evidence has suggested favorable associations between plant-based dietary patterns and risk of type 2 diabetes, although there is a lack of a quantitative summary of evidence substantiating this important association. Objective: To quantitatively synthesize available prospective observational evidence on the association between plant-based dietary patterns and risk of type 2 diabetes. Data Sources: A systematic search of PubMed and MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, and reference lists through February 15, 2019, was conducted. Data analysis was conducted between December 2018 and February 2019. Study Selection: All prospective observational studies that examined the association between adherence to plant-based dietary patterns and incidence of type 2 diabetes among adults 18 years or older were identified. Data Extraction and Synthesis: Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology guidelines for data abstraction and reporting were followed, and a National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute assessment tool was used to evaluate study quality. Two authors independently conducted full-text assessments and data abstraction. Meta-analysis was conducted using the random-effects method to calculate the overall relative risk (RR) and 95% CI. Main Outcomes and Measures: Level of adherence to a plant-based diet and incidence of type 2 diabetes. Results: A total of 9 studies were identified, totaling 307\u202f099 participants with 23\u202f544 cases of incident type 2 diabetes. A significant inverse association was observed between higher adherence to a plant-based dietary pattern and risk of type 2 diabetes (RR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.71-0.84) in comparison with poorer adherence, with modest heterogeneity across studies (I2\u2009=\u200944.5%; P\u2009=\u2009.07 for heterogeneity). Similar findings were obtained when using the fixed-effects model (RR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.75-0.84). Consistent associations were observed across predefined subgroups. This association was strengthened when healthy plant-based foods, such as fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, and nuts, were included in the definition of plant-based patterns (RR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.62-0.79). Most studies were deemed to have good quality in terms of dietary assessment, disease outcomes, and statistical adjustment for confounding factors. Using restricted cubic splines, a significant inverse linear dose-response association was identified between plant-based dietary indices and risk of type 2 diabetes. Conclusions and Relevance: Plant-based dietary patterns, especially when they are enriched with healthful plant-based foods, may be beneficial for the primary prevention of type 2 diabetes. ",
        "Prevalence and Severity of Food Allergies Among US Adults. Importance: Food allergy is a costly, potentially life-threatening condition. Although studies have examined the prevalence of childhood food allergy, little is known about prevalence, severity, or health care utilization related to food allergies among US adults. Objective: To provide nationally representative estimates of the distribution, severity, and factors associated with adult food allergies. Design, Setting, and Participants: In this cross-sectional survey study of US adults, surveys were administered via the internet and telephone from October 9, 2015, to September 18, 2016. Participants were first recruited from NORC at the University of Chicago's probability-based AmeriSpeak panel, and additional participants were recruited from the non-probability-based Survey Sampling International (SSI) panel. Exposures: Demographic and allergic participant characteristics. Main Outcomes and Measures: Self-reported food allergies were the main outcome and were considered convincing if reported symptoms to specific allergens were consistent with IgE-mediated reactions. Diagnosis history to specific allergens and food allergy-related health care use were also primary outcomes. Estimates were based on this nationally representative sample using small-area estimation and iterative proportional fitting methods. To increase precision, AmeriSpeak data were augmented by calibration-weighted, non-probability-based responses from SSI. Results: Surveys were completed by 40\u202f443 adults (mean [SD] age, 46.6 [20.2] years), with a survey completion rate of 51.2% observed among AmeriSpeak panelists (n\u2009=\u20097210) and 5.5% among SSI panelists (n\u2009=\u200933\u202f233). Estimated convincing food allergy prevalence among US adults was 10.8% (95% CI, 10.4%-11.1%), although 19.0% (95% CI, 18.5%-19.5%) of adults self-reported a food allergy. The most common allergies were shellfish (2.9%; 95% CI, 2.7%-3.1%), milk (1.9%; 95% CI, 1.8%-2.1%), peanut (1.8%; 95% CI, 1.7%-1.9%), tree nut (1.2%; 95% CI, 1.1%-1.3%), and fin fish (0.9%; 95% CI, 0.8%-1.0%). Among food-allergic adults, 51.1% (95% CI, 49.3%-52.9%) experienced a severe food allergy reaction, 45.3% (95% CI, 43.6%-47.1%) were allergic to multiple foods, and 48.0% (95% CI, 46.2%-49.7%) developed food allergies as an adult. Regarding health care utilization, 24.0% (95% CI, 22.6%-25.4%) reported a current epinephrine prescription, and 38.3% (95% CI, 36.7%-40.0%) reported at least 1 food allergy-related lifetime emergency department visit. Conclusions and Relevance: These data suggest that at least 10.8% (>26 million) of US adults are food allergic, whereas nearly 19% of adults believe that they have a food allergy. Consequently, these findings suggest that it is crucial that adults with suspected food allergy receive appropriate confirmatory testing and counseling to ensure food is not unnecessarily avoided and quality of life is not unduly impaired.

        "Ultraprocessed Food Consumption and Risk of Type 2 Diabetes Among Participants of the NutriNet-Sant\u00e9 Prospective Cohort. Importance: Ultraprocessed foods (UPF) are widespread in Western diets. Their consumption has been associated in recent prospective studies with increased risks of all-cause mortality and chronic diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular diseases, hypertension, and dyslipidemia; however, data regarding diabetes is lacking. Objective: To assess the associations between consumption of UPF and risk of type 2 diabetes (T2D). Design, Setting, and Participants: In this population-based prospective cohort study, 104\u202f707 participants aged 18 years or older from the French NutriNet-Sant\u00e9 cohort (2009-2019) were included. Dietary intake data were collected using repeated 24-hour dietary records (5.7 per participant on average), designed to register participants' usual consumption for more than 3500 different food items. These were categorized according to their degree of processing by the NOVA classification system. Main Outcomes and Measures: Associations between UPF consumption and risk of T2D were assessed using cause-specific multivariable Cox proportional hazard models adjusted for known risk factors (sociodemographic, anthropometric, lifestyle, medical history, and nutritional factors). Results: A total of 104\u202f707 participants (21\u202f800 [20.8%] men and 82\u202f907 [79.2%] women) were included. Mean (SD) baseline age of participants was 42.7 (14.5) years. Absolute T2D rates in the lowest and highest UPF consumers were 113 and 166 per 100\u202f000 person-years, respectively. Consumption of UPF was associated with a higher risk of T2D (multi-adjusted hazard ratio [HR] for an absolute increment of 10 in the percentage of UPF in the diet, 1.15; 95% CI, 1.06-1.25; median follow-up, 6.0 years; 582\u202f252 person-years; 821 incident cases). These results remained statistically significant after adjustment for several markers of the nutritional quality of the diet, for other metabolic comorbidities (HR, 1.13; 95% CI, 1.03-1.23), and for weight change (HR, 1.13; 95% CI, 1.01-1.27). The absolute amount of UPF consumption (grams per day) was consistently associated with T2D risk, even when adjusting for unprocessed or minimally processed food intake (HR for a 100 g/d increase, 1.05; 95% CI, 1.02-1.08). Conclusions and Relevance: In this large observational prospective study, a higher proportion of UPF in the diet was associated with a higher risk of T2D. Even though these results need to be confirmed in other populations and settings, they provide evidence to support efforts by public health authorities to recommend limiting UPF consumption.

        "Care Practices for Patients With Advanced Kidney Disease Who Forgo Maintenance Dialysis. Importance: Although maintenance dialysis is a treatment choice with potential benefits and harms, little is known about care practices for patients with advanced chronic kidney disease who forgo this treatment. Objective: To describe how decisions not to start dialysis unfold in the clinical setting. Design, Setting, and Participants: A qualitative study was performed of documentation in the electronic medical records of 851 adults receiving care from the US Veterans Health Administration between January 1, 2000, and October 1, 2011, who had chosen not to start dialysis. Qualitative analysis was performed between March 1, 2017, and April 1, 2018. Main Outcomes and Measures: Dominant themes that emerged from clinician documentation of clinical events and health care interactions between patients, family members, and clinicians relevant to the decision to forgo dialysis. Results: In the cohort of 851 patients (842 men and 9 women; mean [SD] age, 75.0 [10.3] years), 567 (66.6%) were white. Three major dynamics relevant to understanding how decisions to forgo dialysis unfolded were identified. The first dynamic was that of dialysis as the norm: when patients expressed a desire to forgo dialysis, it was unusual for clinicians to readily accept patients' decisions. Clinicians tended to repeatedly question this preference over time, deliberated about patients' competency to make this decision, used a variety of strategies to encourage patients to initiate dialysis, and prepared for patients to change their minds and start dialysis. The second dynamic arose when patients were not candidates for dialysis: clinicians viewed particular patients as not candidates or appropriate for dialysis, usually on the basis of specific characteristics and/or expected prognosis, rather than after consideration of patients' goals and values. When clinicians decided patients were not candidates for dialysis, there seemed to be little room for uncertainty in these decisions. The third dynamic occurred when clinicians believed they had little to offer patients beyond dialysis: when it was clear that patients would not be starting dialysis, nephrologists often signed off from their care and had few recommendations other than referral to hospice care. Conclusions and Relevance: These findings describe an all-or-nothing approach to caring for patients with advanced chronic kidney disease in which initiation of dialysis served as a powerful default option with few perceived alternatives. Stronger efforts are needed to develop a more patient-centered approach to caring for patients with advanced chronic kidney disease that is capable of proactively supporting those who do not wish to start dialysis.
