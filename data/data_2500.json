        "Genome-Wide Analysis of Left Ventricular Image-Derived Phenotypes Identifies Fourteen Loci Associated With Cardiac Morphogenesis and Heart Failure Development. BACKGROUND: The genetic basis of left ventricular (LV) image-derived phenotypes, which play a vital role in the diagnosis, management, and risk stratification of cardiovascular diseases, is unclear at present. METHODS: The LV parameters were measured from the cardiovascular magnetic resonance studies of the UK Biobank. Genotyping was done using Affymetrix arrays, augmented by imputation. We performed genome-wide association studies of 6 LV traits-LV end-diastolic volume, LV end-systolic volume, LV stroke volume, LV ejection fraction, LV mass, and LV mass to end-diastolic volume ratio. The replication analysis was performed in the MESA study (Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis). We identified the candidate genes at genome-wide significant loci based on the evidence from extensive bioinformatic analyses. Polygenic risk scores were constructed from the summary statistics of LV genome-wide association studies to predict the heart failure events. RESULTS: The study comprised 16\u2009923 European UK Biobank participants (mean age 62.5 years; 45.8% men) without prevalent myocardial infarction or heart failure. We discovered 14 genome-wide significant loci (3 loci each for LV end-diastolic volume, LV end-systolic volume, and LV mass to end-diastolic volume ratio; 4 loci for LV ejection fraction, and 1 locus for LV mass) at a stringent P<1\u00d710-8. Three loci were replicated at Bonferroni significance and 7 loci at nominal significance (P<0.05 with concordant direction of effect) in the MESA study (n=4383). Follow-up bioinformatic analyses identified 28 candidate genes that were enriched in the cardiac developmental pathways and regulation of the LV contractile mechanism. Eight genes (TTN, BAG3, GRK5, HSPB7, MTSS1, ALPK3, NMB, and MMP11) supported by at least 2 independent lines of in silico evidence were implicated in the cardiac morphogenesis and heart failure development. The polygenic risk scores of LV phenotypes were predictive of heart failure in a holdout UK Biobank sample of 3106 cases and 224\u2009134 controls (odds ratio 1.41, 95% CI 1.26 - 1.58, for the top quintile versus the bottom quintile of the LV end-systolic volume risk score). CONCLUSIONS: We report 14 genetic loci and indicate several candidate genes that not only enhance our understanding of the genetic architecture of prognostically important LV phenotypes but also shed light on potential novel therapeutic targets for LV remodeling.

        "Semen miRNAs Contained in Exosomes as Non-Invasive Biomarkers for Prostate Cancer Diagnosis. Although it is specific for prostatic tissue, serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening has resulted in an over-diagnosis of prostate cancer (PCa) and many unnecessary biopsies of benign disease due to a well-documented low cancer specificity, thus improvement is required. We profiled the expression level of miRNAs contained in semen exosomes from men with moderately increased PSA levels to assess their usefulness, either alone or in addition to PSA marker, as non-invasive biomarkers, for the early efficient diagnosis and prognosis of PCa. An altered miRNA expression pattern was found by a high throughput profiling analysis in PCa when compared with healthy individuals (HCt) exosomal semen samples. The presence of vasectomy was taken into account for the interpretation of results. Fourteen miRNAs were selected for miRNA validation as PCa biomarkers in a subsequent set of semen samples. In this explorative study, we describe miRNA-based models, which included miRNA expression values together with PSA levels, that increased the classification function of the PSA screening test with diagnostic and/or prognostic potential: [PSA\u2009+\u2009miR-142-3p\u2009+\u2009miR-142-5p\u2009+\u2009miR-223-3p] model (AUC:0,821) to discriminate PCa from BPH (Sn:91,7% Sp:42,9% vs Sn:100% Sp:14,3%); and [PSA\u2009+\u2009miR-342-3p\u2009+\u2009miR-374b-5p] model (AUC: 0,891) to discriminate between GS\u2009\u2265\u20097 tumours and men presenting PSA\u2009\u2265\u20094\u2009ng/ml with no cancer or GS6 tumours (Sn:81,8% Sp:95% vs Sn:54,5% Sp:90%). The pathway analysis of predicted miRNA target genes supports a role for these miRNAs in PCa aetiology and/or progression. Our study shows semen exosome miRNA-based models as molecular biomarkers with the potential to improve PCa diagnosis/prognosis efficiency. As the next step, further prospective studies on larger cohorts of patients are required to validate the diagnostic and/or prognostic role of the miRNA panel before it could be adopted into clinical practice.

        "Embedding topography enables fracture guidance in soft solids. The natural topographical microchannels in human skin have recently been shown to be capable of guiding propagating cracks. In this article we examine the ability to guide fracture by incorporating similar topographical features into both single, and dual layer elastomer membranes that exhibit uniform thickness. In single layer membranes, crack guidance is achieved by minimizing the nadir thickness of incorporated v-shaped channels, maximizing the release of localized strain energy. In dual layer membranes, crack guidance along embedded channels is achieved via interfacial delamination, which requires less energy to create a new surface than molecular debonding. In both membrane types, guided crack growth is only temporary. However, utilizing multiple embedded channels, non-contiguous crack control can be maintained at angles up to 45\u00b0 from the mode I fracture condition. The ability to control and deflect fracture holds great potential for improving the robustness and lifespan of flexible electronics and stretchable sensors. ",
        "Endogenous fluctuations of OCT4 and SOX2 bias pluripotent cell fate decisions. SOX2 and OCT4 are pioneer transcription factors playing a key role in embryonic stem (ES) cell self-renewal and differentiation. How temporal fluctuations in their expression levels bias lineage commitment is unknown. Here, we generated knock-in reporter fusion ES cell lines allowing to monitor endogenous SOX2 and OCT4 protein fluctuations in living cells and to determine their impact on mesendodermal and neuroectodermal commitment. We found that small differences in SOX2 and OCT4 levels impact cell fate commitment in G1 but not in S phase. Elevated SOX2 levels modestly increased neuroectodermal commitment and decreased mesendodermal commitment upon directed differentiation. In contrast, elevated OCT4 levels strongly biased ES cells towards both neuroectodermal and mesendodermal fates in undirected differentiation. Using ATAC-seq on ES cells gated for different endogenous SOX2 and OCT4 levels, we found that high OCT4 levels increased chromatin accessibility at differentiation-associated enhancers. This suggests that small endogenous fluctuations of pioneer transcription factors can bias cell fate decisions by concentration-dependent priming of differentiation-associated enhancers. ",
        "Racial Differences and Factors Associated with Pregnancy in ESKD Patients on Dialysis in the United States. BACKGROUND: Pregnancy in women with ESKD undergoing dialysis is uncommon due to impaired fertility. Data on pregnancy in women on dialysis in the United States is scarce. METHODS: We evaluated a retrospective cohort of 47,555 women aged 15-44 years on dialysis between January 1, 2005 and December 31, 2013 using data from the United States Renal Data System with Medicare as primary payer. We calculated pregnancy rates and identified factors associated with pregnancy. RESULTS: In 47,555 women on dialysis, 2352 pregnancies were identified. Pregnancy rate was 17.8 per thousand person years (PTPY) with the highest rate in women aged 20-24 (40.9 PTPY). In the adjusted time-to-event analysis, a higher likelihood of pregnancy was seen in Native American (HR, 1.77; 95% CI, 1.33 to 2.36), Hispanic (HR, 1.51; 95% CI, 1.32 to 1.73), and black (HR, 1.33; 95% CI, 1.18 to 1.49) women than in white women. A higher rate of pregnancy was seen in women with ESKD due to malignancy (HR, 1.64; 95% CI, 1.27 to 2.12), GN (HR, 1.38; 95% CI, 1.21 to 1.58), hypertension (HR, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.16 to 1.51), and secondary GN/vasculitis (HR, 1.18; 95% CI, 1.02 to 1.37) than ESKD due to diabetes. A lower likelihood of pregnancy was seen among women on peritoneal dialysis than on hemodialysis (HR, 0.47; 95% CI, 0.41 to 0.55). CONCLUSIONS: The pregnancy rate is higher in women on dialysis than previous reports indicate. A higher likelihood of pregnancy was associated with race/ethnicity, ESKD cause, and dialysis modality.

        "Aberrant mechanosensing in injured intervertebral discs as a result of boundary-constraint disruption and residual-strain loss. In fibrous tissues, prestressed boundary constraints at bone interfaces instil residual strain throughout the tissue, even when unloaded. For example, internal swelling pressures in the central nucleus pulposus of the intervertebral disc generate prestrain in the outer annulus fibrosus. With injury and depressurization, these residual strains are lost. Here we show that the loss of residual strains in the intervertebral disc alters the microenvironment and instigates aberrant tissue remodelling and the adoption of atypical cellular phenotypes. By using puncture surgery of the annulus fibrosus in rabbits, ex vivo puncture experiments and electrospun nanofibrous scaffolds recapitulating these evolving boundary constraints, we show that the loss of residual strain promotes short-term apoptosis and the emergence of a fibrotic phenotype. We also show that local fibre organization and cellular contractility mediate this process and that the aberrant cellular changes could be abrogated by targeting the cell-mechanosensing machinery with small molecules. Our findings indicate that injury to dense connective tissues under prestrain alters boundary constraints and residual strain; this leads to aberrant mechanosensing, which in turn promotes disease progression.

        "Early detection and staging of chronic liver diseases with a protein MRI contrast agent. Early diagnosis and noninvasive detection of liver fibrosis and its heterogeneity remain as major unmet medical needs for stopping further disease progression toward severe clinical consequences. Here we report a collagen type I targeting protein-based contrast agent (ProCA32.collagen1) with strong collagen I affinity. ProCA32.collagen1 possesses high relaxivities per particle (r1 and r2) at both 1.4 and 7.0\u2009T, which enables the robust detection of early-stage (Ishak stage 3 of 6) liver fibrosis and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (Ishak stage 1 of 6 or 1\u2009A Mild) in animal models via dual contrast modes. ProCA32.collagen1 also demonstrates vasculature changes associated with intrahepatic angiogenesis and portal hypertension during late-stage fibrosis, and heterogeneity via serial molecular imaging. ProCA32.collagen1 mitigates metal toxicity due to lower dosage and strong resistance to transmetallation and unprecedented metal selectivity for Gd3+ over physiological metal ions with strong translational potential in facilitating effective treatment to halt further chronic liver disease progression.

        "The eIF2\u03b1 Kinase GCN2 Modulates Period and Rhythmicity of the Circadian Clock by Translational Control of Atf4. The integrated stress response (ISR) is activated in response to diverse stress stimuli to maintain homeostasis in neurons. Central to this process is the phosphorylation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 alpha (eIF2\u03b1). Here, we report a critical role for ISR in regulating the mammalian circadian clock. The eIF2\u03b1 kinase GCN2 rhythmically phosphorylates eIF2\u03b1 in the suprachiasmatic circadian clock. Increased eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation shortens the circadian period in both fibroblasts and mice, whereas reduced eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation lengthens the circadian period and impairs circadian rhythmicity in animals. Mechanistically, phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 promotes mRNA translation of Atf4. ATF4 binding motifs are identified in multiple clock genes, including Per2, Per3, Cry1, Cry2, and Clock. ATF4 binds to the TTGCAGCA motif in the Per2 promoter and activates its transcription. Together, these results demonstrate a significant role for ISR in circadian physiology and provide a potential link between dysregulated ISR and circadian dysfunction in brain diseases. ",
        "Step-Up Therapy in Black Children and Adults with Poorly Controlled Asthma. BACKGROUND: Morbidity from asthma is disproportionately higher among black patients than among white patients, and black patients constitute the minority of participants in trials informing treatment. Data indicate that patients with inadequately controlled asthma benefit more from addition of a long-acting beta-agonist (LABA) than from increased glucocorticoids; however, these data may not be informative for treatment in black patients. METHODS: We conducted two prospective, randomized, double-blind trials: one involving children and the other involving adolescents and adults. In both trials, the patients had at least one grandparent who identified as black and had asthma that was inadequately controlled with low-dose inhaled glucocorticoids. We compared combinations of therapy, which included the addition of a LABA (salmeterol) to an inhaled glucocorticoid (fluticasone propionate), a step-up to double to quintuple the dose of fluticasone, or both. The treatments were compared with the use of a composite measure that evaluated asthma exacerbations, asthma-control days, and lung function; data were stratified according to genotypic African ancestry. RESULTS: When quintupling the dose of fluticasone (to 250 \u03bcg twice a day) was compared with adding salmeterol (50 \u03bcg twice a day) and doubling the fluticasone (to 100 \u03bcg twice a day), a superior response occurred in 46% of the children with quintupling the fluticasone and in 46% of the children with doubling the fluticasone and adding salmeterol (P\u2009=\u20090.99). In contrast, more adolescents and adults had a superior response to added salmeterol than to an increase in fluticasone (salmeterol-low-dose fluticasone vs. medium-dose fluticasone, 49% vs. 28% [P\u2009=\u20090.003]; salmeterol-medium-dose fluticasone vs. high-dose fluticasone, 49% vs. 31% [P\u2009=\u20090.02]). Neither the degree of African ancestry nor baseline biomarkers predicted a superior response to specific treatments. The increased dose of inhaled glucocorticoids was associated with a decrease in the ratio of urinary cortisol to creatinine in children younger than 8 years of age. CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to black adolescents and adults, almost half the black children with poorly controlled asthma had a superior response to an increase in the dose of an inhaled glucocorticoid and almost half had a superior response to the addition of a LABA.

        "Ability of Noninvasive Scoring Systems to Identify Individuals in the Population at Risk for Severe Liver Disease. BACKGROUND & AIMS: Noninvasive scoring systems are used to identify persons with advanced liver fibrosis. We investigated the ability of scoring systems to identify individuals in the general population at risk for future liver-related events. METHODS: We collected data from the Swedish Apolipoprotein Mortality Risk cohort on persons 35 to 79 years old who had blood samples collected from 1985 through 1996. We collected APRI (n\u00a0= 127,302), BARD (n\u00a0= 75,303), FIB-4 (n\u00a0= 126,941), Forns (n\u00a0= 122,419), and the nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) fibrosis scores (NFS, n\u00a0= 13,160). We ascertained incident cases of cirrhosis or complications by linking Swedish health data registers. Cox regression was used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) for severe liver disease at 5, 10, and a maximum follow-up time of 27 years. The predictive ability of the scores was evaluated using area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve and C-statistics analyses. Our specific aims were to investigate the predictive capabilities of scoring systems for fatal and nonfatal liver disease, determine which\u00a0scoring system has the highest level of accuracy, and investigate the predictive abilities of the scoring systems in persons with a higher probability of NAFLD at baseline. RESULTS: A similar proportion of individuals evaluated by each scoring system developed cirrhosis or complications thereof (1.0%-1.4%). The incidence of any outcome was increased in intermediate- and high-risk groups compared with low-risk groups, with HRs at 10 years in the high-risk group ranging from 1.67 for the BARD score to 45.9 for the APRI score. The predictive abilities of all scoring systems decreased with time and were higher in men. All scoring systems were more accurate in persons with risk factors for NAFLD at baseline, with AUROCs reaching 0.83. CONCLUSIONS: Higher scores from noninvasive scoring systems to evaluate fibrosis are associated with an increased risk of cirrhosis in a general population, but their predictive ability is modest. Performance was better when patients\u00a0were followed for shorter time periods and in persons with a higher risk of NAFLD, with AUROC values reaching 0.83. New scoring systems are needed to evaluate risk of fibrosis in the general population and in primary care. ",
        "Association of Short-term Change in Leukocyte Telomere Length With Cortical Thickness and Outcomes of Mental Training Among Healthy Adults: A Randomized Clinical Trial. Importance: Telomere length is associated with the development of age-related diseases and structural differences in multiple brain regions. It remains unclear, however, whether change in telomere length is linked to brain structure change, and to what extent telomere length can be influenced through mental training. Objectives: To assess the dynamic associations between leukocyte telomere length (LTL) and cortical thickness (CT), and to determine whether LTL is affected by a longitudinal contemplative mental training intervention. Design, Setting, and Participants: An open-label efficacy trial of three 3-month mental training modules with healthy, meditation-naive adults was conducted. Data on LTL and CT were collected 4 times over 9 months between April 22, 2013, and March 31, 2015, as part of the ReSource Project. Data analysis was performed between September 23, 2016, and June 21, 2019. Of 1582 eligible individuals, 943 declined to participate; 362 were randomly selected for participation and assigned to training or retest control cohorts, with demographic characteristics matched. The retest control cohorts underwent all testing but no training. Intention-to-treat analysis was performed. Interventions: Training cohort participants completed 3 modules cultivating interoception and attention (Presence), compassion (Affect), or perspective taking (Perspective). Main Outcomes and Measures: Change in LTL and CT. Results: Of the 362 individuals randomized, 30 participants dropped out before study initiation (initial sample, 332). Data were available for analysis of the training intervention in 298 participants (n\u2009=\u2009222 training; n\u2009=\u200976 retest control) (175 women [58.7%]; mean [SD] age, 40.5 [9.3] years). The training modules had no effect on LTL. In 699 observations from all 298 participants, mean estimated changes in the relative ratios of telomere repeat copy number to single-copy gene (T/S) were for no training, 0.004 (95% CI, -0.010 to 0.018); Presence, -0.007 (95% CI, -0.025 to 0.011); Affect, -0.005 (95% CI, -0.019 to 0.010); and Perspective, -0.001 (95% CI, -0.017 to 0.016). Cortical thickness change data were analyzed in 167 observations from 67 retest control participants (37 women [55.2%], mean [SD] age, 39.6 [9.0] years). In this retest control cohort subsample, naturally occurring LTL change was related to CT change in the left precuneus extending to the posterior cingulate cortex (mean t161\u2009=\u20093.22; P\u2009<\u2009.001; r\u2009=\u20090.246). At the individual participant level, leukocyte telomere shortening as well as lengthening were observed. Leukocyte telomere shortening was related to cortical thinning (t77\u2009=\u20092.38; P\u2009=\u2009.01; r\u2009=\u20090.262), and leukocyte telomere lengthening was related to cortical thickening (t77\u2009=\u20092.42; P\u2009=\u2009.009; r\u2009=\u20090.266). All analyses controlled for age, sex, and body mass index. Conclusions and Relevance: The findings of this trial indicate an association between short-term change in LTL and concomitant change in plasticity of the left precuneus extending to the posterior cingulate cortex. This result contributes to the evidence that LTL changes more dynamically on the individual level than previously thought. Further studies are needed to determine potential long-term implications of such change in relation to cellular aging and the development of neurodegenerative disorders. No effect of contemplative mental training was noted in what may be, to date, the longest intervention with healthy adults. Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01833104. ",
        "Evaluating Employment Quality as a Determinant of Health in a Changing Labor Market. The shifting nature of employment in recent decades has not been adequately examined from a public health perspective. To that end, traditional models of work and health research need to be expanded to include the relational and contractual aspects of employment that also affect health. We examine the association of three health outcomes with different types of employment in the contemporary U.S. labor market, as measured by a multidimensional construct of employment quality (EQ) derived from latent class analysis. We find that EQ is associated with self-rated health, mental health, and occupational injury. Further, we explore three proposed mediating mechanisms of the EQ-health relationship (material deprivation, employment-related stressors, and occupational risk factors), and find each to be supported by these data.

        "Closed-Loop Haptic Feedback Control Using a Self-Sensing Soft Pneumatic Actuator Skin. In this article, we achieve a closed-loop control over haptic feedback, first time for an entirely soft platform. We prototyped a novel self-sensing soft pneumatic actuator (SPA) with soft strain sensors, called SPA-skin, which withstands large multiaxial strains and is capable of high-frequency sensing and actuation. To close-loop control the haptic feedback, the platform requires a cohesively integrated system. Our system consists of a stretchable low profile (<500\u2009\u03bcm) SPA and an ultra-compliant thin-metal film strain sensor that create a novel bidirectional platform for tactile sensing via force-tunable vibratory feedback. With this prototype, we demonstrated control of the actuator shape in real time up to 100\u2009Hz at output forces up to 1\u2009N, maintained under variable mechanical loadings. We further characterized the SPA-skin platform for its static and dynamic behavior over a range of actuation amplitudes and frequencies as well as developed an analytical model of this system to predict the actuator inflation state only using the embedded sensor's resistance. Our SPA-skin is a multifunctional multilayer system that can readily be implemented as a high-speed wearable bidirectional interface for contact sensing and vibrotactile feedback. ",
        "Glutamatergic synaptic input to glioma cells drives brain tumour progression. A network of communicating tumour cells that is connected by tumour microtubes mediates the progression of incurable gliomas. Moreover, neuronal activity can foster malignant behaviour of glioma cells by non-synaptic paracrine and autocrine mechanisms. Here we report a direct communication channel between neurons and glioma cells in different disease models and human tumours: functional bona fide chemical synapses between presynaptic neurons and postsynaptic glioma cells. These neurogliomal synapses show a typical synaptic ultrastructure, are located on tumour microtubes, and produce postsynaptic currents that are mediated by glutamate receptors of the AMPA subtype. Neuronal activity including epileptic conditions generates synchronised calcium transients in tumour-microtube-connected glioma networks. Glioma-cell-specific genetic perturbation of AMPA receptors reduces calcium-related invasiveness of tumour-microtube-positive tumour cells and glioma growth. Invasion and growth are also reduced by anaesthesia and the AMPA receptor antagonist perampanel, respectively. These findings reveal a biologically relevant direct synaptic communication between neurons and glioma cells with potential clinical implications. ",
        "12-Lipoxygenase Regulates Cold Adaptation and Glucose Metabolism by Producing the Omega-3 Lipid 12-HEPE from Brown Fat. Distinct oxygenases and their oxylipin products have been shown to participate in thermogenesis by mediating physiological adaptations required to sustain body temperature. Since the role of the lipoxygenase (LOX) family in cold adaptation remains elusive, we aimed to investigate whether, and how, LOX activity is required for cold adaptation and to identify LOX-derived lipid mediators that could serve as putative cold mimetics with therapeutic potential to combat diabetes. By utilizing mass-spectrometry-based lipidomics in mice and humans, we demonstrated that cold and \u03b23-adrenergic stimulation could promote the biosynthesis and release of 12-LOX metabolites from brown adipose tissue (BAT). Moreover, 12-LOX ablation in mouse brown adipocytes impaired glucose uptake and metabolism, resulting in blunted adaptation to the cold in\u00a0vivo. The cold-induced 12-LOX product 12-HEPE was found to be a batokine that improves glucose metabolism by promoting glucose uptake into adipocytes and skeletal muscle through activation of an insulin-like intracellular signaling pathway.

        "Trends in Disparities in Preemptive Kidney Transplantation in the United States. BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Long wait times for deceased donor kidneys and low rates of preemptive wait-listing have limited preemptive transplantation in the United States. We aimed to assess trends in preemptive deceased donor transplantation with the introduction of the new Kidney Allocation System (KAS) in 2014 and identify whether key disparities in preemptive transplantation have changed. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: We identified adult deceased donor kidney transplant recipients in the United States from 2000 to 2018 using the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients. Preemptive transplantation was defined as no dialysis before transplant. Associations between recipient, donor, transplant, and policy era characteristics and preemptive transplantation were calculated using logistic regression. To test for modification by KAS policy era, an interaction term between policy era and each characteristic of interest was introduced in bivariate and adjusted models. RESULTS: The proportion of preemptive transplants increased after implementation of KAS from 9.0% to 9.8%, with 1.10 (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.06 to 1.14) times higher odds of preemptive transplantation post-KAS compared with pre-KAS. Preemptive recipients were more likely to be white, older, female, more educated, hold private insurance, and have ESKD cause other than diabetes or hypertension. Policy era significantly modified the association between preemptive transplantation and race, age, insurance status, and Human Leukocyte Antigen zero-mismatch (interaction P<0.05). Medicare patients had a significantly lower odds of preemptive transplantation relative to private insurance holders (pre-KAS adjusted OR, [aOR] 0.26; [95% CI, 0.25 to 0.27], to 0.20 [95% CI, 0.18 to 0.22] post-KAS). Black and Hispanic patients experienced a similar phenomenon (aOR 0.48 [95% CI, 0.45 to 0.51] to 0.41 [95% CI, 0.37 to 0.45] and 0.43 [95% CI, 0.40 to 0.47] to 0.40 [95% CI, 0.36 to 0.46] respectively) compared with white patients. CONCLUSIONS: Although the proportion of deceased donor kidney transplants performed preemptively increased slightly after KAS, disparities in preemptive kidney transplantation persisted after the 2014 KAS policy changes and were exacerbated for racial minorities and Medicare patients.

        "SNCA and mTOR Pathway Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms Interact to Modulate the Age at Onset of Parkinson's Disease. BACKGROUND: Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the \u03b1-synuclein (SNCA) gene are associated with differential risk and age at onset (AAO) of both idiopathic and Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2)-associated Parkinson's disease (PD). Yet potential combinatory or synergistic effects among several modulatory SNPs for PD risk or AAO remain largely underexplored. OBJECTIVES: The mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway is functionally impaired in PD. Here we explored whether SNPs in the mTOR pathway, alone or by epistatic interaction with known susceptibility factors, can modulate PD risk and AAO. METHODS: Based on functional relevance, we selected a total of 64 SNPs mapping to a total of 57 genes from the mTOR pathway and genotyped a discovery series cohort encompassing 898 PD patients and 921 controls. As a replication series, we screened 4170 PD and 3014 controls available from the International Parkinson's Disease Genomics Consortium. RESULTS: In the discovery series cohort, we found a 4-loci interaction involving STK11 rs8111699, FCHSD1 rs456998, GSK3B rs1732170, and SNCA rs356219, which was associated with an increased risk of PD (odds ratio = 2.59, P <\u2009.001). In addition, we also found a 3-loci epistatic combination of RPTOR rs11868112 and RPS6KA2 rs6456121 with SNCA rs356219, which was associated (odds ratio = 2.89; P <\u2009.0001) with differential AAO. The latter was further validated (odds ratio = 1.56; P =\u20090.046-0.047) in the International Parkinson's Disease Genomics Consortium cohort. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that genetic variability in the mTOR pathway contributes to SNCA effects in a nonlinear epistatic manner to modulate differential AAO in PD, unraveling the contribution of this cascade in the pathogenesis of the disease. \u00a9 2019 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.

        "Association between environmental quality and diabetes in the USA. AIMS/INTRODUCTION: Caloric excess and physical inactivity fail to fully account for the rise of diabetes prevalence. Individual environmental pollutants can disrupt glucose homeostasis and promote metabolic dysfunction. However, the impact of cumulative exposures on diabetes risk is unknown. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The Environmental Quality Index, a county-level index composed of five domains, was developed to capture the multifactorial ambient environmental exposures. The Environmental Quality Index was linked to county-level annual age-adjusted population-based estimates of diabetes prevalence rates. Prevalence differences (PD, annual difference per 100,000 persons) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated using random intercept mixed effects linear regression models. Associations were assessed for overall environmental quality and domain-specific indices, and all analyses were stratified by four rural-urban strata. RESULTS: Comparing counties in the highest quintile/poorest environmental quality to those in the lowest quintile/best environmental quality, counties with poor environmental quality demonstrated lower total diabetes prevalence rates. Associations varied by rural-urban strata; overall better environmental quality was associated with lower total diabetes prevalence rates in the less urbanized and thinly populated strata. When considering all counties, good sociodemographic environments were associated with lower total diabetes prevalence rates (prevalence difference 2.77, 95% confidence interval 2.71-2.83), suggesting that counties with poor sociodemographic environments have an annual prevalence rate 2.77 per 100,000 persons higher than counties with good sociodemographic environments. CONCLUSIONS: Increasing attention has focused on environmental exposures as contributors to diabetes pathogenesis, and the present findings suggest that comprehensive approaches to diabetes prevention must include interventions to improve environmental quality.

Resident memory T cells (TRM cells) are an important first-line defense against respiratory pathogens, but the unique contributions of lung TRM cell populations to protective immunity and the factors that govern their localization to different compartments of the lung are not well understood. Here, we show that airway and interstitial TRM cells have distinct effector functions and that CXCR6 controls the partitioning of TRM cells within the lung by recruiting CD8 TRM cells to the airways. The absence of CXCR6 significantly decreases airway CD8 TRM cells due to altered trafficking of CXCR6-/- cells within the lung, and not decreased survival in the airways. CXCL16, the ligand for CXCR6, is localized primarily at the respiratory epithelium, and mice lacking CXCL16 also had decreased CD8 TRM cells in the airways. Finally, blocking CXCL16 inhibited the steady-state maintenance of airway TRM cells. Thus, the CXCR6/CXCL16 signaling axis controls the localization of TRM cells to different compartments of the lung and maintains airway TRM cells. ",
        "Association of a Comprehensive Smoking Cessation Program With Smoking Abstinence Among Patients With Cancer. Importance: Patients with cancer who smoke after diagnosis risk experiencing reductions in treatment effectiveness, survival rates, and quality of life, and increases in complications, cancer recurrence, and second primary cancers. Smoking cessation can significantly affect these outcomes, but to date comprehensive treatment is not widely implemented in the oncologic setting. Objectives: To describe a potential model tobacco treatment program (TTP) implemented in a cancer setting, report on its long-term outcomes, and highlight its importance to quality patient care. Design, Setting, and Participants: A prospective cohort of smokers was treated in the TTP at a comprehensive cancer center from January 1, 2006, to August 31, 2015. Data analysis was performed from November 2017 to December 2018. Participants included 3245 patients (2343 with current cancer; 309 with previous cancer; 593 with no cancer history) drawn from a population of 5061 smokers referred for treatment in the TTP. Reasons for exclusion included follow-up for a noncancerous disease, no medical consultation, smoked less than 1 cigarette per day; or died before the 9-month follow-up. Exposures: Treatment consisted of an in-person medical consultation, 6 to 8 in-person and telephone follow-up counseling sessions, and 10 to 12 weeks of pharmacotherapy. Main Outcomes and Measures: Primary outcome was 9-month 7-day point-prevalence abstinence evaluated using time-specific (3-, 6-, and 9-month follow-ups) and longitudinal covariate-adjusted and unadjusted regression models with multiple imputation, intention-to-treat, and respondent-only approaches to missing data. The Fagerstr\u00f6m Test for Cigarette Dependence was used as a measure of dependence (possible range, 0-10; higher numbers indicate greater dependence). Results: Of the 3245 smokers, 1588 (48.9%) were men, 322 (9.9%) were of black race/ethnicity, 172 (5.3%) were of Hispanic race/ethnicity, and 2498 (76.0%) were of white race/ethnicity. Mean (SD) age was 54 (11.4) years; Fagerstr\u00f6m Test for Cigarette Dependence score, 4.41 (2.2), number of cigarettes smoked per day,\u200917.1 (10.7); years smoked, 33 (13.2); and 1393 patients (42.9%) had at least 1 psychiatric comorbidity. Overall self-reported abstinence was 45.1% at 3 months, 45.8% at 6 months, and 43.7% at 9 months in the multiply imputed sample. Results across all models were consistent, suggesting that, in comparison with smokers with no cancer history, abstinence rates within this TTP program did not differ appreciably whether smokers had current cancer, were a cancer survivor, or had smoking-related cancers, with the exception of patients with head and neck cancer; the rates were higher at 9 months (relative risk, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.11-1.56; P\u2009=\u2009.001) and in longitudinal models (relative risk, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.08-1.42; P\u2009=\u2009.002). Conclusions and Relevance: In this study, mean smoking abstinence rates did not differ significantly between patients with cancer and those without cancer. These findings suggest that providing comprehensive tobacco treatment in the oncologic setting can result in sustained high abstinence rates for all patients with cancer and survivors and should be included as standard of care to ensure the best possible cancer treatment outcomes.

        "Longitudinal Associations between Sleep, Intrusive Thoughts, and Alcohol Problems Among Veterans. BACKGROUND: Research suggests bidirectional associations between symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and sleep disturbance, both of which have been associated with alcohol problems. However, few studies have examined the interplay of these conditions in predicting alcohol problems over time. This study tested 2 competing models: (i) sleep disturbance as a mediator of the association between intrusive thoughts about trauma and alcohol problems and (ii) intrusion symptoms as the mediator of the sleep/alcohol problem association. METHODS: Veterans (N\u00a0=\u00a0325, 93% male, 81% White) completed assessments at baseline, 6\u00a0months, and 12\u00a0months as part of a larger observational study. Zero-inflated-negative binomial models were used to examine indirect effects of baseline predictors on (i) yes/no likelihood and (ii) number of 12-month alcohol problems through 6-month mediators. Models controlled for past-year cannabis use and drinks consumed per week at baseline. RESULTS: The only significant predictor of alcohol problem likelihood was baseline drinking quantity. Baseline PTSD intrusions had a direct effect on number of alcohol problems at 12\u00a0months, with no indirect (mediated) effect through 6-month sleep disturbance. In the competing model, baseline sleep disturbance had a marginally significant direct effect on 12-month alcohol problems, with a significant indirect effect through 6-month PTSD intrusions. CONCLUSIONS: PTSD intrusions are associated with more alcohol problems and help explain the long-term association between sleep and alcohol problems among veterans. Because sleep disturbances are associated with more intrusive thoughts about trauma, we recommend that treatments targeting sleep in the context of PTSD and alcohol use include a cognitive component.

        "Medicaid Reimbursement for Common Spine Procedures: Are Compensation Rates Consistent?. STUDY DESIGN: Health Services Research. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to determine the variability of Medicaid (MCD) reimbursement for patients who require spine procedures, and to assess how this compares to regional Medicare (MCR) reimbursement as a marker of access to spine surgery. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: The current health care environment includes two major forms of government reimbursement: MCD and MCR, which are regulated and funded by the state and federal government, respectively. METHODS: MCD reimbursement rates from each state were obtained for eight spine procedures, utilizing online web searches: anterior cervical decompression and fusion, posterior cervical decompression and fusion, posterior lumbar decompression, single-level posterior lumbar fusion, posterior fusion for deformity (less than six levels; six to 12 levels; 13+ levels), and lumbar microdiscectomy. Discrepancy in reimbursement for these procedures on a state-to-state basis, as well as overall differences in MCD versus MCR reimbursement, was determined. Procedures were examined to identify whether certain surgical interventions have greater discrepancy in reimbursement. RESULTS: The average MCD reimbursement was 78.4% of that for MCR. However, there was significant variation between states (38.8%-140% of MCR for the combined eight procedures). On average, New York, New Jersey, Florida, and Rhode Island provided MCD reimbursements <50% of MCR reimbursements in the region. In total, 20 and 42 states provided <75% and 100% of MCR reimbursements, respectively. Based upon relative reimbursement, MCD appears to value microdiscectomy (84.1% of MCR; P\u200a=\u200a0.10) over other elective spine procedures. Microdiscectomy also had the most interstate variation in MCD reimbursement: 39.0% to 207.0% of MCR. CONCLUSION: Large disparities were found between MCR and MCD when comparing identical procedures. Further research is necessary to fully understand the effect of these significant differences. However, it is likely that these discrepancies lead to suboptimal access to necessary spine care.

        "Inflammation Induced Sensory Nerve Growth and Pain Hypersensitivity Requires the N-Type Calcium Channel Cav2.2. Voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs) are important mediators of pain hypersensitivity during inflammatory states, but their role in sensory nerve growth remains underexplored. Here, we assess the role of the N-type calcium channel Cav2.2 in the complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) model of inflammatory pain. We demonstrate with in situ hybridization and immunoblotting, an increase in Cav2.2 expression after hind paw CFA injection in sensory neurons that respond to thermal stimuli, but not in two different mechanosensitive neuronal populations. Further, Cav2.2 upregulation post-CFA correlates with thermal but not mechanical hyperalgesia in behaving mice, and this hypersensitivity is blocked with a specific Cav2.2 inhibitor. Voltage clamp recordings reveal a significant increase in Cav2.2 currents post-CFA, while current clamp analyses demonstrate a significant increase in action potential frequency. Moreover, CFA-induced sensory nerve growth, which involves the extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK1/2) signaling pathway and likely contributes to inflammation-induced hyperalgesia, was blocked with the Cav2.2 inhibitor. Together, this work uncovers a role for Cav2.2 during inflammation, demonstrating that VGCC activity can promote thermal hyperalgesia through both changes in firing rates of sensory neurons as well as promotion of new neurite outgrowth.

        "Sampling, identification and sensory evaluation of odors of a newborn baby's head and amniotic fluid. For baby odor analyses, noninvasive, stress-free sample collection is important. Using a simple method, we succeeded in obtaining fresh odors from the head of five newborn babies. These odors were chemically analyzed by two-dimensional gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC\u2009\u00d7\u2009GC-MS), and compared with each other or with the odor of amniotic fluid from the baby's mother. We identified 31 chemical components of the volatile odors from neonate heads and 21 from amniotic fluid. Although 15 of these components were common to both sources, there was an apparent difference in the GC\u2009\u00d7\u2009GC patterns between the head and amniotic fluid odors, so the neonate head odor might be individually distinct immediately after birth. Therefore, we made artificial mixtures of the major odor components of the neonate head and maternal amniotic fluid, and used psychological tests to examine whether or not these odors could be distinguished from each other. Our data show that the artificial odor of a neonate head could be distinguished from that of amniotic fluid, and that the odors of artificial head odor mixtures could be correctly discriminated for neonates within an hour after birth and at 2 or 3 days of age.

        "Effects of Model, Method of Collection, and Topography on Chemical Elements and Metals in the Aerosol of Tank-Style Electronic Cigarettes. Our purpose was to examine the effect of model, puffing topography (voltage, air-flow, puff interval), and method of collection on 19 elements/metals in aerosols from six tank-style electronic cigarettes (EC). Aerosols were collected from six brands using a cold trap or impinger and various puffing topographies. 19 elements were quantified using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy. 16 elements/metals were present and quantified in the aerosols. The total concentrations of elements/metals ranged from 43 to 3,138\u2009\u00b5g/L with the impinger method of collection and 226 to 6,767\u2009\u00b5g/L with the cold trap method. The concentrations of individual elements were often similar across brands and across topographies. Some elements (e.g., zinc) were present in most aerosols, while others (e.g., cadmium, titanium, vanadium) were rarely found. Concentrations of some elements (e.g., lead) increased in aerosols as voltage/power increased. The model with fewest metal parts in the atomizer had the fewest metals in its aerosols. Most elements/metals in the aerosols have been found previously in the atomizers of EC. All tank-style aerosols had elements/metals that appeared to originate in the atomizers, and concentrations increased with increasing power. Concentrations of some elements were high enough to be a health concern. ",
        "Trends in Hospitalization for Infective Endocarditis as a Reason for Admission or a Secondary Diagnosis. We postulate that the trends for infective endocarditis (IE) are different for patients admitted for this condition compared with those admitted for a different reason with IE as a secondary diagnosis. Using the Myocardial Infarction Data Acquisition System (MIDAS) database, we analyzed 21,443 records of patients hospitalized with diagnosis of IE from 1994 to 2015. There were 9,191 patients hospitalized with IE as the primary diagnosis, and 12,252 patients with IE as a secondary diagnosis. Piecewise linear models were used to detect changes in trends. A bootstrap method was used to assess the statistical significance of the slopes and break point of each model. Differences in co-morbidities and microbiological patterns were analyzed. Trend analysis showed a significant decrease in IE as the primary diagnosis starting in the year 2004 (p <0.01). Hospitalizations with IE as a secondary diagnosis showed a linear increase in incidence (p <0.001), without any change points. In primary diagnosis IE, the proportion of streptococci as a causative microorganism was higher compared with staphylococci (p <0.001). On the contrary, in secondary diagnosis IE, the proportion of staphylococci was higher than streptococci (p <0.001). The proportion of gram-negative and other organism IE was similar in both groups. In conclusion, this study showed 2 divergent temporal trends in hospitalizations for IE as a primary or secondary diagnosis starting in 2004. The profile of the microorganisms reveals a steady higher proportion of staphylococcal infection in secondary diagnosis IE compared with streptococcal infection. Different strategies are needed for the prevention of IE. ",
        "Asymmetric inheritance of spindle microtubule-organizing centres preserves replicative lifespan. The differential distribution of the microtubule-organizing centres (MTOCs) that orchestrate spindle formation during cell division is a fascinating phenomenon originally described in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and later found to be conserved during stem cell divisions in organisms ranging from Drosophila to humans. Whether predetermined MTOC inheritance patterns fulfil any biological function is however unknown. Using a genetically designed S. cerevisiae strain that displays a constitutively inverted MTOC fate, we demonstrate that the asymmetric segregation of these structures is critical to ensure normal levels of the Sir2 sirtuin and correct localization of the mitochondrial inheritance regulator Mfb1, and therefore to properly distribute functional mitochondria and protein aggregates between the mother and daughter cells. Consequently, interfering with this process severely accelerates cellular ageing. ",
        "Observational retrospective study of the association of initial healthcare provider for new-onset low back pain with early and long-term opioid use. OBJECTIVE: This study examined the association of initial provider treatment with early and long-term opioid use in a national sample of patients with new-onset low back pain (LBP). DESIGN: A retrospective cohort study of patients with new-onset LBP from 2008 to 2013. SETTING: The study evaluated outpatient and inpatient claims from patient visits, pharmacy claims and inpatient and outpatient procedures with initial providers seen for new-onset LBP. PARTICIPANTS: 216 504 individuals aged 18 years or older across the USA who were diagnosed with new-onset LBP and were opioid-na\u00efve were included. Participants had commercial or Medicare Advantage insurance. EXPOSURES: The primary independent variable is type of initial healthcare provider including physicians and conservative therapists (physical therapists, chiropractors, acupuncturists). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Short-term opioid use (within 30 days of the index visit) following new LBP visit and long-term opioid use (starting within 60 days of the index date and either 120 or more days' supply of opioids over 12 months, or 90 days or more supply of opioids and 10 or more opioid prescriptions over 12 months). RESULTS: Short-term use of opioids was 22%. Patients who received initial treatment from chiropractors or physical therapists had decreased odds of short-term and long-term opioid use compared with those who received initial treatment from primary care physicians (PCPs) (adjusted OR (AOR) (95%\u2009CI) 0.10 (0.09 to 0.10) and 0.15 (0.13 to 0.17), respectively). Compared with PCP visits, initial chiropractic and physical therapy also were associated with decreased odds of long-term opioid use in a propensity score matched sample (AOR (95%\u2009CI) 0.21 (0.16 to 0.27) and 0.29 (0.12 to 0.69), respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Initial visits to chiropractors or physical therapists is associated with substantially decreased early and long-term use of opioids. Incentivising use of conservative therapists may be a strategy to reduce risks of early and long-term opioid use. ",
        "Microbial communities in the tropical air ecosystem follow a precise diel cycle. The atmosphere is vastly underexplored as a habitable ecosystem for microbial organisms. In this study, we investigated 795 time-resolved metagenomes from tropical air, generating 2.27 terabases of data. Despite only 9 to 17% of the generated sequence data currently being assignable to taxa, the air harbored a microbial diversity that rivals the complexity of other planetary ecosystems. The airborne microbial organisms followed a clear diel cycle, possibly driven by environmental factors. Interday taxonomic diversity exceeded day-to-day and month-to-month variation. Environmental time series revealed the existence of a large core of microbial taxa that remained invariable over 13 mo, thereby underlining the long-term robustness of the airborne community structure. Unlike terrestrial or aquatic environments, where prokaryotes are prevalent, the tropical airborne biomass was dominated by DNA from eukaryotic phyla. Specific fungal and bacterial species were strongly correlated with temperature, humidity, and CO2 concentration, making them suitable biomarkers for studying the bioaerosol dynamics of the atmosphere.

        "The Washing Machine as a Reservoir for Transmission of Extended-Spectrum-Beta-Lactamase (CTX-M-15)-Producing Klebsiella oxytoca ST201 to Newborns. During the period from April 2012 to May 2013, 13 newborns (1\u2009to\u20094\u2009weeks of age) and 1 child in a pediatric hospital ward in Germany were colonized with Klebsiella oxytoca producing an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) (CTX-M-15). A microbiological source-tracking analysis with human and environmental samples was carried out to identify the source and transmission pathways of the K. oxytoca clone. In addition, different hygienic intervention methods were evaluated. K. oxytoca isolates were detected in the detergent drawer and on the rubber door seal of a domestic washer-extractor machine that was used in the same ward to wash laundry for the newborns, as well as in two sinks. These strains were typed using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and multilocus sequence typing. The environmental findings were compared with those for the human strains and the isolates detected on clothing. The results from both techniques showed that the strains were identical (sequence type 201 and PFGE type 00531, a clone specific to this hospital and not previously isolated in Germany), emphasizing the washing machine as a reservoir and fomite for the transmission of these multidrug-resistant bacteria. After the washing machine was taken out of use, no further colonizations were detected during the subsequent 4-year period.IMPORTANCE Washing machines should be further investigated as possible sites for horizontal gene transfer (ESBL genes) and cross-contamination with clinically important Gram-negative strains. Particularly in the health care sector, the knowledge of possible (re-)contamination of laundry (patients' clothes and staff uniforms) with multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria could help to prevent and to control nosocomial infections. This report describes an outbreak with a single strain of a multidrug-resistant bacterium (Klebsiella oxytoca sequence type 201) in a neonatal intensive care unit that was terminated only when the washing machine was removed. In addition, the study implies that changes in washing machine design and processing are required to prevent accumulation of residual water where microbial growth can occur and contaminate clothes.

        "Allele-specific NKX2-5 binding underlies multiple genetic associations with human electrocardiographic traits. The cardiac transcription factor (TF) gene NKX2-5 has been associated with electrocardiographic (EKG) traits through genome-wide association studies (GWASs), but the extent to which differential binding of NKX2-5 at common regulatory variants contributes to these traits has not yet been studied. We analyzed transcriptomic and epigenomic data from induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes from seven related individuals, and identified ~2,000 single-nucleotide variants associated with allele-specific effects (ASE-SNVs) on NKX2-5 binding. NKX2-5 ASE-SNVs were enriched for altered TF motifs, for heart-specific expression quantitative trait loci and for EKG GWAS signals. Using fine-mapping combined with epigenomic data from induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes, we prioritized candidate causal variants for EKG traits, many of which were NKX2-5 ASE-SNVs. Experimentally characterizing two NKX2-5 ASE-SNVs (rs3807989 and rs590041) showed that they modulate the expression of target genes via differential protein binding in cardiac cells, indicating that they are functional variants underlying EKG GWAS signals. Our results show that differential NKX2-5 binding at numerous regulatory variants across the genome contributes to EKG phenotypes. ",
        "The effect of early discrimination on accelerated aging among African Americans. OBJECTIVE: This study examined the role of depressive symptoms in mediating the relationship between early life experiences of racial discrimination and accelerated aging in adulthood for African Americans (i.e., prediction over a 19-year period, from ages 10 to 29) after adjusting for gender and health behaviors. METHOD: Longitudinal self-report data over 7 waves of data collection from the Family and Community Health Study were utilized. The sample included 368 African Americans with usable gene expression data to compute accelerated aging, as well as complete data on all self-report variables including racial discrimination (Schedule of Racist Events) and depression (Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children-Version 4). Blood was collected by antecubital blood draws from participants at age 29. The proposed model was tested by path analysis. RESULTS: Findings revealed that high discrimination at ages 10-15 was associated with depression at ages 20-29 (\u03b2 = .19, p = .001), controlling for depression at ages 10-15, which, in turn, was related to accelerated cellular-level aging (\u03b2 = .11, p = .048) after controlling for gender, alcohol consumption, and cigarette use. The indirect effect of racial discrimination on aging through depression at ages 20-29 was significant (\u03b2 = .021, 95% confidence interval [.001, .057]), accounting for 32.3% of the total variance. CONCLUSION: These findings support research conceptualizations that early life stress due to racial discrimination lead to sustained negative affective states continuing into young adulthood that confer risk for accelerated aging and possibly premature disease and mortality in African Americans. These findings advance knowledge of potential underlying mechanisms that influence racial health disparities. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved). ",
        "AAV8-vectored suprachoroidal gene transfer produces widespread ocular transgene expression. There has been great progress in ocular gene therapy, but delivery of viral vectors to the retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE) and retina can be challenging. Subretinal injection, the preferred route of delivery for most applications, requires a surgical procedure that has risks. Herein we report a novel gene therapy delivery approach, suprachoroidal injection of AAV8 vectors, which is less invasive and could be done in an outpatient setting. Two weeks after suprachoroidal injection of AAV8.GFP in rats, GFP fluorescence covered 18.9% of RPE flat mounts and extended entirely around sagittal and transverse sections in RPE and photoreceptors. After 2 suprachoroidal injections of AAV8.GFP, GFP fluorescence covered 30.5% of RPE flat mounts. Similarly, widespread expression of GFP occurred in nonhuman primate and pig eyes after suprachoroidal injection of AAV8.GFP. Compared with subretinal injection in rats of RGX-314, an AAV8 vector expressing an anti-VEGF Fab, suprachoroidal injection of the same dose of RGX-314 resulted in similar expression of anti-VEGF Fab and similar suppression of VEGF-induced vascular leakage. Suprachoroidal AAV8 vector injection provides a noninvasive outpatient procedure to obtain widespread transgene expression in retina and RPE. ",
        "Sex Steroid Hormones and Asthma in a Nationwide Study of U.S. Adults. Rationale: Women have a higher burden of asthma than men. Although sex hormones may explain sex differences in asthma, their role is unclear.Objectives: To examine sex hormone levels and asthma in adults.Methods: Cross-sectional study of serum levels of free testosterone and estradiol and current asthma in 7,615 adults (3,953 men and 3,662 women) aged 18-79 years who participated in the 2013-2014 and 2015-2016 U.S. National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Logistic regression was used for the multivariable analysis of sex hormones and current asthma, which was conducted separately in women and men.Measurements and Main Results: Free testosterone levels in the fourth quartile were associated with lower odds of current asthma in women (odds ratio [OR] for the fourth quartile [Q4] vs. Q1, 0.56; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.39-0.80). Given an interaction between obesity and sex hormones on current asthma, we stratified the analysis by obesity. In this analysis, elevated free testosterone (OR for Q4 vs. Q1, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.37-0.91) and estradiol (OR for Q4 vs. Q1, 0.43; 95% CI, 0.23-0.78) levels were associated with reduced odds of current asthma in obese women, and an elevated serum estradiol was associated with lower odds of current asthma in nonobese men (OR for Q4 vs. Q1, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.21-0.90).Conclusions: Our findings suggest that sex hormones play a role in known sex differences in asthma in adults. Moreover, our results suggest that obesity modifies the effects of sex hormones on asthma in adults. ",
        "Rationally engineered Staphylococcus aureus Cas9 nucleases with high genome-wide specificity. RNA-guided CRISPR-Cas9 proteins have been widely used for genome editing, but their off-target activities limit broad application. The minimal Cas9 ortholog from Staphylococcus aureus (SaCas9) is commonly used for in vivo genome editing; however, no variant conferring high genome-wide specificity is available. Here, we report rationally engineered SaCas9 variants with highly specific genome-wide activity in human cells without compromising on-target efficiency. One engineered variant, referred to as SaCas9-HF, dramatically improved genome-wide targeting accuracy based on the genome-wide unbiased identification of double-stranded breaks enabled by sequencing (GUIDE-seq) method and targeted deep sequencing analyses. Among 15 tested human endogenous sites with the canonical NNGRRT protospacer adjacent motif (PAM), SaCas9-HF rendered no detectable off-target activities at 9 sites, minimal off-target activities at 6 sites, and comparable on-target efficiencies to those of wild-type SaCas9. Furthermore, among 4 known promiscuous targeting sites, SaCas9-HF profoundly reduced off-target activities compared with wild type. When delivered by an adeno-associated virus vector, SaCas9-HF also showed reduced off-target effects when targeting VEGFA in a human retinal pigmented epithelium cell line compared with wild type. Then, we further altered a previously described variant named KKH-SaCas9 that has a wider PAM recognition range. Similarly, the resulting KKH-HF remarkably reduced off-target activities and increased on- to off-target editing ratios. Our finding provides an alternative to wild-type SaCas9 for genome editing applications requiring exceptional genome-wide precision. ",
        "Hyperspectral Imaging of Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma for Cancer Margin Detection in Surgical Specimens from 102 Patients Using Deep Learning. Surgical resection of head and neck (H and N) squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) may yield inadequate surgical cancer margins in 10 to 20% of cases. This study investigates the performance of label-free, reflectance-based hyperspectral imaging (HSI) and autofluorescence imaging for SCC detection at the cancer margin in excised tissue specimens from 102 patients and uses fluorescent dyes for comparison. Fresh surgical specimens (n = 293) were collected during H and N SCC resections (n = 102). The tissue specimens were imaged with reflectance-based HSI and autofluorescence imaging and afterwards with two fluorescent dyes for comparison. A histopathological ground truth was made. Deep learning tools were developed to detect SCC with new patient samples (inter-patient) and machine learning for intra-patient tissue samples. Area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver-operator characteristic was used as the main evaluation metric. Additionally, the performance was estimated in mm increments circumferentially from the tumor-normal margin. In intra-patient experiments, HSI classified conventional SCC with an AUC of 0.82 up to 3 mm from the cancer margin, which was more accurate than proflavin dye and autofluorescence (both p < 0.05). Intra-patient autofluorescence imaging detected human papilloma virus positive (HPV+) SCC with an AUC of 0.99 at 3 mm and greater accuracy than proflavin dye (p < 0.05). The inter-patient results showed that reflectance-based HSI and autofluorescence imaging outperformed proflavin dye and standard red, green, and blue (RGB) images (p < 0.05). In new patients, HSI detected conventional SCC in the larynx, oropharynx, and nasal cavity with 0.85-0.95 AUC score, and autofluorescence imaging detected HPV+ SCC in tonsillar tissue with 0.91 AUC score. This study demonstrates that label-free, reflectance-based HSI and autofluorescence imaging methods can accurately detect the cancer margin in ex-vivo specimens within minutes. This non-ionizing optical imaging modality could aid surgeons and reduce inadequate surgical margins during SCC resections. ",
        "Conjugated polymers optically regulate the fate of endothelial colony-forming cells. The control of stem and progenitor cell fate is emerging as a compelling urgency for regenerative medicine. Here, we propose a innovative strategy to gain optical control of endothelial colony-forming cell fate, which represents the only known truly endothelial precursor showing robust in vitro proliferation and overwhelming vessel formation in vivo. We combine conjugated polymers, used as photo-actuators, with the advantages offered by optical stimulation over current electromechanical and chemical stimulation approaches. Light modulation provides unprecedented spatial and temporal resolution, permitting at the same time lower invasiveness and higher selectivity. We demonstrate that polymer-mediated optical excitation induces a robust enhancement of proliferation and lumen formation in vitro. We identify the underlying biophysical pathway as due to light-induced activation of TRPV1 channel. Altogether, our results represent an effective way to induce angiogenesis in vitro, which represents the proof of principle to improve the outcome of autologous cell-based therapy in vivo. ",
        "Destruction of tumor mass by gadolinium-loaded nanoparticles irradiated with monochromatic X-rays: Implications for the Auger therapy. Synchrotron generated monochromatic X-rays can be precisely tuned to the K-shell energy of high Z materials resulting in the release of the Auger electrons. In this work, we have employed this mechanism to destruct tumor spheroids. We first loaded gadolinium onto the surface of mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) producing gadolinium-loaded MSN (Gd-MSN). When Gd-MSN was added to the tumor spheroids, we observed efficient uptake and uniform distribution of Gd-MSN. Gd-MSN also can be taken up into cancer cells and localize to a site just outside of the cell nucleus. Exposure of the Gd-MSN containing tumor spheroids to monochromatic X-ray beams resulted in almost complete destruction. Importantly, this effect was observed at an energy level of 50.25\u2009keV, but not with 50.0\u2009keV. These results suggest that it is possible to use precisely tuned monochromatic X-rays to destruct tumor mass loaded with high Z materials, while sparing other cells. Our experiments point to the importance of nanoparticles to facilitate loading of gadolinium to tumor spheroids and to localize at a site close to the nucleus. Because the nanoparticles can target to tumor, our study opens up the possibility of developing a new type of radiation therapy for cancer. ",
        "Reducing Suicidal Ideation Through Insomnia Treatment (REST-IT): A Randomized Clinical Trial. OBJECTIVE: The authors sought to determine whether targeted treatment of insomnia with controlled-release zolpidem (zolpidem-CR) in suicidal adults with insomnia would provide a reduction in suicidal ideation superior to placebo. METHODS: Reducing Suicidal Ideation Through Insomnia Treatment was an 8-week three-site double-blind placebo-controlled parallel-group randomized controlled trial of zolpidem-CR hypnotic therapy compared with placebo, in conjunction with an open-label selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor. Participants were medication-free 18- to 65-year-olds with major depressive disorder, insomnia, and suicidal ideation. Suicidal ideation was the main outcome, measured first by the Scale for Suicide Ideation and second by the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS). RESULTS: A total of 103 participants were randomly assigned to receive zolpidem-CR (N=51) or placebo (N=52) (64 women and 39 men; mean age=40.5 years). Zolpidem-CR had a robust anti-insomnia effect, especially in patients with the most severe insomnia symptoms. No significant treatment effect was observed on the Scale for Suicide Ideation (least squares mean estimate=-0.56, SE=0.83, 95% CI=-2.19, 1.08), but the reduction in scores was significantly positively related to improvement in insomnia after accounting for the effect of other depression symptoms. The C-SSRS indicated that zolpidem-CR had a significant treatment effect (least squares mean estimate=-0.26, SE=0.12, 95% CI=-0.50, -0.02). The advantage for zolpidem-CR in reducing suicidal ideation on the C-SSRS was greater in patients with more severe insomnia. No deaths or suicide attempts occurred. CONCLUSIONS: Although the results do not support the routine prescription of hypnotic medication for mitigating suicidal ideation in all depressed outpatients with insomnia, they suggest that coprescription of a hypnotic during initiation of an antidepressant may be beneficial in suicidal outpatients, especially in patients with severe insomnia.

        "The introduction of new food retail opportunities in lower-income communities and the impact on fruit and vegetable intake: a systematic review. A lack of access to fresh fruits and vegetables (F&Vs) is associated with consumption of fewer F&Vs and higher risk of obesity, especially for lower-income individuals. It is widely believed that the addition of new food retail opportunities could improve F&V consumption and subsequently reduce the chronic disease burden. Observational studies provide some support for these hypotheses, but contradictions exist. In this study we sought to examine if the introduction of a food retailer affects F&V consumption in lower-income communities. We used a systematic PRISMA approach to conduct this study. We searched PubMed, EMBASE, and ProQuest Dissertations & Theses for academic journal references and gray literature published before August 2018. Included studies were those looking at the effect of the introduction of a new food retailer on F&V consumption. Studies were also categorized based on which dimensions of food access were targeted by the food retailer. We identified 15 studies meeting inclusion criteria: 11 studies reported a positive increase in F&V consumption attributable to the introduction of a new food retailer, of which 6 were statistically significant. The remaining 4 studies, all of which examined the impact of introducing a new retail supermarket, showed no change or a decrease in F&V intake. Results from studies which change the food environment generally support the idea that increased access to healthy food improves diet, but more studies are needed in order to assess the differences between the various types of retailers, and to identify strategies for improving impact. Understanding which types of new food retail programs are most likely to impact diet has implications for policies which incentivize new food retail. ",
        "Diagnosis of osteoporosis in statin-treated patients is dose-dependent. OBJECTIVE: Whether HMG-CoA-reductase inhibition, the main mechanism of statins, plays a role in the pathogenesis of osteoporosis, is not entirely known so far. Consequently, this study was set out to investigate the relationship of different kinds and dosages of statins with osteoporosis, hypothesising that the inhibition of the synthesis of cholesterol could influence sex-hormones and therefore the diagnosis of osteoporosis. METHODS: Medical claims data of all Austrians from 2006 to 2007 was used to identify all patients treated with statins to compute their daily defined dose averages of six different types of statins. We applied multiple logistic regression to analyse the dose-dependent risks of being diagnosed with osteoporosis for each statin individually. RESULTS: In the general study population, statin treatment was associated with an overrepresentation of diagnosed osteoporosis compared with controls (OR: 3.62, 95%\u2009CI 3.55 to 3.69, p<0.01). There was a highly non-trivial dependence of statin dosage with the ORs of osteoporosis. Osteoporosis was underrepresented in low-dose statin treatment (0-10\u2009mg per day), including lovastatin (OR: 0.39, CI 0.18 to 0.84, p<0.05), pravastatin (OR: 0.68, 95%\u2009CI 0.52 to 0.89, p<0.01), simvastatin (OR: 0.70, 95%\u2009CI 0.56 to 0.86, p<0.01) and rosuvastatin (OR: 0.69, 95%\u2009CI 0.55 to 0.87, p<0.01). However, the exceeding of the 40\u2009mg threshold for simvastatin (OR: 1.64, 95%\u2009CI 1.31 to 2.07, p<0.01), and the exceeding of a 20\u2009mg threshold for atorvastatin (OR: 1.78, 95%\u2009CI 1.41 to 2.23, p<0.01) and for rosuvastatin (OR: 2.04, 95%\u2009CI 1.31 to 3.18, p<0.01) was related to an overrepresentation of osteoporosis. CONCLUSION: Our results show that the diagnosis of osteoporosis in statin-treated patients is dose-dependent. Thus, osteoporosis is underrepresented in low-dose and overrepresented in high-dose statin treatment, demonstrating the importance of future studies' taking dose-dependency into account when investigating the relationship between statins and osteoporosis.

        "Coupling the State and Contents of Consciousness. One fundamental feature of consciousness is that the contents of consciousness depend on the state of consciousness. Here, we propose an answer to why this is so: both the state and the contents of consciousness depend on the activity of cortical layer 5 pyramidal (L5p) neurons. These neurons affect both cortical and thalamic processing, hence coupling the cortico-cortical and thalamo-cortical loops with each other. Functionally this coupling corresponds to the coupling between the state and the contents of consciousness. Together the cortico-cortical and thalamo-cortical loops form a thalamo-cortical broadcasting system, where the L5p cells are the central elements. This perspective makes one quite specific prediction: cortical processing that does not include L5p neurons will be unconscious. More generally, the present perspective suggests that L5p neurons have a central role in the mechanisms underlying consciousness. ",
        "Molecular Basis of The Retinal Pigment Epithelial Changes That Characterize The Ocular Lesion in Toxoplasmosis. When a person becomes infected with Toxoplasma gondii, ocular toxoplasmosis is the most common clinical presentation. The medical literature describes retinitis with surrounding hyperpigmentation secondary to proliferative changes in the retinal pigment epithelium, which is sufficiently characteristic that investigation often is not needed to make the diagnosis. We aimed to establish the frequency of \"typical\" ocular toxoplasmosis and delineate its molecular basis. Among 263 patients presenting consecutively with ocular toxoplasmosis to Ribeir\u00e3o Preto General Hospital in Brazil, where T. gondii infection is endemic, 94.2% of 345 eyes had retinal hyperpigmentation. In ARPE-19 and primary human retinal pigment epithelial cell monolayers exposed to minimal numbers of T. gondii tachyzoites, the proliferation marker-KI-67-was increased in uninfected cells, which also were rendered more susceptible to infection. RT-qPCR and ELISA detected increased expression of vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF) and insulin-like growth factor (IGF)1, and decreased expression of thrombospondin (TSP)1 by infected cells. Blockade of VEGF and IGF1-or supplementation of TSP1-reversed the proliferation phenotype in uninfected cells. Our findings confirm that hyperpigmentation is a characteristic feature of retinitis in ocular toxoplasmosis, and demonstrate that T. gondii-infected human retinal pigment epithelial cells secrete VEGF and IGF1, and reduce production of TSP1, to promote proliferation of adjacent uninfected cells and create this disease-specific appearance.

        "The air quality and health impacts of projected long-haul truck and rail freight transportation in the United States in 2050. Diesel emissions from freight transportation activities are a key threat to public health. This study examined the air quality and public health impacts of projected freight-related emissions in 2050 over the continental United States. Three emission scenarios were considered: (1) a projected business-as-usual socioeconomic growth with freight fleet turnover and stringent emission control (CTR); (2) the application of a carbon pricing climate policy (PO); and (3) further technology improvements to eliminate high-emitting conditions in the truck fleet (NS). The PO and NS cases are superimposed on the CTR case. Using a WRF-SMOKE-CMAQ-BenMAP modeling framework, we quantified the impacts of diesel fine particulate matter (PM2.5) emissions change on air quality, health, and economic benefits. In the CTR case, we simulate a widespread reduction of PM2.5 concentrations, between 0.5 and 1.5\u202f\u03bcg\u202fm-3, comparing to a base year of 2011. This translates into health benefits of 3600 (95% CI: 2400-4800) prevented premature deaths, corresponding to $38 (95% CI: $3.5-$100) billion. Compared to CTR case, the PO case can obtain ~9% more health benefits nationally, however, climate policy also affects the health outcomes regionally due to transition of demand from truck to rail; regions with fewer trucks could gain in health benefits, while regions with added rail freight may potentially experience a loss in health benefits due to air quality degradation. The NS case provides substantial additional benefits (~20%). These results support that a combination of continuous adoption of stringent emission standards and strong improvements in vehicle technology are necessary, as well as rewarding, to meet the sustainable freight and community health goals. States and metropolitan areas with high population density and usually high freight demand and emissions can take more immediate actions, such as accelerating vehicle technology improvements and removing high-emitting trucks, to improve air quality and health benefits.

        "Aurora B kinase activity is regulated by SET/TAF1 on Sgo2 at the inner centromere. The accurate regulation of phosphorylation at the kinetochore is essential for establishing chromosome bi-orientation. Phosphorylation of kinetochore proteins by the Aurora B kinase destabilizes improper kinetochore-microtubule attachments, whereas the phosphatase PP2A has a counteracting role. Imbalanced phosphoregulation leads to error-prone chromosome segregation and aneuploidy, a hallmark of cancer cells. However, little is known about the molecular events that control the balance of phosphorylation at the kinetochore. Here, we show that localization of SET/TAF1, an oncogene product, to centromeres maintains Aurora B kinase activity by inhibiting PP2A, thereby correcting erroneous kinetochore-microtubule attachment. SET localizes at the inner centromere by interacting directly with shugoshin 2, with SET levels declining at increased distances between kinetochore pairs, leading to establishment of chromosome bi-orientation. Moreover, SET overexpression induces chromosomal instability by disrupting kinetochore-microtubule attachment. Thus, our findings reveal the novel role of SET in fine-tuning the phosphorylation level at the kinetochore by balancing the activities of Aurora B and PP2A. ",
        "Cannabidiol Counteracts the Psychotropic Side-Effects of \u0394-9-Tetrahydrocannabinol in the Ventral Hippocampus through Bidirectional Control of ERK1-2 Phosphorylation. Evidence suggests that the phytocannabinoids \u0394-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD) differentially regulate salience attribution and psychiatric risk. The ventral hippocampus (vHipp) relays emotional salience via control of dopamine (DA) neuronal activity states, which are dysregulated in psychosis and schizophrenia. Using in vivo electrophysiology in male Sprague Dawley rats, we demonstrate that intra-vHipp THC strongly increases ventral tegmental area (VTA) DA neuronal frequency and bursting rates, decreases GABA frequency, and amplifies VTA beta, gamma and \u03b5 oscillatory magnitudes via modulation of local extracellular signal-regulated kinase phosphorylation (pERK1-2). Remarkably, whereas intra-vHipp THC also potentiates salience attribution in morphine place-preference and fear conditioning assays, CBD coadministration reverses these changes by downregulating pERK1-2 signaling, as pharmacological reactivation of pERK1-2 blocked the inhibitory properties of CBD. These results identify vHipp pERK1-2 signaling as a critical neural nexus point mediating THC-induced affective disturbances and suggest a potential mechanism by which CBD may counteract the psychotomimetic and psychotropic side effects of THC.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Strains of marijuana with high levels of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and low levels of cannabidiol (CBD) have been shown to underlie neuropsychiatric risks associated with high-potency cannabis use. However, the mechanisms by which CBD mitigates the side effects of THC have not been identified. We demonstrate that THC induces cognitive and affective abnormalities resembling neuropsychiatric symptoms directly in the hippocampus, while dysregulating dopamine activity states and amplifying oscillatory frequencies in the ventral tegmental area via modulation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling pathway. In contrast, CBD coadministration blocked THC-induced ERK phosphorylation, and prevented THC-induced behavioral and neural abnormalities. These findings identify a novel molecular mechanism that may account for how CBD functionally mitigates the neuropsychiatric side effects of THC. ",
        "Behaviour change, weight loss and remission of Type 2 diabetes: a community-based prospective cohort study. AIM: To quantify the association between behaviour change and weight loss after diagnosis of Type 2 diabetes, and the likelihood of remission of diabetes at 5-year follow-up. METHOD: We conducted a prospective cohort study in 867 people with newly diagnosed diabetes aged 40-69 years from the ADDITION-Cambridge\u00a0trial. Participants were identified via stepwise screening between 2002 and 2006, and underwent assessment of weight change, physical activity (EPAQ2 questionnaire), diet (plasma vitamin C and self-report), and alcohol consumption (self-report) at baseline and 1 year after diagnosis. Remission was examined at 5 years after diabetes diagnosis via HbA1c level. We constructed log binomial regression models to quantify the association between change in behaviour and weight over both the first year after diagnosis and the subsequent 1-5 years, as well as remission at 5-year follow-up. RESULTS: Diabetes remission was achieved in 257 participants (30%) at 5-year follow-up. Compared with people who maintained the same weight, those who achieved \u2265 10% weight loss in the first year after diagnosis had a significantly higher likelihood of remission [risk ratio 1.77 (95% CI 1.32 to 2.38; p<0.01)]. In the subsequent 1-5 years, achieving \u226510% weight loss was also associated with remission [risk ratio 2.43 (95% CI 1.78 to 3.31); p<0.01]. CONCLUSION: In a population-based sample of adults with screen-detected Type 2 diabetes, weight loss of \u226510% early in the disease trajectory was associated with a doubling of the likelihood of remission at 5 years. This was achieved without intensive lifestyle interventions or extreme calorie restrictions. Greater attention should be paid to enabling people to achieve weight loss following diagnosis of Type 2 diabetes. ",
        "Encorafenib, Binimetinib, and Cetuximab in BRAF V600E-Mutated Colorectal Cancer. BACKGROUND: Patients with metastatic colorectal cancer with the BRAF V600E mutation have a poor prognosis, with a median overall survival of 4 to 6 months after failure of initial therapy. Inhibition of BRAF alone has limited activity because of pathway reactivation through epidermal growth factor receptor signaling. METHODS: In this open-label, phase 3 trial, we enrolled 665 patients with BRAF V600E-mutated metastatic colorectal cancer who had had disease progression after one or two previous regimens. Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive encorafenib, binimetinib, and cetuximab (triplet-therapy group); encorafenib and cetuximab (doublet-therapy group); or the investigators' choice of either cetuximab and irinotecan or cetuximab and FOLFIRI (folinic acid, fluorouracil, and irinotecan) (control group). The primary end points were overall survival and objective response rate in the triplet-therapy group as compared with the control group. A secondary end point was overall survival in the doublet-therapy group as compared with the control group. We report here the results of a prespecified interim analysis. RESULTS: The median overall survival was 9.0 months in the triplet-therapy group and 5.4 months in the control group (hazard ratio for death, 0.52; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.39 to 0.70; P<0.001). The confirmed response rate was 26% (95% CI, 18 to 35) in the triplet-therapy group and 2% (95% CI, 0 to 7) in the control group (P<0.001). The median overall survival in the doublet-therapy group was 8.4 months (hazard ratio for death vs. control, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.45 to 0.79; P<0.001). Adverse events of grade 3 or higher occurred in 58% of patients in the triplet-therapy group, in 50% in the doublet-therapy group, and in 61% in the control group. CONCLUSIONS: A combination of encorafenib, cetuximab, and binimetinib resulted in significantly longer overall survival and a higher response rate than standard therapy in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer with the BRAF V600E mutation.

        "Airway Inflammation and Lung Function in Sickle Cell Disease. .                         Rationale:.                      Asthma is a common comorbid condition in sickle cell disease (SCD). However, obstructive lung disease is prevalent in SCD, independent of a diagnosis of asthma. It is speculated that the heightened state of inflammation in SCD, involving pathways distinct from allergic asthma, may underlie the SCD-specific obstructive disease. .                         Objective:.                      The objective of the study was to compare airway and systemic inflammatory markers between SCD patients with pulmonary manifestations and patients with allergic asthma, and correlate the discriminating inflammatory markers with clinical measures of pulmonary disease. .                         Materials and Methods:.                      In a pilot translational study conducted at the Children's Hospital at Montefiore, 15 patients with SCD, and history of asthma, airway obstruction, or airway hyper-reactivity, and 15 control patients with allergic asthma 6-21 years of age were recruited. Inflammatory markers, including peripheral blood T helper cell subsets, serum and exhaled breath condensate (EBC) cytokines and chemokines of the Th-1/Th-17, Th-2, and monocytic pathways, and serum cysteinyl leukotrienes B4 (LTB4), were quantified, compared between the study groups, and correlated with atopic sensitization, pulmonary function tests, and markers of hemolysis. .                         Results:.                      White blood cells (P\u2009<\u20090.05) and monocytes (P\u2009<\u20090.001) were elevated in the SCD group, while atopic characteristics were higher in the control asthma group. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (P\u2009<\u20090.01), interferon gamma inducible protein (IP)-10 (P\u2009<\u20090.05), and interleukin-4 (P\u2009<\u20090.01) in serum and monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP)-1 in EBC were higher in the SCD group (P\u2009\u2264\u20090.05). Forced vital capacity (FVC) and forced expiratory volume in 1\u2009s (FEV1) in patients with SCD inversely correlated with serum IP-10 and LTB4 levels. .                         Conclusions:.                      Compared with atopic asthmatic patients, inflammatory markers involving Th-1, Th-2, and monocytic pathways were higher in the SCD group, among which Th-1 measures correlated with pulmonary function deficits.

        "Racial discrimination, the superwoman schema, and allostatic load: exploring an integrative stress-coping model among African American women. Racial discrimination has been linked to allostatic load (i.e., cumulative biological stress) among African American women. However, limited attention has been given to psychosocial processes involved in the stress response-critical for understanding biological pathways to health-in studies examining racial discrimination as a social determinant of health. We examined whether the superwoman schema (SWS), a multidimensional culture-specific framework characterizing psychosocial responses to stress among African American women, modifies the association between racial discrimination and allostatic load. We used purposive sampling to recruit a community sample of African American women ages 30-50 from five San Francisco Bay Area counties (n = 208). Path analysis was used to test for interactions while accounting for the covariance among SWS subscales using both linear and quadratic models. Significant interactions were observed between racial discrimination and four of the five SWS subscales. Feeling obligated to present an image of strength and an obligation to suppress emotions were each protective whereas feeling an intense motivation to succeed and feeling an obligation to help others exacerbated the independent health risk associated with experiencing racial discrimination. Our findings affirm the need to consider individual variability in coping and potentially other psychosocial processes involved in the stress response process, and offer several insights that may help elucidate the mechanisms by which racial discrimination gets \"under the skin.\".

        "In vivo imaging of mitochondrial membrane potential in non-small-cell lung cancer. Mitochondria are essential regulators of cellular energy and metabolism, and have a crucial role in sustaining the growth and survival of cancer cells. A central function of mitochondria is the synthesis of ATP by oxidative phosphorylation, known as mitochondrial bioenergetics. Mitochondria maintain oxidative phosphorylation by creating a membrane potential gradient that is generated by the electron transport chain to drive the synthesis of ATP1. Mitochondria are essential for tumour initiation and maintaining tumour cell growth in cell culture and xenografts2,3. However, our understanding of oxidative mitochondrial metabolism in cancer is limited because most studies have been performed in vitro in cell culture models. This highlights a need for in vivo studies\u00a0to better understand how oxidative metabolism supports tumour growth. Here we measure mitochondrial membrane potential in non-small-cell lung cancer in vivo using a voltage-sensitive, positron emission tomography (PET) radiotracer known as 4-[18F]fluorobenzyl-triphenylphosphonium (18F-BnTP)4. By using PET imaging of 18F-BnTP, we profile mitochondrial membrane potential in autochthonous mouse models of lung cancer, and find distinct functional mitochondrial heterogeneity within subtypes of lung tumours. The use of 18F-BnTP PET imaging enabled us to functionally profile mitochondrial membrane potential in live tumours. ",
        "Maternal exposure to intimate partner violence and breastfeeding practices in 51 low-income and middle-income countries: A population-based cross-sectional study. BACKGROUND: Intimate partner violence (IPV) against women is a major global health issue, particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), that is associated with poor physical and mental health, but its association with breastfeeding practices is understudied. Both the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) recommend that children initiate breastfeeding within the first hour of birth and be exclusively breastfed for the first 6 months of life. Breastfeeding within the first hour of birth is critical to newborn survival, and exclusive breastfeeding for 6 months is recognised to offer significant health benefits to mothers and their infants. We examined the association of maternal exposure to IPV with early initiation of breastfeeding (within 1 hour of birth) and exclusive breastfeeding in the first 6 months. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We assessed population-based cross-sectional Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) from 51 LMICs. Data from the most recent DHS in each country (conducted between January 2000 and January 2019) with data available on IPV and breastfeeding practices were used. By WHO region, 52.9% (27/51) were from Africa, 11.8% (6/51) from the Americas, 7.8% (4/51) from the Eastern Mediterranean, 11.8% (6/51) from Europe, 11.8% (6/51) from South-East Asia, and 3.9% (2/51) from the Western Pacific. We estimated multilevel logistic regression models for any IPV and each type of IPV separately (physical violence, sexual violence, and emotional violence), accounting for demographic and socioeconomic factors. Depending on specification, the sample size varied between 95,320 and 102,318 mother-infant dyads. The mean age of mothers was 27.5 years, and the prevalence of any lifetime exposure to IPV among mothers was 33.3% (27.6% for physical violence, 8.4% for sexual violence, and 16.4% for emotional violence). Mothers exposed to any IPV were less likely to initiate breastfeeding early (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]: 0.88 [95% CI 0.85-0.97], p < 0.001) and breastfeed exclusively in the first 6 months (AOR: 0.87 [95% CI 0.82-0.92], p < 0.001). The associations were similar for each type of IPV and were overall consistent across infant's sex and WHO regions. After simultaneously adjusting for all 3 types of IPV, all 3 types of IPV were independently associated with decreased likelihood of early breastfeeding initiation, but only exposure to physical violence was independently associated with a decreased likelihood of exclusively breastfeeding in the first 6 months. The main limitations of this study included the use of cross-sectional datasets, the possibility of residual confounding of the observed associations by household wealth, and the possibility of underreporting of IPV experiences attenuating the magnitude of observed associations. CONCLUSIONS: Our study indicates that mothers exposed to any form of IPV (physical, sexual, or emotional violence) were less likely to initiate breastfeeding early and breastfeed exclusively in the first 6 months. These findings may inform the argument for antenatal screening for IPV in LMICs and the provision of services to not only improve mothers' safety and well-being, but also support them in adopting recommended breastfeeding practices.

        "Hemozoin produced by mammals confers heme tolerance. Free heme is cytotoxic as exemplified by hemolytic diseases and genetic deficiencies in heme recycling and detoxifying pathways. Thus, intracellular accumulation of heme has not been observed in mammalian cells to date. Here we show that mice deficient for the heme transporter SLC48A1 (also known as HRG1) accumulate over ten-fold excess heme in reticuloendothelial macrophage lysosomes that are 10 to 100 times larger than normal. Macrophages tolerate these high concentrations of heme by crystallizing them into hemozoin, which heretofore has only been found in blood-feeding organisms. SLC48A1 deficiency results in impaired erythroid maturation and an inability to systemically respond to iron deficiency. Complete heme tolerance requires a fully-operational heme degradation pathway as haplo insufficiency of HMOX1 combined with SLC48A1 inactivation causes perinatal lethality demonstrating synthetic lethal interactions between heme transport and degradation. Our studies establish the formation of hemozoin by mammals as a previously unsuspected heme tolerance pathway. ",
        "Altered Dynamics of Canonical Feedback Inhibition Predicts Increased Burst Transmission in Chronic Epilepsy. Inhibitory interneurons, organized into canonical feedforward and feedback motifs, play a key role in controlling normal and pathological neuronal activity. We demonstrate prominent quantitative changes in the dynamics of feedback inhibition in a rat model of chronic epilepsy (male Wistar rats). Systematic interneuron recordings revealed a large decrease in intrinsic excitability of basket cells and oriens-lacunosum moleculare interneurons in epileptic animals. Additionally, the temporal dynamics of interneuron recruitment by recurrent feedback excitation were strongly altered, resulting in a profound loss of initial feedback inhibition during synchronous CA1 pyramidal activity. Biophysically constrained models of the complete feedback circuit motifs of normal and epileptic animals revealed that, as a consequence of altered feedback inhibition, burst activity arising in CA3 is more strongly converted to a CA1 output. This suggests that altered dynamics of feedback inhibition promote the transmission of epileptiform bursts to hippocampal projection areas.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT We quantitatively characterized changes of the CA1 feedback inhibitory circuit in a model of chronic temporal lobe epilepsy. This study shows, for the first time, that dynamic recruitment of inhibition in feedback circuits is altered and establishes the cellular mechanisms for this change. Computational modeling revealed that the observed changes are likely to systematically alter CA1 input-output properties leading to (1) increased seizure propagation through CA1 and (2) altered computation of synchronous CA3 input.

        "Dietary Sugars Alter Hepatic Fatty Acid Oxidation via Transcriptional and Post-translational Modifications of Mitochondrial Proteins. Dietary sugars, fructose and glucose, promote hepatic de novo lipogenesis and modify the effects of a high-fat diet (HFD) on the development of insulin resistance. Here, we show that fructose and glucose supplementation of an HFD exert divergent effects on hepatic mitochondrial function and fatty acid oxidation. This is mediated via three different nodes of regulation, including differential effects on malonyl-CoA levels, effects on mitochondrial size/protein abundance, and acetylation of mitochondrial proteins. HFD- and HFD plus fructose-fed mice have decreased CTP1a activity, the rate-limiting enzyme of fatty acid oxidation, whereas knockdown of fructose metabolism increases CPT1a and its acylcarnitine products. Furthermore, fructose-supplemented HFD leads to increased acetylation of ACADL and CPT1a, which is associated with decreased fat metabolism. In summary, dietary fructose, but not glucose, supplementation of HFD impairs mitochondrial size, function, and protein acetylation, resulting in decreased fatty acid oxidation and development of metabolic dysregulation.

        "Interprofessional collaboration improves linkages to primary care: a longitudinal analysis. The first steps of the HIV care continuum include patients finding access to HIV testing and primary care. Psychosocial providers (\"providers\"), such as social workers, health educators, and outreach workers comprise a workforce tasked with linking patients to HIV testing and primary care. This study examines longitudinal associations between provider- and organization-level factors and linkage to HIV testing and primary care. The sample included 245 providers in 36 agencies in New York City. We used longitudinal data (baseline and 12- and 24-months follow-ups) and multilevel ordinal logistic regression to examine associations between factors distributed in three theoretical socioecological domains: individual (demographic and HIV training characteristics); relationship (interprofessional collaboration); and agency (size and capacity), and frequency of HIV testing and primary care linkages. Approximately 30% of providers linked 20 or more patients to HIV testing or HIV primary care in the previous six months. Providers' higher endorsement of interprofessional collaboration at 12 months, formal HIV training, younger age, and Latinx ethnicity had higher odds of making more linkages to HIV testing and HIV primary care at 24 months. Training providers in interprofessional collaboration principles and practice and basic HIV knowledge may improve the frequency of linkages to HIV care continuum services. ",

PARTICIPANTS: 4090 survey respondents (response rate 54%) with \u2265\u200912\u00a0months HMP enrollment and 67 interviewees with \u2265\u20096\u00a0months enrollment. MAIN MEASURES: Self-reported chronic condition diagnoses, changes in physical/mental health, and healthcare access. Descriptive survey data were adjusted for survey design and nonresponse. Semi-structured interview questions about how gaining HMP coverage led to changes in health status. KEY RESULTS: Among enrollees, 68% had a self-reported diagnosis of a chronic health condition; 42% of those were newly diagnosed since HMP enrollment. In multivariable models, enrollees with chronic conditions were significantly more likely to report improved physical (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 1.70, 95% CI (1.40, 2.07)) and mental health (aOR 1.75, (1.43, 2.15)) since HMP enrollment than enrollees without chronic conditions. Among enrollees with chronic conditions, the strongest predictors of improvements in health were having seen a primary care physician, improved mental health care access, and improved medication access. Interviewees with chronic conditions described how increased access to health care led to improvements in both physical and mental health. CONCLUSIONS: Enrollees with expanded Medicaid coverage commonly reported detection of previously undiagnosed chronic conditions. Perceived health status and access improved more often among enrollees with chronic health conditions. Improved access was associated with improved physical and mental health among this vulnerable group. ",
        "Functional brain alterations following mild-to-moderate sensorineural hearing loss in children. Auditory deprivation in the form of deafness during development leads to lasting changes in central auditory system function. However, less is known about the effects of mild-to-moderate sensorineural hearing loss (MMHL) during development. Here, we used a longitudinal design to examine late auditory evoked responses and mismatch responses to nonspeech and speech sounds for children with MMHL. At Time 1, younger children with MMHL (8-12 years; n = 23) showed age-appropriate mismatch negativities (MMNs) to sounds, but older children (12-16 years; n = 23) did not. Six years later, we re-tested a subset of the younger (now older) children with MMHL (n = 13). Children who had shown significant MMNs at Time 1 showed MMNs that were reduced and, for nonspeech, absent at Time 2. Our findings demonstrate that even a mild-to-moderate hearing loss during early-to-mid childhood can lead to changes in the neural processing of sounds in late childhood/adolescence. ",
        "Effect of Collaborative Dementia Care via Telephone and Internet on Quality of Life, Caregiver Well-being, and Health Care Use: The Care Ecosystem Randomized Clinical Trial. Importance: Few health systems have adopted effective dementia care management programs. The Care Ecosystem is a model for delivering care from centralized hubs across broad geographic areas to caregivers and persons with dementia (PWDs) independently of their health system affiliations. Objective: To determine whether the Care Ecosystem is effective in improving outcomes important to PWDs, their caregivers, and payers beyond those achieved with usual care. Design, Setting, and Participants: A single-blind, randomized clinical trial with a pragmatic design was conducted among PWDs and their caregivers. Each PWD-caregiver dyad was enrolled for 12 months between March 20, 2015, and February 28, 2017. Data were collected until March 5, 2018. Study interventions and assessments were administered over the telephone and internet by clinical and research teams in San Francisco, California, and Omaha, Nebraska. Of 2585 referred or volunteer PWD-caregiver dyads in California, Iowa, or Nebraska, 780 met eligibility criteria and were enrolled. A total of 512 PWD-caregiver dyads were randomized to receive care through the Care Ecosystem and 268 dyads to receive usual care. All eligible PWDs had a dementia diagnosis; were enrolled or eligible for enrollment in Medicare or Medicaid; and spoke English, Spanish, or Cantonese. Analyses were intention-to-treat. Intervention: Telephone-based collaborative dementia care was delivered by a trained care team navigator, who provided education, support and care coordination with a team of dementia specialists (advanced practice nurse, social worker, and pharmacist). Main Outcomes and Measures: Primary outcome measure: Quality of Life in Alzheimer's Disease based on caregiver's rating of 13 aspects of PWD's well-being (including physical health, energy level, mood, living situation, memory, relationships, and finances) on a 4-point scale (poor to excellent). Secondary outcomes: frequencies of PWDs' use of emergency department, hospitalization, and ambulance services; caregiver depression (score on 9-Item Patient Health Questionnaire; higher scores indicate more severe depression); and caregiver burden (score on 12-Item Zarit Burden Interview; higher scores indicate more severe caregiver burden). Results: The 780 PWDs (56.3% female; mean [SD] age, 78.1 [9.9] years) and 780 caregivers (70.9% female; mean [SD] age, 64.7 [12.0] years) lived in California (n\u2009=\u2009452), Nebraska (n\u2009=\u2009284), or Iowa (n\u2009=\u200944). Of 780 dyads, 655 were still active at 12 months, and 571 completed the 12-month survey. Compared with usual care, the Care Ecosystem improved PWD quality of life (B, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.25-1.30; P\u2009=\u2009.04), reduced emergency department visits (B, -0.14; 95% CI, -0.29 to -0.01; P\u2009=\u2009.04), and decreased caregiver depression (B, -1.14; 95% CI, -2.15 to -0.13; P\u2009=\u2009.03) and caregiver burden (B, -1.90; 95% CI, -3.89 to -0.08; P\u2009=\u2009.046). Conclusions and Relevance: Effective care management for dementia can be delivered from centralized hubs to supplement usual care and mitigate the growing societal and economic burdens of dementia.

        "High-definition spatial transcriptomics for in situ tissue profiling. Spatial and molecular characteristics determine tissue function, yet high-resolution methods to capture both concurrently are lacking. Here, we developed high-definition spatial transcriptomics, which captures RNA from histological tissue sections on a dense, spatially barcoded bead array. Each experiment recovers several hundred thousand transcript-coupled spatial barcodes at 2-\u03bcm resolution, as demonstrated in mouse brain and primary breast cancer. This opens the way to high-resolution spatial analysis of cells and tissues. ",
        "Maternal and perinatal outcomes by planned place of birth in Australia 2000 - 2012: a linked population data study. OBJECTIVE: To compare perinatal and maternal outcomes for Australian women with uncomplicated pregnancies according to planned place of birth, that is, in hospital labour wards, birth centres or at home. DESIGN: A population-based retrospective design, linking and analysing routinely collected electronic data. Analysis comprised \u03c72 tests and binary logistic regression for categorical data, yielding adjusted ORs. Continuous data were analysed using analysis of variance. SETTING: All eight Australian states and territories. PARTICIPANTS: Women with uncomplicated pregnancies who gave birth between 2000 and 2012 to a singleton baby in cephalic presentation at between 37 and 41 completed weeks' gestation. Of the 1 251 420 births, 1 171 703 (93.6%) were planned in hospital labour wards, 71 505 (5.7%) in birth centres and 8212 (0.7%) at home. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Mode of birth, normal labour and birth, interventions and procedures during labour and birth, maternal complications, admission to special care/high dependency or intensive care units (mother or infant) and perinatal mortality (intrapartum stillbirth and neonatal death). RESULTS: Compared with planned hospital births, the odds of normal labour and birth were over twice as high in planned birth centre births (adjusted OR (AOR) 2.72; 99%\u2009CI 2.63 to 2.81) and nearly six times as high in planned home births (AOR 5.91; 99%\u2009CI 5.15 to 6.78). There were no statistically significant differences in the proportion of intrapartum stillbirths, early or late neonatal deaths between the three planned places of birth. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first Australia-wide study to examine outcomes by planned place of birth. For healthy women in Australia having an uncomplicated pregnancy, planned births in birth centres or at home are associated with positive maternal outcomes although the number of homebirths was small overall. There were no significant differences in the perinatal mortality rate, although the absolute numbers of deaths were very small and therefore firm conclusions cannot be drawn about perinatal mortality outcomes.

        "Marine Omega-3 Supplementation and Cardiovascular Disease: An Updated Meta-Analysis of 13 Randomized Controlled Trials Involving 127 477 Participants. Background Whether marine omega-3 supplementation is associated with reduction in risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains controversial. Methods and Results This meta-analysis included study-level data from 13 trials. The outcomes of interest included myocardial infarction, coronary heart disease (CHD) death, total CHD, total stroke, CVD death, total CVD, and major vascular events. The unadjusted rate ratios were calculated using a fixed-effect meta-analysis. A meta-regression was conducted to estimate the dose-response relationship between marine omega-3 dosage and risk of each prespecified outcome. During a mean treatment duration of 5.0\u00a0years, 3838 myocardial infarctions, 3008 CHD deaths, 8435 total CHD events, 2683 strokes, 5017 CVD deaths, 15\u00a0759 total CVD events, and 16\u00a0478 major vascular events were documented. In the analysis excluding REDUCE-IT (Reduction of Cardiovascular Events with Icosapent Ethyl-Intervention Trial), marine omega-3 supplementation was associated with significantly lower risk of myocardial infarction (rate ratio [RR] [95% CI]: 0.92 [0.86, 0.99]; P=0.020), CHD death (RR [95% CI]: 0.92 [0.86, 0.98]; P=0.014), total CHD (RR [95% CI]: 0.95 [0.91, 0.99]; P=0.008), CVD death (RR [95% CI]: 0.93 [0.88, 0.99]; P=0.013), and total CVD (RR [95% CI]: 0.97 [0.94, 0.99]; P=0.015). Inverse associations for all outcomes were strengthened after including REDUCE-IT while introducing statistically significant heterogeneity. Statistically significant linear dose-response relationships were found for total CVD and major vascular events in the analyses with and without including REDUCE-IT. Conclusions Marine omega-3 supplementation lowers risk for myocardial infarction, CHD death, total CHD, CVD death, and total CVD, even after exclusion of REDUCE-IT. Risk reductions appeared to be linearly related to marine omega-3 dose. ",
        "m6A mRNA Methylation Regulates Human \u03b2-Cell Biology in Physiological States and in Type 2 Diabetes. The regulation of islet cell biology is critical for glucose homeostasis1.N6 -methyladenosine (m6A) is the most abundant internal messenger RNA (mRNA) modification in mammals2. Here we report that the m6A landscape segregates human type 2 diabetes (T2D) islets from controls significantly better than the transcriptome and that m6A is vital for \u03b2-cell biology. m6A-sequencing in human T2D islets reveals several hypomethylated transcripts involved in cell-cycle progression, insulin secretion, and the Insulin/IGF1-AKT-PDX1 pathway. Depletion of m6A levels in EndoC-\u03b2H1 induces cell-cycle arrest and impairs insulin secretion by decreasing AKT phosphorylation and PDX1 protein levels. \u03b2-cell specific Mettl14 knock-out mice, which display reduced m6A levels, mimic the islet phenotype in human T2D with early diabetes onset and mortality due to decreased \u03b2-cell proliferation and insulin degranulation. Our data underscore the significance of RNA methylation in regulating human \u03b2-cell biology, and provide a rationale for potential therapeutic targeting of m6A modulators to preserve \u03b2-cell survival and function in diabetes.

        "Vibrio cholerae residing in food vacuoles expelled by protozoa are more infectious in vivo. Vibrio cholerae interacts with many organisms in the environment, including heterotrophic protists (protozoa). Several species of protozoa have been reported to release undigested bacteria in expelled food vacuoles (EFVs) when feeding on some pathogens. While the production of EFVs has been reported, their biological role as a vector for the transmission of pathogens remains unknown. Here we report that ciliated protozoa release EFVs containing V. cholerae. The EFVs are stable, the cells inside them are protected from multiple stresses, and large numbers of cells escape when incubated at 37\u2009\u00b0C or in the presence of nutrients. We show that OmpU, a major outer membrane protein positively regulated by ToxR, has a role in the production of EFVs. Notably, cells released from EFVs have growth and colonization advantages over planktonic cells both in vitro and in vivo. Our results suggest that EFVs facilitate V. cholerae survival in the environment, enhancing their infectious potential and may contribute to the dissemination of epidemic V. cholerae strains. These results improve our understanding of the mechanisms of persistence and the modes of transmission of V. cholerae and may further apply to other opportunistic pathogens that have been shown to be released by protists in EFVs.

        "Rates of Help-Seeking in US Adults With Lifetime DSM-5 Eating Disorders: Prevalence Across Diagnoses and Differences by Sex and Ethnicity/Race. OBJECTIVE: To investigate, in a nationally representative sample of US adults, the prevalence of help-seeking in individuals with Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) eating disorders (EDs) and to examine sex and ethnic/racial differences. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The 2012-2013 National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions-III (N=36,309) included respondents who met the criteria for specific lifetime DSM-5 EDs and answered questions regarding help-seeking for their ED symptoms (anorexia nervosa [AN]: n=275; bulimia nervosa [BN]: n=91; and binge-eating disorder [BED]: n=256). RESULTS: The prevalence (standard error) estimates of ever seeking any help for AN, BN, and BED were 34.5% (2.80%), 62.6% (5.36%), and 49.0% (3.74%), respectively. Adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics, men and ethnic/racial minorities (non-Hispanic blacks and Hispanics) were statistically significantly less likely to ever seek help for BED than were women or non-Hispanic whites, respectively. Hispanics also were significantly less likely to seek help for AN relative to non-Hispanic whites. CONCLUSION: This was the first study in a nationally representative sample of US adults to examine rates of help-seeking, including by sex and ethnic/racial differences, across DSM-5-defined EDs. These findings emphasize the need to develop strategies to encourage help-seeking among individuals with EDs, particularly among men and ethnic/racial minorities. ",
        "Genome-wide association study reveals dynamic role of genetic variation in infant and early childhood growth. Infant and childhood growth are dynamic processes with large changes in BMI during development. By performing genome-wide association studies of BMI at 12 time points from birth to eight years (9286 children, 74,105 measurements) in the Norwegian Mother, Father, and Child Cohort Study, replicated in 5235 children, we identify a transient effect in the leptin receptor (LEPR) locus: no effect at birth, increasing effect in infancy, peaking at 6-12 months (rs2767486, P6m\u2009=\u20092.0\u2009\u00d7\u200910-21, \u03b26m\u2009=\u20090.16 sd-BMI), and little effect after age five. We identify a similar transient effect near the leptin gene (LEP), peaking at 1.5 years (rs10487505, P1.5y\u2009=\u20091.3\u2009\u00d7\u200910-8, \u03b21.5y\u2009=\u20090.079 sd-BMI). Both signals are protein quantitative trait loci for soluble-LEPR and LEP in plasma in adults independent from adult traits mapped to the respective genes, suggesting key roles of common variation in the leptin signaling pathway for healthy infant growth.

        "Step-Up Therapy in Black Children and Adults with Poorly Controlled Asthma. BACKGROUND: Morbidity from asthma is disproportionately higher among black patients than among white patients, and black patients constitute the minority of participants in trials informing treatment. Data indicate that patients with inadequately controlled asthma benefit more from addition of a long-acting beta-agonist (LABA) than from increased glucocorticoids; however, these data may not be informative for treatment in black patients. METHODS: We conducted two prospective, randomized, double-blind trials: one involving children and the other involving adolescents and adults. In both trials, the patients had at least one grandparent who identified as black and had asthma that was inadequately controlled with low-dose inhaled glucocorticoids. We compared combinations of therapy, which included the addition of a LABA (salmeterol) to an inhaled glucocorticoid (fluticasone propionate), a step-up to double to quintuple the dose of fluticasone, or both. The treatments were compared with the use of a composite measure that evaluated asthma exacerbations, asthma-control days, and lung function; data were stratified according to genotypic African ancestry. RESULTS: When quintupling the dose of fluticasone (to 250 \u03bcg twice a day) was compared with adding salmeterol (50 \u03bcg twice a day) and doubling the fluticasone (to 100 \u03bcg twice a day), a superior response occurred in 46% of the children with quintupling the fluticasone and in 46% of the children with doubling the fluticasone and adding salmeterol (P\u2009=\u20090.99). In contrast, more adolescents and adults had a superior response to added salmeterol than to an increase in fluticasone (salmeterol-low-dose fluticasone vs. medium-dose fluticasone, 49% vs. 28% [P\u2009=\u20090.003]; salmeterol-medium-dose fluticasone vs. high-dose fluticasone, 49% vs. 31% [P\u2009=\u20090.02]). Neither the degree of African ancestry nor baseline biomarkers predicted a superior response to specific treatments. The increased dose of inhaled glucocorticoids was associated with a decrease in the ratio of urinary cortisol to creatinine in children younger than 8 years of age. CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to black adolescents and adults, almost half the black children with poorly controlled asthma had a superior response to an increase in the dose of an inhaled glucocorticoid and almost half had a superior response to the addition of a LABA.

        "A large-scale study reveals 24-h operational rhythms in hospital treatment. Hospitals operate 24 h a day, and it is assumed that important clinical decisions occur continuously around the clock. However, many aspects of hospital operation occur at specific times of day, including medical team rounding and shift changes. It is unclear whether this impacts patient care, as no studies have addressed this. We analyzed the daily distribution of \u223c500,000 doses of 12 separate drugs in 1,546 inpatients at a major children's hospital in the United States from 2010 to 2017. We tracked both order time (when a care provider places an electronic request for a drug) and dosing time (when the patient receives the drug). Order times were time-of-day-dependent, marked by distinct morning-time surges and overnight lulls. Nearly one-third of all 103,847 orders for treatment were placed between 8:00 AM and 12:00 PM. First doses from each order were also rhythmic but shifted by 2 h. These 24-h rhythms in orders and first doses were remarkably consistent across drugs, diagnosis, and hospital units. This rhythm in hospital medicine coincided with medical team rounding time, not necessarily immediate medical need. Lastly, we show that the clinical response to hydralazine, an acute antihypertensive, is dosing time-dependent and greatest at night, when the fewest doses were administered. The prevailing dogma is that hospital treatment is administered as needed regardless of time of day. Our findings challenge this notion and reveal a potential operational barrier to best clinical care. ",
        "Cerebral perfusion of the left reading network predicts recovery of reading in subacute to chronic stroke. Better understanding of cerebral blood flow (CBF) perfusion in stroke recovery can help inform decisions about optimal timing and targets of restorative treatments. In this study, we examined the relationship between cerebral perfusion and recovery from stroke-induced reading deficits. Left stroke patients were tested with a noninvasive CBF measure (arterial spin labeling) <5\u2009weeks post-stroke, and a subset had follow up testing >3\u2009months post-stroke. We measured blood flow perfusion within the left and right sides of the brain, in areas surrounding the lesion, and areas belonging to the reading network. Two hypotheses were tested. The first was that recovery of reading function depends on increased perfusion around the stroke lesion. This hypothesis was not supported by our findings. The second hypothesis was that increased perfusion of intact areas within the reading circuit is tightly coupled with recovery. Our findings are consistent with this hypothesis. Specifically, higher perfusion in the left reading network measured during the subacute stroke period predicted better reading ability and phonology competence in the chronic period. In contrast, higher perfusion of the right homologous regions was associated with decreased reading accuracy and phonology competence in the subacute and chronic periods. These findings suggest that recovery of reading and language competence may rely on improved blood flow in the reading network of the language-dominant hemisphere. ",
        "Left Ventricular Filling Pressures Contribute to Exercise Limitation in Patients with Continuous Flow Left Ventricular Assist Devices. We sought to determine hemodynamic mechanisms of exercise intolerance in a group of patients with the HeartWare ventricular assist device (VAD) compared to a group of heart failure patients. Twenty VAD and 22 heart failure patients underwent symptom-limited active straight leg raising exercise during right heart catheterization with thermodilution (TD), and upright cycling cardiopulmonary stress testing with cardiac output measurement by inert gas rebreathing (IGR) method. The TD and IGR exercise cardiac indexes were higher in VAD compared with heart failure group (both P < 0.05), although there was only a borderline increase in peak exercise oxygen consumption (VO2) (P = 0.06). Baseline and exercise right heart catheterization pressures were not significantly different between the two groups. The only significant independent predictors of peak VO2 in the heart failure group were exercise heart rate and cardiac index (both P < 0.05). In contrast, for the VAD group only, resting pulmonary arterial wedge and pulmonary arterial mean pressures were independently related to peak VO2 (both P < 0.05). Thus, in heart failure, exercise cardiac index is an important limitation to exercise capacity, and VADs increase exercise cardiac index. However, in VAD patients, this only produces limited benefits as increased pulmonary and pulmonary wedge pressures limit increases in exercise capacity. ",
        "Amyloid-beta impairs TOM1-mediated IL-1R1 signaling. Defects in interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2)-mediated cellular responses contribute to Alzheimer's disease (AD). To decipher the mechanism associated with its pathogenesis, we investigated the molecular events associated with the termination of IL-1\u03b2 inflammatory responses by focusing on the role played by the target of Myb1 (TOM1), a negative regulator of the interleukin-1\u03b2 receptor-1 (IL-1R1). We first show that TOM1 steady-state levels are reduced in human AD hippocampi and in the brain of an AD mouse model versus respective controls. Experimentally reducing TOM1 affected microglia activity, substantially increased amyloid-beta levels, and impaired cognition, whereas enhancing its levels was therapeutic. These data show that reparation of the TOM1-signaling pathway represents a therapeutic target for brain inflammatory disorders such as AD. A better understanding of the age-related changes in the immune system will allow us to craft therapies to limit detrimental aspects of inflammation, with the broader purpose of sharply reducing the number of people afflicted by AD.

        "Association of Race/Ethnicity With Hospital Discharge Disposition After Elective Total Knee Arthroplasty. Importance: Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is one of the most common elective procedures performed in adults with end-stage arthritis. Racial disparities in TKA outcomes have been described in the literature. Objectives: To assess the association of race/ethnicity with discharge disposition and hospital readmission after elective primary TKA and to assess the association of nonhome discharge disposition with hospital readmission risk. Design, Setting, and Participants: This retrospective cohort study used data from the Pennsylvania Health Care Cost Containment Council Database, a large regional database that included demographic data from all discharges of patients who underwent elective primary TKA in 170 nongovernmental acute care hospitals in Pennsylvania from April 1, 2012, to September 30, 2015. Data analyses were conducted from September 29, 2017, to November 29, 2017. Exposures: Patient race/ethnicity and discharge disposition. Main Outcomes and Measures: Discharge disposition and 90-day hospital readmission. Results: Among 107\u202f768 patients, 7287 (6.8%) were African American, 68\u202f372 (63.4%) were women, 46\u202f420 (43.1%) were younger than 65 years, and 60\u202f636 (56.3%) were insured by Medicare. In multivariable logistic regression, among patients younger than 65 years, African American patients were more likely than white patients to be discharged to inpatient rehabilitation facility (IRF) (adjusted relative risk ratio [aRRR], 2.49 [95% CI, 1.42-4.36]; P\u2009=\u2009.001) or a skilled nursing facility (SNF) (aRRR, 3.91 [95% CI, 2.17-7.06]; P\u2009<\u2009.001) and had higher odds of 90-day hospital readmission (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.30 [95% CI, 1.02-1.67]; P\u2009=\u2009.04). Compared with white patients 65 years or older, African American patients 65 years or older were more likely to be discharged to SNF (aRRR, 3.30 [95% CI, 1.81-6.02]; P\u2009<\u2009.001). In both age groups, discharge to an IRF (age <65 years: aOR, 3.62 [95% CI, 2.33-5.64]; P\u2009<\u2009.001; age \u226565 years: aOR, 2.85 [95% CI, 2.25-3.61]; P\u2009<\u2009.001) or SNF (age <65 years: aOR, 1.91 [95% CI, 1.37-2.65]; P\u2009<\u2009.001; age \u226565 years: aOR, 1.55 [95% CI, 1.27-1.89]; P\u2009<\u2009.001) was associated with higher odds of 90-day readmission. Conclusions and Relevance: This cohort study found that race/ethnicity was associated with higher odds of discharge to an IRF or SNF for postoperative care after primary TKA. Among patients younger than 65 years, African American patients were more likely than white patients to be readmitted to the hospital within 90 days. Discharge to an IRF or SNF for postoperative care and rehabilitation was also associated with a higher risk of readmission to an acute care hospital. ",
        "Engineering the stereoisomeric structure of seed oil to mimic human milk fat. Human milk fat substitute (HMFS) is a class of structured lipid that is widely used as an ingredient in infant formulas. Like human milk fat, HMFS is characterized by enrichment of palmitoyl (C16:0) groups specifically at the middle (sn-2 or \u03b2) position on the glycerol backbone, and there is evidence that triacylglycerol (TAG) with this unusual stereoisomeric structure provides nutritional benefits. HMFS is currently made by in vitro enzyme-based catalysis because there is no appropriate biological alternative to human milk fat. Most of the fat currently used in infant formulas is obtained from plants, which exclude C16:0 from the middle position. In this study, we have modified the metabolic pathway for TAG biosynthesis in the model oilseed Arabidopsis thaliana to increase the percentage of C16:0 at the middle (vs. outer) positions by more than 20-fold (i.e., from \u223c3% in wild type to >70% in our final iteration). This level of C16:0 enrichment is comparable to human milk fat. We achieved this by relocating the C16:0-specific chloroplast isoform of the enzyme lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferase (LPAT) to the endoplasmic reticulum so that it functions within the cytosolic glycerolipid biosynthetic pathway to esterify C16:0 to the middle position. We then suppressed endogenous LPAT activity to relieve competition and knocked out phosphatidylcholine:diacylglycerol cholinephosphotransferase activity to promote the flux of newly made diacylglycerol directly into TAG. Applying this technology to oilseed crops might provide a source of HMFS for infant formula. ",
        "Asthma status moderates the relationship between neighbourhood disadvantage and obesity in African American adolescent females. Introduction: Significant health disparities exist in asthma and obesity for African American youths. Successful interventions present an opportunity to address these disparities but require detailed study in order to ensure generalizability. This study investigated the intersection of obesity, neighbourhood disadvantage, and asthma. Methods: Data were extracted from 129 African American females ages 13 to 19 years (mean = 15.6 years [SD = 1.9]). Obesity was measured via body mass index (BMI). Asthma status was based on clinical diagnosis and/or results of the International Study of Asthma and Allergies during Childhood (ISAAC) questionnaire. The concentrated disadvantage index (CDI) assessed neighbourhood disadvantage. Results: Findings showed that 21.5% (n = 28) of participants were clinically defined as having asthma, 76.2% (n = 99) had obesity, and 24.9% (n = 31) were classified without obesity. The mean BMI was 35.1 (SD = 9.1) and the mean CDI was 1.0 (SD = 0.9). CDI and obesity were significantly associated in participants without asthma, but not in those with asthma. Multivariable linear regression results showed a significant interaction between CDI and asthma (t value = 2.2, P = .03). Conclusion: In sum, results from this study found that asthma moderated the relationship between neighbourhood disadvantage and obesity. ",
        "A distinct subset of Fc\u03b3RI-expressing Th1 cells exert antibody-mediated cytotoxic activity. While a high frequency of Th1 cells in tumors is associated with improved cancer prognosis, this benefit has been attributed mainly to support of cytotoxic activity of CD8+ T cells. By attempting to potentiate antibody-driven immunity, we found a remarkable synergy between CD4+ T cells and tumor-binding antibodies. This surprising synergy was mediated by a small subset of tumor-infiltrating CD4+ T cells that express the high-affinity Fc\u03b3 receptor for IgG (Fc\u03b3RI) in both mouse and human patients. These cells efficiently lyse tumor cells coated with antibodies through concomitant crosslinking of their T cell receptor (TCR) and Fc\u03b3RI. By expressing Fc\u03b3RI and its signaling chain in conventional CD4+ T cells, we successfully employed this mechanism to treat established solid cancers. Overall, this discovery sheds new light on the biology of this T cell subset, their function during tumor immunity, and the means to utilize their unique killing signals in immunotherapy. ",
        "The fungal mycobiome promotes pancreatic oncogenesis via activation of MBL. Bacterial dysbiosis accompanies carcinogenesis in malignancies such as colon and liver cancer, and has recently been implicated in the pathogenesis of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA)1. However, the mycobiome has not been clearly implicated in tumorigenesis. Here we show that fungi migrate from the gut lumen to the pancreas, and that this is implicated in the pathogenesis of PDA. PDA tumours in humans\u00a0and mouse models of this cancer\u00a0displayed an increase in fungi of about 3,000-fold compared to normal pancreatic tissue. The composition of the mycobiome of PDA tumours was distinct from that of the gut or normal pancreas on the basis of alpha- and beta-diversity indices. Specifically, the fungal community that infiltrated PDA tumours was markedly enriched for Malassezia spp. in both mice and humans. Ablation of the mycobiome was protective against tumour growth in slowly progressive and invasive models of PDA, and repopulation with a Malassezia species-but not species in the genera Candida, Saccharomyces or Aspergillus-accelerated oncogenesis. We also discovered that ligation of mannose-binding lectin (MBL), which binds to glycans of the fungal wall to activate the complement cascade, was required for oncogenic progression, whereas deletion of MBL or C3 in the extratumoral compartment-or knockdown of C3aR in tumour cells-were both protective against tumour growth. In addition, reprogramming of the mycobiome did not alter the progression of PDA in Mbl- (also known as Mbl2) or C3-deficient mice. Collectively, our work shows that pathogenic fungi promote PDA by driving the complement cascade through the activation of MBL. ",
        "Interplay of Objective Sleep Duration and Cardiovascular and Cerebrovascular Diseases on Cause-Specific Mortality. Background Cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases (CBVDs) and cancer are leading causes of death. Short sleep is a potential contributor to health; however, its role in predicting mortality associated with cardiometabolic risk factors (CMRs) and CBVD remains poorly understood. We tested whether objective short sleep duration increases the risk of mortality associated with CMRs and CBVD. Methods and Results A total of 1654 adults (aged 20-74\u00a0years) from the Penn State Adult Cohort (47.5 years, 52.5% women, and 89.8% white) whose cause of death was determined after 19.2 years (5.2 years). CMR was defined as stage 2 hypertension and/or type 2 diabetes mellitus on the basis of blood pressure and glucose levels or a report of diagnosis or treatment for these conditions. CBVD was defined as a report of diagnosis or treatment for heart disease and/or stroke. Objective short sleep duration was defined as polysomnographic total sleep time <6 hours. Cox proportional hazard models estimated multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs. Risk of all-cause mortality associated with CMR or CBVD was significantly modified by objective sleep duration (P<0.05), and it was significantly higher in subjects who slept <6 hours (HR, 2.14 [95% CI, 1.52-3.02] and HR, 3.17 [95% CI=2.16-4.65], respectively). In subjects who slept <6 hours, CMR was associated with a 1.83 higher (95% CI, 1.07-3.13) risk of CBVD mortality and CBVD with a 2.92 higher (95% CI, 1.28-6.65) risk of cancer mortality. In subjects who slept \u22656 hours, CMR was not significantly associated with CBVD mortality (HR, 1.35; 95% CI, 0.70-2.63) nor was CBVD significantly associated with cancer mortality (HR, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.18-1.64). Conclusions Objective short sleep duration predicts the all-cause mortality prognosis of middle-aged adults with CMR and the cancer-specific mortality prognosis of those with CBVD. ",
        "Effects of Low FODMAP Diet on Symptoms, Fecal Microbiome, and Markers of Inflammation in Patients With Quiescent Inflammatory Bowel Disease in a Randomized Trial. BACKGROUND & AIMS: There is limited evidence that a diet low in fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols (FODMAPs) reduces gut symptoms in quiescent inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). We performed a randomized, controlled trial to investigate the effects of a low FODMAP diet on persistent gut symptoms, the intestinal microbiome, and circulating markers of inflammation in patients with quiescent IBD. METHODS: We performed a single-blind trial of 52 patients with quiescent Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis and persistent gut symptoms at 2 large gastroenterology clinics in the United Kingdom. Patients were randomly assigned to groups that followed a diet low in FODMAPs (n\u00a0= 27) or a control diet (n\u00a0= 25), with dietary advice, for 4 weeks. Gut symptoms and health-related quality of life were measured using validated questionnaires. Stool and blood samples were collected at baseline and end of trial. We assessed fecal microbiome composition and function using shotgun metagenomic sequencing and phenotypes of T cells in blood using flow cytometry. RESULTS: A higher proportion of patients reported adequate relief of gut symptoms following the low FODMAP diet (14/27, 52%) than the control diet (4/25, 16%, P=.007). Patients had a greater reduction in irritable bowel syndrome severity scores following the low FODMAP diet (mean reduction of 67; standard error, 78) than the control diet (mean reduction of 34; standard error, 50), although this difference was not statistically significant (P\u00a0= .075). Following the low FODMAP diet, patients had higher health-related quality of life scores (81.9 \u00b1 1.2) than patients on the control diet (78.3 \u00b1 1.2, P\u00a0= .042). A targeted analysis revealed that in stool samples collected at the end of the study period, patients on the low FODMAP diet had significantly lower abundance of Bifidobacterium adolescentis, Bifidobacterium longum, and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii than patients on control diet. However, microbiome diversity and markers of inflammation did not differ significantly between groups. CONCLUSIONS: In a trial of the low FODMAP diet vs a control diet in patients with quiescent IBD, we found no significant difference after 4 weeks in change in irritable bowel syndrome severity scores, but significant improvements in specific symptom scores and numbers reporting adequate symptom relief. The low FODMAP diet reduced fecal abundance of microbes believed to regulate the immune response, compared with the control diet, but had no significant effect on markers of inflammation. We conclude that a 4-week diet low in FODMAPs is safe and effective for managing persistent gut symptoms in patients with quiescent IBD. www.isrctn.com no.: ISRCTN17061468. ",
        "RNA Transcription and Splicing Errors as a Source of Cancer Frameshift Neoantigens for Vaccines. The success of checkpoint inhibitors in cancer therapy is largely attributed to activating the patient's immune response to their tumor's neoantigens arising from DNA mutations. This realization has motivated the interest in personal cancer vaccines based on sequencing the patient's tumor DNA to discover neoantigens. Here we propose an additional, unrecognized source of tumor neoantigens. We show that errors in transcription of microsatellites (MS) and mis-splicing of exons create highly immunogenic frameshift (FS) neoantigens in tumors. The sequence of these FS neoantigens are predictable, allowing creation of a peptide array representing all possible neoantigen FS peptides. This array can be used to detect the antibody response in a patient to the FS peptides. A survey of 5 types of cancers reveals peptides that are personally reactive for each patient. This source of neoantigens and the method to discover them may be useful in developing cancer vaccines. ",
        "The Ancestral Environment Shapes Antiviral CD8+ T\u00a0cell Responses across Generations. Recent studies have linked health fates of children to environmental exposures of their great grandparents. However, few studies have considered whether ancestral exposures influence immune function across generations. Here, we report transgenerational inheritance of altered T\u00a0cell responses resulting from maternal (F0) exposure to the aryl hydrocarbon receptor ligand 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD). Since F0 exposure to TCDD has been linked to transgenerational transmission of reproductive problems, we asked whether maternal TCDD exposure also caused transgenerational changes in immune function. F0 exposure caused transgenerational effects on the CD8+ T\u00a0cell response to influenza virus infection in females but not in males. Outcrosses showed changes were passed through both parental lineages. These data demonstrate that F0 exposure to an aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) agonist causes durable changes to immune responses that can affect subsequent generations. This has broad implications for understanding how the environment of prior generations shapes susceptibility to pathogens and antiviral immunity in later generations. ",
        "Unexpected roles for ADH1 and SORD in catalyzing the final step of erythritol biosynthesis. The low-calorie sweetener erythritol is endogenously produced from glucose through the pentose phosphate pathway in humans. Erythritol is of medical interest because elevated plasma levels of this polyol are predictive for visceral adiposity gain and development of type 2 diabetes. However, the mechanisms behind these associations remain unknown because the erythritol biosynthesis pathway, particularly the enzyme catalyzing the final step of erythritol synthesis (reduction of erythrose to erythritol), is not characterized. In this study, we purified two enzymes from rabbit liver capable of catalyzing the conversion of erythrose to erythritol: alcohol dehydrogenase 1 (ADH1) and sorbitol dehydrogenase (SORD). Both recombinant human ADH1 and SORD reduce erythrose to erythritol, using NADPH as a co-factor, and cell culture studies indicate that this activity is primarily NADPH-dependent. We found that ADH1 variants vary markedly in both their affinity for erythrose and their catalytic capacity (turnover number). Interestingly, the recombinant protein produced from the ADH1B2 variant, common in Asian populations, is not active when NADPH is used as a co-factor in vitro We also confirmed SORD contributes to intracellular erythritol production in human A549 lung cancer cells, where ADH1 is minimally expressed. In summary, human ADH1 and SORD catalyze the conversion of erythrose to erythritol, pointing to novel roles for two dehydrogenase proteins in human glucose metabolism that may contribute to individual responses to diet.

        "Associations of physical activity, sedentary time, and cardiorespiratory fitness with heart rate variability in 6- to 9-year-old children: the PANIC study. PURPOSE: To study the associations of physical activity (PA), sedentary time (ST), and cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) with heart rate variability (HRV) in children. METHODS: The participants were a population sample of 377 children aged 6-9\u00a0years (49% boys). ST, light PA (LPA), moderate PA (MPA), vigorous PA (VPA), and moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA), and PA energy expenditure (PAEE) were assessed using a combined heart rate and movement sensor, maximal power output per kilograms of lean body mass as a measure of CRF by maximal cycle ergometer exercise test, and HRV variables (SDNN, RMSSD, LF, and HF) using 5\u00a0min resting electrocardiography. Data were analysed by linear regression adjusted for years from peak height velocity. RESULTS: In boys, ST was inversely associated (\u03b2\u2009=\u2009- 0.185 to - 0.146, p\u2009\u2264\u20090.049) and MVPA, VPA, PAEE, and CRF were directly associated (\u03b2\u2009=\u20090.147 to 0.320, p\u2009\u2264\u20090.048) with HRV variables. CRF was directly associated with all HRV variables and PAEE was directly associated with RMSSD after mutual adjustment for ST, PAEE, and CRF (\u03b2\u2009=\u20090.169 to 0.270, p\u2009\u2264\u20090.046). In girls, ST was inversely associated (\u03b2\u2009=\u2009- 0.382 to - 0.294, p\u2009<\u20090.001) and LPA, MPA, VPA, MVPA, and PAEE were directly associated with HRV variables (\u03b2\u2009=\u20090.144 to 0.348, p\u2009\u2264\u20090.049). After mutual adjustment for ST, PAEE, and CRF, only the inverse associations of ST with HRV variables remained statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: Higher ST and lower PA and CRF were associated with poorer cardiac autonomic nervous system function in children. Lower CRF in boys and higher ST in girls were the strongest correlates of poorer cardiac autonomic function. ",
        "Convergent evolution of face spaces across human face-selective neuronal\u00a0groups and deep\u00a0convolutional networks. The discovery that deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) achieve human performance in realistic tasks offers fresh opportunities for linking neuronal tuning properties to such tasks. Here we show that the face-space geometry, revealed through pair-wise activation similarities of face-selective neuronal\u00a0groups recorded intracranially in 33 patients, significantly matches that of a DCNN having human-level face recognition capabilities. This convergent evolution of pattern similarities across biological and artificial networks highlights the significance of face-space geometry in face perception. Furthermore, the nature of the neuronal to DCNN match suggests a role of human face areas in pictorial aspects of face perception. First, the match was confined to intermediate DCNN layers. Second, presenting identity-preserving image manipulations to the DCNN abolished its correlation to neuronal responses. Finally, DCNN units matching human neuronal\u00a0group tuning displayed view-point selective receptive fields. Our results demonstrate the importance of face-space geometry in the pictorial aspects of human face perception. ",
        "The effect of hypoglycaemia during hospital admission on health-related outcomes for people with diabetes: a systematic review and meta-analysis. AIM: To assess the health-related outcomes of hypoglycaemia for people with diabetes admitted to hospital; specifically, hospital length of stay and mortality. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies relating to hypoglycaemia (<\u00a04 mmol/l) for hospitalized adults (\u2265\u00a016\u00a0years) with diabetes reporting the primary outcomes of interest, hospital length of stay or mortality. Final papers for inclusion were reviewed in duplicate and the adjusted results of each were pooled, using a random effects model then undergoing further prespecified subgroup analysis. RESULTS: In total, 15 studies were included in the meta-analysis. The pooled mean difference in length of stay for ward-based inpatients exposed to hypoglycaemia was 4.1\u00a0days longer [95% confidence interval (CI) 2.36 to 5.79; I\u00b2 = 99%] compared with those without hypoglycaemia. This association remained robust across the pre-specified subgroup analyses. The pooled relative risk (RR) of in-hospital mortality was greater for those exposed to hypoglycaemia (RR 2.09, 95% CI 1.64 to 2.67; I\u00b2 = 94%, n = 7 studies) but not in intensive care unit mortality (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.49 to 1.16; I\u00b2 =0%, n = 2 studies). CONCLUSION: There is an association between inpatient hypoglycaemia and longer length of stay and greater in-hospital mortality. Studies examining this association were heterogenous in terms of both clinical populations and effect size, but the overall direction of the association was consistent. Therefore, glucose concentration should be considered a potential tool to aid the identification of inpatients at risk of poor health-related outcomes. ",
        "Targeting nNOS ameliorates the severe neuropathic pain due to chronic pancreatitis. BACKGROUND: Pain due to pancreatic cancer/PCa or chronic pancreatitis/CP, is notoriously resistant to the strongest pain medications. Here, we aimed at deciphering the specific molecular mediators of pain at surgical-stage pancreatic disease and to discover novel translational targets. METHODS: We performed a systematic, quantitative analysis of the neurotransmitter/neuroenzmye profile within intrapancreatic nerves of CP and PCa patients. Ex vivo neuronal cultures treated with human pancreatic extracts, conditional genetically engineered knockout mouse models of PCa and CP, and the cerulein-induced CP model were employed to explore the therapeutic potential of the identified targets. FINDINGS: We identified a unique enrichment of neuronal nitric-oxide-synthase (nNOS) in the pancreatic nerves of CP patients with increasing pain severity. Employment of ex vivo neuronal cultures treated with pancreatic tissue extracts of CP patients, and brain-derived-neurotrophic-factor-deficient (BDNF+/-) mice revealed neuronal enrichment of nNOS to be a consequence of BDNF loss in the progressively destroyed pancreatic tissue. Mechanistically, nNOS upregulation in sensory neurons was induced by tryptase secreted from perineural mast cells. In a head-to-head comparison of several genetically induced, painless mouse models of PCa (KPC, KC mice) or CP (Ptf1a-Cre;Atg5fl/fl) against the hypersecretion/cerulein-induced, painful CP mouse model, we show that a similar nNOS enrichment is present in the painful cerulein-CP model, but absent in painless genetic models. Consequently, mice afflicted with painful cerulein-induced CP could be significantly relieved upon treatment with the specific nNOS inhibitor NPLA. INTERPRETATION: We propose nNOS inhibition as a novel strategy to treat the unbearable pain in CP. FUND: Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft/DFG (DE2428/3-1 and 3-2). ",
        "EGR1 recruits TET1 to shape the brain methylome during development and upon neuronal activity. Life experience can leave lasting marks, such as epigenetic changes, in the brain. How life experience is translated into storable epigenetic information remains largely unknown. With unbiased data-driven approaches, we predicted that Egr1, a transcription factor important for memory formation, plays an essential role in brain epigenetic programming. We performed EGR1 ChIP-seq and validated thousands of EGR1 binding sites with methylation patterns established during postnatal brain development. More specifically, these EGR1 binding sites become hypomethylated in mature neurons but remain heavily methylated in glia. We further demonstrated that EGR1 recruits a DNA demethylase TET1 to remove the methylation marks and activate downstream genes. The frontal cortices from the knockout mice lacking Egr1 or Tet1 share strikingly similar profiles in both gene expression and DNA methylation. In summary, our study reveals EGR1 programs the brain methylome together with TET1 providing new insight into how life experience may shape the brain methylome. ",
        "Association of Antidepressant Use With Adverse Health Outcomes: A Systematic Umbrella Review. Importance: Antidepressant use is increasing worldwide. Yet, contrasting evidence on the safety of antidepressants is available from meta-analyses, and the credibility of these findings has not been quantified. Objective: To grade the evidence from published meta-analyses of observational studies that assessed the association between antidepressant use or exposure and adverse health outcomes. Data Sources: PubMed, Scopus, and PsycINFO were searched from database inception to April 5, 2019. Evidence Review: Only meta-analyses of observational studies with a cohort or case-control study design were eligible. Two independent reviewers recorded the data and assessed the methodological quality of the included meta-analyses. Evidence of association was ranked according to established criteria as follows: convincing, highly suggestive, suggestive, weak, or not significant. Results: Forty-five meta-analyses (17.9%) from 4471 studies identified and 252 full-text articles scrutinized were selected that described 120 associations, including data from 1012 individual effect size estimates. Seventy-four (61.7%) of the 120 associations were nominally statistically significant at P\u2009\u2264\u2009.05 using random-effects models. Fifty-two associations (43.4%) had large heterogeneity (I2\u2009>\u200950%), whereas small-study effects were found for 17 associations (14.2%) and excess significance bias was found for 9 associations (7.5%). Convincing evidence emerged from both main and sensitivity analyses for the association between antidepressant use and risk of suicide attempt or completion among children and adolescents, autism spectrum disorders with antidepressant exposure before and during pregnancy, preterm birth, and low Apgar scores. None of these associations remained supported by convincing evidence after sensitivity analysis, which adjusted for confounding by indication. Conclusions and Relevance: This study's findings suggest that most putative adverse health outcomes associated with antidepressant use may not be supported by convincing evidence, and confounding by indication may alter the few associations with convincing evidence. Antidepressant use appears to be safe for the treatment of psychiatric disorders, but more studies matching for underlying disease are needed to clarify the degree of confounding by indication and other biases. No absolute contraindication to antidepressants emerged from this umbrella review. ",
        "Development of a forward-oriented therapeutic lentiviral vector for hemoglobin disorders. Hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) gene therapy is being evaluated for hemoglobin disorders including sickle cell disease (SCD). Therapeutic globin vectors have demanding requirements including high-efficiency transduction at the HSC level and high-level, erythroid-specific expression with long-term persistence. The requirement of intron 2 for high-level \u03b2-globin expression dictates a reverse-oriented globin-expression cassette to prevent its loss from RNA splicing. Current reverse-oriented globin vectors can drive phenotypic correction, but they are limited by low vector titers and low transduction efficiencies. Here we report a clinically relevant forward-oriented \u03b2-globin-expressing vector, which has sixfold higher vector titers and four to tenfold higher transduction efficiency for long-term hematopoietic repopulating cells in humanized mice and rhesus macaques. Insertion of Rev response element (RRE) allows intron 2 to be retained, and \u03b2-globin production is observed in transplanted macaques and human SCD CD34+ cells. These findings bring us closer to a widely applicable gene therapy for hemoglobin disorders. ",
        "Systems-level Analysis Reveals Multiple Modulators of Epithelial-mesenchymal Transition and Identifies DNAJB4 and CD81 as Novel Metastasis Inducers in Breast Cancer. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is driven by complex signaling events that induce dramatic biochemical and morphological changes whereby epithelial cells are converted into cancer cells. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain elusive. Here, we used mass spectrometry based quantitative proteomics approach to systematically analyze the post-translational biochemical changes that drive differentiation of human mammary epithelial (HMLE) cells into mesenchymal. We identified 314 proteins out of more than 6,000 unique proteins and 871 phosphopeptides out of more than 7,000 unique phosphopeptides as differentially regulated. We found that phosphoproteome is more unstable and prone to changes during EMT compared with the proteome and multiple alterations at proteome level are not thoroughly represented by transcriptional data highlighting the necessity of proteome level analysis. We discovered cell state specific signaling pathways, such as Hippo, sphingolipid signaling, and unfolded protein response (UPR) by modeling the networks of regulated proteins and potential kinase-substrate groups. We identified two novel factors for EMT whose expression increased on EMT induction: DnaJ heat shock protein family (Hsp40) member B4 (DNAJB4) and cluster of differentiation 81 (CD81). Suppression of DNAJB4 or CD81 in mesenchymal breast cancer cells resulted in decreased cell migration in vitro and led to reduced primary tumor growth, extravasation, and lung metastasis in vivo Overall, we performed the global proteomic and phosphoproteomic analyses of EMT, identified and validated new mRNA and/or protein level modulators of EMT. This work also provides a unique platform and resource for future studies focusing on metastasis and drug resistance. ",
        "ETS Proteins Bind with Glucocorticoid Receptors: Relevance for Treatment of Ewing Sarcoma. The glucocorticoid receptor (GR) acts as a ubiquitous cortisol-dependent transcription factor (TF). To identify co-factors, we used protein-fragment complementation assays and found that GR recognizes FLI1 and additional ETS family proteins, TFs relaying proliferation and/or migration signals. Following steroid-dependent translocation of FLI1 and GR to the nucleus, the FLI1-specific domain (FLS) binds with GR and strongly enhances GR's transcriptional activity. This interaction has functional consequences in Ewing sarcoma (ES), childhood and adolescence bone malignancies driven by fusions between EWSR1 and FLI1. In\u00a0vitro, GR knockdown inhibited the migration and proliferation of ES cells, and in animal models, antagonizing GR (or lowering cortisol) retarded both tumor growth and metastasis from bone to lung. Taken together, our findings offer mechanistic rationale for repurposing GR-targeting drugs for the treatment of patients with ES. ",
        "Intestinal UDP-glucuronosyltransferase as a potential target for the treatment and prevention of lymphatic filariasis. Lymphatic filariasis (LF), a morbid disease caused by the tissue-invasive nematodes Wuchereria bancrofti, Brugia malayi, and Brugia timori, affects millions of people worldwide. Global eradication efforts have significantly reduced worldwide prevalence, but complete elimination has been hampered by limitations of current anti-filarial drugs and the lack of a vaccine. The goal of this study was to evaluate B. malayi intestinal UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (Bm-UGT) as a potential therapeutic target. To evaluate whether Bm-UGT is essential for adult filarial worms, we inhibited its expression using siRNA. This resulted in a 75% knockdown of Bm-ugt mRNA for 6 days and almost complete suppression of detectable Bm-UGT by immunoblot. Reduction in Bm-UGT expression resulted in decreased worm motility for 6 days, 70% reduction in microfilaria release from adult worms, and significant reduction in adult worm metabolism as detected by MTT assays. Because prior allergic-sensitization to a filarial antigen would be a contraindication for its use as a vaccine candidate, we tested plasma from infected and endemic normal populations for Bm-UGT-specific IgE using a luciferase immunoprecipitation assay. All samples (n = 35) tested negative. We then tested two commercially available medicines known to be broad inhibitors of UGTs, sulfinpyrazone and probenecid, for in vitro activity against B. malayi. There were marked macrofilaricidal effects at concentrations achievable in humans and very little effect on microfilariae. In addition, we observed that probenecid and sulfinpyrazone exhibit a synergistic macrofilaricidal effect when used in combination with albendazole. The results of this study demonstrate that Bm-UGT is an essential protein for adult worm survival. Lack of prior IgE sensitization in infected and endemic populations suggest it may be a feasible vaccine candidate. The finding that sulfinpyrazone and probenecid have in vitro effects against adult B. malayi worms suggests that these medications have promise as potential macrofilaricides in humans. ",
        "Increasing Vegetable Intake by Emphasizing Tasty and Enjoyable Attributes: A Randomized Controlled Multisite Intervention for Taste-Focused Labeling. Healthy food labels tout health benefits, yet most people prioritize tastiness in the moment of food choice. In a preregistered intervention, we tested whether taste-focused labels compared with health-focused labels increased vegetable intake at five university dining halls throughout the United States. Across 137,842 diner decisions, 185 days, and 24 vegetable types, taste-focused labels increased vegetable selection by 29% compared with health-focused labels and by 14% compared with basic labels. Vegetable consumption also increased. Supplementary studies further probed the mediators, moderators, and boundaries of these effects. Increased expectations of a positive taste experience mediated the effect of taste-focused labels on vegetable selection. Moderation tests revealed greater effects in settings that served tastier vegetable recipes. Taste-focused labels outperformed labels that merely contained positive words, fancy words, or lists of ingredients. Together, these studies show that emphasizing tasty and enjoyable attributes increases vegetable intake in real-world settings in which vegetables compete with less healthy options. ",
        "X-chromosome upregulation is driven by increased burst frequency. Ohno's hypothesis postulates that upregulation of X-linked genes rectifies their dosage imbalance relative to autosomal genes, which are present in two active copies per cell. Here we have dissected X-chromosome upregulation into the kinetics of transcription, inferred from allele-specific single-cell RNA sequencing data from somatic and embryonic mouse cells. We confirmed increased X-chromosome expression levels in female and male cells and found that the X chromosome achieved upregulation by elevated burst frequencies. By monitoring transcriptional kinetics in differentiating female mouse embryonic stem cells, we found that increased burst frequency was established on the active X chromosome when X inactivation took place on the other allele. Thus, our study provides mechanistic insights into X-chromosome upregulation. ",
        "A Taxon-Specific and High-Throughput Method for Measuring Ligand Binding to Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptors. The binding of compounds to nicotinic acetylcholine receptors is of great interest in biomedical research. However, progress in this area is hampered by the lack of a high-throughput, cost-effective, and taxonomically flexible platform. Current methods are low-throughput, consume large quantities of sample, or are taxonomically limited in which targets can be tested. We describe a novel assay which utilizes a label-free bio-layer interferometry technology, in combination with adapted mimotope peptides, in order to measure ligand binding to the orthosteric site of nicotinic acetylcholine receptor alpha-subunits of diverse organisms. We validated the method by testing the evolutionary patterns of a generalist feeding species (Acanthophis antarcticus), a fish specialist species (Aipysurus laevis), and a snake specialist species (Ophiophagus hannah) for comparative binding to the orthosteric site of fish, amphibian, lizard, snake, bird, marsupial, and rodent alpha-1 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. Binding patterns corresponded with diet, with the Acanthophis antarcticus not showing bias towards any particular lineage, while Aipysurus laevis showed selectivity for fish, and Ophiophagus hannah a selectivity for snake. To validate the biodiscovery potential of this method, we screened Acanthophis antarcticus and Tropidolaemus wagleri venom for binding to human alpha-1, alpha-2, alpha-3, alpha-4, alpha-5, alpha-6, alpha-7, alpha-9, and alpha-10. While A. antarcticus was broadly potent, T. wagleri showed very strong but selective binding, specifically to the alpha-1 target which would be evolutionarily selected for, as well as the alpha-5 target which is of major interest for drug design and development. Thus, we have shown that our novel method is broadly applicable for studies including evolutionary patterns of venom diversification, predicting potential neurotoxic effects in human envenomed patients, and searches for novel ligands of interest for laboratory tools and in drug design and development.

Importance: Fragmented daily physical activity may be a sign of physiological decline that provides more powerful insight into impending mortality than total daily activity. Objective: To compare and contrast the association between total daily activity and activity fragmentation, which encompasses activity bouts and duration, and mortality risk. Design, Setting, and Participants: In this cohort study, accelerometer data from 2007 through 2015 and mortality data from 2007 through 2017 were collected from 548 adults aged 65 years and older participating in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging. The dates of analysis were November 2016 to June 2019, with data collected through December 31, 2017. Using Cox proportional hazards regression, the association between accelerometer-derived patterns of physical activity and mortality was estimated after adjusting for demographic characteristics, lifestyle factors, and comorbidities. Exposures: Minute-by-minute physical activity data were collected over a 24-hour, 7-day period (excluding times between 11:00 pm and 4:59 am) using an accelerometer. Each minute was labeled either active or sedentary, and 5 features of accelerometer data were extracted: total daily activity (defined as any activity performed throughout the day), activity fragmentation (defined as an active-to-sedentary transition probability), and 3 measures of activity bouts (<5, 5-10, and \u226510 active minutes). Main Outcomes and Measures: All-cause mortality. Results: Among 548 well-functioning older adults (mean [SD] age, 75.8 [7.2] years; 262 [47.8%] women), 61 participants (11.1%) died. Total daily physical activity was not associated with mortality risk (hazard ratio [HR], 0.90 [95% CI, 0.75-1.08]; P\u2009=\u2009.28). However, more fragmented physical activity patterns were associated with greater mortality risk (HR, 1.49 [95% CI, 1.02-2.19]; P\u2009=\u2009.04) after adjusting for age, sex, race/ethnicity, body mass index, smoking history, employment, self-reported health, grip strength, usual gait speed, comorbidities, and device wear time. In addition, more frequently engaging in activity bouts lasting less than 5 minutes was associated with greater mortality risk (HR, 1.28 [95% CI, 1.01-1.61]; P\u2009=\u2009.04), whereas activity bouts of 5 to 10 minutes (HR, 0.99 [95% CI, 0.58-1.69]; P\u2009=\u2009.97) and 10 minutes or longer (HR, 0.81 [95% CI, 0.65-1.01]; P\u2009=\u2009.06) were not associated with mortality risk. Conclusions and Relevance: In this cohort study of well-functioning adults aged 65 years and older, fragmented daily physical activity, particularly activity bouts lasting less than 5 minutes, was associated with greater mortality risk. These findings suggest that activity fragmentation in older adults may precede declines in functional capability and overall physical activity that typically indicate impending mortality. ",
        "Head and Neck Melanoma Incidence Trends in the Pediatric, Adolescent, and Young Adult Population of the United States and Canada, 1995-2014. Importance: Melanoma is one of the most common cancers worldwide, typically diagnosed in older adults. There is an increasing incidence in the younger population (age \u226440 years) in America. In addition, approximately 1 in 5 cases of melanoma affect the head and neck. However, there are limited data on the incidence of head and neck melanoma in the pediatric, adolescent, and young adult population in North America (United States and Canada). Objective: To assess 20-year demographic and incidence changes associated with head and neck melanoma in the pediatric, adolescent, and young adult population in North America. Design, Setting, and Participants: A descriptive analysis of retrospective data on head and neck melanoma from the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries' Cancer in North America public use data set from 1995 to 2014 was conducted. The data set currently includes 93% of the United States and 64% of the Canadian populations. Eligible data were from 12\u202f462 pediatric, adolescent, and young adult patients (aged 0-39 years) with a confirmed diagnosis of melanoma (International Classification of Diseases-Oncology 3 histologic types 8720-8790) in primary head and neck sites: skin of lip, not otherwise specified (C44.0); eyelid (C44.1); external ear (C44.2); skin of other/unspecified parts of face (C44.3); and skin of scalp and neck (C44.4). The study was conducted from January 26 to July 21, 2019. Main Outcomes and Measures: Log-linear regression was used to estimate annual percentage change in age-adjusted incidence rates (AAIRs) of head and neck melanoma. Results: Of the 12\u202f462 patients with head and neck melanoma included in the study, 6810 were male (54.6%). The AAIR was 0.51 per 100\u202f000 persons (95% CI, 0.50-0.52 per 100\u202f000 persons). In North America, the incidence of head and neck melanoma increased by 51.1% from 1995 to 2014. The rate was higher in the United States (AAIR, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.51-0.53 per 100\u202f000 person-years) than Canada (AAIR, 0.43; 95% CI, 0.40-0.45 per 100\u202f000 persons). In the United States, the incidence increased 4.68% yearly from 1995 to 2000 and 1.15% yearly from 2000 to 2014. In Canada, the incidence increased 2.18% yearly from 1995 to 2014. Male sex (AAIR, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.54-0.57 per 100\u202f000 persons), older age (AAIR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.79-0.80 per 100\u202f000 persons), and non-Hispanic white race/ethnicity (AAIR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.77-0.80 per 100\u202f000 persons) were associated with an increased incidence of head and neck melanoma. Conclusions and Relevance: The incidence of pediatric, adolescent, and young adult head and neck melanoma in North America appears to have increased by 51.1% in the past 2 decades, with males aged 15 to 39 years the main cohort associated with the increase.

        "Health Insurance Coverage of Gender-Affirming Top Surgery in the United States. BACKGROUND: Despite the medical necessity, legislative mandates, and economic benefits of gender-affirming surgery, access to treatment remains limited. The World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH) has proposed guidelines for transition-related surgery in conjunction with criteria to delineate medical necessity. The authors assessed insurance coverage of \"top\" gender-affirming surgery and evaluated the differences between insurance policy criteria and WPATH recommendations. METHODS: The authors conducted a cross-sectional analysis of insurance policies for coverage of top gender-affirming surgery. Insurance companies were selected based on their state enrollment data and market share. A Web-based search and individual telephone interviews were conducted to identify the policy. Medical necessity criteria were abstracted from publicly available policies. RESULTS: Of the 57 insurers evaluated, bilateral mastectomy (transmasculine) was covered by significantly more insurers than breast augmentation (transfeminine) (96 percent versus 68 percent; p < 0.0001). Only 4 percent of companies used WPATH-consistent criteria. No criterion was universally required by insurers. Additional prerequisites for coverage that extended beyond WPATH guidelines for top surgery were continuous living in congruent gender role, two referring mental health professionals, and hormone therapy before surgery. Hormone therapy was required in a significantly higher proportion of transfeminine policies compared with transmasculine policies (90 percent versus 21 percent; p < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: In addition to the marked intercompany variation in criteria for insurance coverage that often deviated from WPATH recommendations, there are health care insurers who categorically deny access to top gender-affirming surgery. A greater evidence base is needed to provide further support for the medical necessity criteria in current use. ",
        "Profiles and Predictors of Infant Sleep Problems Across the First Year. OBJECTIVE: To identify profiles and predictors of maternal-reported infant sleep problems across the first postnatal year. METHODS: Survey data examining maternal mental and physical health, intimate partner violence (IPV), and infant sleep problems and night waking were gathered from a cohort of 1,460 nulliparous women at 15 weeks' gestation and when their infants were 3, 6, 9, and 12 months old. RESULTS: Latent class analysis revealed 5 profiles of infant sleep problems, including those who had few problems (24.7%), persistent moderate problems (27.3%), increased problems at 6 months (10.8%), increased problems at 9 months (17.8%), and persistent severe problems (19.4%). Persistent severe infant sleep problems were associated with prepartum and postpartum maternal depression (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 2.13, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.35-3.34, p < 0.01; AOR 2.52, 95% CI 1.64-3.87, p < 0.001, respectively), poorer prepartum and postpartum perception of health (adjusted mean difference [AMD] 23.48, 95% CI 24.9 to 22.1, p < 0.01; AMD 23.78, 95% CI 25.2 to 22.4, p < 0.001, respectively), increased postpartum anxiety (AOR 2.22, 95% CI 1.26-3.90, p < 0.01), and increased prevalence of IPV in the first year postpartum (AOR 1.86, 95% CI 1.20-2.87, p < 0.01). CONCLUSION: Poorer prepartum and postpartum maternal mental and physical health, and IPV, were associated with maternal report of persistent severe infant sleep problems. Women experiencing prenatal physical and mental health difficulties may benefit from advice on managing infant sleep and settling. Health professionals working with unsettled infants must be equipped to enquire about and respond appropriately to disclosures of IPV. ",
        "Resorting the function of the colorectal cancer gatekeeper adenomatous polyposis coli. As a large number of cancers are caused by nonsense mutations in key genes, read-through of these mutations to restore full-length protein expression is a potential therapeutic strategy. Mutations in the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene initiate the majority of both sporadic and hereditary colorectal cancers (CRC) and around 30% of these mutations are nonsense mutations. Our goal was to test the feasibility and effectiveness of APC nonsense mutation read-through as a potential chemo-preventive therapy in Familial Adenomatous Polyposis (FAP), an inherited CRC syndrome patients. Ten FAP patients harboring APC nonsense mutations were treated with the read-through inducing antibiotic erythromycin for 4 months. Endoscopic assessment of the adenomas was performed at baseline, after 4 and after 12\u2009months. Adenoma burden was documented in terms of adenoma number, maximal polyp size and cumulative polyp size per procedure. Tissue samples were collected and subjected to molecular and genetic analyses. Our results show that in the majority of patients the treatment led to a decrease in cumulative adenoma burden, median reduction in cumulative adenoma size and median reduction in adenoma number. Molecular and genetic analyses of the adenomas revealed that the treatment led to a reduced number of somatic APC mutations, reduced cellular proliferation and restoration of APC tumor-suppressing activity. Together, our findings show that induced read-through of APC nonsense mutations leads to promising clinical results and should be further investigated to establish its therapeutic potential in FAP and sporadic CRCs harboring nonsense APC mutations.

        "The feasibility and acceptability of using virtual world technology for interprofessional education in palliative care: a mixed methods study. The objective of this mixed methods study was to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of using a virtual world educational environment for interprofessional health professions students learning about palliative care. Graduate students (n\u00a0=\u00a035) from five different health professions programs (medicine, nursing, nutrition, physical therapy, and social work) across two educational institutions participated in a small-group immersive educational experience focused on palliative care in the virtual world of Second Life. Collected data included pre and post surveys of interprofessional attitudes using previously-published questionnaires as well as student reflective writing and photographs about their experience. We found it was feasible to create and deliver an interprofessional educational experience in palliative care in a virtual world environment. The educational experience was acceptable to participants, with an improvement in attitudes toward interprofessional education and interprofessional teamwork after a single virtual world educational session, based on both quantitative and qualitative results. Students found the virtual world environment acceptable for interprofessional education focused on palliative care, based on qualitative results. As health professions schools develop interprofessional education curricula, the use of virtual world technology may be an important modality to consider, to effectively and conveniently bring interprofessional learners together.

        "Increasing Vegetable Intake by Emphasizing Tasty and Enjoyable Attributes: A Randomized Controlled Multisite Intervention for Taste-Focused Labeling. Healthy food labels tout health benefits, yet most people prioritize tastiness in the moment of food choice. In a preregistered intervention, we tested whether taste-focused labels compared with health-focused labels increased vegetable intake at five university dining halls throughout the United States. Across 137,842 diner decisions, 185 days, and 24 vegetable types, taste-focused labels increased vegetable selection by 29% compared with health-focused labels and by 14% compared with basic labels. Vegetable consumption also increased. Supplementary studies further probed the mediators, moderators, and boundaries of these effects. Increased expectations of a positive taste experience mediated the effect of taste-focused labels on vegetable selection. Moderation tests revealed greater effects in settings that served tastier vegetable recipes. Taste-focused labels outperformed labels that merely contained positive words, fancy words, or lists of ingredients. Together, these studies show that emphasizing tasty and enjoyable attributes increases vegetable intake in real-world settings in which vegetables compete with less healthy options. ",
        "Cryo-EM structure and dynamics of eukaryotic DNA polymerase \u03b4 holoenzyme. DNA polymerase \u03b4 (Pol\u03b4) plays pivotal roles in eukaryotic DNA replication and repair. Pol\u03b4 is conserved from yeast to humans, and mutations in human Pol\u03b4 have been implicated in various cancers. Saccharomyces cerevisiae Pol\u03b4 consists of catalytic Pol3 and the regulatory Pol31 and Pol32 subunits. Here, we present the near atomic resolution (3.2\u2009\u00c5) cryo-EM structure of yeast Pol\u03b4 holoenzyme in the act of DNA synthesis. The structure reveals an unexpected arrangement in which the regulatory subunits (Pol31 and Pol32) lie next to the exonuclease domain of Pol3 but do not engage the DNA. The Pol3 C-terminal domain contains a 4Fe-4S cluster and emerges as the keystone of Pol\u03b4 assembly. We also show that the catalytic and regulatory subunits rotate relative to each other and that this is an intrinsic feature of the Pol\u03b4 architecture. Collectively, the structure provides a framework for understanding DNA transactions at the replication fork. ",
        "A Cost-effectiveness Analysis of Multigene Testing for All Patients With Breast Cancer. Importance: Moving to multigene testing for all women with breast cancer (BC) could identify many more mutation carriers who can benefit from precision prevention. However, the cost-effectiveness of this approach remains unaddressed. Objective: To estimate incremental lifetime effects, costs, and cost-effectiveness of multigene testing of all patients with BC compared with the current practice of genetic testing (BRCA) based on family history (FH) or clinical criteria. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cost-effectiveness microsimulation modeling study compared lifetime costs and effects of high-risk BRCA1/BRCA2/PALB2 (multigene) testing of all unselected patients with BC (strategy A) with BRCA1/BRCA2 testing based on FH or clinical criteria (strategy B) in United Kingdom (UK) and US populations. Data were obtained from 11\u202f836 patients in population-based BC cohorts (regardless of FH) recruited to 4 large research studies. Data were collected and analyzed from January 1, 2018, through June 8, 2019. The time horizon is lifetime. Payer and societal perspectives are presented. Probabilistic and 1-way sensitivity analyses evaluate model uncertainty. Interventions: In strategy A, all women with BC underwent BRCA1/BRCA2/PALB2 testing. In strategy B, only women with BC fulfilling FH or clinical criteria underwent BRCA testing. Affected BRCA/PALB2 carriers could undertake contralateral preventive mastectomy; BRCA carriers could choose risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy (RRSO). Relatives of mutation carriers underwent cascade testing. Unaffected relative carriers could undergo magnetic resonance imaging or mammography screening, chemoprevention, or risk-reducing mastectomy for BC risk and RRSO for ovarian cancer (OC) risk. Main Outcomes and Measures: Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was calculated as incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained and compared with standard \u00a330 000/QALY and $100\u202f000/QALY UK and US thresholds, respectively. Incidence of OC, BC, excess deaths due to heart disease, and the overall population effects were estimated. Results: BRCA1/BRCA2/PALB2 multigene testing for all patients detected with BC annually would cost \u00a310 464/QALY (payer perspective) or \u00a37216/QALY (societal perspective) in the United Kingdom or $65\u202f661/QALY (payer perspective) or $61\u202f618/QALY (societal perspective) in the United States compared with current BRCA testing based on clinical criteria or FH. This is well below UK and US cost-effectiveness thresholds. In probabilistic sensitivity analysis, unselected multigene testing remained cost-effective for 98% to 99% of UK and 64% to 68% of US health system simulations. One year's unselected multigene testing could prevent 2101 cases of BC and OC and 633 deaths in the United Kingdom and 9733 cases of BC and OC and 2406 deaths in the United States. Correspondingly, 8 excess deaths due to heart disease occurred in the United Kingdom and 35 in the United States annually. Conclusions and Relevance: This study found unselected, high-risk multigene testing for all patients with BC to be extremely cost-effective compared with testing based on FH or clinical criteria for UK and US health systems. These findings support changing current policy to expand genetic testing to all women with BC. ",
        "The Cofilin/Limk1 Pathway Controls the Growth Rate of Both Developing and Regenerating Motor Axons. Regenerating axons often have to grow considerable distances to reestablish circuits, making functional recovery a lengthy process. One solution to this problem would be to co-opt the \"temporal\" guidance mechanisms that control the rate of axon growth during development to accelerate the rate at which nerves regenerate in adults. We have previously found that the loss of Limk1, a negative regulator of cofilin, accelerates the rate of spinal commissural axon growth. Here, we use mouse models to show that spinal motor axon outgrowth is similarly promoted by the loss of Limk1, suggesting that temporal guidance mechanisms are widely used during development. Furthermore, we find that the regulation of cofilin activity is an acute response to nerve injury in the peripheral nervous system. Within hours of a sciatic nerve injury, the level of phosphorylated cofilin dramatically increases at the lesion site, in a Limk1-dependent manner. This response may be a major constraint on the rate of peripheral nerve regeneration. Proof-of-principle experiments show that elevating cofilin activity, through the loss of Limk1, results in faster sciatic nerve growth, and improved recovery of some sensory and motor function.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT The studies shed light on an endogenous, shared mechanism that controls the rate at which developing and regenerating axons grow. An understanding of these mechanisms is key for developing therapies to reduce painful recovery times for nerve-injury patients, by accelerating the rate at which damaged nerves reconnect with their synaptic targets.

        "CUTseq is a versatile method for preparing multiplexed DNA sequencing libraries from low-input samples. Current multiplexing strategies for massively parallel sequencing of genomic DNA mainly rely on library indexing in the final steps of library preparation. This procedure is costly and time-consuming, because a library must be generated separately for each sample. Furthermore, library preparation is challenging in the case of fixed samples, such as DNA extracted from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues. Here we describe CUTseq, a method that uses restriction enzymes and in vitro transcription to barcode and amplify genomic DNA prior to library construction. We thoroughly assess the sensitivity and reproducibility of CUTseq in both cell lines and FFPE samples, and demonstrate an application of CUTseq for multi-region DNA copy number profiling within single FFPE tumor sections, to assess intratumor genetic heterogeneity at high spatial resolution. In conclusion, CUTseq is a versatile and cost-effective method for library preparation for reduced representation genome sequencing, which can find numerous applications in research and diagnostics.

        "Silver nanowire inks for direct-write electronic tattoo applications. Room-temperature printing of conductive traces has the potential to facilitate the direct writing of electronic tattoos and other medical devices onto biological tissue, such as human skin. However, in order to achieve sufficient electrical performance, the vast majority of conductive inks require biologically harmful post-processing techniques. In addition, most printed conductive traces will degrade with bending stresses that occur from everyday movement. In this work, water-based inks consisting of high aspect ratio silver nanowires are shown to enable the printing of conductive traces at low temperatures and without harmful post-processing. Moreover, the traces produced from these inks retain high electrical performance, even while undergoing up to 50% bending strain and cyclic bending strain over a thousand bending cycles. This ink has a rapid dry time of less than 2 minutes, which is imperative for applications requiring the direct writing of electronics on sensitive surfaces. Demonstrations of conductive traces printed onto soft, nonplanar materials, including an apple and a human finger, highlight the utility of these new silver nanowire inks. These mechanically robust films are ideally suited for printing directly on biological substrates and may find potential applications in the direct-write printing of electronic tattoos and other biomedical devices.

        "Reporting Skill: The Missing Ingredient in Concussion Reporting Intention Assessment. BACKGROUND: Extant literature suggests that a substantial portion of athletes may not report a possible concussion and that concussion knowledge is insufficient to predict concussion reporting behavior. One area that has not been explored is reporting skill; that is, mastery of the actions required to report a concussion. This study evaluated the relationship between reporting skill and reporting intention, introducing a measure of the reporting skill construct. HYPOTHESES: Reporting intentions will be more closely associated with reporting skill than with concussion/symptom knowledge. The relationship between concussion (or symptom) knowledge and reporting intentions will differ by level of reporting skill. STUDY DESIGN: Repeated cross-sectional study. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level 2. METHODS: A set of items was administered to young adults aged 18 to 24 years from the Survey Sampling International panel. Exploratory/confirmatory factor analyses were conducted on 2 waves of data to develop the scale (n = 899). Hypotheses were tested using structural equation modeling on the responses from the third wave of participants (n = 406). RESULTS: Knowing the actions to take in reporting was more important than having knowledge of concussions or concussion symptoms. Reporting skill, not concussion or concussion symptom knowledge, was associated with higher intentions to report symptoms. Among those with higher levels of reporting skill, concussion symptom knowledge (but not general concussion knowledge) was associated with higher intentions to report symptoms. CONCLUSION: Reporting skill is an important and, until now, missing ingredient in the concussion literature and practice. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Incorporating reporting skill development in concussion education and team activities to teach athletes how to report is likely to improve actual reporting intentions. While further study is needed with particular sports and additional age groups, reporting skill holds promise as a new avenue for increased concussion reporting. ",

The ability to manipulate the structure and function of promising systems via external stimuli is emerging with the development of reconfigurable and programmable multifunctional materials. Increasing antifungal and antitumor activity requires novel, effective treatments to be diligently sought. In this work, the synthesis, characterization, and in vitro biological screening of pure \u03b1-Ag2WO4, irradiated with electrons and with non-focused and focused femtosecond laser beams are reported. We demonstrate, for the first time, that Ag nanoparticles/\u03b1-Ag2WO4 composite displays potent antifungal and antitumor activity. This composite had an extreme low inhibition concentration against Candida albicans, cause the modulation of \u03b1-Ag2WO4 perform the fungicidal activity more efficient. For tumor activity, it was found that the composite showed a high selectivity against the cancer cells (MB49), thus depleting the populations of cancer cells by necrosis and apoptosis, without the healthy cells (BALB/3T3) being affected.

        "Hotspot SF3B1 mutations induce metabolic reprogramming and vulnerability to serine deprivation. Cancer-associated mutations in the spliceosome gene SF3B1 create a neomorphic protein that produces aberrant mRNA splicing in hundreds of genes, but the ensuing biologic and therapeutic consequences of this missplicing are not well understood. Here we have provided evidence that aberrant splicing by mutant SF3B1 altered the transcriptome, proteome, and metabolome of human cells, leading to missplicing-associated downregulation of metabolic genes, decreased mitochondrial respiration, and suppression of the serine synthesis pathway. We also found that mutant SF3B1 induces vulnerability to deprivation of the nonessential amino acid serine, which was mediated by missplicing-associated downregulation of the serine synthesis pathway enzyme PHGDH. This vulnerability was manifest both in vitro and in vivo, as dietary restriction of serine and glycine in mice was able to inhibit the growth of SF3B1MUT xenografts. These findings describe a role for SF3B1 mutations in altered energy metabolism, and they offer a new therapeutic strategy against SF3B1MUT cancers. ",
        "Missense Mutations in NKAP Cause a Disorder of Transcriptional Regulation Characterized by Marfanoid Habitus and Cognitive Impairment. NKAP is a ubiquitously expressed nucleoplasmic protein that is currently known as a transcriptional regulatory molecule via its interaction with HDAC3 and spliceosomal proteins. Here, we report a disorder of transcriptional regulation due to missense mutations in the X chromosome gene, NKAP. These mutations are clustered in the C-terminal region of NKAP where NKAP interacts with HDAC3 and post-catalytic spliceosomal complex proteins. Consistent with a role for the C-terminal region of NKAP in embryogenesis, nkap mutant zebrafish with a C-terminally truncated NKAP demonstrate severe developmental defects. The clinical features of affected individuals are highly conserved and include developmental delay, hypotonia, joint contractures, behavioral abnormalities, Marfanoid habitus, and scoliosis. In affected cases, transcriptome analysis revealed the presence of a unique transcriptome signature, which is characterized by the downregulation of long genes with higher exon numbers. These observations indicate the critical role of NKAP in transcriptional regulation and demonstrate that perturbations of the C-terminal region lead to developmental defects in both humans and zebrafish.

        "Full-Length P2X7 Structures Reveal How Palmitoylation Prevents Channel Desensitization. P2X receptors are trimeric, non-selective cation channels activated by extracellular ATP. The P2X7 receptor subtype is a pharmacological target because of involvement in apoptotic, inflammatory, and tumor progression pathways. It is the most structurally and functionally distinct P2X subtype, containing a unique cytoplasmic domain critical for the receptor to initiate apoptosis and not undergo desensitization. However, lack of structural information about the cytoplasmic domain has hindered understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying these processes. We report cryoelectron microscopy structures of full-length rat P2X7 receptor in apo and ATP-bound states. These structures reveal how one cytoplasmic element, the C-cys anchor, prevents desensitization by anchoring the pore-lining helix to the membrane with palmitoyl groups. They show a second cytoplasmic element with a unique fold, the cytoplasmic ballast, which unexpectedly contains a zinc ion complex and a guanosine nucleotide binding site. Our structures provide first insights into the architecture and function of a P2X receptor cytoplasmic domain. ",
        "Concurrent Daily Alcohol and Tobacco Use among Sexual Minority and Heterosexual Women. Background: Studies show that sexual minority women (SMW) report more hazardous alcohol use patterns and higher rates of tobacco use than exclusively heterosexual women. Despite the public health implications of drinking and smoking, especially when they co-occur, little is known about SMW's daily use patterns or the factors that may facilitate concurrent use. Objectives: The present study seeks to identify patterns of daily concurrent alcohol and tobacco use among SMW and heterosexual women, including socio-environmental drinking contexts of concurrent use. Methods: Data come from a community sample of lesbian, bisexual, and heterosexual women (N\u2009=\u2009246) who completed up to 84 consecutive days of web-based reports about substance use. Results: Participants reported 4,012 drinking days (24%), 2,019 smoking days (12%), and 769 concurrent drinking and smoking days (5%). No differences were found between SMW and heterosexual women in the proportion of drinking days; however, SMW consumed more drinks on drinking days. SMW also reported a greater proportion of smoking days, more cigarettes smoked on smoking days, and a greater proportion of concurrent drinking and smoking days. Reciprocal daily relationships between alcohol and tobacco use were identified, and these relationships were strongest for bisexual women. Socio-environmental factors-including certain locations, situations, and companions-increased the likelihood of concurrent use for all women; however, few sexual identity differences were found in concurrent use contexts. Importance: Results expand our understanding about daily concurrent alcohol and tobacco use risk among SMW, and potentially inform treatment research to better address the unique experiences of this vulnerable group.

        "Complex interaction of obesity, intentional weight loss and heart failure: a systematic review and meta-analysis. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the meta-analysis was to determine the association of obesity and heart failure (HF) and the cardiac impact of intentional weight loss following bariatric surgery on cardiac structure and myocardial function in obese subjects. METHODS: MEDLINE, Embase and Web of Science were searched up to 3 April 2018. Studies reporting association and prognostic impact of obesity in HF and the impact of intentional weight loss following bariatric surgery on cardiac structure and myocardial function in obesity were included in the meta-analysis. RESULTS: 4959 citations were reviewed. After exclusions, 29 studies were analysed. A 'J curve' relationship was observed between body mass index (BMI) and risk of HF with maximum risk in the morbidly obese (1.73 (95% CI 1.30 to 2.31), p<0.001, n=11). Although 'obesity paradox' was observed for all-cause mortality, the overweight group was associated with lower cardiovascular (CV) mortality (OR=0.86 (95% CI 0.79 to 0.94), n=11) with no significant differences across other BMI groups. Intentional weight loss induced by bariatric surgery in obese patients (n=9) without established HF, atrial fibrillation or known coronary artery disease, was associated with a reduction in left ventricular mass index (p<0.0001), improvement in left ventricular diastolic function (p\u22640.0001) and a reduction in left atrial size (p=0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Despite the increased risk of HF with obesity, an 'obesity paradox' is observed for all-cause mortality. However, the nadir for CV mortality is observed in the overweight group. Importantly, intentional weight loss was associated with improvement in indices of cardiac structure and myocardial function in obese patients. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: APP 74412. ",
        "Objective Sleep Duration in Older Adults: Results From The Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing. OBJECTIVE: This study assessed the distribution and correlates of objective sleep duration in the older population in Ireland. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study using population-derived data from wave 3 of The Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing. SETTING: Community-dwelling adults. PARTICIPANTS: Adults, aged 50\u2009years and older, who wore an accelerometer for at least 4\u2009days (N = 1533). MEASUREMENTS: Sleep was measured for at least 4\u2009days in 1533 participants using a GENEActiv wrist-worn accelerometer device. Sleep parameters included total sleep time (TST) and self-reported sleep problems. TST was categorized as short and long sleep duration using US National Sleep Foundation guidelines. Linear and multinomial logistic regression models assessed sociodemographic, health, and behavioral correlates of sleep duration. RESULTS: Mean TST for the sample was 463\u2009minutes (SD = 72.6 minutes). Of participants, 13.9% and 16.5% measured short and long sleep duration, respectively. TST decreased as sleep problems increased, as did durations recorded in summer compared to winter recordings. Advancing age was associated with longer sleep, as was antidepressant use. Retired/unemployed participants recorded longer TST and were more likely to record long sleep compared to employed participants. Fair/poor self-rated health and separated/divorced participants were more likely to record short sleep. Those reporting moderate or high physical activity were less likely to record short or long sleep, respectively, compared to those reporting low physical activity. Participants reporting a limiting disability were less likely to record long sleep. CONCLUSION: Average TST was within recommended guidelines; however, a significant subset of older adults recorded sleep duration outside of the guidelines. Independent demographic and health correlates of suboptimal sleep were identified, many of which are modifiable. Patients and clinicians should be aware of factors potentially influencing sleep patterns. Longitudinal analyses to confirm directionality of relationships with potential risk factors are warranted.

        "Abnormal auditory tonotopy in patients with schizophrenia. Auditory hallucinations are among the most prevalent and most distressing symptoms of schizophrenia. Despite significant progress, it is still unclear whether auditory hallucinations arise from abnormalities in primary sensory processing or whether they represent failures of higher-order functions. To address this knowledge gap, we capitalized on the increased spatial resolution afforded by ultra-high field imaging at 7 Tesla to investigate the tonotopic organization of the auditory cortex in patients with schizophrenia with a history of recurrent hallucinations. Tonotopy is a fundamental feature of the functional organization of the auditory cortex that is established very early in development and predates the onset of symptoms by decades. Compared to healthy participants, patients showed abnormally increased activation and altered tonotopic organization of the auditory cortex during a purely perceptual task, which involved passive listening to tones across a range of frequencies (88-8000\u2009Hz). These findings suggest that the predisposition to auditory hallucinations is likely to be predicated on abnormalities in the functional organization of the auditory cortex and which may serve as a biomarker for the early identification of vulnerable individuals.

        "Multiplexed and single cell tracing of lipid metabolism. Cellular lipid metabolism is a complex network process comprising dozens of enzymes, multiple organelles and more than a thousand lipid species. Tracing metabolic reactions in this network is a major technological and scientific challenge. Using a click-chemistry mass spectrometry reporter strategy, we have developed a specific, highly sensitive and robust tracing procedure for alkyne-labeled lipids. The method enables sample multiplexing, which improves sample comparison. We demonstrate this by a time-resolved analysis of hepatocyte glycerolipid metabolism with parallel quantitative monitoring of 120 labeled lipid species. The subfemtomole sensitivity enabled a single cell analysis of fatty acid incorporation into neutral and membrane lipids. The results demonstrate the robustness of lipid homeostasis at the single cell level. ",
        "Bone Marrow Absorbed Doses and Correlations with Hematologic Response During 177Lu-DOTATATE Treatments Are Influenced by Image-Based Dosimetry Method and Presence of Skeletal Metastases. This study aimed to compare different image-based methods for bone marrow dosimetry and study the dose-response relationship during treatment with 177Lu-DOTATATE in patients with and without skeletal metastases. Methods: This study included 46 patients with advanced neuroendocrine tumors treated with at least 2 fractions of 177Lu-DOTATATE at Sahlgrenska University Hospital. High- and low-uptake compartments were automatically outlined in planar images collected at 2, 24, 48, and 168 h after injection. The bone marrow absorbed doses were calculated from the cross doses of the high- and low-uptake compartments and the self-dose, using the time-activity concentration curve for the low-uptake compartment. This time-activity concentration curve was adjusted using a fixed constant of 1.8 for the planar dosimetry method and using the activity concentrations in vertebral bodies in SPECT images at 24 h after injection of 177Lu-DOTATATE in 4 hybrid methods: L4-SPECT used the activity concentration in the L4 vertebra, whereas V-SPECT, L-SPECT, and T-SPECT used the median activity concentration in all visible vertebrae, lumbar vertebrae, and thoracic vertebrae, respectively. Results: Using the planar method, L4-SPECT, V-SPECT, L-SPECT, and T-SPECT, the estimated median bone marrow absorbed doses were 0.19, 0.36, 0.40, 0.39, and 0.46 Gy/7.4 GBq, respectively, with respective ranges of 0.12-0.33, 0.15-1.44, 0.19-1.71, 0.21-1.60, and 0.18-2.12 Gy/7.4 GBq. For all methods, the bone marrow absorbed dose significantly correlated with decreased platelet counts. This correlation increased after treatment fraction 2: the Spearman correlation (rs) were -0.49 for the planar method, -0.61 for L4-SPECT, -0.63 for V-SPECT, -0.63 for L-SPECT, and -0.57 for T-SPECT. A separate analysis revealed an increased correlation for patients without skeletal metastases using the planar method (rs = -0.67). In contrast, hybrid methods had poor correlations for patients without metastases and stronger correlations for patients with skeletal metastases (rs = -0.61 to -0.74). The mean bone marrow absorbed doses were 3%-69% higher for patients with skeletal metastases than for patients without. Conclusion: The estimated bone marrow absorbed doses by image-based techniques and the correlation with platelets are influenced by the choice of measured vertebrae and the presence of skeletal metastases.

        "Healthcare Experiences of Transgender People of Color. BACKGROUND: Transgender people and racial/ethnic minorities separately report poor healthcare experiences. However, little is known about the healthcare experiences of transgender people of color (TPOC), who are both transgender and racial/ethnic minorities. OBJECTIVE: To investigate how TPOC healthcare experiences are shaped by both race/ethnicity and gender identity. DESIGN AND PARTICIPANTS: Semi-structured, in-depth individual interviews (n\u2009=\u200922) and focus groups (2; n\u2009=\u200917 total); all taken from a sample of TPOC from the Chicago area. All participants completed a quantitative survey (n\u2009=\u200939). APPROACH: Interviews and focus groups covered healthcare experiences, and how these were shaped by gender identity and/or race/ethnicity. The interviews and focus groups were audio recorded, transcribed verbatim, and imported into HyperRESEARCH software. At least two reviewers independently coded each transcript using a codebook of themes created following grounded theory methodology. The quantitative survey data captured participants' demographics and past healthcare experiences, and were analyzed with descriptive statistics. KEY RESULTS: All participants described healthcare experiences where providers responded negatively to their race/ethnicity and/or gender identity. A majority of participants believed they would be treated better if they were cisgender or white. Participants commonly cited providers' assumptions about TPOC as a pivotal factor in negative experiences. A majority of participants sought out healthcare locations designated as lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT)-friendly in an effort to avoid discrimination, but feared experiencing racism there. A minority of participants expressed a preference for providers of color; but a few reported reluctance to reveal their gender identity to providers of their own race due to fear of transphobia. When describing positive healthcare experiences, participants were most likely to highlight providers' respect for their gender identity. CONCLUSIONS: TPOC have different experiences compared with white transgender or cisgender racial/ethnic minorities. Providers must improve understanding of intersectional experiences of TPOC to improve quality of care. ",
        "Pseudogene Associated Recurrent Gene Fusion in Prostate Cancer. We present the functional characterization of a pseudogene associated recurrent gene fusion in prostate cancer. The fusion gene KLK4-KLKP1 is formed by the fusion of the protein coding gene KLK4 with the noncoding pseudogene KLKP1. Screening of a cohort of 659 patients (380 Caucasian American; 250 African American, and 29 patients from other races) revealed that the KLK4-KLKP1 is expressed in about 32% of prostate cancer patients. Correlative analysis with other ETS gene fusions and SPINK1 revealed a concomitant expression pattern of KLK4-KLKP1 with ERG and a mutually exclusive expression pattern with SPINK1, ETV1, ETV4, and ETV5. Development of an antibody specific to KLK4-KLKP1 fusion protein confirmed the expression of the full-length KLK4-KLKP1 protein in prostate tissues. The in vitro and in vivo functional assays to study the oncogenic properties of KLK4-KLKP1 confirmed its role in cell proliferation, cell invasion, intravasation, and tumor formation. Presence of strong ERG and AR binding sites located at the fusion junction in KLK4-KLKP1 suggests that the fusion gene is regulated by ERG and AR. Correlative analysis of clinical data showed an association of KLK4-KLKP1 with lower preoperative PSA values and in young men (<50\u202fyears) with prostate cancer. Screening of patient urine samples showed that KLK4-KLKP1 can be detected noninvasively in urine. Taken together, we present KLK4-KLKP1 as a class of pseudogene associated fusion transcript in cancer with potential applications as a biomarker for routine screening of prostate cancer. ",
        "SerpinB1 controls encephalitogenic T helper cells in neuroinflammation. SerpinB1, a protease inhibitor and neutrophil survival factor, was recently linked with IL-17-expressing T cells. Here, we show that serpinB1 (Sb1) is dramatically induced in a subset of effector CD4 cells in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Despite normal T cell priming, Sb1-/- mice are resistant to EAE with a paucity of T helper (TH) cells that produce two or more of the cytokines, IFN\u03b3, GM-CSF, and IL-17. These multiple cytokine-producing CD4 cells proliferate extremely rapidly; highly express the cytolytic granule proteins perforin-A, granzyme C (GzmC), and GzmA and surface receptors IL-23R, IL-7R\u03b1, and IL-1R1; and can be identified by the surface marker CXCR6. In Sb1-/- mice, CXCR6+ TH cells are generated but fail to expand due to enhanced granule protease-mediated mitochondrial damage leading to suicidal cell death. Finally, anti-CXCR6 antibody treatment, like Sb1 deletion, dramatically reverts EAE, strongly indicating that the CXCR6+ T cells are the drivers of encephalitis. ",

        "Cryo-EM structure of the ClpXP protein degradation machinery. The ClpXP machinery is a two-component protease complex that performs targeted protein degradation in bacteria and mitochondria. The complex consists of the AAA+ chaperone ClpX and the peptidase ClpP. The hexameric ClpX utilizes the energy of ATP binding and hydrolysis to engage, unfold and translocate substrates into the catalytic chamber of tetradecameric ClpP, where they are degraded. Formation of the complex involves a symmetry mismatch, because hexameric AAA+ rings bind axially to the opposing stacked heptameric rings of the tetradecameric ClpP. Here we present the cryo-EM structure of ClpXP from Listeria monocytogenes. We unravel the heptamer-hexamer binding interface and provide novel insight into the ClpX-ClpP cross-talk and activation mechanism. Comparison with available crystal structures of ClpP and ClpX in different states allows us to understand important aspects of the complex mode of action of ClpXP and provides a structural framework for future pharmacological applications.

        "Reduction in Mental Health Treatment Utilization Among Transgender Individuals After Gender-Affirming Surgeries: A Total Population Study. OBJECTIVE: Despite professional recommendations to consider gender-affirming hormone and surgical interventions for transgender individuals experiencing gender incongruence, the long-term effect of such interventions on mental health is largely unknown. The aim of this study was to ascertain the prevalence of mood and anxiety disorder health care visits and antidepressant and anxiolytic prescriptions in 2015 as a function of gender incongruence diagnosis and gender-affirming hormone and surgical treatment in the entire Swedish population. METHODS: This study used the Swedish Total Population Register (N=9,747,324), linked to the National Patient Register and the Prescribed Drug Register. Among individuals who received a diagnosis of gender incongruence (i.e., transsexualism or gender identity disorder) between 2005 and 2015 (N=2,679), mental health treatment in 2015 was examined as a function of length of time since gender-affirming hormone and surgical treatment. Outcome measures were mood and anxiety disorder health care visits, antidepressant and anxiolytic prescriptions, and hospitalization after a suicide attempt. RESULTS: Compared with the general population, individuals with a gender incongruence diagnosis were about six times as likely to have had a mood and anxiety disorder health care visit, more than three times as likely to have received prescriptions for antidepressants and anxiolytics, and more than six times as likely to have been hospitalized after a suicide attempt. Years since initiating hormone treatment was not significantly related to likelihood of mental health treatment (adjusted odds ratio=1.01, 95% CI=0.98, 1.03). However, increased time since last gender-affirming surgery was associated with reduced mental health treatment (adjusted odds ratio=0.92, 95% CI=0.87, 0.98). CONCLUSIONS: In this first total population study of transgender individuals with a gender incongruence diagnosis, the longitudinal association between gender-affirming surgery and reduced likelihood of mental health treatment lends support to the decision to provide gender-affirming surgeries to transgender individuals who seek them.

        "Patient-Specific Identification of Atrial Flutter Vulnerability-A Computational Approach to Reveal Latent Reentry Pathways. Atypical atrial flutter (AFlut) is a reentrant arrhythmia which patients frequently develop after ablation for atrial fibrillation (AF). Indeed, substrate modifications during AF ablation can increase the likelihood to develop AFlut and it is clinically not feasible to reliably and sensitively test if a patient is vulnerable to AFlut. Here, we present a novel method based on personalized computational models to identify pathways along which AFlut can be sustained in an individual patient. We build a personalized model of atrial excitation propagation considering the anatomy as well as the spatial distribution of anisotropic conduction velocity and repolarization characteristics based on a combination of a priori knowledge on the population level and information derived from measurements performed in the individual patient. The fast marching scheme is employed to compute activation times for stimuli from all parts of the atria. Potential flutter pathways are then identified by tracing loops from wave front collision sites and constricting them using a geometric snake approach under consideration of the heterogeneous wavelength condition. In this way, all pathways along which AFlut can be sustained are identified. Flutter pathways can be instantiated by using an eikonal-diffusion phase extrapolation approach and a dynamic multifront fast marching simulation. In these dynamic simulations, the initial pattern eventually turns into the one driven by the dominant pathway, which is the only pathway that can be observed clinically. We assessed the sensitivity of the flutter pathway maps with respect to conduction velocity and its anisotropy. Moreover, we demonstrate the application of tailored models considering disease-specific repolarization properties (healthy, AF-remodeled, potassium channel mutations) as well as applicabiltiy on a clinical dataset. Finally, we tested how AFlut vulnerability of these substrates is modulated by exemplary antiarrhythmic drugs (amiodarone, dronedarone). Our novel method allows to assess the vulnerability of an individual patient to develop AFlut based on the personal anatomical, electrophysiological, and pharmacological characteristics. In contrast to clinical electrophysiological studies, our computational approach provides the means to identify all possible AFlut pathways and not just the currently dominant one. This allows to consider all relevant AFlut pathways when tailoring clinical ablation therapy in order to reduce the development and recurrence of AFlut. ",
        "Opportunities in Interventional and Diagnostic Imaging by Using High-Performance Low-Field-Strength MRI. Background Commercial low-field-strength MRI systems are generally not equipped with state-of-the-art MRI hardware, and are not suitable for demanding imaging techniques. An MRI system was developed that combines low field strength (0.55 T) with high-performance imaging technology. Purpose To evaluate applications of a high-performance low-field-strength MRI system, specifically MRI-guided cardiovascular catheterizations with metallic devices, diagnostic imaging in high-susceptibility regions, and efficient image acquisition strategies. Materials and Methods A commercial 1.5-T MRI system was modified to operate at 0.55 T while maintaining high-performance hardware, shielded gradients (45 mT/m; 200 T/m/sec), and advanced imaging methods. MRI was performed between January 2018 and April 2019. T1, T2, and T2* were measured at 0.55 T; relaxivity of exogenous contrast agents was measured; and clinical applications advantageous at low field were evaluated. Results There were 83 0.55-T MRI examinations performed in study participants (45 women; mean age, 34 years \u00b1 13). On average, T1 was 32% shorter, T2 was 26% longer, and T2* was 40% longer at 0.55 T compared with 1.5 T. Nine metallic interventional devices were found to be intrinsically safe at 0.55 T (<1\u00b0C heating) and MRI-guided right heart catheterization was performed in seven study participants with commercial metallic guidewires. Compared with 1.5 T, reduced image distortion was shown in lungs, upper airway, cranial sinuses, and intestines because of improved field homogeneity. Oxygen inhalation generated lung signal enhancement of 19% \u00b1 11 (standard deviation) at 0.55 T compared with 7.6% \u00b1 6.3 at 1.5 T (P = .02; five participants) because of the increased T1 relaxivity of oxygen (4.7e-4 mmHg-1sec-1). Efficient spiral image acquisitions were amenable to low field strength and generated increased signal-to-noise ratio compared with Cartesian acquisitions (P < .02). Representative imaging of the brain, spine, abdomen, and heart generated good image quality with this system. Conclusion This initial study suggests that high-performance low-field-strength MRI offers advantages for MRI-guided catheterizations with metal devices, MRI in high-susceptibility regions, and efficient imaging. \u00a9 RSNA, 2019 Online supplemental material is available for this article.

        "Effect of Comprehensive Care Coordination on Medicaid Expenditures Compared With Usual Care Among Children and Youth With Chronic Disease: A Randomized Clinical Trial. Importance: Medicaid spending on children and young adults with chronic disease could be decreased through care coordination programs by reducing unnecessary hospital and emergency care. Objective: To assess whether a comprehensive care coordination program reduces Medicaid expenditures by decreasing hospital and emergency department (ED) utilization. Design, Setting, and Participants: This randomized clinical trial included 6259 children and young adults with chronic disease who received public insurance through Illinois Medicaid. In April 2016, eligible youth were randomized to receive comprehensive care coordination through the Coordinated Healthcare for Complex Kids (CHECK) program (n\u2009=\u20093126) or usual care (n\u2009=\u20093119) to measure the effect of the CHECK program on Medicaid expenditures and health care utilization using a difference-in-differences (DID) approach. Data were collected from May 1, 2014, to April 30, 2017, and analyzed in May 2018. Interventions: Care coordination, mental health care, education, and social support were provided to CHECK participants and their family members. Services were tailored based on family and participant need. Main Outcomes and Measures: Mean annual Medicaid expenditures, mean annual health care utilization by category (ED and inpatient), and chronic disease type and risk level. Results: A total of 6259 participants (mean [SD] age, 11.3 [6.4] years; 2918 [46.6%] female; 2594 [41.4%] with medium and high risk) were randomized. Following the exclusion of 14 outliers, 6245 participants were analyzed. The mean (SD) annual Medicaid expenditure before the intervention was $1633 ($4006) for the intervention group and $1703 ($4466) for the usual care group, which decreased to a mean (SD) of $1341 ($3004) and $1413 ($3785), respectively, after the intervention (DID, -$1; 95% CI, -$199 to $196; P\u2009=\u2009.99). The mean (SD) inpatient utilization before the intervention was 63.0 (344.4) per 1000 person-years (PYs) for the intervention group and 69.3 (370.9) per 1000 PYs for the usual care group, which decreased to 43.5 (297.2) per 1000 PYs and 47.8 (304.9) per 1000 PYs, respectively, after the intervention (DID, 2.0; 95% CI, -17.9 to 21.8; P\u2009=\u2009.85). Among participants with asthma, those in the intervention group had a greater mean (SD) decrease in ED utilization compared with usual care, but the difference was not significant (-225.9 [65.3] vs -104.5 [80.0] visits per 1000 PY; DID, -121.5; 95% CI, -268.9 to 26.0; P\u2009=\u2009.11). Similarly, enrolled participants with sickle cell disease had a smaller but not significant mean (SD) increase in ED utilization compared with usual care (583.3 [839.0] vs 3761.9 [4611.2] visits per 1000 PYs; DID, -3178.6; 95% CI, -10\u202f724.3 to 4367.2; P\u2009=\u2009.41). Conclusions and Relevance: Overall Medicaid expenditures and health care utilization (hospital and ED) decreased similarly for both CHECK participants and the usual care group.

        "Mast cells are critical for controlling the bacterial burden and the healing of infected wounds. Skin wound infections are a significant health problem, and antibiotic resistance is on the rise. Mast cells (MCs) have been shown to contribute to host-defense responses in certain bacterial infections, but their role in skin wound superinfection is unknown. We subjected 2 MC-deficient mouse strains to Pseudomonas aeruginosa skin wound infection and found significantly delayed wound closure in infected skin wounds. This delay was associated with impaired bacterial clearance in the absence of MCs. Engraftment of MCs restored both bacterial clearance and wound closure. Bacterial killing was dependent on IL-6 released from MCs, and engraftment with IL-6-deficient MCs failed to control wound infection. Treatment with recombinant IL-6 enhanced bacterial killing and resulted in the control of wound infection and normal wound healing in vivo. Taken together, our results demonstrate a defense mechanism for boosting host innate immune responses, namely effects of MC-derived IL-6 on antimicrobial functions of keratinocytes. ",
        "Protons versus Photons for Unresectable Hepatocellular Carcinoma: Liver Decompensation and Overall Survival. PURPOSE: Ablative radiation therapy is increasingly being used for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) resulting in excellent local control rates; however, patients without evidence of disease progression often die from liver failure. The clinical benefit of proton- over photon-based radiation therapy is unclear. We therefore sought to compare clinical outcomes of proton versus photon ablative radiation therapy in patients with unresectable HCC. METHODS AND MATERIALS: This is a single-institution retrospective study of patients treated during 2008 to 2017 with nonmetastatic, unresectable HCC not previously treated with liver-directed radiation therapy and who did not receive further liver-directed radiation therapy within 12\u00a0months after completion of index treatment. The primary outcome, overall survival (OS), was assessed using Cox regression. Secondary endpoints included incidence of non-classic radiation-induced liver disease (defined as increase in baseline Child-Pugh score by \u22652 points at 3\u00a0months posttreatment), assessed using logistic regression, and locoregional recurrence, assessed using Fine-Gray regression for competing risks. All outcomes were measured from radiation start date. RESULTS: The median follow-up was 14\u00a0months. Of 133 patients with median age 68\u00a0years and 75% male, 49 (37%) were treated with proton radiation therapy. Proton radiation therapy was associated with improved OS (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.47; P\u00a0=\u00a0.008; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.27-0.82). The median OS for proton and photon patients was 31 and 14\u00a0months, respectively, and the 24-month OS for proton and photon patients was 59.1% and 28.6%, respectively. Proton radiation therapy was also associated with a decreased risk of non-classic radiation-induced liver disease (odds ratio, 0.26; P\u00a0=\u00a0.03; 95% CI, 0.08-0.86). Development of nonclassic RILD at 3\u00a0months was associated with worse OS (adjusted hazard ratio, 3.83; P\u00a0<\u00a0.001; 95% CI, 2.12-6.92). There was no difference in locoregional recurrence, including local failure, between protons and photons. CONCLUSIONS: Proton radiation therapy was associated with improved survival, which may be driven by decreased incidence of posttreatment liver decompensation. Our findings support prospective investigations comparing proton versus photon ablative radiation therapy for HCC. ",
        "Awakening: Predicting external stimulation to force transitions between different brain states. A fundamental problem in systems neuroscience is how to force a transition from one brain state to another by external driven stimulation in, for example, wakefulness, sleep, coma, or neuropsychiatric diseases. This requires a quantitative and robust definition of a brain state, which has so far proven elusive. Here, we provide such a definition, which, together with whole-brain modeling, permits the systematic study in silico of how simulated brain stimulation can force transitions between different brain states in humans. Specifically, we use a unique neuroimaging dataset of human sleep to systematically investigate where to stimulate the brain to force an awakening of the human sleeping brain and vice versa. We show where this is possible using a definition of a brain state as an ensemble of \"metastable substates,\" each with a probabilistic stability and occurrence frequency fitted by a generative whole-brain model, fine-tuned on the basis of the effective connectivity. Given the biophysical limitations of direct electrical stimulation (DES) of microcircuits, this opens exciting possibilities for discovering stimulation targets and selecting connectivity patterns that can ensure propagation of DES-induced neural excitation, potentially making it possible to create awakenings from complex cases of brain injury.

        "Wirelessly observed therapy compared to directly observed therapy to confirm and support tuberculosis treatment adherence: A randomized controlled trial. BACKGROUND: Excellent adherence to tuberculosis (TB) treatment is critical to cure TB and avoid the emergence of resistance. Wirelessly observed therapy (WOT) is a novel patient self-management system consisting of an edible ingestion sensor (IS), external wearable patch, and paired mobile device that can detect and digitally record medication ingestions. Our study determined the accuracy of ingestion detection in clinical and home settings using WOT and subsequently compared, in a randomized control trial (RCT), confirmed daily adherence to medication in persons using WOT or directly observed therapy (DOT) during TB treatment. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We evaluated WOT in persons with active Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex disease using IS-enabled combination isoniazid 150 mg/rifampin 300 mg (IS-Rifamate). Seventy-seven participants with drug-susceptible TB in the continuation phase of treatment, prescribed daily isoniazid 300 mg and rifampin 600 mg, used IS-Rifamate. The primary endpoints of the trial were determination of the positive detection accuracy (PDA) of WOT, defined as the percentage of ingestions detected by WOT administered under direct observation, and subsequently the proportion of prescribed doses confirmed by WOT compared to DOT. Initially participants received DOT and WOT simultaneously for 2-3 weeks to allow calculation of WOT PDA, and the 95% confidence interval (CI) was estimated using the bootstrap method with 10,000 samples. Sixty-one participants subsequently participated in an RCT to compare the proportion of prescribed doses confirmed by WOT and DOT. Participants were randomized 2:1 to receive WOT or maximal in-person DOT. In the WOT arm, if ingestions were not remotely confirmed, the participant was contacted within 24 hours by text or cell phone to provide support. The number of doses confirmed was collected, and nonparametric methods were used for group and individual comparisons to estimate the proportions of confirmed doses in each randomized arm with 95% CIs. Sensitivity analyses, not prespecified in the trial registration, were also performed, removing all nonworking (weekend and public holiday) and held-dose days. Participants, recruited from San Diego (SD) and Orange County (OC) Divisions of TB Control and Refugee Health, were 43.1 (range 18-80) years old, 57% male, 42% Asian, and 39% white with 49% Hispanic ethnicity. The PDA of WOT was 99.3% (CI 98.1; 100). Intent-to-treat (ITT) analysis within the RCT showed WOT confirmed 93% versus 63% DOT (p < 0.001) of daily doses prescribed. Secondary analysis removing all nonworking days (weekends and public holidays) and held doses from each arm showed WOT confirmed 95.6% versus 92.7% (p = 0.31); WOT was non-inferior to DOT (difference 2.8% CI [-1.8%, 9.1%]). One hundred percent of participants preferred using WOT. WOT associated adverse events were <10%, consisting of minor skin rash and pruritus associated with the patch. WOT provided longitudinal digital reporting in near real time, supporting patient self-management and allowing rapid remote identification of those who needed more support to maintain adherence. This study was conducted during the continuation phase of TB treatment, limiting its generalizability to the entire TB treatment course. CONCLUSIONS: In terms of accuracy, WOT was equivalent to DOT. WOT was superior to DOT in supporting confirmed daily adherence to TB medications during the continuation phase of TB treatment and was overwhelmingly preferred by participants. WOT should be tested in high-burden TB settings, where it may substantially support low- and middle-income country (LMIC) TB programs. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01960257. ",
        "3D mapping reveals network-specific amyloid progression and subcortical susceptibility in mice. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive, neurodegenerative dementia with no cure. Prominent hypotheses suggest accumulation of beta-amyloid (A\u03b2) contributes to neurodegeneration and memory loss, however identifying brain regions with early susceptibility to A\u03b2 remains elusive. Using SWITCH to immunolabel intact brain, we created a spatiotemporal map of A\u03b2 deposition in the 5XFAD mouse. We report that subcortical memory structures show primary susceptibility to A\u03b2 and that aggregates develop in increasingly complex networks with age. The densest early A\u03b2 occurs in the mammillary body, septum, and subiculum- core regions of the Papez memory circuit. Previously, early mammillary body dysfunction in AD had not been established. We also show that A\u03b2 in the mammillary body correlates with neuronal hyper-excitability and that modulation using a pharmacogenetic approach reduces A\u03b2 deposition. Our data demonstrate large-tissue volume processing techniques can enhance biological discovery and suggest that subcortical susceptibility may underlie early brain alterations in AD. ",
        "Effect of Public Deliberation on Patient Attitudes Regarding Consent and Data Use in a Learning Health Care System for Oncology. PURPOSE: We sought to generate informed and considered opinions regarding acceptable secondary uses of deidentified health information and consent models for oncology learning health care systems. METHODS: Day-long democratic deliberation sessions included 217 patients with cancer at four geographically and sociodemographically diverse sites. Patients completed three surveys (at baseline, immediately after deliberation, and 1-month follow-up). RESULTS: Participants were 67.3% female, 21.7% black, and 6.0% Hispanic. The most notable changes in perceptions after deliberation related to use of deidentified medical-record data by insurance companies. After discussion, 72.3% of participants felt comfortable if the purpose was to make sure patients receive recommended care (v 79.5% at baseline; P = .03); 24.9% felt comfortable if the purpose was to determine eligibility for coverage or reimbursement (v 50.9% at baseline; P < .001). The most notable change about secondary research use related to believing it was important that doctors ask patients at least once whether researchers can use deidentified medical-records data for future research. The proportion endorsing high importance decreased from baseline (82.2%) to 68.7% immediately after discussion (P < .001), and remained decreased at 73.1% (P = .01) at follow-up. At follow-up, non-Hispanic whites were more likely to consider it highly important to be able to conduct medical research with deidentified electronic health records (96.8% v 87.7%; P = .01) and less likely to consider it highly important for doctors to get a patient's permission each time deidentified medical record information is used for research (23.2% v 51.6%; P < .001). CONCLUSION: This research confirms that most patients wish to be asked before deidentified medical records are used for research. Policies designed to realize the potential benefits of learning health care systems can, and should be, grounded in informed and considered public opinion. ",
        "Phage-Derived Antibacterials: Harnessing the Simplicity, Plasticity, and Diversity of Phages. Despite the successful use of antibacterials, the emergence of multidrug-resistant bacteria has become a serious threat to global healthcare. In this era of antibacterial crisis, bacteriophages (phages) are being explored as an antibacterial treatment option since they possess a number of advantages over conventional antibacterials, especially in terms of specificity and biosafety; phages specifically lyse target bacteria while not affecting normal and/or beneficial bacteria and display little or no toxicity in that they are mainly composed of proteins and nucleic acids, which consequently significantly reduces the time and cost involved in antibacterial development. However, these benefits also create potential issues regarding antibacterial spectra and host immunity; the antibacterial spectra being very narrow when compared to those of chemicals, with the phage materials making it possible to trigger host immune responses, which ultimately disarm antibacterial efficacy upon successive treatments. In addition, phages play a major role in horizontal gene transfer between bacterial populations, which poses serious concerns for the potential of disastrous consequences regarding antibiotic resistance. Fortunately, however, recent advancements in synthetic biology tools and the speedy development of phage genome resources have allowed for research on methods to circumvent the potentially disadvantageous aspects of phages. These novel developments empower research which goes far beyond traditional phage therapy approaches, opening up a new chapter for phage applications with new antibacterial platforms. Herein, we not only highlight the most recent synthetic phage engineering and phage product engineering studies, but also discuss a new proof-of-concept for phage-inspired antibacterial design based on the studies undertaken by our group.

        "Breast cancers utilize hypoxic glycogen stores via PYGB, the brain isoform of glycogen phosphorylase, to promote metastatic phenotypes. In breast cancer, tumor hypoxia has been linked to poor prognosis and increased metastasis. Hypoxia activates transcriptional programs in cancer cells that lead to increased motility and invasion, as well as various metabolic changes. One of these metabolic changes, an increase in glycogen metabolism, has been further associated with protection from reactive oxygen species damage that may lead to premature senescence. Here we report that breast cancer cells significantly increase glycogen stores in response to hypoxia. We found that knockdown of the brain isoform of an enzyme that catalyzes glycogen breakdown, glycogen phosphorylase B (PYGB), but not the liver isoform, PYGL, inhibited glycogen utilization in estrogen receptor negative and positive breast cancer cells; whereas both independently inhibited glycogen utilization in the normal-like breast epithelial cell line MCF-10A. Functionally, PYGB knockdown and the resulting inhibition of glycogen utilization resulted in significantly decreased wound-healing capability in MCF-7 cells and a decrease in invasive potential of MDA-MB-231 cells. Thus, we identify PYGB as a novel metabolic target with potential applications in the management and/or prevention of metastasis in breast cancer. ",
        "3D extracellular matrix microenvironment in bioengineered tissue models of primary pediatric and adult brain tumors. Dynamic alterations in the unique brain extracellular matrix (ECM) are involved in malignant brain tumors. Yet studies of brain ECM roles in tumor cell behavior have been difficult due to lack of access to the human brain. We present a tunable 3D bioengineered brain tissue platform by integrating microenvironmental cues of native brain-derived ECMs and live imaging to systematically evaluate patient-derived brain tumor responses. Using pediatric ependymoma and adult glioblastoma as examples, the 3D brain ECM-containing microenvironment with a balance of cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions supports distinctive phenotypes associated with tumor type-specific and ECM-dependent patterns in the tumor cells' transcriptomic and release profiles. Label-free metabolic imaging of the composite model structure identifies metabolically distinct sub-populations within a tumor type and captures extracellular lipid-containing droplets with potential implications in drug response. The versatile bioengineered 3D tumor tissue system sets the stage for mechanistic studies deciphering microenvironmental role in brain tumor progression. ",
        "Circadian rhythm-dependent and circadian rhythm-independent impacts of the molecular clock on type 3 innate lymphoid cells. Many gut functions are attuned to circadian rhythm. Intestinal group 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3s) include NKp46+ and NKp46- subsets, which are ROR\u03b3t dependent and provide mucosal defense through secretion of interleukin-22 (IL-22) and IL-17. Because ILC3s highly express some key circadian clock genes, we investigated whether ILC3s are also attuned to circadian rhythm. We noted circadian oscillations in the expression of clock and cytokine genes, such as REV-ERB\u03b1, IL-22, and IL-17, whereas acute disruption of the circadian rhythm affected cytokine secretion by ILC3s. Because of prominent and rhythmic expression of REV-ERB\u03b1 in ILC3s, we also investigated the impact of constitutive deletion of REV-ERB\u03b1, which has been previously shown to inhibit the expression of a ROR\u03b3t repressor, NFIL3, while also directly antagonizing DNA binding of ROR\u03b3t. Development of the NKp46+ ILC3 subset was markedly impaired, with reduced cell numbers, ROR\u03b3t expression, and IL-22 production in REV-ERB\u03b1-deficient mice. The NKp46- ILC3 subsets developed normally, potentially due to compensatory expression of other clock genes, but IL-17 secretion paradoxically increased, probably because ROR\u03b3t was not antagonized by REV-ERB\u03b1. We conclude that ILC3s are attuned to circadian rhythm, but clock regulator REV-ERB\u03b1 also has circadian-independent impacts on ILC3 development and functions due to its roles in the regulation of ROR\u03b3t.

        "Mitochondrial calcium exchange links metabolism with the epigenome to control cellular differentiation. Fibroblast to myofibroblast differentiation is crucial for the initial healing response but excessive myofibroblast activation leads to pathological fibrosis. Therefore, it is imperative to understand the mechanisms underlying myofibroblast formation. Here we report that mitochondrial calcium (mCa2+) signaling is a regulatory mechanism in myofibroblast differentiation and fibrosis. We demonstrate that fibrotic signaling alters gating of the mitochondrial calcium uniporter (mtCU) in a MICU1-dependent fashion to reduce mCa2+ uptake and induce coordinated changes in metabolism, i.e., increased glycolysis feeding anabolic pathways and glutaminolysis yielding increased \u03b1-ketoglutarate (\u03b1KG) bioavailability. mCa2+-dependent metabolic reprogramming leads to the activation of \u03b1KG-dependent histone demethylases, enhancing chromatin accessibility in loci specific to the myofibroblast gene program, resulting in differentiation. Our results uncover an important role for the mtCU beyond metabolic regulation and cell death and demonstrate that mCa2+ signaling regulates the epigenome to influence cellular differentiation. ",
        "Urothelial organoids originating from Cd49fhigh mouse stem cells display Notch-dependent differentiation capacity. Understanding urothelial stem cell biology and differentiation has been limited by the lack of methods for their unlimited propagation. Here, we establish mouse urothelial organoids that can be maintained uninterruptedly for\u2009>1 year. Organoid growth is dependent on EGF and Wnt activators. High CD49f/ITGA6 expression features a subpopulation of organoid-forming cells expressing basal markers. Upon differentiation, multilayered organoids undergo reduced proliferation, decreased cell layer number, urothelial program activation, and acquisition of barrier function. Pharmacological modulation of PPAR\u03b3 and EGFR promotes differentiation. RNA sequencing highlighted genesets enriched in proliferative organoids (i.e. ribosome) and transcriptional networks involved in differentiation, including expression of Wnt ligands and Notch components. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq) analysis of the organoids revealed five clusters with distinct gene expression profiles. Together, with the use of \u03b3-secretase inhibitors\u00a0and scRNA-Seq, confirms that Notch signaling is required for differentiation. Urothelial organoids provide a powerful tool to study cell regeneration and differentiation. ",
        "Human Peripheral Blood Eosinophils Express High Levels of the Purinergic Receptor P2X4. Extracellular nucleotides are important mediators of cell activation and trigger multiple responses via membrane receptors known as purinergic receptors (P2). P2X receptors are ligand-gated ion channels, activated by extracellular ATP. P2X4 is one of the most sensitive purinergic receptors, that is typically expressed by neurons, microglia, and some epithelial and endothelial cells. P2X4 mediates neuropathic pain via brain-derived neurotrophic factor and is also involved in inflammation in response to high ATP release. It is therefore involved in multiple inflammatory pathologies as well as neurodegenerative diseases. We have produced monoclonal antibodies (mAb) directed against this important human P2X4 receptor. Focusing on two mAbs, we showed that they also recognize mouse and rat P2X4. We demonstrated that these mAbs can be used in flow cytometry, immunoprecipitation, and immunohistochemistry, but not in Western blot assays, indicating that they target conformational epitopes. We also characterized the expression of P2X4 receptor on mouse and human peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL). We showed that P2X4 is expressed at the surface of several leukocyte cell types, with the highest expression level on eosinophils, making them potentially sensitive to adenosine triphosphate (ATP). P2X4 is expressed by leucocytes, in human and mouse, with a significant gender difference, males having higher surface expression levels than females. Our findings reveal that PBL express significant levels of P2X4 receptor, and suggest an important role of this receptor in leukocyte activation by ATP, particularly in P2X4high expressing eosinophils.

        "Transmission dynamics of HIV-1 subtype B strains in Indonesia. Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) represent a major public health concern in Indonesia. Although circulating recombinant form (CRF) 01_AE is a predominant subtype in Indonesia, HIV-1 subtype B (HIV-1B) is also widely prevalent. However, the viral genetic evolution, spatial origins, and patterns of transmission of HIV-1B in Indonesia remain unclear. In the present study, we described the evolutionary characteristics and spatial-temporal transmission networks of HIV-1B in Indonesia. To elucidate the epidemiological link between HIV-1B epidemics in Indonesia and those in the remainder of the world, we conducted phylogenetic analyses of HIV-1B strains in Indonesia. Based on the results obtained, at least three epidemic clades [the Indonesia, United States (US), and China clades] of HIV-1B were found to be prevalent in Indonesia. In order to identify the potential source and transmission route of Indonesian HIV-1B strains, we performed Bayesian analyses and constructed Maximum clade credibility trees of each clade. Although some HIV-1B strains in Indonesia were introduced from Thailand, the prevalent HIV-1B strains appeared to have been directly introduced from Europe or America. Indonesian HIV-1B may have spread via the main dispersal of pandemic HIV-1B strains via the US from the Caribbean region rather than being directly introduced from Africa. ",
        "DNA polymerase delta in DNA replication and genome maintenance. The eukaryotic genome is in a constant state of modification and repair. Faithful transmission of the genomic information from parent to daughter cells depends upon an extensive system of surveillance, signaling, and DNA repair, as well as accurate synthesis of DNA during replication. Often, replicative synthesis occurs over regions of DNA that have not yet been repaired, presenting further challenges to genomic stability. DNA polymerase \u03b4 (pol \u03b4) occupies a central role in all of these processes: catalyzing the accurate replication of a majority of the genome, participating in several DNA repair synthetic pathways, and contributing structurally to the accurate bypass of problematic lesions during translesion synthesis. The concerted actions of pol \u03b4 on the lagging strand, pol \u03f5 on the leading strand, associated replicative factors, and the mismatch repair (MMR) proteins results in a mutation rate of less than one misincorporation per genome per replication cycle. This low mutation rate provides a high level of protection against genetic defects during development and may prevent the initiation of malignancies in somatic cells. This review explores the role of pol \u03b4 in replication fidelity and genome maintenance. ",
        "Lifetime Drinking Trajectories and Nonfatal Acute Myocardial Infarction. BACKGROUND: The relation of lifetime drinking trajectories to coronary heart disease is not well understood. METHODS: Cases hospitalized for a nonfatal acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and healthy population-based controls matched on age and sex completed a physical examination and an interview covering known AMI risk factors and a detailed lifetime drinking history. Distinct lifetime drinking trajectories based on ounces of ethanol consumed per decade between ages 10 and 59\u00a0years were derived and characterized according to lifetime drinking patterns associated with each. Sex-specific multiple logistic regression analyses were conducted to estimate AMI risk among participants who never drank regularly compared to lifetime drinking trajectories and risk associated with distinct trajectories among former and current drinkers. RESULTS: Two lifetime drinking trajectories were derived, early peak and stable. Early peak trajectories were characterized by earlier onset of regular drinking, less frequent drinking, more drinks per drinking day, fewer total drinks, more frequent drunkenness per drinking year, and reduced alcohol intake or abstention by middle age. Never drinking regularly, reported by significantly more women than men, was associated with significantly higher AMI risk than stable lifetime drinking trajectories among men and in the sex-combined analysis of former drinkers only. Compared to stable lifetime drinking trajectories, early peak trajectories were associated with significantly higher AMI risk among male former drinkers, among sex-combined former drinkers, and among female current drinkers. CONCLUSIONS: Epidemiological studies of alcohol and health in populations over age 35 may have underestimated the impact of heavy episodic drinking during adolescence and emerging adulthood on the cardiovascular system.

        "Measurements of the self-assembly kinetics of individual viral capsids around their RNA genome. Self-assembly is widely used by biological systems to build functional nanostructures, such as the protein capsids of RNA viruses. But because assembly is a collective phenomenon involving many weakly interacting subunits and a broad range of timescales, measurements of the assembly pathways have been elusive. We use interferometric scattering microscopy to measure the assembly kinetics of individual MS2 bacteriophage capsids around MS2 RNA. By recording how many coat proteins bind to each of many individual RNA strands, we find that assembly proceeds by nucleation followed by monotonic growth. Our measurements reveal the assembly pathways in quantitative detail and also show their failure modes. We use these results to critically examine models of the assembly process. ",
        "Inactivation of chronic wasting disease prions using sodium hypochlorite. Chronic wasting disease (CWD) is a fatal prion disease that can infect deer, elk and moose. CWD has now been detected in 26 states of the USA, 3 Canadian provinces, South Korea, Norway, Sweden and Finland. CWD continues to spread from endemic areas, and new foci of infections are frequently detected. As increasing numbers of cervids become infected, the likelihood for human exposure increases. To date, no cases of CWD infection in humans have been confirmed, but experience with the BSE zoonosis in the United Kingdom suggests exposure to CWD should be minimized. Specifically, hunters, meat processors and others in contact with tissues from potentially CWD-infected cervids need a practical method to decontaminate knives, saws and other equipment. Prions are notoriously difficult to inactivate, and most effective methods require chemicals or sterilization processes that are either dangerous, caustic, expensive or not readily available. Although corrosive, sodium hypochlorite (bleach) is widely available and affordable and has been shown to inactivate prion agents including those that cause scrapie, bovine spongiform encephalopathy and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. In the current study, we confirm that bleach is an effective disinfectant for CWD prions and establish minimum times and bleach concentrations to eliminate prion seeding activity from stainless steel and infected brain homogenate solutions. We found that a five-minute treatment with a 40% dilution of household bleach was effective at inactivating CWD seeding activity from stainless-steel wires and CWD-infected brain homogenates. However, bleach was not able to inactivate CWD seeding activity from solid tissues in our studies. ",
        "New insights into the genomic landscape of meningiomas identified FGFR3 in a subset of patients with favorable prognoses. Background: With a prevalence of 170 000 adults in the US alone, meningiomas are the most common primary intracranial tumors. The management of skull base meningiomas is challenging due to their complexity and proximity to crucial nearby structures. The identification of oncogenic mutations has provided further insights into the tumorigenesis of meningioma and the possibility of targeted therapy. This study aimed to further investigate the association of mutational profiles with anatomical distribution, histological subtype, WHO grade, and recurrence in patients with meningioma. Methods: Tissue samples were collected from 71 patients diagnosed with meningioma from 2008 to 2016. A total of 51 cases were skull based. Samples were subjected to targeted sequencing using a next generation customized cancer gene panel (n = 66 genes analyzed). Results: We detected genomic alterations (GAs) in 68 tumors, averaging 1.56 \u00b1 1.07 genomic alterations (GAs) per sample. NF2 was the most frequently altered gene (36/71 cases). Interestingly, we identified a number of mutations in non-NF2 genes, including a hotspot TERTp c.-124: G > A mutation that may be related to poor prognosis and FGFR3 mutations that may represent biomarkers of a favorable prognosis as reported in other cancers. Conclusions: We demonstrate that comprehensive genomic profiling in our population can reveal a potential new prognostic biomarkers of skull base meningioma. These mutations can enhance diagnostic accuracy and clinical decision-making. Among our findings were the identification of a TERTp mutation and the first report of FGFR3 mutations that may represent biomarkers for the identification of skull base meningioma patients with a favorable prognosis.

        "Optimizing Postprandial Glucose Management in Adults With Insulin-Requiring Diabetes: Report and Recommendations. Faster-acting insulins, new noninsulin drug classes, more flexible insulin-delivery systems, and improved continuous glucose monitoring devices offer unprecedented opportunities to improve postprandial glucose (PPG) management and overall care for adults with insulin-treated diabetes. These developments led the Endocrine Society to convene a working panel of diabetes experts in December 2018 to assess the current state of PPG management, identify innovative ways to improve self-management and quality of life, and align best practices to current and emerging treatment and monitoring options. Drawing on current research and collective clinical experience, we considered the following issues for the \u223c200 million adults worldwide with type 1 and insulin-requiring type 2 diabetes: (i) the role of PPG management in reducing the risk of diabetes complications; (ii) barriers preventing effective PPG management; (iii) strategies to reduce PPG excursions and improve patient quality of life; and (iv) education and clinical tools to support endocrinologists in improving PPG management. We concluded that managing PPG to minimize or prevent diabetes-related complications will require elucidating fundamental questions about optimal ways to quantify and clinically assess the metabolic dysregulation and consequences of the abnormal postprandial state in diabetes and recommend research strategies to address these questions. We also identified practical strategies and tools that are already available to reduce barriers to effective PPG management, optimize use of new and emerging clinical tools, and improve patient self-management and quality of life.

        "The benefits of exercise in cancer patients and the criteria for exercise prescription in cardio-oncology. Cancer and cardiovascular diseases are the leading causes of death in high-income countries. Cardiovascular complications can be found in cancer patients, being the result of so-called 'cardio-toxicity'. Therefore, it becomes essential to thoroughly investigate the origin of cardiac damage and the strategy to prevent it or to reverse the negative remodelling associated with cardiotoxicity. In this review the beneficial effects of physical exercise in cancer patients were analysed, particularly to prevent cardio-toxicity before its clinical manifestation. According to the relevance of exercise, we suggest strategies for exercise prescription with a tailored approach in these patients. In conclusion, physical exercise seems to be a promising and effective treatment for cancer patients during and after therapy and seems to counteract the negative effects induced by drugs on the cardiovascular system. Exercise prescription should be tailored according to patient's individual characteristics, to the drugs administered, to the personal history, and to his/her response to exercise, taking into account that different types of training can be prescribed according also to the patient's choice. A cardiological evaluation including exercise testing is essential for an appropriate prescription of exercise in these patients. ",
        "Implantable hyaluronic acid-deferoxamine conjugate prevents nonunions through stimulation of neovascularization. Approximately 6.3 million fractures occur in the U.S. annually, with 5-10% resulting in debilitating nonunions. A major limitation to achieving successful bony union is impaired neovascularization. To augment fracture healing, we designed an implantable drug delivery technology containing the angiogenic stimulant, deferoxamine (DFO). DFO activates new blood vessel formation through iron chelation and upregulation of the HIF-1\u03b1 pathway. However, due to its short half-life and rapid clearance, maintaining DFO at the callus site during peak fracture angiogenesis has remained challenging. To overcome these limitations, we composed an implantable formulation of DFO conjugated to hyaluronic acid (HA). This compound immobilizes DFO within the fracture callus throughout the angiogenic window, making it a high-capacity iron sponge that amplifies blood vessel formation and prevents nonunions. We investigated implanted HA-DFO's capacity to facilitate fracture healing in the irradiated rat mandible, a model whereby nonunions routinely develop secondary to obliteration of vascularity. HA-DFO implantation significantly improved radiomorphometrics and metrics of biomechanical strength. In addition, HA-DFO treated mandibles exhibited a remarkable 91% bone union rate, representing a 3.5-fold improvement over non-treated/irradiated controls (20% bone union rate). Collectively, our work proposes a unique methodology for the targeted delivery of DFO to fracture sites in order to facilitate neovascularization. If these findings are successfully translated into clinical practice, millions of patients will benefit from the prevention of nonunions. ",
        "A Catalytic Trisulfide in Human Sulfide Quinone Oxidoreductase Catalyzes Coenzyme A Persulfide Synthesis and Inhibits Butyrate Oxidation. Mitochondrial sulfide quinone oxidoreductase (SQR) catalyzes the oxidation of H2S to glutathione persulfide with concomitant reduction of CoQ10. We report herein that the promiscuous activity of human SQR supported the conversion of CoA to CoA-SSH (CoA-persulfide), a potent inhibitor of butyryl-CoA dehydrogenase, and revealed a molecular link between sulfide and butyrate metabolism, which are known to interact. Three different CoQ1-bound crystal structures furnished insights into how diverse substrates access human SQR, and provided snapshots of the reaction coordinate. Unexpectedly, the active site cysteines in SQR are configured in a bridging trisulfide at the start and end of the catalytic cycle, and the presence of sulfane sulfur was confirmed biochemically. Importantly, our study leads to a mechanistic proposal for human SQR in which sulfide addition to the trisulfide cofactor eliminates 201Cys-SSH, forming an intense charge-transfer complex with flavin adenine dinucleotide, and 379Cys-SSH, which transfers sulfur to an external acceptor.

        "Dynorphin-based \"release on demand\" gene therapy for drug-resistant temporal lobe epilepsy. Focal epilepsy represents one of the most common chronic CNS diseases. The high incidence of drug resistance, devastating comorbidities, and insufficient responsiveness to surgery pose unmet medical challenges. In the quest of novel, disease-modifying treatment strategies of neuropeptides represent promising candidates. Here, we provide the \"proof of concept\" that gene therapy by adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector transduction of preprodynorphin into the epileptogenic focus of well-accepted mouse and rat models for temporal lobe epilepsy leads to suppression of seizures over months. The debilitating long-term decline of spatial learning and memory is prevented. In human hippocampal slices obtained from epilepsy surgery, dynorphins suppressed seizure-like activity, suggestive of a high potential for clinical translation. AAV-delivered preprodynorphin expression is focally and neuronally restricted and release is dependent on high-frequency stimulation, as it occurs at the onset of seizures. The novel format of \"release on demand\" dynorphin delivery is viewed as a key to prevent habituation and to minimize the risk of adverse effects, leading to long-term suppression of seizures and of their devastating sequel.

        "The CXCL5/CXCR2 axis is sufficient to promote breast cancer colonization during bone metastasis. Bone is one of the most common sites for metastasis across cancers. Cancer cells that travel through the vasculature and invade new tissues can remain in a non-proliferative dormant state for years before colonizing the metastatic site. Switching from dormancy to colonization is the rate-limiting step of bone metastasis. Here we develop an ex vivo co-culture method to grow cancer cells in mouse bones to assess cancer cell proliferation using healthy or cancer-primed bones. Profiling soluble factors from conditioned media identifies the chemokine CXCL5 as a candidate to induce metastatic colonization. Additional studies using CXCL5 recombinant protein suggest that CXCL5 is sufficient to promote breast cancer cell proliferation and colonization in bone, while inhibition of its receptor CXCR2 with an antagonist blocks proliferation of metastatic cancer cells. This study suggests that CXCL5 and CXCR2 inhibitors may have efficacy in treating metastatic bone tumors dependent on the CXCL5/CXCR2 axis. ",
        "House dust mites activate nociceptor-mast cell clusters to drive type 2 skin inflammation. Allergic skin diseases, such as atopic dermatitis, are clinically characterized by severe itching and type\u20092 immunity-associated hypersensitivity to widely distributed allergens, including those derived from house dust mites (HDMs). Here we found that HDMs with cysteine protease activity directly activated peptidergic nociceptors, which are neuropeptide-producing nociceptive sensory neurons that express the ion channel TRPV1 and Tac1, the gene encoding the precursor for the neuropeptide substance\u2009P. Intravital imaging and genetic approaches indicated that HDM-activated nociceptors drive the development of allergic skin inflammation by inducing the degranulation of mast cells contiguous to such nociceptors, through the release of substance P and the activation of the cationic molecule receptor MRGPRB2 on mast cells. These data indicate that, after exposure to HDM allergens, activation of TRPV1+Tac1+ nociceptor-MRGPRB2+ mast cell sensory clusters represents a key early event in the development of allergic skin reactions.

        "Extended Temporal Association Memory by Modulations of Inhibitory Circuits. Hebbian learning of excitatory synapses plays a central role in storing activity patterns in associative memory models. Interstimulus Hebbian learning associates multiple items by converting temporal correlation to spatial correlation between attractors. Growing evidence suggests the importance of inhibitory plasticity in memory processing, but the consequence of such regulation in associative memory has not been understood. Noting that Hebbian learning of inhibitory synapses yields an anti-Hebbian effect, we show that the combination of Hebbian and anti-Hebbian learning can significantly increase the span of temporal association between correlated attractors as well as the sensitivity of these states to external input. Furthermore, these effects are regulated by changing the ratio of local and global recurrent inhibition after learning weights for excitation-inhibition balance. Our results suggest a nontrivial role of plasticity and modulation of inhibitory circuits in associative memory. ",
        "Health-related quality of life in oncology drug reimbursement submissions in Canada: A review of submissions to the pan-Canadian Oncology Drug Review. BACKGROUND: In Canada, the Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health (CADTH) evaluates and makes recommendations for the reimbursement of cancer drugs. One component of its recommendation is based on an economic evaluation, which typically takes the form of a cost-utility analysis. A cost-utility analysis measures the effects of competing therapies with quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). The data for this calculation typically come from generic, preference-based measures of health-related quality of life (HRQOL). The objective of this review is to determine the frequency at which HRQOL data are collected alongside cancer drug trials and used in the cost-utility analysis submitted to the\u00a0CADTH pan-Canadian Oncology Drug Review (pCODR). METHODS: Submissions between 2015 and 2018 to pCODR, the group charged with evaluating cancer drug submissions at CADTH, were reviewed. All pCODR submissions, either in progress or completed, were publicly available online. The search was restricted to completed evaluations. RESULTS: Forty-three submissions met the inclusion criteria. The incremental gain in QALYs in most submissions from the new technology was small (median incremental gain, 0.86; interquartile range, 0.6-1.39). More than half of the submissions (56%) did not include original data on HRQOL, with most relying on previous studies of variable relevance and quality. Re-analyses by pCODR based on concerns over HRQOL data used in the submitted model were common (52%). CONCLUSIONS: Drug manufacturers do not consistently collect data on HRQOL alongside clinical trials and instead rely on evidence generated in previous studies to inform cost-utility analyses. These findings should induce manufacturers to collect original HRQOL data that are simultaneously relevant to patients and decision makers. ",
        "Locally instructed CXCR4hi neutrophils trigger environment-driven allergic asthma through the release of neutrophil extracellular traps. Low exposure to microbial products, respiratory viral infections and air pollution are major risk factors for allergic asthma, yet the mechanistic links between such conditions and host susceptibility to type 2 allergic disorders remain unclear. Through the use of single-cell RNA sequencing, we characterized lung neutrophils in mice exposed to a pro-allergic low dose of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or a protective high dose of LPS before exposure to house dust mites. Unlike exposure to a high dose of LPS, exposure to a low dose of LPS instructed recruited neutrophils to upregulate their expression of the chemokine receptor CXCR4 and to release neutrophil extracellular traps. Low-dose LPS-induced neutrophils and neutrophil extracellular traps potentiated the uptake of house dust mites by CD11b+Ly-6C+ dendritic cells and type 2 allergic airway inflammation in response to house dust mites. Neutrophil extracellular traps derived from CXCR4hi neutrophils were also needed to mediate allergic asthma triggered by infection with influenza virus or exposure to ozone. Our study indicates that apparently unrelated environmental risk factors can shape recruited lung neutrophils to promote the initiation of allergic asthma. ",
        "Duration of American Football Play and Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy. OBJECTIVE: Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) is a neurodegenerative disease associated with exposure to contact and collision sports, including American football. We hypothesized a dose-response relationship between duration of football played and CTE risk and severity. METHODS: In a convenience sample of 266 deceased American football players from the Veterans Affairs-Boston University-Concussion Legacy Foundation and Framingham Heart Study Brain Banks, we estimated the association of years of football played with CTE pathological status and severity. We evaluated the ability of years played to classify CTE status using receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. Simulation analyses quantified conditions that might lead to selection bias. RESULTS: In total, 223 of 266 participants met neuropathological diagnostic criteria for CTE. More years of football played were associated with having CTE (odds ratio [OR] = 1.30 per year played, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.19-1.41; p =\u20093.8\u2009\u00d7\u200910-9 ) and with CTE severity (severe vs mild; OR = 1.14 per year played, 95% CI = 1.07-1.22; p =\u20093.1\u2009\u00d7\u200910-4 ). Participants with CTE were 1/10th as likely to have played <4.5\u2009years (negative likelihood ratio [LR] = 0.102, 95% CI = 0.100-0.105) and were 10 times as likely to have played >14.5\u2009years (positive LR = 10.2, 95% CI = 9.8-10.7) compared with participants without CTE. Sensitivity and specificity were maximized at 11\u2009years played. Simulation demonstrated that years played remained adversely associated with CTE status when years played and CTE status were both related to brain bank selection across widely ranging scenarios. INTERPRETATION: The odds of CTE double every 2.6\u2009years of football played. After accounting for brain bank selection, the magnitude of the relationship between years played and CTE status remained consistent. ANN NEUROL 2020;87:116-131. ",
        "Normalizing Plasma Renin Activity in Experimental Dilated Cardiomyopathy: Effects on Edema, Cachexia, and Survival. Heart failure (HF) patients frequently have elevated plasma renin activity. We examined the significance of elevated plasma renin activity in a translationally-relevant model of dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), which replicates the progressive stages (A-D) of human HF. Female mice with DCM and elevated plasma renin activity concentrations were treated with a direct renin inhibitor (aliskiren) in a randomized, blinded fashion beginning at Stage B HF. By comparison to controls, aliskiren treatment normalized pathologically elevated plasma renin activity (p < 0.001) and neprilysin levels (p < 0.001), but did not significantly alter pathological changes in plasma aldosterone, angiotensin II, atrial natriuretic peptide, or corin levels. Aliskiren improved cardiac systolic function (ejection fraction, p < 0.05; cardiac output, p < 0.01) and significantly reduced the longitudinal development of edema (extracellular water, p < 0.0001), retarding the transition from Stage B to Stage C HF. The normalization of elevated plasma renin activity reduced the loss of body fat and lean mass (cachexia/sarcopenia), p < 0.001) and prolonged survival (p < 0.05). In summary, the normalization of plasma renin activity retards the progression of experimental HF by improving cardiac systolic function, reducing the development of systemic edema, cachexia/sarcopenia, and mortality. These data suggest that targeting pathologically elevated plasma renin activity may be beneficial in appropriately selected HF patients. ",
        "Relation between 20-year income volatility and brain health in midlife: The CARDIA study. OBJECTIVE: Income volatility presents a growing public health threat. To our knowledge, no previous study examined the relationship among income volatility, cognitive function, and brain integrity. METHODS: We studied 3,287 participants aged 23-35 years in 1990 from the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults prospective cohort study. Income volatility data were created using income data collected from 1990 to 2010 and defined as SD of percent change in income and number of income drops \u226525% (categorized as 0, 1, or 2+). In 2010, cognitive tests (n = 3,287) and brain scans (n = 716) were obtained. RESULTS: After covariate adjustment, higher income volatility was associated with worse performance on processing speed (\u03b2 = -1.09, 95% confidence interval [CI] -1.73 to -0.44) and executive functioning (\u03b2 = 2.53, 95% CI 0.60-4.50) but not on verbal memory (\u03b2 = -0.02, 95% CI -0.16 to 0.11). Similarly, additional income drops were associated with worse performance on processing speed and executive functioning. Higher income volatility and more income drops were also associated with worse microstructural integrity of total brain and total white matter. All findings were similar when restricted to those with high education, suggesting reverse causation may not explain these findings. CONCLUSION: Income volatility over a 20-year period of formative earning years was associated with worse cognitive function and brain integrity in midlife. ",
        "Neighbor predation linked to natural competence fosters the transfer of large genomic regions in Vibrio cholerae. Natural competence for transformation is a primary mode of horizontal gene transfer. Competent bacteria are able to absorb free DNA from their surroundings and exchange this DNA against pieces of their own genome when sufficiently homologous. However, the prevalence of non-degraded DNA with sufficient coding capacity is not well understood. In this context, we previously showed that naturally competent Vibrio cholerae use their type VI secretion system (T6SS) to actively acquire DNA from non-kin neighbors. Here, we explored the conditions of the DNA released through T6SS-mediated killing versus passive cell lysis and the extent of the transfers that occur due to these conditions. We show that competent V. cholerae acquire DNA fragments with a length exceeding 150 kbp in a T6SS-dependent manner. Collectively, our data support the notion that the environmental lifestyle of V. cholerae fosters the exchange of genetic material with sufficient coding capacity to significantly accelerate bacterial evolution.

        "Longer collagen fibers trigger multicellular streaming on soft substrates via enhanced forces and cell-cell cooperation. Grouped cells often leave large cell colonies in the form of narrow multicellular streams. However, it remains unknown how collective cell streaming exploits specific matrix properties, like stiffness and fiber length. It is also unclear how cellular forces, cell-cell adhesion and velocities are coordinated within streams. To independently tune stiffness and collagen fiber length, we developed new hydrogels and discovered invasion-like streaming of normal epithelial cells on soft substrates coated with long collagen fibers. Here, streams arise owing to a surge in cell velocities, forces, YAP activity and expression of mesenchymal marker proteins in regions of high-stress anisotropy. Coordinated velocities and symmetric distribution of tensile and compressive stresses support persistent stream growth. Stiff matrices diminish cell-cell adhesions, disrupt front-rear velocity coordination and do not promote sustained fiber-dependent streaming. Rac inhibition reduces cell elongation and cell-cell cooperation, resulting in a complete loss of streaming in all matrix conditions. Our results reveal a stiffness-modulated effect of collagen fiber length on collective cell streaming and unveil a biophysical mechanism of streaming governed by a delicate balance of enhanced forces, monolayer cohesion and cell-cell cooperation.This article has an associated First Person interview with the first authors of the paper.

        "Design and testing of microbubble-based MRI contrast agents for gastric pressure measurement. PURPOSE: This work demonstrates specifically tailored microbubble-based preparations and their suitability as MRI contrast agents for ingestion and measuring temporal and spatial pressure variation in the human stomach. METHODS: Enhanced alginate spheres were prepared by incorporating gas-filled microbubbles into sodium alginate solution followed by the polymerization of the mixture in an aqueous calcium lactate solution. The microbubbles were prepared with a phospholipid shell and perfluorocarbon gas filling, using a mechanical cavitational agitation regime. The NMR signal changes to externally applied pressure and coming from the enhanced alginate spheres were acquired and compared with that of alginate spheres without microbubbles. In vivo investigations were also carried out on healthy volunteers to measure the pressure variation in the stomach. RESULTS: The MR signal changes in the contrast agent exhibits a linear sensitivity of approximately 40% per bar, as opposed to no measurable signal change seen in the control gas-free spheres. This novel contrast agent also demonstrates an excellent stability in simulated gastric conditions, including at body temperature. In vivo studies showed that the signal change exhibited in the meal within the antrum region is between 5% and 10%, but appears to come from both pressure changes and partial volume artifacts. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that alginate spheres with microbubbles can be used as an MRI contrast agent to measure pressure changes. The peristaltic movement within the stomach is seen to substantially alter the overall signal intensity of the contrast agent meal. Future work must focus on improving the contrast agent's sensitivity to pressure changes. ",
        "Leveraging transcriptional dynamics to improve BRAF inhibitor responses in melanoma. BACKGROUND: Melanoma is a heterogeneous tumour, but the impact of this heterogeneity upon therapeutic response is not well understood. METHODS: Single cell mRNA analysis was used to define the transcriptional heterogeneity of melanoma and its dynamic response to BRAF inhibitor therapy and treatment holidays. Discrete transcriptional states were defined in cell lines and melanoma patient specimens that predicted initial sensitivity to BRAF inhibition and the potential for effective re-challenge following resistance. A mathematical model was developed to maintain competition between the drug-sensitive and resistant states, which was validated in vivo. FINDINGS: Our analyses showed melanoma cell lines and patient specimens to be composed of >3 transcriptionally distinct states. The cell state composition was dynamically regulated in response to BRAF inhibitor therapy and drug holidays. Transcriptional state composition predicted for therapy response. The differences in fitness between the different transcriptional states were leveraged to develop a mathematical model that optimized therapy schedules to retain the drug sensitive population. In vivo validation demonstrated that the personalized adaptive dosing schedules outperformed continuous or fixed intermittent BRAF inhibitor schedules. INTERPRETATION: Our study provides the first evidence that transcriptional heterogeneity at the single cell level predicts for initial BRAF inhibitor sensitivity. We further demonstrate that manipulating transcriptional heterogeneity through personalized adaptive therapy schedules can delay the time to resistance. FUNDING: This work was funded by the National Institutes of Health. The funder played no role in assembly of the manuscript. ",
        "Histone H3K27 acetylation precedes active transcription during zebrafish zygotic genome activation as revealed by live-cell analysis. Histone post-translational modifications are key gene expression regulators, but their rapid dynamics during development remain difficult to capture. We applied a Fab-based live endogenous modification labeling technique to monitor the changes in histone modification levels during zygotic genome activation (ZGA) in living zebrafish embryos. Among various histone modifications, H3 Lys27 acetylation (H3K27ac) exhibited most drastic changes, accumulating in two nuclear foci in the 64- to 1k-cell-stage embryos. The elongating form of RNA polymerase II, which is phosphorylated at Ser2 in heptad repeats within the C-terminal domain (RNAP2 Ser2ph), and miR-430 transcripts were also concentrated in foci closely associated with H3K27ac. When treated with \u03b1-amanitin to inhibit transcription or JQ-1 to inhibit binding of acetyl-reader proteins, H3K27ac foci still appeared but RNAP2 Ser2ph and miR-430 morpholino were not concentrated in foci, suggesting that H3K27ac precedes active transcription during ZGA. We anticipate that the method presented here could be applied to a variety of developmental processes in any model and non-model organisms. ",
        "Maternal obesity accelerates rat offspring metabolic ageing in a sex-dependent manner. KEY POINTS: Maternal obesity predisposes to metabolic dysfunction in male and female offspring Maternal high-fat diet consumption prior to and throughout pregnancy and lactation accelerates offspring metabolic ageing in a sex-dependent manner This study provides evidence for programming-ageing interactions ABSTRACT: Human epidemiological studies show that maternal obesity (MO) shortens offspring life and health span. Life course cellular mechanisms involved in this developmental programming-ageing interaction are poorly understood. In a well-established rat MO model, female Wistar rats ate chow (controls (C)) or high energy, obesogenic diet to induce MO from weaning through pregnancy and lactation. Females were bred at postnatal day (PND) 120. Offspring (F1 ) of mothers on control diet (CF1 ) and MO diet (MOF1 ) delivered spontaneously at terms. Both CF1 and MOF1 ate C diet from weaning throughout the study. Offspring were killed at PND 36, 110, 450 and 650. We determined body and liver weights, liver and serum metabolite concentrations, hormones and oxidative stress biomarkers. Male and female CF1 body weight, total fat, adiposity index, serum leptin, insulin, insulin resistance, and liver weight, fat, triglycerides, malondialdehyde, reactive oxygen species and nitrotyrosine all rose with differing ageing trajectories. Female CF1 triglycerides were unchanged with age. Age-related increases were greater in MOF1 than CF1 in both sexes for all variables except glucose in males and females and cholesterol in males. Cholesterol fell in CF1 females but not MOF1 . Serum corticosterone levels were higher in male and female MOF1 than CF1 and declined with age. DHEA serum levels were lower in male and female MOF1 than CF1 . Liver antioxidant enzymes decreased with age (CF1 and MOF1 ). CONCLUSIONS: exposure to the developmental challenge of MO accelerates progeny ageing metabolic and endocrine profiles in a sex specific manner, providing evidence for programming-ageing interactions.

        "Maternal Prenatal Stress Is Associated With Altered Uncinate Fasciculus Microstructure in Premature Neonates. BACKGROUND: Maternal prenatal stress exposure (PNSE) increases risk for adverse psychiatric and behavioral outcomes in offspring. The biological basis for this elevated risk is poorly understood but may involve alterations to the neurodevelopmental trajectory of white matter tracts within the limbic system, particularly the uncinate fasciculus. Additionally, preterm birth is associated with both impaired white matter development and adverse developmental outcomes. In this study we hypothesized that higher maternal PNSE was associated with altered uncinate fasciculus microstructure in offspring. METHODS: In this study, 251 preterm infants (132 male, 119 female) (median gestational age\u00a0= 30.29 weeks [range, 23.57-32.86 weeks]) underwent brain magnetic resonance imaging including diffusion-weighted imaging around term-equivalent age (median\u00a0= 42.43 weeks [range, 37.86-45.71 weeks]). Measures of white matter microstructure were calculated for the uncinate fasciculus and the inferior longitudinal fasciculus, a control tract that we hypothesized was not associated with maternal PNSE. Multiple regressions were used to investigate the relationship among maternal trait anxiety scores, stressful life events, and white matter microstructure indices in the neonatal brain. RESULTS: Adjusting for gestational age at birth, postmenstrual age at scan, maternal age, socioeconomic status, sex, and number of days on parenteral nutrition, higher stressful life events scores were associated with higher axial diffusivity (\u03b2\u00a0= .177, q\u00a0= .007), radial diffusivity (\u03b2\u00a0= .133, q\u00a0= .026), and mean diffusivity (\u03b2\u00a0= .149, q\u00a0= .012) in the left uncinate fasciculus, and higher axial diffusivity (\u03b2\u00a0= .142, q\u00a0= .026) in the right uncinate fasciculus. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that PNSE is associated with altered development of specific frontolimbic pathways in preterm neonates as early as term-equivalent age. ",
        "The MedSafer Study: A Controlled Trial of an Electronic Decision Support Tool for Deprescribing in Acute Care. OBJECTIVES: Polypharmacy is common, costly, and harmful for hospitalized older adults. Scalable strategies to reduce the burden of potentially inappropriate medications (PIMs) are needed. We sought to leverage medication reconciliation in hospitalized older adults by pairing with MedSafer, an electronic decision support tool for deprescribing. DESIGN: This was a nonrandomized controlled before-and-after study. SETTING: The study took place on four internal medicine clinical teaching units. PARTICIPANTS: Subjects were aged 65\u2009years and older, had an expected prognosis of 3 or more months, and were taking five or more usual home medications. INTERVENTION: In the baseline phase, patients received usual care that was medication reconciliation. Patients in the intervention arm also had a \"deprescribing opportunity report\" generated by MedSafer and provided to their in-hospital treating team. MEASUREMENTS: The primary outcome was ascertained at the time of hospital discharge and was the proportion of patients who had one or more PIMs deprescribed. RESULTS: A total of 1066 patients were enrolled, and deprescribing opportunities were present for 873 (82%; 418 during the control and 455 during the intervention phases, respectively). The proportion of patients with one or more PIMs deprescribed at discharge increased from 46.9% in the control period to 54.7% in the intervention period with an adjusted absolute risk difference of 8.3% (2.9%-13.9%). Not all classes of drugs in the intervention arm were associated with an increase in deprescribing, and new PIM starts were equally common in both arms of the study. CONCLUSION: Using an electronic decision support tool for deprescribing, we increased the proportion of patients with one or more PIMs deprescribed at hospital discharge as compared with usual care. Although this type of intervention may help address medication overload in hospitalized patients, it also underscores the importance of powering future trials for a reduction in adverse drug events.

        "Meflin-Positive Cancer-Associated Fibroblasts Inhibit Pancreatic Carcinogenesis. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAF) constitute a major component of the tumor microenvironment. Recent observations in genetically engineered mouse models and clinical studies have suggested that there may exist at least two functionally different populations of CAFs, that is, cancer-promoting CAFs (pCAF) and cancer-restraining CAFs (rCAF). Although various pCAF markers have been identified, the identity of rCAFs remains unknown because of the lack of rCAF-specific marker(s). In this study, we found that Meflin, a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored protein that is a marker of mesenchymal stromal/stem cells and maintains their undifferentiated state, is expressed by pancreatic stellate cells that are a source of CAFs in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). In situ hybridization analysis of 71 human PDAC tissues revealed that the infiltration of Meflin-positive CAFs correlated with favorable patient outcome. Consistent herewith, Meflin deficiency led to significant tumor progression with poorly differentiated histology in a PDAC mouse model. Similarly, genetic ablation of Meflin-positive CAFs resulted in poor differentiation of tumors in a syngeneic transplantation model. Conversely, delivery of a Meflin-expressing lentivirus into the tumor stroma or overexpression of Meflin in CAFs suppressed the growth of xenograft tumors. Lineage tracing revealed that Meflin-positive cells gave rise to \u03b1-smooth muscle actin-positive CAFs that are positive or negative for Meflin, suggesting a mechanism for generating CAF heterogeneity. Meflin deficiency or low expression resulted in straightened stromal collagen fibers, which represent a signature for aggressive tumors, in mouse or human PDAC tissues, respectively. Together, the data suggest that Meflin is a marker of rCAFs that suppress PDAC progression. SIGNIFICANCE: Meflin marks and functionally contributes to a subset of cancer-associated fibroblasts that exert antitumoral effects.Graphical Abstract: http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/canres/79/20/5367/F1.large.jpg.

        "Structure of ribosome-bound azole-modified peptide phazolicin rationalizes its species-specific mode of bacterial translation inhibition. Ribosome-synthesized post-translationally modified peptides (RiPPs) represent a\u00a0rapidly expanding class of natural products with various biological activities. Linear azol(in)e-containing peptides (LAPs) comprise a subclass of RiPPs that display outstanding diversity of mechanisms of action while sharing common structural features. Here, we report the discovery of a new LAP biosynthetic gene cluster in the genome of Rhizobium Pop5, which encodes the precursor peptide and modification machinery of phazolicin (PHZ) - an extensively modified peptide exhibiting narrow-spectrum antibacterial activity against some symbiotic bacteria of leguminous plants. The cryo-EM structure of the Escherichia coli 70S-PHZ complex reveals that the drug interacts with the 23S rRNA and uL4/uL22 proteins and obstructs ribosomal exit tunnel in a way that is distinct from other compounds. We show that the uL4 loop sequence determines the species-specificity of antibiotic action. PHZ expands the known diversity of LAPs and may be used in the future as biocontrol agent for agricultural needs. ",
        "Effect of Intra-Articular Sprifermin vs Placebo on Femorotibial Joint Cartilage Thickness in Patients With Osteoarthritis: The FORWARD Randomized Clinical Trial. Importance: Sprifermin is under investigation as a disease-modifying osteoarthritis drug. Objective: To evaluate the effects of sprifermin on changes in total femorotibial joint cartilage thickness in the more symptomatic knee of patients with osteoarthritis. Design, Setting, and Participants: FORWARD (FGF-18 Osteoarthritis Randomized Trial with Administration of Repeated Doses) was a 5-year, dose-finding, multicenter randomized clinical trial conducted at 10 sites. Eligible participants were aged 40 to 85 years with symptomatic, radiographic knee osteoarthritis and Kellgren-Lawrence grade 2 or 3. Enrollment began in July 2013 and ended in May 2014; the last participant visit occurred on May 8, 2017. The primary outcome at 2 years and a follow-up analysis at 3 years are reported. Interventions: Participants were randomized to 1 of 5 groups: intra-articular injections of 100 \u03bcg of sprifermin administered every 6 months (n\u2009=\u2009110) or every 12 months (n\u2009=\u2009110), 30 \u03bcg of sprifermin every 6 months (n\u2009=\u2009111) or every 12 months (n\u2009=\u2009110), or placebo every 6 months (n\u2009=\u2009108). Each treatment consisted of weekly injections over 3 weeks. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary end point was change in total femorotibial joint cartilage thickness measured by quantitative magnetic resonance imaging at 2 years. The secondary end points (of 15 total) included 2-year change from baseline in total Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) scores. The minimal clinically important difference (MCID) is unknown for the primary outcome; for total WOMAC score in patients with hip and knee osteoarthritis, the absolute MCID is 7 U (95% CI, 4 to 10 U) and the percentage MCID is 14% (95% CI, 9% to 18%). Results: Among 549 participants (median age, 65.0 years; 379 female [69.0%]), 474 (86.3%) completed 2-year follow-up. Compared with placebo, the changes from baseline to 2 years in total femorotibial joint cartilage thickness were 0.05 mm (95% CI, 0.03 to 0.07 mm) for 100 \u03bcg of sprifermin administered every 6 months; 0.04 mm (95% CI, 0.02 to 0.06 mm) for 100 \u03bcg of sprifermin every 12 months; 0.02 mm (95% CI, -0.01 to 0.04 mm) for 30 \u03bcg of sprifermin every 6 months; and 0.01 mm (95% CI, -0.01 to 0.03 mm) for 30 \u03bcg of sprifermin every 12 months. Compared with placebo, there were no statistically significant differences in mean absolute change from baseline in total WOMAC scores for 100 \u03bcg of sprifermin administered every 6 months or every 12 months, or for 30 \u03bcg of sprifermin every 6 months or every 12 months. The most frequently reported treatment-emergent adverse event was arthralgia (placebo: n\u2009=\u200946 [43.0%]; 100 \u03bcg of sprifermin administered every 6 months: n\u2009=\u200945 [41.3%]; 100 \u03bcg of sprifermin every 12 months: n\u2009=\u200950 [45.0%]; 30 \u03bcg of sprifermin every 6 months: n\u2009=\u200940 [36.0%]; and 30 \u03bcg of sprifermin every 12 months: n\u2009=\u200948 [44.0%]). Conclusions and Relevance: Among participants with symptomatic radiographic knee osteoarthritis, the intra-articular administration of 100 \u03bcg of sprifermin every 6 or 12 months vs placebo resulted in an improvement in total femorotibial joint cartilage thickness after 2 years that was statistically significant, but of uncertain clinical importance; there was no significant difference for 30 \u03bcg of sprifermin every 6 or 12 months vs placebo. Durability of response also was uncertain. Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01919164. ",
        "Allele-specific nonstationarity in evolution of influenza A virus surface proteins. Influenza A virus (IAV) is a major public health problem and a pandemic threat. Its evolution is largely driven by diversifying positive selection so that relative fitness of different amino acid variants changes with time due to changes in herd immunity or genomic context, and novel amino acid variants attain fitness advantage. Here, we hypothesize that diversifying selection also has another manifestation: the fitness associated with a particular amino acid variant should decline with time since its origin, as the herd immunity adapts to it. By tracing the evolution of antigenic sites at IAV surface proteins, we show that an amino acid variant becomes progressively more likely to become replaced by another variant with time since its origin-a phenomenon we call \"senescence.\" Senescence is particularly pronounced at experimentally validated antigenic sites, implying that it is largely driven by host immunity. By contrast, at internal sites, existing variants become more favorable with time, probably due to arising contingent mutations at other epistatically interacting sites. Our findings reveal a previously undescribed facet of adaptive evolution and suggest approaches for prediction of evolutionary dynamics of pathogens. ",
        "Protein painting, an optimized MS-based technique, reveals functionally relevant interfaces of the PD-1/PD-L1 complex and the YAP2/ZO-1 complex. Protein-protein interactions lie at the heart of many biological processes and therefore represent promising drug targets. Despite this opportunity, identification of protein-protein interfaces remains challenging. We have previously developed a method that relies on coating protein surfaces with small-molecule dyes to discriminate between solvent-accessible protein surfaces and hidden interface regions. Dye-bound, solvent-accessible protein regions resist trypsin digestion, whereas hidden interface regions are revealed by denaturation and sequenced by MS. The small-molecule dyes bind promiscuously and with high affinity, but their binding mechanism is unknown. Here, we report on the optimization of a novel dye probe used in protein painting, Fast Blue B + naphthionic acid, and show that its affinity for proteins strongly depends on hydrophobic moieties that we call here \"hydrophobic clamps.\" We demonstrate the utility of this probe by sequencing the protein-protein interaction regions between the Hippo pathway protein Yes-associated protein 2 (YAP2) and tight junction protein 1 (TJP1 or ZO-1), uncovering interactions via the known binding domain as well as ZO-1's MAGUK domain and YAP's N-terminal proline-rich domain. Additionally, we demonstrate how residues predicted by protein painting are present exclusively in the complex interface and how these residues may guide the development of peptide inhibitors using a case study of programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) and programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 (PD-L1). Inhibitors designed around the PD-1/PD-L1 interface regions identified via protein painting effectively disrupted complex formation, with the most potent inhibitor having an IC50 of 5 \u03bcm. ",
        "A deep learning framework to predict binding preference of RNA constituents on protein surface. Protein-RNA interaction plays important roles in post-transcriptional regulation. However, the task of predicting these interactions given a protein structure is difficult. Here we show that, by leveraging a deep learning model NucleicNet, attributes such as binding preference of RNA backbone constituents and different bases can be predicted from local physicochemical characteristics of protein structure surface. On a diverse set of challenging RNA-binding proteins, including Fem-3-binding-factor 2, Argonaute 2 and Ribonuclease III, NucleicNet can accurately recover interaction modes discovered by structural biology experiments. Furthermore, we show that, without seeing any in vitro or in vivo assay data, NucleicNet can still achieve consistency with experiments, including RNAcompete, Immunoprecipitation Assay, and siRNA Knockdown Benchmark. NucleicNet can thus serve to provide quantitative fitness of RNA sequences for given binding pockets or to predict potential binding pockets and binding RNAs for previously unknown RNA binding proteins.

        "Convergence of human and Old World monkey gut microbiomes demonstrates the importance of human ecology over phylogeny. BACKGROUND: Comparative data from non-human primates provide insight into the processes that shaped the evolution of the human gut microbiome and highlight microbiome traits that differentiate humans from other primates. Here, in an effort to improve our understanding of the human microbiome, we compare gut microbiome composition and functional potential in 14 populations of humans from ten nations and 18 species of wild, non-human primates. RESULTS: Contrary to expectations from host phylogenetics, we find that human gut microbiome composition and functional potential are more similar to those of cercopithecines, a subfamily of Old World monkey, particularly baboons, than to those of African apes. Additionally, our data reveal more inter-individual variation in gut microbiome functional potential within the human species than across other primate species, suggesting that the human gut microbiome may exhibit more plasticity in response to environmental variation compared to that of other primates. CONCLUSIONS: Given similarities of ancestral human habitats and dietary strategies to those of baboons, these findings suggest that convergent ecologies shaped the gut microbiomes of both humans and cercopithecines, perhaps through environmental exposure to microbes, diet, and/or associated physiological adaptations. Increased inter-individual variation in the human microbiome may be associated with human dietary diversity or the ability of humans to inhabit novel environments. Overall, these findings show that diet, ecology, and physiological adaptations are more important than host-microbe co-diversification in shaping the human microbiome, providing a key foundation for comparative analyses of the role of the microbiome in human biology and health.

        "A Neurobehavioral Approach to Addiction: Implications for the Opioid Epidemic and the Psychology of Addiction. Two major questions about addictive behaviors need to be explained by any worthwhile neurobiological theory. First, why do people seek drugs in the first place? Second, why do some people who use drugs seem to eventually become unable to resist drug temptation and so become \"addicted\"? We will review the theories of addiction that address negative-reinforcement views of drug use (i.e., taking opioids to alleviate distress or withdrawal), positive-reinforcement views (i.e., taking drugs for euphoria), habit views (i.e., growth of automatic drug-use routines), incentive-sensitization views (i.e., growth of excessive \"wanting\" to take drugs as a result of dopamine-related sensitization), and cognitive-dysfunction views (i.e., impaired prefrontal top-down control), including those involving competing neurobehavioral decision systems (CNDS), and the role of the insula in modulating addictive drug craving. In the special case of opioids, particular attention is paid to whether their analgesic effects overlap with their reinforcing effects and whether the perceived low risk of taking legal medicinal opioids, which are often prescribed by a health professional, could play a role in the decision to use. Specifically, we will address the issue of predisposition or vulnerability to becoming addicted to drugs (i.e., the question of why some people who experiment with drugs develop an addiction, while others do not). Finally, we review attempts to develop novel therapeutic strategies and policy ideas that could help prevent opioid and other substance abuse. ",
        "Difference Between Users and Nonusers of a Patient Portal in Health Behaviors and Outcomes: Retrospective Cohort Study. BACKGROUND: Patient portals are frequently used in modern health care systems as an engagement and communication tool. An increased focus on the potential value of these communication channels to improve health outcomes is warranted. OBJECTIVE: This paper aimed to quantify the impact of portal use on patients' preventive health behavior and chronic health outcomes. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective, observational cohort study of 10,000 patients aged 50 years or older who were treated at the University of Pennsylvania Health System (UPHS) from September 1, 2014, to October 31, 2016. The data were sourced from the UPHS electronic health records. We investigated the association between patient portal use and patients' preventive health behaviors or chronic health outcomes, controlling for confounders using a novel cardinality matching approach based on propensity scoring and a subsequent bootstrapping method to estimate the variance of association estimates. RESULTS: Patient-level characteristics differed substantially between portal users, comprising approximately 59.32% (5932/10000) of the cohort, and nonusers. On average, users were more likely to be younger (63.46 years for users vs 66.08 years for nonusers), white (72.77% [4317/5932] for users vs 52.58% [2139/4068] for nonusers), have commercial insurance (60.99% [3618/5932] for users vs 40.12% [1632/4068] for nonusers), and have higher annual incomes (US $74,172/year for users vs US $62,940/year for nonusers). Even after adjusting for these potential confounders, patient portal use had a positive and clinically meaningful impact on patients' preventive health behaviors but not on chronic health outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: This paper contributes to the understanding of the impact of patient portal use on health outcomes and is the first study to identify a meaningful subgroup of patients' health behaviors that improved with portal use. These findings may encourage providers to promote portal use to improve patients' preventive health behaviors. ",
        "Rice bran supplementation modulates growth, microbiota and metabolome in weaning infants: a clinical trial in Nicaragua and Mali. Rice bran supplementation provides nutrients, prebiotics and phytochemicals that enhance gut immunity, reduce enteric pathogens and diarrhea, and warrants attention for improvement of environmental enteric dysfunction (EED) in children. EED is a subclinical condition associated with stunting due to impaired nutrient absorption. This study investigated the effects of rice bran supplementation on weight for age and length for age z-scores (WAZ, LAZ), EED stool biomarkers, as well as microbiota and metabolome signatures in weaning infants from 6 to 12 months old that reside in Nicaragua and Mali. Healthy infants were randomized to a control (no intervention) or a rice bran group that received daily supplementation with increasing doses at each month (1-5\u2009g/day). Stool microbiota were characterized using 16S rDNA amplicon sequencing. Stool metabolomes were analyzed using ultra-high-performance liquid-chromatography tandem mass-spectrometry. Statistical comparisons were completed at 6, 8, and 12 months of age. Daily consumption of rice bran was safe and feasible to support changes in LAZ from 6-8 and 8-12 months of age in Nicaragua and Mali infants when compared to control. WAZ was significantly improved only for Mali infants at 8 and 12 months. Mali and Nicaraguan infants showed major differences in the overall gut microbiota and metabolome composition and structure at baseline, and thus each country cohort demonstrated distinct microbial and metabolite profile responses to rice bran supplementation when compared to control. Rice bran is a practical dietary intervention strategy that merits development in rice-growing regions that have a high prevalence of growth stunting due to malnutrition and diarrheal diseases. Rice is grown as a staple food, and the bran is used as animal feed or wasted in many low- and middle-income countries where EED and stunting is prevalent. ",
        "Dodecyl-TPP Targets Mitochondria and Potently Eradicates Cancer Stem Cells (CSCs): Synergy With FDA-Approved Drugs and Natural Compounds (Vitamin C and Berberine). Elevated mitochondrial biogenesis and/or metabolism are distinguishing features of cancer cells, as well as Cancer Stem Cells (CSCs), which are involved in tumor initiation, metastatic dissemination, and therapy resistance. In fact, mitochondria-impairing agents can be used to hamper CSCs maintenance and propagation, toward better control of neoplastic disease. Tri-Phenyl-Phosphonium (TPP)-based mitochondrially-targeted compounds are small non-toxic and biologically active molecules that are delivered to and accumulated within the mitochondria of living cells. Therefore, TPP-derivatives may represent potentially \"powerful\" candidates to block CSCs. Here, we evaluate the metabolic and biological effects induced by the TPP-derivative, termed Dodecyl-TPP (d-TPP) on breast cancer cells. By employing the 3D mammosphere assay in MCF-7 cells, we demonstrate that treatment with d-TPP dose-dependently inhibits the propagation of breast CSCs in suspension. Also, d-TPP targets adherent \"bulk\" cancer cells, by decreasing MCF-7 cell viability. The analysis of metabolic flux using Seahorse Xfe96 revealed that d-TPP potently inhibits the mitochondrial oxygen consumption rate (OCR), while simultaneously shifting cell metabolism toward glycolysis. Thereafter, we exploited this ATP depletion phenotype and strict metabolic dependency on glycolysis to eradicate the residual glycolytic CSC population, by using additional metabolic stressors. More specifically, we applied a combination strategy based on treatment with d-TPP, in the presence of a selected panel of natural and synthetic compounds, some of which are FDA-approved, that are known to behave as glycolysis (Vitamin C, 2-Deoxy-Glucose) and OXPHOS (Doxycyline, Niclosamide, Berberine) inhibitors. This two-hit scheme effectively decreased CSC propagation, at concentrations of d-TPP toxic only for cancer cells, but not for normal cells, as evidenced using normal human fibroblasts (hTERT-BJ1) as a reference point. Taken together, d-TPP halts CSCs propagation and targets \"bulk\" cancer cells, without eliciting the relevant undesirable off-target effects in normal cells. These observations pave the way for further exploring the potential of TPP-based derivatives in cancer therapy. Moreover, TPP-based compounds should be investigated for their potential to discriminate between \"normal\" and \"malignant\" mitochondria, suggesting that distinct biochemical, and metabolic changes in these organelles could precede specific normal or pathological phenotypes. Lastly, our data validate the manipulation of the energetic machinery as useful tool to eradicate CSCs. ",

        "Quantitative analysis of T cell proteomes and environmental sensors during T cell differentiation. Quantitative mass spectrometry reveals how CD4+ and CD8+ T cells restructure proteomes in response to antigen and mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1). Analysis of copy numbers per cell of >9,000 proteins provides new understanding of T cell phenotypes, exposing the metabolic and protein synthesis machinery and environmental sensors that shape T cell fate. We reveal that lymphocyte environment sensing is controlled by immune activation, and that CD4+ and CD8+ T cells differ in their intrinsic nutrient transport and biosynthetic capacity. Our data also reveal shared and divergent outcomes of mTORC1 inhibition in na\u00efve versus effector T cells: mTORC1 inhibition impaired cell cycle progression in activated na\u00efve cells, but not effector cells, whereas metabolism was consistently impacted in both populations. This study provides a comprehensive map of na\u00efve and effector T cell proteomes, and a resource for exploring and understanding T cell phenotypes and cell context effects of mTORC1. ",
        "A randomized placebo-controlled trial to investigate the effect of lactolycopene on semen quality in healthy males. PURPOSE: Poor sperm quality is a major contributor to infertility in heterosexual couples, but at present there are few empirical therapies. Several studies have examined the role of dietary factors and data from randomized controlled trials suggest that oral antioxidant therapy can improve some sperm parameters. Health benefits of lycopene supplementation have been proposed for a variety of health conditions and here we examine whether it can help improve sperm quality. This study aimed to investigate the effect of 14\u00a0mg daily lactolycopene for 12\u00a0weeks on semen quality in healthy men. METHODS: Sixty healthy male participants were recruited and randomized to this double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel study and received either 14\u00a0mg/d lactolycopene or a placebo for 12\u00a0weeks. The primary endpoint was a change in motile sperm concentration. Secondary endpoints were all other aspects of sperm quality, including the level of sperm DNA damage. RESULTS: Fifty-six men completed the intervention and the level of plasma lycopene was significantly increased in the men randomized to receive lycopene supplementation. There was no significant change in the primary endpoint (motile sperm concentration) post-intervention (p\u2009=\u20090.058). However, the proportion of fast progressive sperm (p\u2009=\u20090.006) and sperm with normal morphology (p\u2009<\u20090.001) did improve significantly in response to lactolycopene intervention. CONCLUSIONS: Supplementation with 14\u00a0mg/d lactolycopene improves sperm motility and morphology in young healthy men.

        "Associations of Socioeconomic Deprivation and Preterm Birth With Speech, Language, and Communication Concerns Among Children Aged 27 to 30 Months. Importance: Successful acquisition of language is foundational for health and well-being across the life course and is patterned by medical and social determinants that operate in early life. Objective: To investigate the associations of neighborhood disadvantage, gestational age, and English as first language with speech, language, and communication concerns among children aged 27 to 30 months. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study used birth data from the National Health Service maternity electronic medical record linked to the Child Health Surveillance Programme for preschool children. The cohort included 28\u202f634 children in the United Kingdom (NHS Lothian, Scotland) born between January 2011 and December 2014 who were eligible for a health review at age 27 to 30 months between April 2013 and April 2016. Data analysis was conducted between January 2018 and February 2019. Exposures: The associations of neighborhood deprivation (using the Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation 2016 quintiles), gestational age, and whether English was the first language spoken in the home with preschool language function were investigated using mutually adjusted logistic regression models. Main Outcomes and Measures: Speech, language, and communication (SLC) concern ascertained at age 27 to 30 months. Results: Records of 28\u202f634 children (14\u202f695 [51.3%] boys) with a mean (SD) age of 27.7 (2.2) months were matched. After excluding records with missing data, there were 26\u202f341 records. The prevalence of SLC concern was 13.0% (3501 of 26\u202f963 children with SLC data). In fully adjusted analyses, each 1-week increase in gestational age from 23 to 36 weeks was associated with an 8.8% decrease in the odds of a child having an SLC concern reported at 27 months (odds ratio, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.90-0.93). The odds of a child for whom English is not the first language of having SLC concern at age 27 to 30 months were 2.1-fold higher than those for a child whose first language is English (OR, 2.09; 95% CI, 1.66-2.64). The odds ratio for having an SLC concern among children living in the most deprived neighborhoods, compared with the least deprived neighborhoods, was 3.15 (95% CI, 2.79-3.56). The estimated probabilities for preterm children having an SLC concern were highest for those living in the most deprived areas. Conclusions and Relevance: This study found that SLC concerns at age 27 to 30 months are common and independently associated with increasing levels of neighborhood deprivation and lower gestational age. Policies that reduce childhood deprivation could be associated with improved preschool language ability and potentially avoid propagation of disadvantage across the life course, including for children born preterm.

        "Risk and subtypes of secondary primary malignancies in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma survivors change over time based on stage at diagnosis. BACKGROUND: Previous studies have shown an increased risk of secondary primary malignancies (SPMs) after diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) treatment. Whether stage of DLBCL at diagnosis affects the subtypes of SPMs that occur has not been previously described. METHODS: The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database was queried for patients aged >18\u00a0years diagnosed with primary DLBCL from 1973 to 2010 and categorized by early stage (ES) (stage I-II) or advanced stage (AS) (stage III-IV) disease. Differences in overall and location-specific SPM incidence by stage and time since diagnosis were assessed in 5-year intervals using a Fine-Gray hazards model. Overall survival was compared using the log-rank test. A Cox proportional hazards model was used to assess differences in survival. RESULTS: In total, 26,038 patients with DLBCL were identified, including 14,724 with ES and 11,314 with AS disease. The median follow-up was 13.3\u00a0years. Overall, 13.0% of patients developed SPM, with a higher but nonsignificantly increased risk of SPM development in those who had ES disease compared with those who had AS disease (14% vs 11.6%; P\u00a0=\u00a0.14). During the first 5\u00a0years after diagnosis, patients who had ES disease had a higher risk of SPM than those who had AS disease, specifically colorectal, pancreas, breast, and prostate SPMs. During the period from 10 to 15\u00a0years after diagnosis, patients who had AS disease had a higher risk of SPM than those who had ES disease, specifically hematologic SPMs. Development of SPM was found to significantly increase the risk of death regardless of stage at diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: In this large, population-based study, distinctly different subtypes and temporal patterns of SPM development were identified based on stage of DLBCL at diagnosis. The current study merits consideration of tailored site-specific and time-specific surveillance for patients with DLBCL according to stage and time interval since diagnosis. ",
        "Suppression of Zika Virus Infection in the Brain by the Antiretroviral Drug Rilpivirine. Zika virus (ZIKV) infection is associated with microcephaly in neonates and Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome in adults. ZIKV produces a class of nonstructural (NS) regulatory proteins that play a critical role in viral transcription and replication, including NS5, which possesses RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) activity. Here we demonstrate that rilpivirine (RPV), a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) used in the treatment of HIV-1 infection, inhibits the enzymatic activity of NS5 and suppresses ZIKV infection and replication in primary human astrocytes. Similarly, other members of the NNRTI family, including etravirine and efavirenz, showed inhibitory effects on viral infection of brain cells. Site-directed mutagenesis identified 14 amino acid residues within the NS5 RdRp domain (AA265-903), which are important for the RPV interaction and the inhibition of NS5 polymerase activity. Administration of RPV to ZIKV-infected interferon-alpha/beta receptor (IFN-A/R) knockout mice improved the clinical outcome and prevented ZIKV-induced mortality. Histopathological examination of the brains from infected animals revealed that RPV reduced ZIKV RNA levels in the hippocampus, frontal cortex, thalamus, and cerebellum. Repurposing of NNRTIs, such as RPV, for the inhibition of ZIKV replication offers a possible therapeutic strategy for the prevention and treatment of ZIKV-associated disease. ",
        "Tau-Mediated Disruption of the Spliceosome Triggers Cryptic RNA Splicing and Neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's Disease. In Alzheimer's disease (AD), spliceosomal proteins with critical roles in RNA processing aberrantly aggregate and mislocalize to Tau neurofibrillary tangles. We test the hypothesis that Tau-spliceosome interactions disrupt pre-mRNA splicing in AD. In human postmortem brain with AD pathology, Tau coimmunoprecipitates with spliceosomal components. In Drosophila, pan-neuronal Tau expression triggers reductions in multiple core and U1-specific spliceosomal proteins, and genetic disruption of these factors, including SmB, U1-70K, and U1A, enhances Tau-mediated neurodegeneration. We further show that loss of function in SmB, encoding a core spliceosomal protein, causes decreased survival, progressive locomotor impairment, and neuronal loss, independent of Tau toxicity. Lastly, RNA sequencing reveals a similar profile of mRNA splicing errors in SmB mutant and Tau transgenic flies, including intron retention and non-annotated cryptic splice junctions. In human brains, we confirm cryptic splicing errors in association with neurofibrillary tangle burden. Our results implicate spliceosome disruption and the resulting transcriptome perturbation in Tau-mediated neurodegeneration in AD. ",
        "The active contribution of OPCs to neuroinflammation is mediated by LRP1. Oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) account for about 5% of total brain and spinal cord cells, giving rise to myelinating oligodendrocytes that provide electrical insulation to neurons of the CNS. OPCs have also recently been shown to regulate inflammatory responses and glial scar formation, suggesting functions that extend beyond myelination. Low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1) is a multifaceted phagocytic receptor that is highly expressed in several CNS cell types, including OPCs. Here, we have generated an oligodendroglia-specific knockout of LRP1, which presents with normal myelin development, but is associated with better outcomes in two animal models of demyelination (EAE and cuprizone). At a mechanistic level, LRP1 did not directly affect OPC differentiation into mature oligodendrocytes. Instead, animals lacking LRP1 in OPCs in the demyelinating CNS were characterized by a robust dampening of inflammation. In particular, LRP1-deficient OPCs presented with impaired antigen cross-presentation machinery, suggesting a failure to propagate the inflammatory response and thus promoting faster myelin repair and neuroprotection. Our study places OPCs as major regulators of neuroinflammation in an LRP1-dependent fashion. ",
        "The Role of a Crystallographically Unresolved Cytoplasmic Loop in Stabilizing the Bacterial Membrane Insertase YidC2. YidC, a bacterial member of the YidC/Alb3/Oxa1 insertase family, mediates membrane protein assembly and insertion. Cytoplasmic loops are known to have functional significance in membrane proteins such as YidC. Employing microsecond-level molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we show that the crystallographically unresolved C2 loop plays a crucial role in the structural dynamics of Bacillus halodurans YidC2. We have modeled the C2 loop and used all- atom MD simulations to investigate the structural dynamics of YidC2 in its apo form, both with and without the C2 loop. The C2 loop was found to stabilize the entire protein and particularly the C1 region. C2 was also found to stabilize the alpha-helical character of the C-terminal region. Interestingly, the highly polar or charged lipid head groups of the simulated membranes were found to interact with and stabilize the C2 loop. These findings demonstrate that the crystallographically unresolved loops of membrane proteins could be important for the stabilization of the protein despite the apparent lack of structure, which could be due to the absence of the relevant lipids to stabilize them in crystallographic conditions.

        "Engineering Phage Host-Range and Suppressing Bacterial Resistance through Phage Tail Fiber Mutagenesis. The rapid emergence of antibiotic-resistant infections is prompting increased interest in phage-based antimicrobials. However, acquisition of resistance by bacteria is a major issue in the successful development of phage therapies. Through natural evolution and structural modeling, we identified host-range-determining regions (HRDRs) in the T3 phage tail fiber protein and developed a high-throughput strategy to genetically engineer these regions through site-directed mutagenesis. Inspired by antibody specificity engineering, this approach generates deep functional diversity while minimizing disruptions to the overall tail fiber structure, resulting in synthetic \"phagebodies.\" We showed that mutating HRDRs yields phagebodies with altered host-ranges, and select phagebodies enable long-term suppression of bacterial growth in\u00a0vitro, by preventing resistance appearance, and are functional in\u00a0vivo using a murine model. We anticipate that this approach may facilitate the creation of next-generation antimicrobials that slow resistance development and could be extended to other viral scaffolds for a broad range of applications.

        "Circannual growth in Wisconsin children and adolescents: Identifying optimal periods of obesity prevention. BACKGROUND: Recent studies suggest kids tend to gain the most weight in summer, but schools are chastised for supporting obesogenic environments. Conclusions on circannual weight gain are hampered by infrequent body mass index (BMI) measurements, and guidance is limited on the optimal timeframe for paediatric weight interventions. OBJECTIVES: This study characterized circannual trends in BMI in Wisconsin children and adolescents and identified sociodemographic differences in excess weight gain. METHODS: An observational study was used to pool data from 2010 to 2015 to examine circannual BMI z-score trends for Marshfield Clinic patients age 3 to 17\u00a0years. Daily 0.20, 0.50, and 0.80 quantiles of BMI z-score were estimated, stratified by gender, race, and age. RESULTS: BMI z-scores increased July to September, followed by a decrease in October to December, and another increase to decrease cycle beginning in February. For adolescents, the summer increase in BMI was greater among those in the upper BMI z-score quantile relative to those in the lower quantile (+0.15\u00a0units vs +0.04\u00a0units). This pattern was opposite in children. CONCLUSIONS: BMI increased most rapidly in late summer. This growth persisted through autumn in adolescents who were larger, suggesting weight management support may be beneficial for kids who are overweight at the start of the school year. ",
        "A bit or a lot on the side? Observational study of the energy content of starters, sides and desserts in major UK restaurant chains. OBJECTIVES: Our objective was to examine the kilocalorie (kcal) content of starters, sides and desserts served in major UK restaurant chains, comparing the kcal content of these dishes in fast-food and full-service restaurants. DESIGN: Observational study. SETTING: Menu and nutritional information provided online by major UK restaurant chains. METHOD: During October to November 2018, we accessed websites of restaurant chains with 50 or more outlets in the UK. Menu items that constituted starters, sides or desserts were identified and their kcal content was extracted. Accompanying beverages were not included. We used multilevel modelling to examine whether mean kcal content of dishes differed in fast-food versus full-service restaurants. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The mean kcal content of dishes and the proportion of dishes exceeding public health recommendations for energy content in a main meal (>600 kcal). RESULTS: A total of 1009 dishes (212 starters, 318 sides and 479 desserts) from 27 restaurant chains (21 full-service, 6 fast-food) were included. The mean kcal content of eligible dishes was 488.0 (SE=15.6) for starters, 397.5 (SE=14.9) for sides and 430.6 (SE=11.5) for desserts. The percentage of dishes exceeding 600 kcal was 26.4% for starters, 21.7% for sides and 20.5% for desserts. Compared with fast-food chains, desserts offered at full-service restaurants were on average more calorific and were significantly more likely to exceed 600 kcal. CONCLUSIONS: The average energy content of sides, starters and desserts sold in major UK restaurants is high. One in four starters and one in five sides and desserts in UK chain restaurants exceed the recommended energy intake for an entire meal. ",
        "Resolving the fibrotic niche of human liver cirrhosis at single-cell level. Liver cirrhosis is a major cause of death worldwide and is characterized by extensive fibrosis. There are currently no effective antifibrotic therapies available. To obtain a better understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in disease pathogenesis and enable the discovery of therapeutic targets, here we profile the transcriptomes of more than 100,000 single human cells, yielding molecular definitions for non-parenchymal cell types that are found in healthy and cirrhotic human liver. We identify a scar-associated TREM2+CD9+ subpopulation of macrophages, which expands in liver fibrosis, differentiates from circulating monocytes and is pro-fibrogenic. We also define ACKR1+ and PLVAP+ endothelial cells that expand in cirrhosis, are topographically restricted to the fibrotic niche and enhance the transmigration of leucocytes. Multi-lineage modelling of ligand and receptor interactions between the scar-associated macrophages, endothelial cells and PDGFR\u03b1+ collagen-producing mesenchymal cells reveals intra-scar activity of several pro-fibrogenic pathways including TNFRSF12A, PDGFR and NOTCH signalling. Our work dissects unanticipated aspects of the cellular and molecular basis of human organ fibrosis at a single-cell level, and provides a conceptual framework for the discovery of rational therapeutic targets in liver cirrhosis.

        "The risk of overweight and obesity in children with autism spectrum disorders: A systematic review and meta-analysis. Multiple studies have suggested that autism spectrum disorders seem to increase the risk of overweight and obesity. We examined the pooled prevalence and relative risk of developing overweight or obesity among children with autism spectrum disorders in a systematic review and meta-analysis. We searched PubMed, Scopus, ProQuest, and Web of Science databases and subsequently screened the records to identify studies that reported prevalence of overweight and/or obesity in children with ASD and matched groups of neurotypical children. DerSimonian-Laird random-effects meta-analyses were performed to examine pooled prevalence and relative risk of obesity in children with autism spectrum disorders using the \"meta\" package in R software. Among children with autism spectrum disorders, the prevalence of obesity was 22.2%. Children with ASD had a 41.1% greater risk (P = .018) of development of obesity. Non-Caucasian race, increasing age, female sex, and living in the United States emerged as positive moderators of the association between autism spectrum disorders and prevalence of overweight or obesity. Autism spectrum disorders seem to increase the risk of childhood obesity. Increased awareness of this association may allow the implementation of early interventions to reduce obesity and prevent potential deterioration of quality-of-life in this population. ",
        "Shared Neural Phenotypes for Mood and Anxiety Disorders: A Meta-analysis of 226 Task-Related Functional Imaging Studies. Importance: Major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, and anxiety disorders are highly comorbid and have shared clinical features. It is not yet known whether their clinical overlap is reflected at the neurobiological level. Objective: To detect transdiagnostic convergence in abnormalities in task-related brain activation. Data Source: Task-related functional magnetic resonance imaging articles published in PubMed, Web of Science, and Google Scholar during the last decade comparing control individuals with patients with mood, posttraumatic stress, and anxiety disorders were examined. Study Selection: Following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses reporting guidelines, articles were selected if they reported stereotactic coordinates of whole-brain-based activation differences between adult patients and control individuals. Data Extraction and Synthesis: Coordinates of case-control differences coded by diagnosis and by cognitive domain based on the research domain criteria were analyzed using activation likelihood estimation. Main Outcomes and Measures: Identification of transdiagnostic clusters of aberrant activation and quantification of the contribution of diagnosis and cognitive domain to each cluster. Results: A total of 367 experiments (major depressive disorder, 149; bipolar disorder, 103; posttraumatic stress disorder, 55; and anxiety disorders, 60) were included comprising observations from 4507 patients and 4755 control individuals. Three right-sided clusters of hypoactivation were identified centered in the inferior prefrontal cortex/insula (volume, 2120 mm3), the inferior parietal lobule (volume, 1224 mm3), and the putamen (volume, 888 mm3); diagnostic differences were noted only in the putamen (\u03c723\u2009=\u20098.66; P\u2009=\u2009.03), where hypoactivation was more likely in bipolar disorder (percentage contribution\u2009=\u200972.17%). Tasks associated with cognitive systems made the largest contribution to each cluster (percentage contributions >29%). Clusters of hyperactivation could only be detected using a less stringent threshold. These were centered in the perigenual/dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (volume, 2208 mm3), the left amygdala/parahippocampal gyrus (volume, 2008 mm3), and the left thalamus (volume, 1904 mm3). No diagnostic differences were observed (\u03c723 <\u20093.06; P\u2009>\u2009.38), while tasks associated with negative valence systems made the largest contribution to each cluster (percentage contributions >49%). All findings were robust to the moderator effects of age, sex, and magnetic field strength of the scanner and medication. Conclusions and Relevance: In mood disorders, posttraumatic stress disorder, and anxiety disorders, the most consistent transdiagnostic abnormalities in task-related brain activity converge in regions that are primarily associated with inhibitory control and salience processing. Targeting these shared neural phenotypes could potentially mitigate the risk of affective morbidity in the general population and improve outcomes in clinical populations. ",
        "Dupilumab in adolescents with uncontrolled moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis: results from a phase IIa open-label trial and subsequent phase III open-label extension. BACKGROUND: Dupilumab (monoclonal antibody inhibiting IL-4/IL-13 signalling) is approved for use in adolescents aged \u2265 12 years with inadequately controlled moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (AD). Dupilumab significantly improved AD signs/symptoms in a 16-week, randomised, placebo-controlled phase III trial in adolescents (NCT03054428). OBJECTIVES: To characterize the pharmacokinetics of dupilumab, and long-term safety and efficacy in adolescents. METHODS: This was a global, multicentre, phase IIa, open-label, ascending-dose, sequential cohort study with a phase III open-label extension (OLE) in adolescents with moderate-to-severe AD. In the phase IIa study, patients received one dupilumab dose (2 mg kg-1 or 4 mg kg-1 ) and 8 weeks of pharmacokinetic sampling. Thereafter, patients received the same dose weekly for 4 weeks, with 8-week safety follow-up. Patients then enrolled in the OLE, continuing 2 mg kg-1 or 4 mg kg-1 dupilumab weekly. Primary end points were dupilumab concentration-time profile and incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs). Secondary outcomes included Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI). RESULTS: Forty adolescents received dupilumab in the phase IIa study; 36 enrolled in the OLE. Dupilumab showed nonlinear, target-mediated pharmacokinetics. Mean \u00b1 SD trough dupilumab concentrations in serum at week 48 (OLE) were 74 \u00b1 19 mg L-1 and 161 \u00b1 60 mg L-1 for 2 mg kg-1 and 4 mg kg-1 , respectively. Dupilumab was well tolerated over 52 weeks; the most common TEAEs were nasopharyngitis (week 52: 41% [2 mg kg-1 ], 47% [4 mg kg-1 ]) and AD exacerbation (29%, 42%). After one dupilumab dose in the phase IIa study, EASI improved from baseline to week 2 [mean \u00b1 SD reduction -34% \u00b1 20% (2 mg kg-1 ) and -51% \u00b1 29% (4 mg kg-1 )]. With continuing treatment, EASI scores improved further [week 52: -85% \u00b1 12% (2 mg kg-1 ) and -84% \u00b1 20% (4 mg kg-1 )]. CONCLUSIONS: In adolescents with moderate-to-severe AD, dupilumab's pharmacokinetic profile was similar to that in adults. These 52-week safety and efficacy data support long-term use of dupilumab in this patient population. What's already known about this topic? Adolescents with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (AD) have high unmet medical need, with significant disease burden and limited treatment options. Dupilumab (monoclonal antibody against interleukin-4 receptor \u03b1) is approved for the treatment of adolescents with moderate-to-severe AD who are inadequately responsive to standard of care (U.S.A.) or candidates for systemic therapy (European Union). A 16-week, randomized, placebo-controlled phase III trial in adolescents demonstrated significant improvements in AD signs/symptoms with an acceptable safety profile. What does this study add? These studies demonstrate the long-term safety and efficacy of dupilumab in adolescents with moderate-to-severe AD for up to 52 weeks of treatment, thus extending and reinforcing the findings from the 16-week dupilumab phase III trial. The data from these studies also support the use of dupilumab in combination with current standard of care (topical corticosteroids), which was not evaluated in the 16-week phase III monotherapy trial.

Although antiretroviral therapy (ART) is highly effective at suppressing HIV-1 replication, the virus persists as a latent reservoir in resting CD4+ T cells during therapy. This reservoir forms even when ART is initiated early after infection, but the dynamics of its formation are largely unknown. The viral reservoirs of individuals who initiate ART during chronic infection are generally larger and genetically more diverse than those of individuals who initiate therapy during acute infection, consistent with the hypothesis that the reservoir is formed continuously throughout untreated infection. To determine when viruses enter the latent reservoir, we compared sequences of replication-competent viruses from resting peripheral CD4+ T cells from nine HIV-positive women on therapy to viral sequences circulating in blood collected longitudinally before therapy. We found that, on average, 71% of the unique viruses induced from the post-therapy latent reservoir were most genetically similar to viruses replicating just before ART initiation. This proportion is far greater than would be expected if the reservoir formed continuously and was always long lived. We conclude that ART alters the host environment in a way that allows the formation or stabilization of most of the long-lived latent HIV-1 reservoir, which points to new strategies targeted at limiting the formation of the reservoir around the time of therapy initiation.

        "Change in Cardiometabolic Risk Factors Associated With Magnitude of Weight Regain 3\u00a0Years After a 1-Year Intensive Lifestyle Intervention in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: The Look AHEAD Trial. Background Weight regain after weight loss is common. The impact on cardiometabolic risk factors is not well established. Methods and Results Publicly available data were analyzed from participants of the Look AHEAD (Action for Health in Diabetes) trial with \u22653% initial weight loss (n=1561) during a 1-year intensive lifestyle intervention and with year 4 follow-up data. Participants who regained (regainers) or maintained (maintainers) weight loss were defined with 5 dichotomized cut points (0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100%) of percentage weight loss regained (weight change from years 1-4 as percentage of first year weight loss). Change in cardiometabolic risk factors after initial weight loss was compared in maintainers and regainers, after controlling for demographics, medications, and baseline and year 1 change in body mass index. The effect was assessed separately in participants with <10% and \u226510% initial weight loss, and women and men. Maintainers exhibited significant improvements to the cardiometabolic risk factors assessed compared with regainers. No weight regain cut point maximized risk difference between maintainers and regainers across risk factors or sex/initial weight loss subgroups. For many risk factors, allowing more regain as part of maintenance (increasing cut point) diminished the cardiometabolic benefit among maintainers. Conclusions Maintaining weight loss was better than regain for all risk factors. No single cut point maximized the risk difference between maintainers and regainers. Maintainers who kept off \u226575% of weight lost had the greatest benefit. These findings emphasize the importance of intervention programs focusing not only on weight loss but weight loss maintenance, given the adverse consequences of the latter.

        "Androgen-Dependent Excitability of Mouse Ventral Hippocampal Afferents to Nucleus Accumbens Underlies Sex-Specific Susceptibility to Stress. BACKGROUND: Depression affects women nearly twice as often as men, but the neurobiological underpinnings of this discrepancy are unclear. Preclinical studies in male mice suggest that activity of ventral hippocampus (vHPC) neurons projecting to the nucleus accumbens (NAc) regulates mood-related behavioral responses to stress. We sought to characterize this circuit in both sexes and to investigate its role in potential sex differences in models of depression. METHODS: We used male and female adult C57BL/6J mice in the subchronic variable stress model to precipitate female-specific reduction in sucrose preference and performed gonadectomies to test the contributions of gonadal hormones to this stress response. In addition, ex\u00a0vivo slice electrophysiology of transgenic Cre-inducible Rosa-eGFP-L10a mice in combination with retrograde viral tracing to identify circuits was used to test contributions of gonadal hormones to sex differences in vHPC afferents. Finally, we used an intersecting viral DREADD (designer receptor exclusively activated by designer drugs) strategy to manipulate vHPC-NAc excitability directly in awake behaving mice. RESULTS: We show a testosterone-dependent lower excitability in male versus female vHPC-NAc neurons and corresponding testosterone-dependent male resilience to reduced sucrose preference after subchronic variable stress. Importantly, we show that long-term DREADD stimulation of vHPC-NAc neurons causes decreased sucrose preference in male mice after subchronic variable stress, whereas DREADD inhibition of this circuit prevents this effect in female mice. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate a circuit-specific sex difference in vHPC-NAc neurons that is dependent on testosterone and causes susceptibility to stress in female mice. These data provide a substantive mechanism linking gonadal hormones to cellular excitability and anhedonia-a key feature in depressive states. ",

        "Development of high-throughput ATR-FTIR technology for rapid triage of brain cancer. Non-specific symptoms, as well as the lack of a cost-effective test to triage patients in primary care, has resulted in increased time-to-diagnosis and a poor prognosis for brain cancer patients. A rapid, cost-effective, triage test could significantly improve this patient pathway. A blood test using attenuated total reflection (ATR)-Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy for the detection of brain cancer, alongside machine learning technology, is advancing towards clinical translation. However, whilst the methodology is simple and does not require extensive sample preparation, the throughput of such an approach is limited. Here we describe the development of instrumentation for the analysis of serum that is able to differentiate cancer and control patients at a sensitivity and specificity of 93.2% and 92.8%. Furthermore, preliminary data from the first prospective clinical validation study of its kind are presented, demonstrating how this innovative technology can triage patients and allow rapid access to imaging.

        "Presynaptic Mitochondria Volume and Abundance Increase during Development of a High-Fidelity Synapse. The calyx of Held, a large glutamatergic presynaptic terminal in the auditory brainstem undergoes developmental changes to support the high action-potential firing rates required for auditory information encoding. In addition, calyx terminals are morphologically diverse, which impacts vesicle release properties and synaptic plasticity. Mitochondria influence synaptic plasticity through calcium buffering and are crucial for providing the energy required for synaptic transmission. Therefore, it has been postulated that mitochondrial levels increase during development and contribute to the morphological-functional diversity in the mature calyx. However, the developmental profile of mitochondrial volumes and subsynaptic distribution at the calyx of Held remains unclear. To provide insight on this, we developed a helper-dependent adenoviral vector that expresses the genetically encoded peroxidase marker for mitochondria, mito-APEX2, at the mouse calyx of Held. We developed protocols to detect labeled mitochondria for use with serial block face scanning electron microscopy to carry out semiautomated segmentation of mitochondria, high-throughput whole-terminal reconstruction, and presynaptic ultrastructure in mice of either sex. Subsequently, we measured mitochondrial volumes and subsynaptic distributions at the immature postnatal day (P)7 and the mature (P21) calyx. We found an increase of mitochondria volumes in terminals and axons from P7 to P21 but did not observe differences between stalk and swelling subcompartments in the mature calyx. Based on these findings, we propose that mitochondrial volumes and synaptic localization developmentally increase to support high firing rates required in the initial stages of auditory information processing.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Elucidating the developmental processes of auditory brainstem presynaptic terminals is critical to understanding auditory information encoding. Additionally, morphological-functional diversity at these terminals is proposed to enhance coding capacity. Mitochondria provide energy for synaptic transmission and can buffer calcium, impacting synaptic plasticity; however, their developmental profile to ultimately support the energetic demands of synapses following the onset of hearing remains unknown. Therefore, we created a helper-dependent adenoviral vector with the mitochondria-targeting peroxidase mito-APEX2 and expressed it at the mouse calyx of Held. Volumetric reconstructions of serial block face electron microscopy data of immature and mature labeled calyces reveal that mitochondrial volumes are increased to support high firing rates upon maturity.

        "A hybrid sub-lineage of Listeria monocytogenes comprising hypervirulent isolates. The foodborne pathogen Listeria monocytogenes (Lm) is a highly heterogeneous species and currently comprises of 4 evolutionarily distinct lineages. Here, we characterize isolates from severe ovine listeriosis outbreaks that represent a hybrid sub-lineage of the major lineage II (HSL-II) and serotype 4h. HSL-II isolates are highly virulent and exhibit higher organ colonization capacities than well-characterized hypervirulent strains of Lm in an orogastric mouse infection model. The isolates harbour both the Lm Pathogenicity Island (LIPI)-1 and a truncated LIPI-2 locus, encoding sphingomyelinase (SmcL), a virulence factor required for invasion and bacterial translocation from the gut, and other non-contiguous chromosomal segments from another pathogenic species, L. ivanovii. HSL-II isolates exhibit a unique wall teichoic acid (WTA) structure essential for resistance to antimicrobial peptides, bacterial invasion and virulence. The discovery of isolates harbouring pan-species virulence genes of the genus Listeria warrants global efforts to identify further hypervirulent lineages of Lm. ",
        "Targeting Jak/Stat pathway as a therapeutic strategy against SP/CD44+ tumorigenic cells in Akt/\u03b2-catenin-driven hepatocellular carcinoma. BACKGROUND & AIMS: Hepatic resection and liver transplantation with adjuvant chemo- and radiotherapy are the mainstay of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) treatment, but the 5-year survival rate remains poor because of frequent recurrence and intrahepatic metastasis. Only sorafenib and lenvatinib are currently approved for the first-line treatment of advanced, unresected HCC, but they yield modest survival benefits. Thus, there is a need to identify new therapeutic targets to improve current HCC treatment modalities. METHODS: The HCC tumor model was generated by hydrodynamic transfection of AKT1 and \u03b2-catenin (CTNNB1) oncogenes. Cancer cells with stemness properties were characterized following isolation using side population (SP) and CD44 surface markers by flow cytometry. The effect of Jak/Stat inhibitors was analyzed in vitro by using tumorsphere culture and in vivo using an allograft mouse model. RESULTS: Co-activation of both Wnt/\u03b2-catenin and Akt/mTOR pathways was found in 14.4% of our HCC patient cohort. More importantly, these patients showed poorer survival than those with either Wnt/\u03b2-catenin or Akt/mTOR pathway activation alone, demonstrating the clinical relevance of our study. In addition, we observed that Akt/\u03b2-catenin tumors contained a subpopulation of cells with stem/progenitor-like characteristics identified through SP analysis and expression of the cancer stem cell-like marker CD44, which may contribute to tumor self-renewal and drug resistance. Consequently, we identified small molecule inhibitors of the Jak/Stat pathway that demonstrated efficacy in mitigating tumor proliferation and formation in Akt/\u03b2-catenin-driven HCC. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, we have shown that Akt/\u03b2-catenin tumors contain a subpopulation of tumor-initiating cells with stem/progenitor-like characteristics which can be effectively targeted with inhibitors of the Jak/Stat pathway, demonstrating that inhibition of the Jak/Stat pathway could be an alternative method to overcome drug resistance and effectively treat Akt/\u03b2-catenin-driven HCC tumors. LAY SUMMARY: The prognosis for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma is poor, partly because of the lack of effective treatment options for those with more advanced disease. In this study, we identified a subpopulation of cancer cells with stem cell-like properties that were critical for tumor maintenance and growth in a mouse model of hepatocellular carcinoma. Through further experiments, we demonstrated that the Jak/Stat pathway is a promising therapeutic target in hepatocellular carcinoma. ",
        "Sex-specific norms for verbal memory tests may improve diagnostic accuracy of amnestic MCI. OBJECTIVE: To examine whether the use of sex-specific norms and cut scores to identify memory impairment improves diagnostic accuracy of amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) compared to non-sex-specific (typical) norms/cut scores given the female advantage in verbal memory. METHODS: We calculated sex-specific and typical norms/cut scores (age and education specific) for impairment on the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test in the Mayo Clinic Study of Aging. Norms/cut scores were applied to 453 women and 532 men from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. We compared sex differences in rates of aMCI (Jak/Bondi criteria) for sex-specific vs typical norms/cut scores. Using sex-specific cut scores as the true condition and typical cut scores as the predicted condition, we categorized participants as true positives (TPs), false positives (FPs), true negative (TNs), or false negative (FNs). In cross-sectional analyses within sex, we compared positivity rates of CSF hyperphosphorylated tau/\u03b2-amyloid (A\u03b2) and cortical A\u03b2 deposition ([18F]AV45 PET) and APOE \u03b54 frequency among diagnostic comparison groups. RESULTS: The frequency of aMCI was higher in men when using typical norms/cut scores. Using sex-adjusted norms/cut scores led to the identification of 10% FNs (missed aMCI cases) among women and 10% FPs among men. Biomarker analyses supported the hypothesis that sex-specific diagnostic criteria improves diagnostic accuracy. Biomarkers rates were higher in FNs vs TNs and similar in FNs and TPs. Biomarker rates were lower in FPs vs TPs and similar between FPs and TNs. CONCLUSION: Results suggest that non-sex-specific aMCI diagnostic criteria led to a 20% diagnostic error rate. Accounting for sex differences in verbal memory performance may improve aMCI classification. ",
        "Ethnic disparities in psychotic experiences explained by area-level syndemic effects. BACKGROUND: Ethnic inequalities in health outcomes are often explained by socioeconomic status and concentrated poverty. However, ethnic disparities in psychotic experiences are not completely attenuated by these factors. AIMS: We investigated whether disparities are better explained by interactions between individual risk factors and place-based clustering of disadvantage, termed a syndemic. METHOD: We performed a cross-sectional survey of 3750 UK men, aged 18-34 years, oversampling Black and minority ethnic (BME) men nationally, together with men residing in London Borough of Hackney. Participants completed questionnaires covering psychiatric symptoms, substance misuse, crime and violence, and risky sexual health behaviours. We included five psychotic experiences and a categorical measure of psychosis based on the Psychosis Screening Questionnaire. RESULTS: At national level, more Black men reported psychotic experiences but disparities disappeared following statistical adjustment for social position. However, large disparities for psychotic experiences in Hackney were not attenuated by adjustment for social factors in Black men (adjusted odds ratio, 3.24; 95% CI 2.14-4.91; P < 0.002), but were for South Asian men. A syndemic model of joint effects, adducing a four-component latent variable (psychotic experiences and anxiety, substance dependence, high-risk sexual behaviour and violence and criminality) showed synergy between components and explained persistent disparities in psychotic experiences. A further interaction confirmed area-level effects (Black ethnicity \u00d7 Hackney residence, 0.834; P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Syndemic effects result in higher rates of non-affective psychosis among BME persons in certain inner-urban settings. Further research should investigate how syndemics raise levels of psychotic experiences and related health conditions in Black men in specific places with multiple deprivations.

        "Neural and neurocognitive markers of vulnerability to gambling disorder: a study of unaffected siblings. Psychological and neurobiological markers in individuals with gambling disorder (GD) could reflect transdiagnostic vulnerability to addiction or neuroadaptive consequences of long-term gambling. Using an endophenotypic approach to identify vulnerability markers, we tested the biological relatives of cases with GD. Male participants seeking treatment for GD (n\u2009=\u200920) were compared with a male control group (n\u2009=\u200918). Biological siblings of cases with GD (n\u2009=\u200917, unrelated to the current GD group) were compared with a separate control group (n\u2009=\u200919) that overlapped partially with the GD control group. Participants completed a comprehensive assessment of clinical scales, neurocognitive functioning, and fMRI of unexpected financial reward. The GD group displayed elevated levels of self-report impulsivity and delay discounting, and increased risk-taking on the Cambridge Gamble Task. We did not observe impaired motor impulsivity on the stop-signal task. Siblings of GD showed some overlapping effects; namely, elevated impulsivity (negative urgency) and increased risk-taking on the Cambridge Gamble Task. We did not observe any differences in the neural response to win outcomes, either in the GD or sibling analysis compared with their control group. Within the GD group, activity in the thalamus and caudate correlated negatively with gambling severity. Increased impulsivity and risk-taking in GD are present in biological relatives of cases with GD, suggesting these markers may represent pre-existing vulnerability to GD. ",
        "Prenatal alcohol exposure programmes offspring disease: insulin resistance in adult males in a rat model of acute exposure. KEY POINTS: Prenatal alcohol exposure has the potential to affect fetal development and programme chronic disease in offspring. Previous preclinical models typically use high, chronic doses of alcohol throughout pregnancy to examine effects on offspring, particularly on the brain and behaviour. In this study we use a rat model of moderate, acute, prenatal alcohol exposure to determine if this can be detrimental to maintenance of glucose homeostasis in adolescent and adult offspring. Although female offspring were relatively unaffected, there was evidence of insulin resistance in 6-month-old male offspring exposed to prenatal alcohol, suggestive of a pre-diabetic state. This result suggests that even a relatively low-dose, acute exposure to alcohol during pregnancy can still programme metabolic dysfunction in a sex-specific manner. ABSTRACT: Alcohol consumption is highly prevalent amongst women of reproductive age. Given that approximately 50% of pregnancies are unplanned, alcohol has the potential to affect fetal development and programme chronic disease in offspring. We examined the effect of an acute but moderate prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) on glucose metabolism, lipid levels and dietary preference in adolescent and/or adult rat offspring. Pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats received an oral gavage of ethanol (1\u00a0g\u00a0kg-1 maternal body weight, n\u00a0=\u00a09 dams) or an equivalent volume of saline (control, n\u00a0=\u00a08 dams) at embryonic days 13.5 and 14.5. PAE resulted in a blood alcohol concentration of 0.05-0.06% 1\u00a0h post-gavage in dams. Fasting blood glucose concentration was not affected by PAE in offspring at any age, nor were blood glucose levels during a glucose tolerance test (GTT) in 6-month-old offspring (P\u00a0>\u00a00.5). However, there was evidence of insulin resistance in PAE male offspring at 6\u00a0months of age, with significantly elevated fasting plasma insulin (P\u00a0=\u00a00.001), a tendency for increased first phase insulin secretion during the GTT and impaired glucose clearance following an insulin challenge (P\u00a0=\u00a00.007). This was accompanied by modest alterations in protein kinase B (AKT) signalling in adipose tissue. PAE also resulted in reduced calorie consumption by offspring compared to controls (P\u00a0=\u00a00.04). These data suggest that a relatively low-level, acute PAE programmes metabolic dysfunction in offspring in a sex-specific manner. These results highlight that alcohol consumption during pregnancy has the potential to affect the long-term health of offspring. ",
        "A sequence symmetry analysis of the interrelationships between statins, diabetes and skin infections. AIMS: To determine statins' impact on skin infection risk in view of conflicting literature: that statins may reduce infection risk, but are also associated with diabetes mellitus, a risk factor for skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs). METHODS: Sequence symmetry analysis was performed on prescription claims (2001-2011) from the Australian Department of Veterans' Affairs to determine the interrelationships between: (i) statins and SSTIs; (ii) statins and diabetes; and (iii) diabetes and SSTIs; as well as whether statins increased the risk of SSTIs, independent of diabetes status. Chi-square tests were performed to detect differences in Index of Relative Socio-economic Advantage and Disadvantage scores of patients within each interrelationship. Prescriptions for statins, antidiabetic medication, and antistaphylococcal antibiotics were evaluated using nonidentifiable client numbers, prescription dates filled, residential electorates, and pharmaceutical codes. Adjusted sequence ratio and confidence interval were calculated at intervals of 91, 182 and 365\u00a0days for sequence symmetry analysis studies. RESULTS: Statins were associated with: (i) significant SSTI risk (adjusted sequence ratio\u00a0>\u00a01; confidence interval >1), (ii) significant diabetes risk, and (iii) diabetic patients had increased risk of SSTIs. Diabetic and nondiabetic statin users had significantly increased risks of SSTIs, while the influence from socioeconomic status was not significant for each of the 3 relationships. CONCLUSIONS: Statins are associated with increased risk of SSTIs via direct and indirect mechanisms, probably independent of diabetes or socioeconomic statuses. We believe that clinicians should be aware of the association between statins and SSTIs, and, where appropriate, monitor blood glucose levels of statin users. ",
        "Association of statin use with risk of Gleason score-specific prostate cancer: A hospital-based cohort study. BACKGROUND: Conflicting evidence suggests that statins act chemopreventively against prostate cancer (PCa). Whether the association of statin use with PCa risk is Gleason score-dependent, time-, dose-respondent is not well studied. METHODS: We conducted a cohort study at a tertiary hospital in the Southeastern US using longitudinal data of electronic medical records (EMR) from 1994 to 2016. Only cancer-free men aged >18\u00a0years at baseline with follow-up time of \u226512\u00a0months were included. Time-dependent Cox proportional hazards regression was used to estimate adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: Among 13\u00a0065 men, 2976 were diagnosed with PCa over median follow-up of 6.6\u00a0years. Statin use was associated with lower risk of both Gleason low- (score <7: aHR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.74-0.96) and high-grade PCa (score \u22657: aHR, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.42-0.69). The protective association was observed only when statins had been used for a relatively longer duration (\u226511\u00a0months) or higher dose (\u2265121 defined daily doses), and were more pronounced for PCa of higher Gleason score (<7: aHR, 0.85, 95% CI, 0.74-0.96; 7 [3\u00a0+\u00a04]: aHR, 0.62, 95% CI, 0.43-0.90; 7 [4\u00a0+\u00a03]: aHR, 0.49, 95% CI, 0.29-0.82; 8: aHR, 0.60, 95% CI, 0.37-0.96; 9-10: aHR, 0.24, 95% CI, 0.11-0.54). Lipophilic statins (aHR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.72-0.95) might be more protective than hydrophilic statins (aHR, 0.91, 95% CI, 0.63-1.33) against PCa. CONCLUSION: Statin use might be associated with reduced PCa risk only when used for a relatively longer duration, and the risk reduction was higher for PCa of higher Gleason score. ",
        "The Independent and Cumulative Effects of Sibling and Peer Bullying in Childhood on Depression, Anxiety, Suicidal Ideation, and Self-Harm in Adulthood. Sibling and peer bullying are reported as the most frequent forms of violence experienced across childhood. There is now ample evidence indicating an association between sibling and peer bullying, with those reporting sibling bullying at an increased risk of peer bullying. While there is convincing evidence of a causative association between peer bullying and a range of mental health outcomes, sibling bullying continues to receive far less attention. The aim of this study was to explore whether sibling bullying roles (non-involved, victim, bully-victim, bully) in middle childhood were independently associated with clinical diagnoses of depression and anxiety and reports of suicidal ideation and self-harm in early adulthood. We further tested whether there was a cumulative relationship between involvement in sibling and peer bullying victimization. This study was based on up to 3,881 youth from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children, a prospective birth-cohort based in the United Kingdom. Sibling and peer bullying was assessed via self-report when youth were 12 years of age, while depression, anxiety, suicidal ideation, and self-harm were assessed via self-administered computerized interviews at 24 years of age. Involvement as a sibling bully-victim was associated with clinical diagnosis of depression (OR = 1.91, 95% CI: 1.33-2.72), while sibling victims were at increased odds of both suicidal ideation (OR = 1.52; 95% CI, 1.16-1.98) as well as suicidal self-harm (OR = 2.20, 95% CI, 1.36-3.58) in early adulthood, even after accounting for concurrent peer bullying and a range of other pre-existing childhood confounders. Sibling and peer bullying were further associated in a homotypic manner. A dose-response relationship of bullying in the home and school across mental health outcomes was found. Youth victimized by both their siblings and peers displayed the highest odds of developing clinical depression, suicidal ideation, and self-harm. Children bullied at home and at school had no safe place to escape the bullying and torment. Our findings highlight the need for intervention studies tailored toward reducing sibling bullying, as these may hold large promise for alleviating a range of adverse outcomes, including the prevention of peer bullying, which may be contingent on early bullying experiences in the home environment.

        "Comparison of the Association Between Goal-Directed Planning and Self-reported Compulsivity vs Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder Diagnosis. Importance: Dimensional definitions of transdiagnostic mental health problems have been suggested as an alternative to categorical diagnoses, having the advantage of capturing heterogeneity within diagnostic categories and similarity across them and bridging more naturally psychological and neural substrates. Objective: To examine whether a self-reported compulsivity dimension has a stronger association with goal-directed and related higher-order cognitive deficits compared with a diagnosis of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Design, Setting, and Participants: In this cross-sectional study, patients with OCD and/or generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) from across the United States completed a telephone-based diagnostic interview by a trained rater, internet-based cognitive testing, and self-reported clinical assessments from October 8, 2015, to October 1, 2017. Follow-up data were collected to test for replicability. Main Outcomes and Measures: Performance was measured on a test of goal-directed planning and cognitive flexibility (Wisconsin Card Sorting Test [WCST]) and a test of abstract reasoning. Clinical variables included DSM-5 diagnosis of OCD and GAD and 3 psychiatric symptom dimensions (general distress, compulsivity, and obsessionality) derived from a factor analysis. Results: Of 285 individuals in the analysis (mean [SD] age, 32 [12] years; age range, 18-77 years; 219 [76.8%] female), 111 had OCD; 82, GAD; and 92, OCD and GAD. A diagnosis of OCD was not associated with goal-directed performance compared with GAD at baseline (\u03b2 [SE], -0.02 [0.02]; P\u2009=\u2009.18). In contrast, a compulsivity dimension was negatively associated with goal-directed performance (\u03b2 [SE], -0.05 [0.02]; P\u2009=\u2009.003). Results for abstract reasoning task and WCST mirrored this pattern; the compulsivity dimension was associated with abstract reasoning (\u03b2 [SE], 2.99 [0.63]; P\u2009<\u2009.001) and several indicators of WCST performance (eg, categories completed: \u03b2 [SE], -0.57 [0.09]; P\u2009<\u2009.001), whereas OCD diagnosis was not (abstract reasoning: \u03b2 [SE], 0.39 [0.66]; P\u2009=\u2009.56; categories completed: \u03b2 [SE], -0.09 [0.10]; P\u2009=\u2009.38). Other symptom dimensions relevant to OCD, obsessionality, and general distress had no reliable association with goal-directed performance, WCST, or abstract reasoning. Obsessionality had a positive association with requiring more trials to reach the first category on the WCST at baseline (\u03b2 [SE], 2.92 [1.39]; P\u2009=\u2009.04), and general distress was associated with impaired goal-directed performance at baseline (\u03b2 [SE],-0.04 [0.02]; P\u2009=\u2009.01). However, unlike the key results of this study, neither survived correction for multiple comparisons or was replicated at follow-up testing. Conclusions and Relevance: Deficits in goal-directed planning in OCD may be more strongly associated with a compulsivity dimension than with OCD diagnosis. This result may have implications for research assessing the association between brain mechanisms and clinical manifestations and for understanding the structure of mental illness. ",
        "111In-Pentetreotide Scintigraphy Versus 68Ga-DOTATATE PET: Impact on Krenning Scores and Effect of Tumor Burden. Eligibility for somatostatin receptor (SSTR) radionuclide therapy uses the qualitative Krenning score based on 111In-pentetreotide planar scintigraphy as was performed in the NETTER-1 trial. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of using SSTR PET-based Krenning score in comparison to 111In-pentetreotide. Methods: This was a post hoc head-to-head comparison of 68Ga-DOTATATE-based and 111In-pentetreotide-based Krenning scores in 150 patients included in a prospective phase 2 study (NCT01967537). Patients were imaged using 68Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT, 111In-pentetreotide planar scintigraphy, and SPECT/CT within 1 wk. SSTR ligand uptake was graded using the Krenning score independently by 3 readers. Results: The detection rate of SSTR-expressing disease (Krenning scores 2-4) was 23%, 38%, and 72% with planar imaging, SPECT, and SSTR PET, respectively. The Krenning score was higher with SSTR PET (2.71 \u00b1 1.74) than with planar imaging (0.75 \u00b1 1.37; P < 0.001) or SPECT (1.23 \u00b1 1.57; P < 0.001). In patients with a Krenning score of at least 3 on SSTR PET, the detection rate of planar imaging and SPECT was lower for lesions smaller than 2 cm than lesions 2 cm or larger: 15% and 24% versus 78% and 89%, respectively (P < 0.001). For lesions larger than 5 cm, Krenning scores between SSTR PET and 111In-pentetreotide were nearly equivalent. Lesion size did not have an impact on SSTR PET Krenning scores. Interreader agreement was higher for SSTR PET than for planar imaging or SPECT (0.79 vs. 0.67 and 0.50, respectively). Conclusion: SSTR PET results in higher Krenning scores than 111In-pentetreotide, particularly when lesions measured 2 cm or less. Small lesion size resulted in low Krenning scores using 111In-pentetreotide, but lesion size did not affect SSTR PET-based Krenning scores. The results of the NETTER-1 trial cannot be directly applied to patients with small lesions. Further study of peptide receptor radionuclide therapy in patients with small lesions negative on 111In-pentetreotide imaging and positive on SSTR PET is warranted. ",
        "Parent Perspectives on Sleep and Sleep Habits Among Young Children Living With Economic Adversity. OBJECTIVE: To examine the perspectives of ethnically diverse, low-income parents of young children regarding sleep, sleep habits, and preferences for sleep promotion for themselves and their children. METHOD: We recruited a sample of mothers who had a 15- to 60-month-old child enrolled in the Special Supplemental Nutritional Program for Women, Infants and Children in a Northeastern U.S. city. We used a convergent mixed-methods design to conduct semistructured interviews and questionnaires to measure parent sleep quality (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index), sleep apnea (Berlin Apnea Questionnaire), mood (Centers for Epidemiological Studies of Depression), children's sleep (Children's Sleep Habits Questionnaire), and behavior (Child Behavior Checklist). RESULTS: Thirty-two mothers (M age\u202f=\u202f30.97 [SD 6.34] years; n\u202f=\u202f21 [65%] African American) and children (N\u202f=\u202f14 [44% female]; M age =38 [SD 12.63] months) participated. Children's average sleep duration was 10 hr, which is below the recommendation for this age group; overall sleep difficulty was high despite most mothers reporting that their children had normal sleep. Five children had abnormal Child Behavior Checklist scores, suggesting internalizing and externalizing behaviors. More than half of the mothers had poor sleep quality and 24 (75%) were at high risk for sleep apnea. Mothers viewed sleep as important for themselves and their children and identified both effective and ineffective practices to promote sleep, including practices learned from their own families. CONCLUSIONS: Ethnically diverse mothers who are living with economic adversity value sleep for themselves and their children. The high value placed on sleep, despite misconceptions about normal sleep, suggest opportunities to promote sleep interventions. The content and delivery methods should be tailored to their knowledge, preferences, and cultural practices. ",
        "Value of routine ultrasound examination at 35-37 weeks' gestation in diagnosis of fetal abnormalities. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the potential value of routine ultrasound examination at 35-37\u2009weeks' gestation in the diagnosis of previously unknown fetal abnormalities. METHODS: This was a prospective study of 52\u2009400 singleton pregnancies attending for a routine ultrasound examination at 35\u2009+\u20090 to 36\u2009+\u20096\u2009weeks' gestation; all pregnancies had a previous scan at 18-24\u2009weeks and 47\u2009214 also had a scan at 11-13\u2009weeks. We included pregnancies resulting in live birth or stillbirth but excluded those with known chromosomal abnormality. Abnormalities were classified according to the affected major organ system, and the type and incidence of new abnormalities were determined. RESULTS: In the study population, the incidence of fetal abnormality was 1.9% (995/52\u2009400), including 674 (67.7%) that had been diagnosed previously during the first and/or second trimester, 247 (24.8%) that were detected for the first time at 35-37\u2009weeks and 74 (7.4%) that were detected for the first time postnatally. The most common abnormalities that were diagnosed during the first and/or second trimester and that were also observed at 35-37\u2009weeks included ventricular septal defect, talipes, unilateral renal agenesis and/or pelvic kidney, hydronephrosis, duplex kidney, unilateral multicystic kidney, congenital pulmonary airway malformation, ventriculomegaly, cleft lip and palate, polydactyly and abdominal cyst or gastroschisis. The most common abnormalities first seen at 35-37\u2009weeks were hydronephrosis, mild ventriculomegaly, ventricular septal defect, duplex kidney, ovarian cyst and arachnoid cyst. The incidence of abnormalities first seen at 35-37\u2009weeks was 0.5% and those that were detected exclusively for the first time at this examination were ovarian cyst, microcephaly, achondroplasia, dacryocystocele and hematocolpos. The incidence of abnormalities first seen postnatally was 0.1% and the most common were isolated cleft palate, polydactyly or syndactyly and ambiguous genitalia or hypospadias; prenatal examination of the genitalia was not a compulsory part of the protocol. CONCLUSIONS: A high proportion of fetal abnormalities are detected for the first time during a routine ultrasound examination at 35-37\u2009weeks' gestation. Such diagnosis and subsequent management, including selection of timing and place for delivery and postnatal investigations, could potentially improve postnatal outcome. Copyright \u00a9 2019 ISUOG.

        "The Role of Drugs in Alcohol Poisoning and Blackout Events: A Latent Class Analysis of a Residential Treatment Sample. BACKGROUND: Alcohol can lead to fatal and nonfatal overdose (OD) through its neurobiological inhibitory effects when used alone or with other drugs. Little research has examined alcohol OD characteristics in the context of concomitant drug use. METHODS: This study utilized alcohol OD data (defined as alcohol poisoning, passing out, or blacking out) collected in a large residential addiction treatment facility (N\u00a0=\u00a0660). Latent class analysis identified classes of alcohol OD events based on concomitant drug use at the time of OD. We evaluated correlates of alcohol OD classes, including depression, emergency medical services, and hospitalization, using latent class regression. RESULTS: Only 20% of alcohol ODs involved alcohol alone. Marijuana was the most\u00a0commonly used drug during the most recent alcohol OD (43.2%), followed by sedatives (27.9%), cocaine or crack (25.9%), prescription opioids (26.1%), and heroin (20%). The final latent class model included 3 classes: no/low drug involvement (61%), moderate drug involvement (33%), and high drug involvement (6%). Relative to the no/low drug involvement class, participants admitted to the hospital were 6.4-fold more likely to be in the high drug involvement class (95% CI: 2.4 to 16.6) and 2.9-fold more likely to be in the moderate drug involvement class (95% CI: 1.2 to 7.2). Participants receiving emergency medical services were more likely to be in the high drug involvement class (aOR: 2.2, 95% CI: 2.2, 1.1 to 4.5) and less likely to be in the moderate drug involvement class (aOR 0.39, 95% CI: 0.2 to 0.96). CONCLUSIONS: Combining drug classes with alcohol prior to OD was common and associated with a higher likelihood of hospitalization. Overdose prevention efforts should address acute risks of alcohol ingestion with other drugs. ",
        "The E3 ubiquitin ligase MIB2 enhances inflammation by degrading the deubiquitinating enzyme CYLD. The tumor suppressor CYLD is a deubiquitinating enzyme that suppresses polyubiquitin-dependent signaling pathways, including the proinflammatory and cell growth-promoting NF-\u03baB pathway. Missense mutations in the CYLD gene are present in individuals with syndromes such as multiple familial trichoepithelioma (MFT), but the pathogenic roles of these mutations remain unclear. Recent studies have shown that CYLD interacts with a RING finger domain protein, mind bomb homologue 2 (MIB2), in the regulation of NOTCH signaling. However, whether MIB2 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that acts on CYLD is unknown. Here, using the cell-free-based AlphaScreen and pulldown assays to detect protein-protein interactions, along with immunofluorescence assays and murine Mib2 knockout cells and animals, we demonstrate that MIB2 promotes proteasomal degradation of CYLD and enhances NF-\u03baB signaling. Of note, arthritic inflammation was suppressed in Mib2-deficient mice. We further observed that the ankyrin repeat in MIB2 interacts with the third CAP domain in CYLD and that MIB2 catalyzes Lys-48-linked polyubiquitination of CYLD at Lys-338 and Lys-530. MIB2-dependent CYLD degradation activated NF-\u03baB signaling via tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF\u03b1) stimulation and the linear ubiquitination assembly complex (LUBAC). Mib2-knockout mice had reduced serum interleukin-6 (IL-6) and exhibited suppressed inflammatory responses in the K/BxN serum-transfer arthritis model. Interestingly, MIB2 significantly enhanced the degradation of a CYLDP904L variant identified in an individual with MFT, although the molecular pathogenesis of the disease was not clarified here. Together, these results suggest that MIB2 enhances NF-\u03baB signaling in inflammation by promoting the ubiquitin-dependent degradation of CYLD. ",
        "Universal screening for social determinants of health in pediatric sickle cell disease: A quality-improvement initiative. BACKGROUND: Social determinants of health (SDoH) are socioeconomic factors that influence health outcomes. Guidelines recommend universal screening for SDoH at clinic visits; however, models that do not require additional resources are limited in subspecialty clinics. Individuals with sickle cell disease (SCD) face the burdens of chronic illness and often racial disparities, both of which may increase their vulnerability to adverse SDoH. Hematologists can impact both quality of life and clinical outcomes for their patients by implementing screening and referral programs addressing SDoH. METHODS: Through prospective, quality-improvement methods, we introduced universal screening for SDoH into our pediatric hematology clinic. The intervention was a paper screener followed by a referral to local community organizations for the specific needs endorsed. The aims of this study were to determine the feasibility of universal screening for SDoH in a busy subspeciality clinic using pre-existing resources to identify the needs of our patients and to facilitate referrals between our patients and community organizations via this low touch intervention. RESULTS: Between August 2017 and November 2018, 156 screens were completed. Sixty-six percent were positive for at least one unmet social need for which 80% were referred to a relevant community organization. Forty-five percent of patients available via follow-up phone call reached out to the community organization. CONCLUSIONS: There is a high burden of SDoH in families of children with SCD. Universal screening at a pediatric hematology clinic with the subsequent connection of patients with SCD to community resources is feasible using existing clinic resources. ",
        "Comparison of Urban Off-Road Vehicle and Motorcycle Injuries at a Level 1 Trauma Center. BACKGROUND: Recently, there has been an increase in the usage of dirt bikes and all-terrain vehicles in urban environments. Previously, it has been shown that crashes involving these urban off-road vehicles (UORVs) resulted in different injury patterns from crashes that occurred in rural environments. The aim of this study was to compare injury patterns of patients involved in crashes while riding UORVs versus motorcycles (MCs). METHODS: A retrospective review (2005-2016) of patients who presented to our urban level I trauma center as a result of any MC or UORV crash was performed. Patients who presented after 48\u00a0h from the time of accident were excluded. A P\u00a0<\u00a00.05 was considered significant. RESULTS: We identified 1556 patients who were involved in an MC or UORV crash resulting in injury (MC: n\u00a0=\u00a01324 [85%]; UORVs: n\u00a0=\u00a0232 [15%]). Patients in UORV crashes were younger (26.2\u00a0y versus 39.6\u00a0y), less likely to be helmeted (39.6% versus 90.2%), required fewer emergent trauma bay procedures (28.4% versus 36.7%), and needed fewer operative interventions (45.9% versus 54.2%) (all P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Both groups had a similar Injury Severity Score (12.2 versus 12.6; P\u00a0=\u00a00.54) and Glasgow Coma Score (13.8 versus 13.5; P\u00a0=\u00a00.46). UORV patients had a lower mortality (0.9% versus 4.7%; P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) compared to MC crash patients despite similar injury patterns. CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrate that patients sustaining UORV injuries were younger and less likely to be helmeted but have a lower mortality rate after a crash, despite sustaining similar injuries as motorcyclists. This study provides an overview of how crashes involving UORV usage is a unique phenomenon and not entirely comparable to MC crashes. ",
        "Viral N6-methyladenosine upregulates replication and pathogenesis of human respiratory syncytial virus. N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is the most prevalent internal modification of mRNAs in most eukaryotes. Here we show that RNAs of human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) are modified by m6A within discreet regions and that these modifications enhance viral replication and pathogenesis. Knockdown of m6A methyltransferases decreases RSV replication and gene expression whereas knockdown of m6A demethylases has the opposite effect. The G gene transcript contains the most m6A modifications. Recombinant RSV variants expressing G transcripts that lack particular clusters of m6A display reduced replication in A549 cells, primary well differentiated human airway epithelial cultures, and respiratory tracts of cotton rats. One of the m6A-deficient variants is highly attenuated yet retains high immunogenicity in cotton rats. Collectively, our results demonstrate\u00a0that viral m6A methylation upregulates RSV replication and pathogenesis and identify viral m6A methylation as a target for rational design of live attenuated vaccine candidates for RSV and perhaps other pneumoviruses.

        "Using resting-state intrinsic network connectivity to identify suicide risk in mood disorders. BACKGROUND: Little is known about the neural substrates of suicide risk in mood disorders. Improving the identification of biomarkers of suicide risk, as indicated by a history of suicide-related behavior (SB), could lead to more targeted treatments to reduce risk. METHODS: Participants were 18 young adults with a mood disorder with a history of SB (as indicated by endorsing a past suicide attempt), 60 with a mood disorder with a history of suicidal ideation (SI) but not SB, 52 with a mood disorder with no history of SI or SB (MD), and 82 healthy comparison participants (HC). Resting-state functional connectivity within and between intrinsic neural networks, including cognitive control network (CCN), salience and emotion network (SEN), and default mode network (DMN), was compared between groups. RESULTS: Several fronto-parietal regions (k > 57, p < 0.005) were identified in which individuals with SB demonstrated distinct patterns of connectivity within (in the CCN) and across networks (CCN-SEN and CCN-DMN). Connectivity with some of these same regions also distinguished the SB group when participants were re-scanned after 1-4 months. Extracted data defined SB group membership with good accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity (79-88%). CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that individuals with a history of SB in the context of mood disorders may show reliably distinct patterns of intrinsic network connectivity, even when compared to those with mood disorders without SB. Resting-state fMRI is a promising tool for identifying subtypes of patients with mood disorders who may be at risk for suicidal behavior. ",
        "Transfer and Metabolism of the Xenoestrogen Zearalenone in Human Perfused Placenta. BACKGROUND:. Pregnancy is a sensitive condition during which adverse environmental exposures should be monitored thoroughly and minimized whenever possible. In particular, the hormone balance during gestation is delicate, and disturbance may cause acute or chronic long-term health effects. A potential endocrine disruption may be provoked by in utero exposure to xenoestrogens mimicking endogenous estrogens. The mycoestrogen zearalenone (ZEN), a toxic fungal secondary metabolite and mycotoxin found frequently in food and feed, constitutes a prominent example. . OBJECTIVES:. We performed a comprehensive assessment of the transfer as well as phase I and phase II metabolism of ZEN at the human placental barrier. . METHODS:. Human placentas were perfused with 1\u03bcM (318\u03bcg/L) ZEN for 6 h. Samples from the maternal and fetal compartment, placental tissue, and fetal plasma were analyzed by a highly sensitive UHPLC-MS/MS assay to detect ZEN as well as nine key metabolites (\u03b1-zearalenol, \u03b2-zearalenol, zearalanone, \u03b1-zearalanol, \u03b2-zearalanol, ZEN-14-glucuronide, \u03b1-zearalenol-14-glucuronide, \u03b2-zearalenol-14-glucuronide, ZEN-14-sulfate). . RESULTS:. The model revealed a fast maternofetal transfer of ZEN across the human placental barrier. We also unraveled phase I and phase II metabolism of the parent toxin ZEN into the approximately 70-times more estrogenic \u03b1-zearalenol and the less active ZEN-14-sulfate conjugate, which are effectively released into the maternal and fetal circulation in considerable amounts. . CONCLUSIONS:. Our findings suggest that exposure to ZEN (such as through consumption of ZEN-contaminated cereal-based products) during pregnancy may result in in utero exposure of the fetus, not only to ZEN but also some of its highly estrogenically active metabolites. In the light of the known affinity of ZEN and potentially co-occurring xenoestrogens to the estrogen receptor, and our results demonstrating placental transfer of ZEN and its metabolites in an ex vivo model, we recommend further research and more comprehensive assessment of gestational exposures in women. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP4860.

        "Dietary restriction induces posttranscriptional regulation of longevity genes. Dietary restriction (DR) increases life span through adaptive changes in gene expression. To understand more about these changes, we analyzed the transcriptome and translatome of Caenorhabditis elegans subjected to DR. Transcription of muscle regulatory and structural genes increased, whereas increased expression of amino acid metabolism and neuropeptide signaling genes was controlled at the level of translation. Evaluation of posttranscriptional regulation identified putative roles for RNA-binding proteins, RNA editing, miRNA, alternative splicing, and nonsense-mediated decay in response to nutrient limitation. Using RNA interference, we discovered several differentially expressed genes that regulate life span. We also found a compensatory role for translational regulation, which offsets dampened expression of a large subset of transcriptionally down-regulated genes. Furthermore, 3' UTR editing and intron retention increase under DR and correlate with diminished translation, whereas trans-spliced genes are refractory to reduced translation efficiency compared with messages with the native 5' UTR. Finally, we find that smg-6 and smg-7, which are genes governing selection and turnover of nonsense-mediated decay targets, are required for increased life span under DR. ",
        "Morphology and composition play distinct and complementary roles in the tolerance of plantar skin to mechanical load. Plantar skin on the soles of the feet has a distinct morphology and composition that is thought to enhance its tolerance to mechanical loads, although the individual contributions of morphology and composition have never been quantified. Here, we combine multiscale mechanical testing and computational models of load bearing to quantify the mechanical environment of both plantar and nonplantar skin under load. We find that morphology and composition play distinct and complementary roles in plantar skin's load tolerance. More specifically, the thick stratum corneum provides protection from stress-based injuries such as skin tears and blisters, while epidermal and dermal compositions provide protection from deformation-based injuries such as pressure ulcers. This work provides insights into the roles of skin morphology and composition more generally and will inform the design of engineered skin substitutes as well as the etiology of skin injury. ",
        "\u0394ccr5 Genotype Is Associated with Mild Form of Nephropathia Epidemica. Nephropathia Epidemica (NE), a mild form of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) and linked to hantavirus infection, is endemic in the Republic of Tatarstan. Several genetic markers of HFRS severity have been identified previously, including human leukocyte antigen (HLA) complexes and nucleotide polymorphism in the tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF\u03b1) gene. Still, our understanding of the genetic markers of NE severity remains incomplete. The frequency of the C-C chemokine receptor type 5 (CCR5) gene wild type and gene with 32-base-pair deletion (\u039432CCR5) genotypes in 98 NE samples and 592 controls was analyzed using PCR. Along with the serum levels of 94 analytes, a lack of differences in the CCR5 genotype distribution between NE cases and the general population suggests that the CCR5 genotype does not affect susceptibility to hantavirus infection. However, in NE cases, significant variation in the serum levels of the host matrix metalloproteases between functional CCR5 homozygous and \u039432CCR5 heterozygous patients was detected. Also, the oliguric phase was longer, while thrombocyte counts were lower in functional CCR5 homozygous as compared to heterozygous NE cases. Our data, for the first time, presents the potential role of the CCR5 receptor genotype in NE pathogenesis. Our data suggests that NE pathogenesis in functional CCR5 homozygous and heterozygous NE patients differs, where homozygous cases may have more disintegration of the extracellular matrix and potentially more severe disease.

        "Sublethal antibiotics collapse gut bacterial populations by enhancing aggregation and expulsion. Antibiotics induce large and highly variable changes in the intestinal microbiome even at sublethal concentrations, through mechanisms that remain elusive. Using gnotobiotic zebrafish, which allow high-resolution examination of microbial dynamics, we found that sublethal doses of the common antibiotic ciprofloxacin cause severe drops in bacterial abundance. Contrary to conventional views of antimicrobial tolerance, disruption was more pronounced for slow-growing, aggregated bacteria than for fast-growing, planktonic species. Live imaging revealed that antibiotic treatment promoted bacterial aggregation and increased susceptibility to intestinal expulsion. Intestinal mechanics therefore amplify the effects of antibiotics on resident bacteria. Microbial dynamics are captured by a biophysical model that connects antibiotic-induced collapses to gelation phase transitions in soft materials, providing a framework for predicting the impact of antibiotics on the intestinal microbiome.

        "Blame-rebalance fMRI neurofeedback in major depressive disorder: A randomised proof-of-concept trial. Previously, using fMRI, we demonstrated lower connectivity between right anterior superior temporal (ATL) and anterior subgenual cingulate (SCC) regions while patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) experience guilt. This neural signature was detected despite symptomatic remission which suggested a putative role in vulnerability. This randomised controlled double-blind parallel group clinical trial investigated whether patients with MDD are able to voluntarily modulate this neural signature. To this end, we developed a fMRI neurofeedback software (FRIEND), which measures ATL-SCC coupling and displays its levels in real time. Twenty-eight patients with remitted MDD were randomised to two groups, each receiving one session of fMRI neurofeedback whilst retrieving guilt and indignation/anger-related autobiographical memories. They were instructed to feel the emotion whilst trying to increase the level of a thermometer-like display on a screen. Active intervention group: The thermometer levels increased with increasing levels of ATL-SCC correlations in the guilt condition. Control intervention group: The thermometer levels decreased when correlation levels deviated from the previous baseline level in the guilt condition, thus reinforcing stable correlations. Both groups also received feedback during the indignation condition reinforcing stable correlations. We confirmed our predictions that patients in the active intervention group were indeed able to increase levels of ATL-SCC correlations for guilt vs. indignation and their self-esteem after training compared to before training and that this differed significantly from the control intervention group. These data provide proof-of-concept for a novel treatment target for MDD patients and are in keeping with the hypothesis that ATL-SCC connectivity plays a key role in self-worth. https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/results/NCT01920490.

        "Cannabis use disorder among people using cannabis daily/almost daily in the United States, 2002-2016. BACKGROUND: Cannabis use disorder (CUD) prevalence among people reporting past-year cannabis use declined from 2002-2016. We examined whether similar reductions in CUD were observed among people reporting daily/almost daily cannabis use. We expected that CUD prevalence among people reporting daily/almost daily use would not decrease. METHODS: We used 2002-2016 National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) data, including 22,651 individuals using cannabis 300+ days in the past year. CUD was defined using DSM-IV criteria for cannabis abuse and/or dependence. Age categories included: 12-17, 18-25, and 26\u202f+\u202f. Annual prevalence of CUD, cannabis dependence, cannabis abuse, and each individual abuse/dependence items accounted for the complex survey design. Differences in trends over time were examined by age group. RESULTS: From 2002-2016, the prevalence of CUD among people reporting daily/almost daily cannabis use decreased by 26.8% in adolescents, by 29.7% in ages 18-25, and by 37.5% in ages 26\u202f+\u202f. Prevalence of DSM-IV cannabis dependence decreased significantly among adolescents (-43.9%) and young adults (-26.8%) but remained stable in adults 26\u202f+\u202f. Reductions in most dependence items were observed in young adults, with less consistent patterns in adolescents and adults 26\u202f+\u202f. Prevalence of DSM-IV cannabis abuse decreased overall and for each abuse item across all age groups. CONCLUSIONS: Contrary to expectations, CUD prevalence decreased significantly across all ages reporting daily/almost daily cannabis use between 2002-2016. Cannabis dependence prevalence decreased for adolescents and young adults and was stable only among adults ages 26+ reporting daily/almost daily cannabis use. Potential drivers of this decrease should be further explored. ",
        "Directional coupling of slow and fast hippocampal gamma with neocortical alpha/beta oscillations in human episodic memory. Episodic memories hinge upon our ability to process a wide range of multisensory information and bind this information into a coherent, memorable representation. On a neural level, these 2 processes are thought to be supported by neocortical alpha/beta desynchronization and hippocampal theta/gamma synchronization, respectively. Intuitively, these 2 processes should couple to successfully create and retrieve episodic memories, yet this hypothesis has not been tested empirically. We address this by analyzing human intracranial electroencephalogram data recorded during 2 associative memory tasks. We find that neocortical alpha/beta (8 to 20 Hz) power decreases reliably precede and predict hippocampal \"fast\" gamma (60 to 80 Hz) power increases during episodic memory formation; during episodic memory retrieval, however, hippocampal \"slow\" gamma (40 to 50 Hz) power increases reliably precede and predict later neocortical alpha/beta power decreases. We speculate that this coupling reflects the flow of information from the neocortex to the hippocampus during memory formation, and hippocampal pattern completion inducing information reinstatement in the neocortex during memory retrieval.

        "Liquid-Cell Electron Tomography of Biological Systems. Liquid-cell electron microscopy is a rapidly growing field in the imaging domain. While real-time observations are readily available to analyze materials and biological systems, these measurementshave been limited to the two-dimensional (2-D) image plane. Here, we introduce an exciting technical advance to image materials in 3-D while enclosed in liquid. The development of liquid-cell electron tomography permitted us to observe and quantify host-pathogen interactions in solution while contained in the vacuum system of the electron microscope. In doing so, we demonstrate new insights for the rules of engagement involving a unique bacteriophage and its host bacterium. A deeper analysis of the genetic content of the phage pathogens revealed structural features of the infectious units while introducing a new paradigm for host interactions. Overall, we demonstrate a technological opportunity to elevate research efforts for in situ imaging while providing a new level of dimensionality beyond the current state of the field. ",
        "Phototherapy and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation facilitate removal of carbon monoxide in rats. Inhaled carbon monoxide (CO) displaces oxygen from hemoglobin, reducing the capacity of blood to carry oxygen. Current treatments for CO-poisoned patients involve administration of 100% oxygen; however, when CO poisoning is associated with acute lung injury secondary to smoke inhalation, burns, or trauma, breathing 100% oxygen may be ineffective. Visible light dissociates CO from hemoglobin. We hypothesized that the exposure of blood to visible light while passing through a membrane oxygenator would increase the rate of CO elimination in vivo. We developed a membrane oxygenator with optimal characteristics to facilitate exposure of blood to visible light and tested the device in a rat model of CO poisoning, with or without concomitant lung injury. Compared to ventilation with 100% oxygen, the addition of extracorporeal removal of CO with phototherapy (ECCOR-P) doubled the rate of CO elimination in CO-poisoned rats with normal lungs. In CO-poisoned rats with acute lung injury, treatment with ECCOR-P increased the rate of CO removal by threefold compared to ventilation with 100% oxygen alone and was associated with improved survival. Further development and adaptation of this extracorporeal CO photo-removal device for clinical use may provide additional benefits for CO-poisoned patients, especially for those with concurrent acute lung injury.

Our findings suggest that exposure to ZEN (such as through consumption of ZEN-contaminated cereal-based products) during pregnancy may result in in utero exposure of the fetus, not only to ZEN but also some of its highly estrogenically active metabolites. In the light of the known affinity of ZEN and potentially co-occurring xenoestrogens to the estrogen receptor, and our results demonstrating placental transfer of ZEN and its metabolites in an ex vivo model, we recommend further research and more comprehensive assessment of gestational exposures in women. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP4860.

        "Polyclonal and convergent antibody response to Ebola virus vaccine rVSV-ZEBOV. Recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus-Zaire Ebola virus (rVSV-ZEBOV) is the most advanced Ebola virus vaccine candidate and is currently being used to combat the outbreak of Ebola virus disease (EVD) in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). Here we examine the humoral immune response in a subset of human volunteers enrolled in a phase 1 rVSV-ZEBOV vaccination trial by performing comprehensive single B cell and electron microscopy structure analyses. Four studied vaccinees show polyclonal, yet reproducible and convergent B cell responses with shared sequence characteristics. EBOV-targeting antibodies cross-react with other Ebolavirus species, and detailed epitope mapping revealed overlapping target epitopes with antibodies isolated from EVD survivors. Moreover, in all vaccinees, we detected highly potent EBOV-neutralizing antibodies with activities comparable or superior to the monoclonal antibodies currently used in clinical trials. These include antibodies combining the IGHV3-15/IGLV1-40 immunoglobulin gene segments that were identified in all investigated individuals. Our findings will help to evaluate and direct current and future vaccination strategies and offer opportunities for novel EVD therapies. ",
        "Serum neurofilament light chain is a discriminative biomarker between frontotemporal lobar degeneration and primary psychiatric disorders. Due to the significant clinical overlap between frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) spectrum disorders and late-onset primary psychiatric disorders (PPD), diagnostic biomarkers reflecting the different underlying pathophysiologies are urgently needed. Thus far, elevated cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of neurofilament light chain (NfL) have been reported in various neurological conditions. Furthermore, recent advancements in ultrasensitive analytical methods (e.g., single molecule array, Simoa) have enabled sensitive and less invasive NfL detection also from blood samples. In this study, we evaluated the potential of serum NfL (sNfL) as a diagnostic tool between FTLD and PPD. We analyzed sNfL levels with Simoa from 125 participants including patients from FTLD (n\u2009=\u200991) and PPD (n\u2009=\u200934) spectra. Our results show that sNfL levels are higher in the FTLD group compared to the PPD group as well as in separate clinical subtypes of FTLD compared to different psychiatric manifestations (i.e., mood or psychotic disorders). At single-subject level, discrimination between FTLD and PPD was possible with 80% sensitivity and 85% specificity (AUC\u2009=\u20090.850, 95% CI 0.776-0.923), and between behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) and PPD with 79% sensitivity and 85% specificity (AUC\u2009=\u20090.830, 95% CI 0.732-0.908). These findings highlight the potential of sNfL as a discriminating biomarker for FTLD over PPD in patients with wide-ranging behavioral, psychiatric and cognitive symptoms. ",
        "Accuracy of Physical Function Questions to Predict Moderate-Vigorous Physical Activity as Measured by Hip Accelerometry. BACKGROUND: Functional capacity assessment is a core component of current perioperative cardiovascular evaluation and management guidelines for noncardiac surgery. The authors investigated the ability of standardized physical function questions to predict whether participants engaged in moderate physical activity as measured by hip accelerometers. METHODS: Participant responses to physical functioning questions and whether they engaged in moderate physical activity were extracted from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (2003 to 2004 and 2005 to 2006). Physical activity intensity was measured using hip accelerometers. Adult participants with at least one Revised Cardiac Risk Index condition were included in the analysis. Standardized physical function questions were evaluated using a classification and regression tree analysis. Training and test datasets were randomly generated to create and test the analysis. RESULTS: Five hundred and twenty-two participants were asked the physical functioning questions and 378 of 522 (72.4%) had a bout of moderate-vigorous activity. Classification and regression tree analysis identified a \"no difficulty\" response to walking up 10 stairs and the ability to walk two to three blocks as the most sensitive questions to predict the presence of a 2-min bout of moderate activity. Participants with positive responses to both questions had a positive likelihood ratio of 3.7 and a posttest probability greater than 90% of a 2-min bout of moderate-vigorous activity. The sensitivity and specificity of positive responses to physical functioning questions in the pruned tree were 0.97 (95% CI, 0.94 to 0.98) and 0.16 (95% CI, 0.10 to 0.23) for training data, and 0.88 (95% CI, 0.75 to 0.96) and 0.10 (95% CI, 0.00 to 0.45) for the test data. Participants with at least one 2-min bout of moderate activity had a greater percentage of overall daily active time (35.4 \u00b1 0.5 vs. 26.7 \u00b1 1.2; P = 0.001) than those without. CONCLUSIONS: Standardized physical function questions are highly sensitive but poorly specific to identify patients who achieve moderate physical activity. Additional strategies to evaluate functional capacity should be considered. ",
        "Transposon Mutagenesis in Chlamydia trachomatis Identifies CT339 as a ComEC Homolog Important for DNA Uptake and Lateral Gene Transfer. Transposon mutagenesis is a widely applied and powerful genetic tool for the discovery of genes associated with selected phenotypes. Chlamydia trachomatis is a clinically significant, obligate intracellular bacterium for which many conventional genetic tools and capabilities have been developed only recently. This report describes the successful development and application of a Himar transposon mutagenesis system for generating single-insertion mutant clones of C. trachomatis This system was used to generate a pool of 105 transposon mutant clones that included insertions in genes encoding flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD)-dependent monooxygenase (C. trachomatis148 [ct148]), deubiquitinase (ct868), and competence-associated (ct339) proteins. A subset of Tn mutant clones was evaluated for growth differences under cell culture conditions, revealing that most phenocopied the parental strain; however, some strains displayed subtle and yet significant differences in infectious progeny production and inclusion sizes. Bacterial burden studies in mice also supported the idea that a FAD-dependent monooxygenase (ct148) and a deubiquitinase (ct868) were important for these infections. The ct339 gene encodes a hypothetical protein with limited sequence similarity to the DNA-uptake protein ComEC. A transposon insertion in ct339 rendered the mutant incapable of DNA acquisition during recombination experiments. This observation, along with in situ structural analysis, supports the idea that this protein is playing a role in the fundamental process of lateral gene transfer similar to that of ComEC. In all, the development of the Himar transposon system for Chlamydia provides an effective genetic tool for further discovery of genes that are important for basic biology and pathogenesis aspects.IMPORTANCEChlamydia trachomatis infections have an immense impact on public health; however, understanding the basic biology and pathogenesis of this organism has been stalled by the limited repertoire of genetic tools. This report describes the successful adaptation of an important tool that has been lacking in Chlamydia studies: transposon mutagenesis. This advance enabled the generation of 105 insertional mutants, demonstrating that numerous gene products are not essential for in vitro growth. Mammalian infections using these mutants revealed that several gene products are important for infections in vivo Moreover, this tool enabled the investigation and discovery of a gene critical for lateral gene transfer; a process fundamental to the evolution of bacteria and likely for Chlamydia as well. The development of transposon mutagenesis for Chlamydia has broad impact for the field and for the discovery of genes associated with selected phenotypes, providing an additional avenue for the discovery of molecular mechanisms used for pathogenesis and for a more thorough understanding of this important pathogen.

        "Global trends in antimicrobial resistance in animals in low- and middle-income countries. The global scale-up in demand for animal protein is the most notable dietary trend of our time. Antimicrobial consumption in animals is threefold that of humans and has enabled large-scale animal protein production. The consequences for the development of antimicrobial resistance in animals have received comparatively less attention than in humans. We analyzed 901 point prevalence surveys of pathogens in developing countries to map resistance in animals. China and India represented the largest hotspots of resistance, with new hotspots emerging in Brazil and Kenya. From 2000 to 2018, the proportion of antimicrobials showing resistance above 50% increased from 0.15 to 0.41 in chickens and from 0.13 to 0.34 in pigs. Escalating resistance in animals is anticipated to have important consequences for animal health and, eventually, for human health. ",
        "Long-Term Exposure to Particulate Air Pollution, Black Carbon, and Their Source Components in Relation to Ischemic Heart Disease and Stroke. BACKGROUND:. Long-term exposure to particulate matter (PM) in ambient air has been associated with cardiovascular mortality, but few studies have considered incident disease in relation to PM from different sources. . OBJECTIVES:. We aimed to study associations between long-term exposure to different types of PM and sources, and incident ischemic heart disease (IHD) and stroke in three Swedish cities. . METHODS:. Based on detailed emission databases, monitoring data, and high-resolution dispersion models, we calculated source contributions to PM with aerodynamic diameter \u226410\u03bcm (PM10), PM with aerodynamic diameter \u22642.5\u03bcm (PM2.5), and black carbon (BC) from road wear, traffic exhaust, residential heating, and other sources in Gothenburg, Stockholm, and Ume\u00e5. Registry data for participants from four cohorts were used to obtain incidence of IHD and stroke for first hospitalization or death. We constructed time windows of exposure for same-year, 1- to 5-y, and 6- to 10-y averages preceding incidence from annual averages at residential addresses. Risk estimates were based on random effects meta-analyses of cohort-specific Cox proportional hazard models. . RESULTS:. We observed 5,166 and 3,119 incident IHD and stroke cases, respectively, in 114,758 participants. Overall, few consistent associations were observed between the different air pollution measures and IHD or stroke incidence. However, same-year levels of ambient locally emitted BC (range: 0.01\u22124.6\u2009\u03bcg/m3) were associated with a 4.0% higher risk of incident stroke per interquartile range (IQR), 0.30\u2009\u03bcg/m3 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.04, 7.8]. This association was primarily related to BC from traffic exhaust. PM10 (range: 4.4\u221252\u2009\u03bcg/m3) and PM2.5 (range: 2.9\u221222\u2009\u03bcg/m3) were not associated with stroke. Associations with incident IHD were observed only for PM2.5 exposure from residential heating. . DISCUSSION:. Few consistent associations were observed between different particulate components and IHD or stroke. However, long-term residential exposure to locally emitted BC from traffic exhaust was associated with stroke incidence. The comparatively low exposure levels may have contributed to the paucity of associations. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP4757. ",
        "Maternal inflammation has a profound effect on cortical interneuron development in a stage and subtype-specific manner. Severe infections during pregnancy are one of the major risk factors for cognitive impairment in the\u00a0offspring. It has been suggested that maternal inflammation leads to dysfunction of cortical GABAergic interneurons that in turn underlies cognitive impairment of the affected offspring. However, the evidence comes largely from studies of adult or mature brains and how the\u00a0impairment of inhibitory circuits arises upon maternal inflammation is unknown. Here we show that maternal inflammation affects multiple steps of cortical GABAergic interneuron development, i.e., proliferation of precursor cells, migration and positioning of neuroblasts, as well as neuronal maturation. Importantly, the development of distinct subtypes of cortical GABAergic interneurons was discretely impaired as a result of maternal inflammation. This translated into a reduction in cell numbers, redistribution across cortical regions and layers, and\u00a0changes in morphology and cellular properties. Furthermore, selective vulnerability of GABAergic interneuron subtypes was associated with the stage of brain development. Thus, we propose that maternally derived insults have developmental stage-dependent effects, which contribute to the complex etiology of cognitive impairment in the affected offspring. ",
        "Testing the Testers: Are Young Men Who Have Sex With Men Receiving Adequate HIV Testing and Counseling Services?. BACKGROUND: The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention promote HIV testing every 6 months among young men who have sex with men (YMSM) to facilitate entry into the HIV prevention and care continuum. Willingness to be tested may be influenced by testing services' quality. Using a novel mystery shopper methodology, we assessed YMSM's testing experiences in 3 cities and recommend service delivery improvements. METHODS: We assessed YMSM's experiences at HIV testing sites in Philadelphia (n = 30), Atlanta (n = 17), and Houston (n = 19). YMSM (18-24) were trained as mystery shoppers and each site was visited twice. After each visit, shoppers completed a quality assurance survey to evaluate their experience. Data were pooled across sites, normed as percentages, and compared across cities. RESULTS: Across cites, visits averaged 30 minutes (SD = 25.5) and were perceived as welcoming and friendly (70.9%). YMSM perceived most sites respected their privacy and confidentiality (84.3%). YMSM noted deficiencies in providers' competencies with sexual minorities (63.4%) and comfort during the visit (65.7%). Sites underperformed on Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender visibility (49.6%) and medical forms inclusivity (57.95%). Sites on average did not discuss YMSM's relationship context (49.8%) nor provide risk reduction counseling (56.8%) or safer sex education (24.3%). Sites delivered pre-exposure prophylaxis information and counseling inconsistently (58.8%). CONCLUSIONS: Testing sites' variable performance underscores the importance of improving HIV testing services for YMSM. Strategies are recommended for testing sites to promote cultural sensitivity: funding staff trainings, creating systems to assess adherence to testing guidelines and best practices, and implementing new service delivery models.

        "Syringe-Injectable, Self-Expandable, and Ultraconformable Magnetic Ultrathin Films. Syringe-injectable biomaterials and medical devices are important as minimally invasive implants for diagnosis, therapy, and regenerative medicine. Free-standing polymeric nanosheets with a thickness less than 1 \u03bcm and a flexural rigidity less than 10-2 nN m are a promising platform of syringe-injectable, implantable devices that provide conformable and long-term stable adhesion to the target biological tissues for in situ delivery of therapeutic materials. Here, we developed free-standing ultrathin films (<1 \u03bcm thick) based on polyurethane-based shape-memory polymer (SMP) and magnetic nanoparticles (MNP), termed MNP-SMP nanosheets. With the temperature-mediated shape-memory effect of SMP, we overcome the limitation in the manipulation of the conventional polymer nanosheets. In particular, we demonstrated the following four capabilities using the 710 nm thick MNP-SMP nanosheet with the glass transition temperature (Tg) of 25 \u00b0C: (1) syringe-injectability through the medical needles, (2) self-expandability after ejection, (3) conformability and removability on the biological surfaces, and (4) guidability in an external magnetic field. The MNP-SMP nanosheets were readily interfaced with an additional layer of poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) to extend their functionality as a carrier of molecular and cellular drugs. The MNP-SMP nanosheets will contribute to the development of advanced syringe-injectable medical devices as a platform to deliver drugs, sensors, cells, and engineered tissues to the specific site or lesion in the body for minimally invasive diagnosis and therapy.

        "Neuronal Circuit Activity during Neonatal Hypoxic-Ischemic Seizures in Mice. OBJECTIVE: To identify circuits active during neonatal hypoxic-ischemic (HI) seizures and seizure propagation using electroencephalography (EEG), behavior, and whole-brain neuronal activity mapping. METHODS: Mice were exposed to HI on postnatal day 10 using unilateral carotid ligation and global hypoxia. EEG and video were recorded for the duration of the experiment. Using immediate early gene reporter mice, active cells expressing cfos were permanently tagged with reporter protein tdTomato during a 90-minute window. After 1 week, allowing maximal expression of the reporter protein, whole brains were processed, lipid cleared, and imaged with confocal microscopy. Whole-brain reconstruction and analysis of active neurons (colocalized tdTomato/NeuN) were performed. RESULTS: HI resulted in seizure behaviors that were bilateral or unilateral tonic-clonic and nonconvulsive in this model. Mice exhibited characteristic EEG background patterns such as burst suppression and suppression. Neuronal activity mapping revealed bilateral motor cortex and unilateral, ischemic somatosensory cortex, lateral thalamus, and hippocampal circuit activation. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed regional differences in myelination, which coincide with these activity patterns. Astrocytes and blood vessel endothelial cells also expressed cfos during HI. INTERPRETATION: Using a combination of EEG, seizure semiology analysis, and whole-brain neuronal activity mapping, we suggest that this rodent model of neonatal HI results in EEG patterns similar to those observed in human neonates. Activation patterns revealed in this study help explain complex seizure behaviors and EEG patterns observed in neonatal HI injury. This pattern may be, in part, secondary to regional differences in development in the neonatal brain. ANN NEUROL 2019;86:927-938. ",
        "Coupled electrophysiological, hemodynamic, and cerebrospinal fluid oscillations in human sleep. Sleep is essential for both cognition and maintenance of healthy brain function. Slow waves in neural activity contribute to memory consolidation, whereas cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) clears metabolic waste products from the brain. Whether these two processes are related is not known. We used accelerated neuroimaging to measure physiological and neural dynamics in the human brain. We discovered a coherent pattern of oscillating electrophysiological, hemodynamic, and CSF dynamics that appears during non-rapid eye movement sleep. Neural slow waves are followed by hemodynamic oscillations, which in turn are coupled to CSF flow. These results demonstrate that the sleeping brain exhibits waves of CSF flow on a macroscopic scale, and these CSF dynamics are interlinked with neural and hemodynamic rhythms. ",
        "Assessment of peripheral endothelial function predicts future risk of solid-tumor cancer. AIMS: Cardiovascular health metrics predict the risk not only of cardiovascular diseases but also of several types of cancers. Microvascular endothelial dysfunction can predict future cardiovascular adverse events, but the predictive value of microvascular endothelial dysfunction for future risk of solid-tumor cancer has not been characterized. METHODS: A total of 488 patients who underwent microvascular endothelial function assessment using reactive hyperemia peripheral arterial tonometry were included in this study. Microvascular endothelial dysfunction was defined as a reactive hyperemia peripheral arterial tonometry index \u22642.0. RESULTS: Of 221 patients with a baseline reactive hyperemia peripheral arterial tonometry index \u22642.0, 21 patients (9.5%) were diagnosed with incident solid-tumor cancer during follow-up, whereas of 267 patients with a baseline reactive hyperemia peripheral arterial tonometry index >2.0, 10 patients (3.7%) were diagnosed with incident solid-tumor cancer during follow-up (p\u2009=\u20090.009). Patients with a reactive hyperemia peripheral arterial tonometry index \u22642.0 had lower solid-tumor cancer-free survival compared to patients with a reactive hyperemia peripheral arterial tonometry index >2.0 (log-rank p\u2009=\u20090.017) (median follow-up 6.0 (3.0-9.1) years). Cox proportional hazard analyses showed that a reactive hyperemia peripheral arterial tonometry index \u22642.0 predicted the incidence of solid-tumor cancer, with a hazard ratio of 2.52 (95% confidence interval 1.17-5.45; p\u2009=\u20090.019) after adjusting for age, sex, and coronary artery disease, 2.83 (95% confidence interval 1.30-6.17; p\u2009=\u20090.009) after adjusting for diabetes mellitus, hypertension, smoking status, and body mass index >30\u2009kg/m2, 2.79 (95% confidence interval 1.21-6.41; p\u2009=\u20090.016) after adjusting for fasting plasma glucose, systolic blood pressure, smoking status (current or former), and body mass index, and 2.43 (95% confidence interval 1.10-5.34; p\u2009=\u20090.028) after adjusting for Framingham risk score. CONCLUSION: Microvascular endothelial dysfunction, as defined by a reactive hyperemia peripheral arterial tonometry index \u22642.0, was associated with a greater than two-fold increased risk of solid-tumor cancer. Microvascular endothelial dysfunction may be a useful marker to predict the future risk of solid-tumor cancer, in addition to its known ability to predict cardiovascular disease. Further research is necessary to develop adequate cancer screening strategies for patients with microvascular endothelial dysfunction. ",
        "Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor downregulates interferon-gamma receptor expression and stimulates interleukin-6 production in activated human macrophages. We studied direct effects of human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) on phenotypical properties of human macrophage cells in vitro. CD14+ monocyte/macrophages (Mc/Mphs) were isolated from blood of healthy donors by positive magnetic separation. G-CSF (0.01-1.0\u2009ng/mL), when added to Mc/Mphs along with lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 1.0\u2009\u03bcg/mL), was able to noticeably reduce proportions of CD119 (interferon-\u03b3 receptor 1)-positive cells, with no stable effects on CD16 (Fc\u03b3RIII)+ and \u0421D124 (IL-4 receptor subunit alpha)-positive cells. In addition, G-CSF markedly upregulated IL-6 production by LPS-activated Mph cells, without significantly affecting IL-1\u03b2, IL-10 and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) secretion. Our data suggests that G-CSF could restrain Mph polarization to pro-inflammatory (M1) phenotype, thus potentially supporting pro-regenerative Mph activity with implications for immunotherapeutic interventions.

        "The effects of aerobic exercise intensity on memory in older adults. Aerobic exercise may enhance memory in older adults. However, the optimal intensity and underlying mechanism are unclear. This community-based study examined the effect of aerobic exercise intensity on memory and general cognitive abilities. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) was examined as a potential mechanism. Sixty-four sedentary older adults participated in one of three groups: 1) high-intensity interval training (HIIT); 2) moderate continuous training (MCT); or 3) stretching control (CON). Prior to and following the intervention, high-interference memory was assessed using a Mnemonic Similarity task and executive functions were assessed using Go Nogo and Flanker tasks. HIIT led to the greatest memory performance compared to MCT and CON [F(2, 55) = 6.04, p = .004] and greater improvements in memory correlated with greater increases in fitness [rs(46) = .27, p = .03]. Exercise intensity seemed to matter less for executive functioning, as positive trends were observed for both HIIT and MCT. No significant differences in BDNF were found between groups. Overall, these results suggest that aerobic exercise may enhance memory in older adults, with the potential for higher intensity exercise to yield the greatest benefit. While our findings suggest that BDNF does not regulate these adaptations, the mechanisms remain to be determined. Novelty bullets: \u2022 High-intensity interval training results in the greatest memory performance in inactive older adults compared to moderate continuous training or stretching \u2022 Improvement in fitness correlates with improvement in memory performance.

        "Pathological consequences of anti-citrullinated protein antibodies in tear fluid and therapeutic potential of pooled human immune globulin-eye drops in dry eye disease. PURPOSE: To investigate the role of Anti-Citrullinated Protein autoantibodies (ACPAs) in the pathology of dry eye disease (DED) and the therapeutic potential of pooled human immune globulin-eye drops in these patients. METHODS: We investigated the presence of citrullinated proteins and ACPAs in ocular surface wash (OSW) and conjunctival impressions from patients with DED and determined the pathological consequences of OSW with high ACPA using in vitro experiments and in vivo murine models. We performed a randomized, double-masked, pilot clinical trial to determine the safety, tolerability and preliminary efficacy of using pooled human immune globulin-eye drops to treat DED patients with ACPAs in OSW. RESULTS: We found that neutrophils are a source of citrullinated proteins on the ocular surface of DED patients. We detected significantly higher immunoglobulin amount and presence of several species of ACPAs in OSW from DED patients. We also found that OSW with high ACPA contributes to production of NETs, and that ACPAs cause ocular surface disease in murine eyes, both of which are reduced with addition of Immune globulins. As compared to Vehicle treatment, pooled human immune globulin-eye drops (IVIG 4\u202fmg/mL) twice a day for 8 weeks caused significant reduction in signs and symptoms of DED with no difference in tolerability or adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report demonstrating ACPAs in OSW of DED patients and their contribution to ocular surface disease. The first-in-human clinical trial suggests that pooled immune globulin-eye drops are a potential new class of biologic therapies for Dry Eye patients. ",
        "Maternal prenatal stress phenotypes associate with fetal neurodevelopment and birth outcomes. Maternal prenatal stress influences offspring neurodevelopment and birth outcomes including the ratio of males to females born; however, there is limited understanding of what types of stress matter, and for whom. Using a data-driven approach with 27 variables from questionnaires, ambulatory diaries, and physical assessments collected early in the singleton pregnancies of 187 women, 3 latent profiles of maternal prenatal stress emerged that were differentially associated with sex at birth, birth outcomes, and fetal neurodevelopment. Most women (66.8%) were in the healthy group (HG); 17.1% were in the psychologically stressed group (PSYG), evidencing clinically meaningful elevations in perceived stress, depression, and anxiety; and 16% were in the physically stressed group (PHSG) with relatively higher ambulatory blood pressure and increased caloric intake. The population normative male:female secondary sex ratio (105:100) was lower in the PSYG (2:3) and PHSG (4:9), and higher in the HG (23:18), consistent with research showing diminished male births in maternal stress contexts. PHSG versus HG infants were born 1.5 wk earlier (P < 0.05) with 22% compared to 5% born preterm. PHSG versus HG fetuses had decreased fetal heart rate-movement coupling (P < 0.05), which may indicate slower central nervous system development, and PSYG versus PHSG fetuses had more birth complications, consistent with previous findings among offspring of women with psychiatric illness. Social support most strongly differentiated the HG, PSYG, and PHSG groups, and higher social support was associated with increased odds of male versus female births. Stress phenotypes in pregnant women are associated with male vulnerability and poor fetal outcomes. ",
        "Unnatural spirocyclic oxindole alkaloids biosynthesis in Uncaria guianensis. Spiro-oxindole scaffolds have been studied due to their promising therapeutic potential. In the Amazon rainforest there are two important Uncaria species known as \"cat's claw\", which biosynthesize spirocyclic oxindole alkaloids; Uncaria tomentosa (Willd. ex Schult.) DC. and Uncaria guianensis (Aublet) Gmell. We carried out a precursor-directed biosynthesis approach with U. guianensis and successfully obtained oxindole alkaloid analogues with molecular mass corresponding to the addition of a methyl or fluorine group on the oxindole ring using tryptamine analogue precursors. Two of these novel oxindole alkaloid analogues (3b-7-methyl-isomitraphylline and 3c-6-fluoro-isomitraphylline) were isolated and characterized by NMR spectroscopy and ESI-QTOF-MS/MS. Having established a substrate feeding protocol for these plantlets, the biosynthetic route for mitraphylline (1), rhynchophylline (2), isomitraphylline (3) and isorhynchophylline (4) was also investigated using 13C-precursors (1-13C-D-glucose, 2-13C-tryptophan, 1-13C-DL-glyceraldehyde, and methyl-13C-D-methionine).

        "The Incidence, Causes, and Risk Factors of Acute Kidney Injury in Patients Receiving Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors. BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Immune checkpoint inhibitor use in oncology is increasing rapidly. We sought to determine the frequency, severity, cause, and predictors of AKI in a real-world population receiving checkpoint inhibitors. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: We included all patients who received checkpoint inhibitor therapy from May 2011 to December 2016 at Massachusetts General Hospital. Baseline serum creatinine, averaged 6 months before checkpoint inhibitor start date, was compared with all subsequent creatinine values within 12 months of starting therapy. AKI was defined by Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes criteria for fold changes in creatinine from baseline. Sustained AKI events lasted at least 3 days and was our primary outcome. The cause of sustained AKI was determined by chart review. Cumulative incidence and subdistribution hazard models were used to assess the relationship between baseline demographics, comorbidities, and medications, and sustained AKI and potential checkpoint inhibitor-related AKI. RESULTS: We included 1016 patients in the analysis. Average age was 63 (SD 13) years, 61% were men, and 91% were white. Mean baseline creatinine was 0.9 mg/dl (SD 0.4 mg/dl), and 169 (17%) had CKD (eGFR<60 ml/min per 1.73 m2) at baseline. A total of 169 patients (17%) experienced AKI, defined by an increase in creatinine at least 1.5 times the baseline within 12 months; 82 patients (8%) experienced sustained AKI and 30 patients (3%) had potential checkpoint inhibitor-related AKI. The first episode of sustained AKI occurred, on average, 106 days (SD 85) after checkpoint inhibitor initiation. Sixteen (2%) patients experienced stage 3 sustained AKI and four patients required dialysis. Proton pump inhibitor use at baseline was associated with sustained AKI. CONCLUSIONS: AKI is common in patients receiving checkpoint inhibitor therapy. The causes of sustained AKI in this population are heterogenous and merit thorough evaluation. The role of PPI and other nephritis-inducing drugs in the development of sustained AKI needs to be better defined. ",
        "Non-enzymatic roles of human RAD51 at stalled replication forks. The central recombination enzyme RAD51 has been implicated in replication fork processing and restart in response to replication stress. Here, we use a separation-of-function allele of RAD51 that retains DNA binding, but not D-loop activity, to reveal mechanistic aspects of RAD51's roles in the response to replication stress. Here, we find that cells lacking RAD51's enzymatic activity protect replication forks from MRE11-dependent degradation, as expected from previous studies. Unexpectedly, we find that RAD51's strand exchange activity is not required to convert stalled forks to a form that can be degraded by DNA2. Such conversion was shown previously to require replication fork regression, supporting a model in which fork regression depends on a non-enzymatic function of RAD51. We also show RAD51 promotes replication restart by both strand exchange-dependent and strand exchange-independent mechanisms. ",
        "Automated Muscle Segmentation from Clinical CT Using Bayesian U-Net for Personalized Musculoskeletal Modeling. We propose a method for automatic segmentation of individual muscles from a clinical CT. The method uses Bayesian convolutional neural networks with the U-Net architecture, using Monte Carlo dropout that infers an uncertainty metric in addition to the segmentation label. We evaluated the performance of the proposed method using two data sets: 20 fully annotated CTs of the hip and thigh regions and 18 partially annotated CTs that are publicly available from The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA) database. The experiments showed a Dice coefficient (DC) of 0.891\u00b10.016 (mean\u00b1std) and an average symmetric surface distance (ASD) of 0.994\u00b10.230 mm over 19 muscles in the set of 20 CTs. These results were statistically significant improvements compared to the state-of-the-art hierarchical multi-atlas method which resulted in 0.845 \u00b1 0.031 DC and 1.556 \u00b1 0.444 mm ASD. We evaluated validity of the uncertainty metric in the multi-class organ segmentation problem and demonstrated a correlation between the pixels with high uncertainty and the segmentation failure. One application of the uncertainty metric in active-learning is demonstrated, and the proposed query pixel selection method considerably reduced the manual annotation cost for expanding the training data set. The proposed method allows an accurate patient-specific analysis of individual muscle shapes in a clinical routine. This would open up various applications including personalization of biomechanical simulation and quantitative evaluation of muscle atrophy. ",
        "Association of Limiting Opioid Prescriptions With Use of Opioids After Corneal Surgery. Importance: Opioids, which carry a high risk for addiction and overdose, are commonly prescribed after corneal surgery. Data are lacking describing opioid prescribing practices and opioid needs by patients after ophthalmic surgery. Objectives: To quantify opioid use and to assess the association of decreasing the number of opioid tablets prescribed after corneal surgery with postsurgical use. Design, Setting, and Participants: This prospective cohort study investigated opioid use after corneal surgery using direct interviews of 2 adult patient cohorts separated by an updated opioid prescribing guideline. The first cohort survey assessed the quantity of opioid tablets used after surgery. The cornea division of a tertiary care academic medical center reviewed the use needs and decreased the number of tablets prescribed after routine cases. Simultaneously, a statewide opioid monitoring program began that provided patients with opioid information. A second unique cohort received a more detailed survey to assess use, opioid disposal, and pain control. Data for the first cohort were collected from December 1, 2017, through January 19, 2018; for the second cohort, from June 1 to September 15, 2018. Data were analyzed from October 24, 2018, through September 24, 2019. Exposure: Corneal surgery. Main Outcomes and Measures: Differences in use of opioid tablets used by both patient cohorts, assessed using the 2-sample t test. Results: Of 112 eligible, contacted patients, 82 consented to participate (42 men [51%]; mean [SD] age, 42.5 [17.8] years) and were included in the analysis; 38 of 42 participated in the first cohort and 44 of 70 participated in the second cohort. Of those receiving opioid prescriptions, the first cohort was prescribed significantly more tablets than the second cohort (mean [SD], 18.8\u2009[4.2] vs 6.6\u2009[3.1]; difference,\u200912.2 [95% CI, 10.4-14.0]; P\u2009<\u2009.001). The first cohort used significantly more tablets than the second cohort (mean [SD], 8.3\u2009[7.0] vs 4.0\u2009[3.2]; difference, 4.3 [95% CI, 1.4-7.2]; P\u2009=\u2009.005) and had significantly more leftover tablets (mean [SD], 10.3\u2009[6.9] vs 2.9\u2009[2.7]; difference, 7.5 [95% CI, 4.7-10.2]; P\u2009<\u2009.001). In the detailed survey for the second cohort, 19 of 27 patients reported pain control as adequate (70% [95% CI, 50%-86%]); 6 of 27, as more than needed (22% [95% CI, 9%-42%]). Twenty of 28 participants (71% [95% CI, 55%-88%]) had leftover tablets; 17 of these (85% [95% CI, 62%-97%]) did not dispose of leftovers, and 3 (15% [95% CI, 3%-38%]) threw away or flushed leftovers. Conclusions and Relevance: After an assessment of opioid needs, physicians prescribed fewer opioid pills. However, patients who underwent cornea surgery and received fewer tablets continued to have adequate pain control and used even fewer tablets compared with the initial cohort. Patients with unused opioid tablets did not dispose of them properly. ",
        "Transcriptomics and proteomics reveal two waves of translational repression during the maturation of malaria parasite sporozoites. Plasmodium sporozoites are transmitted from infected mosquitoes to mammals, and must navigate the host skin and vasculature to infect the liver. This journey requires distinct proteomes. Here, we report the dynamic transcriptomes and proteomes of both oocyst sporozoites and salivary gland sporozoites in both rodent-infectious Plasmodium yoelii parasites and human-infectious Plasmodium falciparum parasites. The data robustly define mRNAs and proteins that are upregulated in oocyst sporozoites (UOS) or upregulated in infectious sporozoites (UIS) within the salivary glands, including many that are essential for sporozoite functions in the vector and host. Moreover, we find that malaria parasites use two overlapping, extensive, and independent programs of translational repression across sporozoite maturation to temporally regulate protein expression. Together with gene-specific validation experiments, these data indicate that two waves of translational repression are implemented and relieved at different times during sporozoite maturation, migration and infection, thus promoting their successful development and vector-to-host transition.

        "Early complement genes are associated with visual system degeneration in multiple sclerosis. Multiple sclerosis is a heterogeneous disease with an unpredictable course and a wide range of severity; some individuals rapidly progress to a disabled state whereas others experience only mild symptoms. Though genetic studies have identified variants that are associated with an increased risk of developing multiple sclerosis, no variants have been consistently associated with multiple sclerosis severity. In part, the lack of findings is related to inherent limitations of clinical rating scales; these scales are insensitive to early degenerative changes that underlie disease progression. Optical coherence tomography imaging of the retina and low-contrast letter acuity correlate with and predict clinical and imaging-based outcomes in multiple sclerosis. Therefore, they may serve as sensitive phenotypes to discover genetic predictors of disease course. We conducted a set of genome-wide association studies of longitudinal structural and functional visual pathway phenotypes in multiple sclerosis. First, we assessed genetic predictors of ganglion cell/inner plexiform layer atrophy in a discovery cohort of 374 patients with multiple sclerosis using mixed-effects models adjusting for age, sex, disease duration, optic neuritis and genetic ancestry and using a combination of single-variant and network-based analyses. For candidate variants identified in discovery, we conducted a similar set of analyses of ganglion cell/inner plexiform layer thinning in a replication cohort (n = 376). Second, we assessed genetic predictors of sustained loss of 5-letters in low-contrast letter acuity in discovery (n = 582) using multivariable-adjusted Cox proportional hazards models. We then evaluated candidate variants/pathways in a replication cohort. (n = 253). Results of both studies revealed novel subnetworks highly enriched for connected genes in early complement activation linked to measures of disease severity. Within these networks, C3 was the gene most strongly associated with ganglion cell/inner plexiform layer atrophy (P = 0.004) and C1QA and CR1 were top results in analysis of sustained low-contrast letter acuity loss. Namely, variant rs158772, linked to C1QA, and rs61822967, linked to CR1, were associated with 71% and 40% increases in risk of sustained LCLA loss, respectively, in meta-analysis pooling discovery and replication cohorts (rs158772: hazard ratio: 1.71; 95% confidence interval 1.30-2.25; P = 1.3 \u00d7 10-4; rs61822967: hazard ratio: 1.40; 95% confidence interval: 1.16-1.68; P = 4.1 \u00d7 10-4). In conclusion, early complement pathway gene variants were consistently associated with structural and functional measures of multiple sclerosis severity. These results from unbiased analyses are strongly supported by several prior reports that mechanistically implicated early complement factors in neurodegeneration. ",

        "Significant Upregulation of Alzheimer's \u03b2-Amyloid Levels in a Living System Induced by Extracellular Elastin Polypeptides. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder and the primary cause of age-related dementia. The etiology of AD is complex and has not been completely elucidated. Herein, we report that treatment with elastin-like polypeptides (ELPs), a component of the brain extracellular matrix (ECM), significantly increased the levels of AD-related amyloid-\u03b2 peptides (A\u03b2) both in\u2005vitro and in\u2005vivo. Regarding the molecular mechanism(s), the upregulation of A\u03b2 levels was related to increased proteolytic processing of the amyloid precursor protein. Furthermore, nesting tests demonstrated that the ELP-treated animals showed significant neurobehavioral deficits with cognitive impairment. These results suggest that the elastin is associated with AD-related pathological and behavioral changes. This finding presents a new aspect for Alzheimer's amyloidosis event and provides a great promise in developing ELP-based model systems to better understand the pathogenesis of AD. ",
        "Altered structural brain asymmetry in autism spectrum disorder in a study of 54 datasets. Altered structural brain asymmetry in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has been reported. However, findings have been inconsistent, likely due to limited sample sizes. Here we investigated 1,774 individuals with ASD and 1,809 controls, from 54 independent data sets of the ENIGMA consortium. ASD was significantly associated with alterations of cortical thickness asymmetry in mostly medial frontal, orbitofrontal, cingulate and inferior temporal areas, and also with asymmetry of orbitofrontal surface area. These differences generally involved reduced asymmetry in individuals with ASD compared to controls. Furthermore, putamen volume asymmetry was significantly increased in ASD. The largest case-control effect size was Cohen's d\u2009=\u2009-0.13, for asymmetry of superior frontal cortical thickness. Most effects did not depend on age, sex, IQ, severity or medication use. Altered lateralized neurodevelopment may therefore be a feature of ASD, affecting widespread brain regions with diverse functions. Large-scale analysis was necessary to quantify subtle alterations of brain structural asymmetry in ASD. ",
        "Design and rationale of the North Indian ST-Segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction Registry: A prospective cohort study. ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) is associated with increased mortality and morbidity. Although remarkable progress has been made in the management of STEMI in high-income countries, contemporary data to evaluate processes and outcomes of STEMI care in India is limited. The North Indian ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NORIN STEMI) registry is a prospective cohort study based at government funded and largely free of cost tertiary medical centers in New Delhi, India. These hospitals serve a large proportion of the patients with lower socioeconomic status presenting from multiple states in India, as many centers in these states lack adequate specialized cardiovascular care. The study has been approved by the Institutional Review Boards of each institution and informed consent has been obtained from study participants. The NORIN STEMI registry aims to provide important insights regarding contemporary risk factors profiles, practice patterns, and prognosis in patients with STEMI in an underserved population in North India. These findings may identify opportunities to improve the outcomes of patients with STEMI in India. ",
        "Cardiomyocyte Homeodomain-Interacting Protein Kinase 2 Maintains Basal Cardiac Function via Extracellular Signal-Regulated Kinase Signaling. BACKGROUND: Cardiac kinases play a critical role in the development of heart failure, and represent potential tractable therapeutic targets. However, only a very small fraction of the cardiac kinome has been investigated. To identify novel cardiac kinases involved in heart failure, we used an integrated transcriptomics and bioinformatics analysis and identified Homeodomain-Interacting Protein Kinase 2 (HIPK2) as a novel candidate kinase. The role of HIPK2 in cardiac biology is unknown. METHODS: We used the Expression2Kinase algorithm for the screening of kinase targets. To determine the role of HIPK2 in the heart, we generated cardiomyocyte (CM)-specific HIPK2 knockout and heterozygous mice. Heart function was examined by echocardiography, and related cellular and molecular mechanisms were examined. Adeno-associated virus serotype 9 carrying cardiac-specific constitutively active MEK1 (TnT-MEK1-CA) was administrated to rescue cardiac dysfunction in CM-HIPK2 knockout mice. RESULTS: To our knowledge, this is the first study to define the role of HIPK2 in cardiac biology. Using multiple HIPK2 loss-of-function mouse models, we demonstrated that reduction of HIPK2 in CMs leads to cardiac dysfunction, suggesting a causal role in heart failure. It is important to note that cardiac dysfunction in HIPK2 knockout mice developed with advancing age, but not during development. In addition, CM-HIPK2 knockout mice and CM-HIPK2 heterozygous mice exhibited a gene dose-response relationship of CM-HIPK2 on heart function. HIPK2 expression in the heart was significantly reduced in human end-stage ischemic cardiomyopathy in comparison to nonfailing myocardium, suggesting a clinical relevance of HIPK2 in cardiac biology. In vitro studies with neonatal rat ventricular CMscorroborated the in vivo findings. Specifically, adenovirus-mediated overexpression of HIPK2 suppressed the expression of heart failure markers, NPPA and NPPB, at basal condition and abolished phenylephrine-induced pathological gene expression. An array of mechanistic studies revealed impaired extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 signaling in HIPK2-deficient hearts. An in vivo rescue experiment with adeno-associated virus serotype 9 TnT-MEK1-CA nearly abolished the detrimental phenotype of knockout mice, suggesting that impaired extracellular signal-regulated kinase signaling mediated apoptosis as the key factor driving the detrimental phenotype in CM-HIPK2 knockout mice hearts. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, these findings suggest that CM-HIPK2 is required to maintain normal cardiac function via extracellular signal-regulated kinase signaling. ",
        "Dissecting primate early post-implantation development using long-term in vitro embryo culture. The transition from peri-implantation to gastrulation in mammals entails the specification and organization of the lineage progenitors into a body plan. Technical and ethical challenges have limited understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms that underlie this transition. We established a culture system that enabled the development of cynomolgus monkey embryos in vitro for up to 20 days. Cultured embryos underwent key primate developmental stages, including lineage segregation, bilaminar disc formation, amniotic and yolk sac cavitation, and primordial germ cell-like cell (PGCLC) differentiation. Single-cell RNA-sequencing analysis revealed development trajectories of primitive endoderm, trophectoderm, epiblast lineages, and PGCLCs. Analysis of single-cell chromatin accessibility identified transcription factors specifying each cell type. Our results reveal critical developmental events and complex molecular mechanisms underlying nonhuman primate embryogenesis in the early postimplantation period, with possible relevance to human development.

        "Measles virus infection diminishes preexisting antibodies that offer protection from other pathogens. Measles virus is directly responsible for more than 100,000 deaths yearly. Epidemiological studies have associated measles with increased morbidity and mortality for years after infection, but the reasons why are poorly understood. Measles virus infects immune cells, causing acute immune suppression. To identify and quantify long-term effects of measles on the immune system, we used VirScan, an assay that tracks antibodies to thousands of pathogen epitopes in blood. We studied 77 unvaccinated children before and 2 months after natural measles virus infection. Measles caused elimination of 11 to 73% of the antibody repertoire across individuals. Recovery of antibodies was detected after natural reexposure to pathogens. Notably, these immune system effects were not observed in infants vaccinated against MMR (measles, mumps, and rubella), but were confirmed in measles-infected macaques. The reduction in humoral immune memory after measles infection generates potential vulnerability to future infections, underscoring the need for widespread vaccination. ",
        "Elexacaftor-Tezacaftor-Ivacaftor for Cystic Fibrosis with a Single Phe508del Allele. BACKGROUND: Cystic fibrosis is caused by mutations in the gene encoding the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein, and nearly 90% of patients have at least one copy of the Phe508del CFTR mutation. In a phase 2 trial involving patients who were heterozygous for the Phe508del CFTR mutation and a minimal-function mutation (Phe508del-minimal function genotype), the next-generation CFTR corrector elexacaftor, in combination with tezacaftor and ivacaftor, improved Phe508del CFTR function and clinical outcomes. METHODS: We conducted a phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to confirm the efficacy and safety of elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor in patients 12 years of age or older with cystic fibrosis with Phe508del-minimal function genotypes. Patients were randomly assigned to receive elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor or placebo for 24 weeks. The primary end point was absolute change from baseline in percentage of predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) at week 4. RESULTS: A total of 403 patients underwent randomization and received at least one dose of active treatment or placebo. Elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor, relative to placebo, resulted in a percentage of predicted FEV1 that was 13.8 points higher at 4 weeks and 14.3 points higher through 24 weeks, a rate of pulmonary exacerbations that was 63% lower, a respiratory domain score on the Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire-Revised (range, 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating a higher patient-reported quality of life with regard to respiratory symptoms; minimum clinically important difference, 4 points) that was 20.2 points higher, and a sweat chloride concentration that was 41.8 mmol per liter lower (P<0.001 for all comparisons). Elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor was generally safe and had an acceptable side-effect profile. Most patients had adverse events that were mild or moderate. Adverse events leading to discontinuation of the trial regimen occurred in 1% of the patients in the elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor group. CONCLUSIONS: Elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor was efficacious in patients with cystic fibrosis with Phe508del-minimal function genotypes, in whom previous CFTR modulator regimens were ineffective.

        "Engineered amphiphilic peptides enable delivery of proteins and CRISPR-associated nucleases to airway epithelia. The delivery of biologic cargoes to airway epithelial cells is challenging due to the formidable barriers imposed by its specialized and differentiated cells. Among cargoes, recombinant proteins offer therapeutic promise but the lack of effective delivery methods limits their development. Here, we achieve protein and SpCas9 or AsCas12a ribonucleoprotein (RNP) delivery to cultured human well-differentiated airway epithelial cells and mouse lungs with engineered amphiphilic peptides. These shuttle peptides, non-covalently combined with GFP protein or CRISPR-associated nuclease (Cas) RNP, allow rapid entry into cultured human ciliated and non-ciliated epithelial cells and mouse airway epithelia. Instillation of shuttle peptides combined with SpCas9 or AsCas12a RNP achieves editing of loxP sites in airway epithelia of ROSAmT/mG mice. We observe no evidence of short-term toxicity with a widespread distribution restricted to the respiratory tract. This peptide-based technology advances potential therapeutic avenues for protein and Cas RNP delivery to refractory airway epithelial cells. ",
        "Human and Nonhuman Primate Lineage-Specific Footprints in the Salivary Proteome. Proteins in saliva are needed for preprocessing food in the mouth, maintenance of tooth mineralization, and protection from microbial pathogens. Novel insights into human lineage-specific functions of salivary proteins and clues to their involvement in human disease can be gained through evolutionary studies, as recently shown for salivary amylase AMY1 and salivary agglutinin DMBT1/gp340. However, the entirety of proteins in saliva, the salivary proteome, has not yet been investigated from an evolutionary perspective. Here, we compared the proteomes of human saliva and the saliva of our closest extant evolutionary relatives, chimpanzees and gorillas, using macaques as an outgroup, with the aim to uncover features in saliva protein composition that are unique to each species. We found that humans produce a waterier saliva, containing less than half total protein than great apes and Old World monkeys. For all major salivary proteins in humans, we could identify counterparts in chimpanzee and gorilla saliva. However, we discovered unique protein profiles in saliva of humans that were distinct from those of nonhuman primates. These findings open up the possibility that dietary differences and pathogenic pressures may have shaped a distinct salivary proteome in the human lineage. ",
        "High-Intensity Walking Time Is a Key Determinant to Increase Physical Fitness and Improve Health Outcomes After Interval Walking Training in Middle-Aged and Older People. OBJECTIVE: To examine the effects of interval walking training (IWT) on the estimated peak aerobic capacity (eV\u02d9O2peak) and lifestyle-related disease (LSD) score while focusing on exercise intensity and volume in middle-aged and older people. PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS: Men and women (N=679; mean age, 65\u00b17 SD years) completed 5-month IWT. Participants were instructed to repeat 5 or more sets of fast and slow walking for 3 minutes each at 70% or more and 40% eV\u02d9O2peak for walking, respectively, per day for 4 or more d/wk. This study was conducted from April 1, 2005, through February 29,\u00a02008. RESULTS: Interval walking training increased eV\u02d9O2peak by 14% and decreased LSD score by 17% on average (P<.001). During 5-month IWT, fast and slow walking times were 88\u00b165 SD and 100\u00b186 min/wk, respectively, but varied among participants. We divided participants into approximately 10 bins for 6 minutes each of fast and slow walking times per week up to 60 min/wk, and above this time, approximately 8 bins for 30 or 60 minutes each of fast and slow walking up to the maximal time. We found that both eV\u02d9O2peak and LSD score improved as fast walking time per week increased up to 50 min/wk (R2=0.94; P<.001 for eV\u02d9O2peak; R2=0.51; P=.03 for LSDS) but plateaued above this time. In contrast, improvement in neither eV\u02d9O2peak nor LSDS was positively correlated with slow or total walking time per week. Multiple regression analyses confirmed that fast walking time per week was the major determinant of improvements in eV\u02d9O2peak (P<.001) and LSD score (P=.001). CONCLUSION: High-intensity walking time during IWT is a key factor to increase eV\u02d9O2peak and decrease LSD score in middle-aged and older people. ",
        "Hypoxaemia in hospitalised children and neonates: A prospective cohort study in Nigerian secondary-level hospitals. Background: Hypoxaemia is a common complication of pneumonia and a major risk factor for death, but less is known about hypoxaemia in other common conditions. We evaluated the epidemiology of hypoxaemia and oxygen use in hospitalised neonates and children in Nigeria. Methods: We conducted a prospective cohort study among neonates and children (<15 years of age) admitted to 12 secondary-level hospitals in southwest Nigeria (November 2015-November 2017) using data extracted from clinical records (documented during routine care). We report summary statistics on hypoxaemia prevalence, oxygen use, and clinical predictors of hypoxaemia. We used generalised linear mixed-models to calculate relative odds of death (hypoxaemia vs not). Findings: Participating hospitals admitted 23,926 neonates and children during the study period. Pooled hypoxaemia prevalence was 22.2% (95%CI 21.2-23.2) for neonates and 10.2% (9.7-10.8) for children. Hypoxaemia was common among children with acute lower respiratory infection (28.0%), asthma (20.4%), meningitis/encephalitis (17.4%), malnutrition (16.3%), acute febrile encephalopathy (15.4%), sepsis (8.7%) and malaria (8.5%), and neonates with neonatal encephalopathy (33.4%), prematurity (26.6%), and sepsis (21.0%). Hypoxaemia increased the adjusted odds of death 6-fold in neonates and 7-fold in children. Clinical signs predicted hypoxaemia poorly, and their predictive ability varied across ages and conditions. Hypoxaemic children received oxygen for a median of 2-3 days, consuming \u223c3500\u202fL of oxygen per admission. Interpretation: Hypoxaemia is common in respiratory and non-respiratory acute childhood illness and increases the risk of death substantially. Given the limitations of clinical signs, pulse oximetry is an essential tool for detecting hypoxaemia, and should be part of the routine assessment of all hospitalised neonates and children. ",
        "Stem cell-driven lymphatic remodeling coordinates tissue regeneration. Tissues rely on stem cells (SCs) for homeostasis and wound repair. SCs reside in specialized microenvironments (niches) whose complexities and roles in orchestrating tissue growth are still unfolding. Here, we identify lymphatic capillaries as critical SC-niche components. In skin, lymphatics form intimate networks around hair follicle (HF) SCs. When HFs regenerate, lymphatic-SC connections become dynamic. Using a mouse model, we unravel a secretome switch in SCs that controls lymphatic behavior. Resting SCs express angiopoietin-like protein 7 (Angptl7), promoting lymphatic drainage. Activated SCs switch to Angptl4, triggering transient lymphatic dissociation and reduced drainage. When lymphatics are perturbed or the secretome switch is disrupted, HFs cycle precociously and tissue regeneration becomes asynchronous. In unearthing lymphatic capillaries as a critical SC-niche element, we have learned how SCs coordinate their activity across a tissue. ",
        "STING Signaling in Melanoma Cells Shapes Antigenicity and Can Promote Antitumor T-cell Activity. STING (stimulator of IFN genes) signaling is an innate immune pathway for induction of a spontaneous antitumor T-cell response against certain immunogenic tumors. Although antigen-presenting cells are known to be involved in this process, insight into the participation of tumor cell-intrinsic STING signaling remains weak. In this study, we find diversity in the regulation of STING signaling across a panel of human melanoma cell lines. We show that intact activation of STING signaling in a subset of human melanoma cell lines enhances both their antigenicity and susceptibility to lysis by human melanoma tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) through the augmentation of MHC class I expression. Conversely, defects in the STING signaling pathway protect melanoma cells from increased immune recognition by TILs and limit their sensitivity to TIL lysis. Based on these findings, we propose that defects in tumor cell-intrinsic STING signaling can mediate not only tumor immune evasion but also resistance to TIL-based immunotherapies. ",
        "Traumatic microbleeds suggest vascular injury and predict disability in traumatic brain injury. Traumatic microbleeds are small foci of hypointensity seen on T2*-weighted MRI in patients following head trauma that have previously been considered a marker of axonal injury. The linear appearance and location of some traumatic microbleeds suggests a vascular origin. The aims of this study were to: (i) identify and characterize traumatic microbleeds in patients with acute traumatic brain injury; (ii) determine whether appearance of traumatic microbleeds predict clinical outcome; and (iii) describe the pathology underlying traumatic microbleeds in an index patient. Patients presenting to the emergency department following acute head trauma who received a head CT were enrolled within 48 h of injury and received a research MRI. Disability was defined using Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended \u22646 at follow-up. All magnetic resonance images were interpreted prospectively and were used for subsequent analysis of traumatic microbleeds. Lesions on T2* MRI were stratified based on 'linear' streak-like or 'punctate' petechial-appearing traumatic microbleeds. The brain of an enrolled subject imaged acutely was procured following death for evaluation of traumatic microbleeds using MRI targeted pathology methods. Of the 439 patients enrolled over 78 months, 31% (134/439) had evidence of punctate and/or linear traumatic microbleeds on MRI. Severity of injury, mechanism of injury, and CT findings were associated with traumatic microbleeds on MRI. The presence of traumatic microbleeds was an independent predictor of disability (P < 0.05; odds ratio = 2.5). No differences were found between patients with punctate versus linear appearing microbleeds. Post-mortem imaging and histology revealed traumatic microbleed co-localization with iron-laden macrophages, predominately seen in perivascular space. Evidence of axonal injury was not observed in co-localized histopathological sections. Traumatic microbleeds were prevalent in the population studied and predictive of worse outcome. The source of traumatic microbleed signal on MRI appeared to be iron-laden macrophages in the perivascular space tracking a network of injured vessels. While axonal injury in association with traumatic microbleeds cannot be excluded, recognizing traumatic microbleeds as a form of traumatic vascular injury may aid in identifying patients who could benefit from new therapies targeting the injured vasculature and secondary injury to parenchyma.

        "Objectively Measured Physical Activity Reduces the Risk of Mortality among Brazilian Older Adults. OBJECTIVES: Use of objectively measured physical activity (PA) in older adults to assess relationship between PA and risk of all-causes mortality is scarce. This study evaluated the associations of PA based on accelerometry and a questionnaire with the risk of mortality among older adults from a city in Southern Brazil. DESIGN: A cohort study. SETTING: Urban area of Pelotas, Southern Brazil. PARTICIPANTS: A representative sample of older adults (\u226560 y) from Pelotas, enrolled in 2014. MEASUREMENTS: Overall physical activity (mg), light physical activity (LPA), and moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) were estimated by raw accelerometer data. The International Physical Activity Questionnaire estimated leisure time and commuting PA. Hazard ratios (excluding deaths in the first 6 mo) stratified by sex were estimated by Cox regression analysis considering adjustment for confounders. RESULTS: From the 1451 older adults interviewed in 2014, 145 died (10%) after a follow-up of an average 2.6\u2009years. Men and women in the highest tertile of overall PA had on average a 77% and 92% lower risk of mortality than their less active counterparts (95% confidence interval [CI] = .06-.84 and 95% CI = .01-.65, respectively). The highest tertile of LPA was also related to a lower risk of mortality in individuals of both sexes (74% and 91% lower risk among men and women, respectively). MVPA statistically reduced the risk of mortality only among women (hazard ratio [HR] = .30 and HR = .07 in the second and third tertiles). Self-reported leisure-time PA was statistically associated with a lower risk of mortality only among men. Women in the highest tertiles of commuting PA showed a lower risk of mortality than those in the reference group.

Multilayered skin substitutes comprising allogeneic cells have been tested for the treatment of nonhealing cutaneous ulcers. However, such nonnative skin grafts fail to permanently engraft because they lack dermal vascular networks important for integration with the host tissue. In this study, we describe the fabrication of an implantable multilayered vascularized bioengineered skin graft using 3D bioprinting. The graft is formed using one bioink containing human foreskin dermal fibroblasts (FBs), human endothelial cells (ECs) derived from cord blood human endothelial colony-forming cells (HECFCs), and human placental pericytes (PCs) suspended in rat tail type I collagen to form a dermis followed by printing with a second bioink containing human foreskin keratinocytes (KCs) to form an epidermis. In vitro, KCs replicate and mature to form a multilayered barrier, while the ECs and PCs self-assemble into interconnected microvascular networks. The PCs in the dermal bioink associate with EC-lined vascular structures and appear to improve KC maturation. When these 3D printed grafts are implanted on the dorsum of immunodeficient mice, the human EC-lined structures inosculate with mouse microvessels arising from the wound bed and become perfused within 4 weeks after implantation. The presence of PCs in the printed dermis enhances the invasion of the graft by host microvessels and the formation of an epidermal rete. Impact Statement Three Dimensional printing can be used to generate multilayered vascularized human skin grafts that can potentially overcome the limitations of graft survival observed in current avascular skin substitutes. Inclusion of human pericytes in the dermal bioink appears to improve both dermal and epidermal maturation. ",
        "Mutations in PCYT2 disrupt etherlipid biosynthesis and cause a complex hereditary spastic paraplegia. CTP:phosphoethanolamine cytidylyltransferase (ET), encoded by PCYT2, is the rate-limiting enzyme for phosphatidylethanolamine synthesis via the CDP-ethanolamine pathway. Phosphatidylethanolamine is one of the most abundant membrane lipids and is particularly enriched in the brain. We identified five individuals with biallelic PCYT2 variants clinically characterized by global developmental delay with regression, spastic para- or tetraparesis, epilepsy and progressive cerebral and cerebellar atrophy. Using patient fibroblasts we demonstrated that these variants are hypomorphic, result in altered but residual ET protein levels and concomitant reduced enzyme activity without affecting mRNA levels. The significantly better survival of hypomorphic CRISPR-Cas9 generated pcyt2 zebrafish knockout compared to a complete knockout, in conjunction with previously described data on the Pcyt2 mouse model, indicates that complete loss of ET function may be incompatible with life in vertebrates. Lipidomic analysis revealed profound lipid abnormalities in patient fibroblasts impacting both neutral etherlipid and etherphospholipid metabolism. Plasma lipidomics studies also identified changes in etherlipids that have the potential to be used as biomarkers for ET deficiency. In conclusion, our data establish PCYT2 as a disease gene for a new complex hereditary spastic paraplegia and confirm that etherlipid homeostasis is important for the development and function of the brain.

        "Filovirus-reactive antibodies in humans and bats in Northeast India imply zoonotic spillover. Bats are reservoirs for several zoonotic pathogens, including filoviruses. Recent work highlights the diversity of bat borne filoviruses in Asia. High risk activities at the bat-human interface pose the threat of zoonotic virus transmission. We present evidence for prior exposure of bat harvesters and two resident fruit bat species to filovirus surface glycoproteins by screening sera in a multiplexed serological assay. Antibodies reactive to two antigenically distinct filoviruses were detected in human sera and to three individual filoviruses in bats in remote Northeast India. Sera obtained from Eonycteris spelaea bats showed similar patterns of cross-reactivity as human samples, suggesting them as the species responsible for the spillover. In contrast, sera from Rousettus leschenaultii bats reacted to two different virus glycoproteins. Our results indicate circulation of several filoviruses in bats and the possibility for filovirus transmission from bats to humans. ",
        "MR-pheWAS with stratification and interaction: Searching for the causal effects of smoking heaviness identified an effect on facial aging. Mendelian randomization (MR) is an established approach to evaluate the effect of an exposure on an outcome. The gene-by-environment (GxE) study design can be used to determine whether the genetic instrument affects the outcome through pathways other than via the exposure of interest (horizontal pleiotropy). MR phenome-wide association studies (MR-pheWAS) search for the effects of an exposure, and can be conducted in UK Biobank using the PHESANT package. In this proof-of-principle study, we introduce the novel GxE MR-pheWAS approach, that combines MR-pheWAS with the use of GxE interactions. This method aims to identify the presence of effects of an exposure while simultaneously investigating horizontal pleiotropy. We systematically test for the presence of causal effects of smoking heaviness-stratifying on smoking status (ever versus never)-as an exemplar. If a genetic variant is associated with smoking heaviness (but not smoking initiation), and this variant affects an outcome (at least partially) via tobacco intake, we would expect the effect of the variant on the outcome to differ in ever versus never smokers. We used PHESANT to test for the presence of effects of smoking heaviness, instrumented by genetic variant rs16969968, among never and ever smokers respectively, in UK Biobank. We ranked results by the strength of interaction between ever and never smokers. We replicated previously established effects of smoking heaviness, including detrimental effects on lung function. Novel results included a detrimental effect of heavier smoking on facial aging. We have demonstrated how GxE MR-pheWAS can be used to identify potential effects of an exposure, while simultaneously assessing whether results may be biased by horizontal pleiotropy. ",
        "Unbalanced dendritic inhibition of CA1 neurons drives spatial-memory deficits in the Ts2Cje Down syndrome model. Overinhibition is assumed one of the main causes of cognitive deficits (e.g. memory impairment) in mouse models of Down syndrome (DS). Yet the mechanisms that drive such exaggerated synaptic inhibition and their behavioral effects remain unclear. Here we report the existence of bidirectional alterations to the synaptic inhibition on CA1 pyramidal cells in the Ts2Cje mouse model of DS which are associated to impaired spatial memory. Furthermore, we identify triplication of the kainate receptor (KAR) encoding gene Grik1 as the cause of these phenotypes. Normalization of Grik1 dosage in Ts2Cje mice specifically restored spatial memory and reversed the bidirectional alterations to CA1 inhibition, but not the changes in synaptic plasticity or the other behavioral modifications observed. We propose that modified information gating caused by disturbed inhibitory tone rather than generalized overinhibition underlies some of the characteristic cognitive deficits in DS. ",
        "Effect of Surgical Versus Medical Therapy on Diabetic Kidney Disease Over 5 Years in Severely Obese Adolescents With Type 2 Diabetes. OBJECTIVE: To compare diabetic kidney disease (DKD) rates over 5 years of follow-up in two cohorts of severely obese adolescents with type 2 diabetes (T2D) undergoing medical or surgical treatment for T2D. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A secondary analysis was performed of data collected from obese participants of similar age and racial distribution enrolled in the Teen-Longitudinal Assessment of Bariatric Surgery (Teen-LABS) and the Treatment Options of Type 2 Diabetes in Adolescents and Youth (TODAY) studies. Teen-LABS participants underwent metabolic bariatric surgery (MBS). TODAY participants were randomized to metformin alone or in combination with rosiglitazone or intensive lifestyle intervention, with insulin therapy given for glycemic progression. Glycemic control, BMI, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), urinary albumin excretion (UAE), and prevalence of hyperfiltration (eGFR \u2265135 mL/min/1.73 m2) and elevated UAE (\u226530 mg/g) were assessed annually. RESULTS: Participants with T2D from Teen-LABS (n = 30, mean \u00b1 SD age, 16.9 \u00b1 1.3 years; 70% female; 60% white; BMI 54.4 \u00b1 9.5 kg/m2) and TODAY (n = 63, age 15.3 \u00b1 1.3 years; 56% female; 71% white; BMI 40.5 \u00b1 4.9 kg/m2) were compared. During 5 years of follow-up, hyperfiltration decreased from 21% to 18% in Teen-LABS and increased from 7% to 48% in TODAY. Elevated UAE decreased from 27% to 5% in Teen-LABS and increased from 21% to 43% in TODAY. Adjusting for baseline age, sex, BMI, and HbA1c, TODAY participants had a greater odds of hyperfiltration (odds ratio 15.7 [95% CI 2.6, 94.3]) and elevated UAE (27.3 [4.9, 149.9]) at 5 years of follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with MBS, medical treatment of obese youth with T2D was associated with a higher odds of DKD over 5 years. ",
        "Volumetric Prefrontal Cortex Alterations in Patients With Alcohol Dependence and the Involvement of Self-Control. BACKGROUND: Aspects of self-control such as sensation seeking and impaired impulse control have been implicated in alcohol dependence (ALC). Conversely, sensation seeking has been ascribed a possible protective role in stress-related psychopathologies. We therefore examined gray matter (GM) morphology in individuals with ALC, focusing on differences in prefrontal regions that have been associated with self-control. Additionally, we accounted for differences in lifetime alcohol intake regarding self-control measures and cortical structures in ALC patients. METHODS: With voxel-based morphometry (VBM) focusing on prefrontal a priori defined regions of interest, we assessed a group of 62 detoxified ALC patients and 62 healthy controls (HC). ALC patients were subsequently divided into high (n\u00a0=\u00a09) and low consumers (n\u00a0=\u00a053). Self-control was assessed by use of the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale and the Sensation Seeking Scale. RESULTS: Compared to HC, ALC had significantly less GM volume in bilateral middle frontal gyrus (MFG) and right medial prefrontal cortex as well as in the right anterior cingulate. High-consuming ALC showed smaller GM in right orbitofrontal cortex as well as lower sensation seeking scores than low consumers. In low-consuming ALC, right MFG-GM was positively associated with magnitude of sensation seeking; particularly, larger MFG-GM correlated with greater thrill and adventure seeking. CONCLUSION: Thus, our findings (i) indicate deficient GM volume in prefrontal areas related to self-control and (ii) might accentuate the phenotypic divergence of ALC patients and emphasize the importance of the development of individual treatment options.

        "Relative Head Impact Exposure and Brain White Matter Alterations After a Single Season of Competitive Football: A Pilot Comparison of Youth Versus High School Football. OBJECTIVE: Youth athletes are believed to be more susceptible to white matter (WM) degradation resulting from head impact exposure relative to high school (HS) athletes; this hypothesis has not been objectively tested. The purpose of this study was to determine preseason to postseason changes in WM integrity from repetitive head impacts for youth football (YFB) players compared with HS football players during a competitive football season. DESIGN: Prospective cohort. SETTING: One season of YFB (grades 7 and 8) and varsity HS football (grades 10-12). PATIENTS OR OTHER PARTICIPANTS: Twelve YFB (13.08 \u00b1 0.64 years) and 21 HS (17.5 \u00b1 0.78 years) athletes. INTERVENTIONS: Participants completed 2 magnetic resonance imaging sessions: preseason and postseason. Head impact exposure was recorded during practice and games using a helmet-mounted accelerometer. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Tract-based spatial statistics were used to evaluate group differences in preseason to postseason changes in diffusion tensor imaging, including fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity (MD), axial diffusivity (AD), and radial diffusivity (RD). RESULTS: The HS group exhibited significant preseason to postseason reductions in MD, AD, and RD (P < 0.05, corrected) in widespread WM areas. Significant WM reductions for the YFB group were only observed for AD (P < 0.05, corrected), but was more limited in extent compared with HS. CONCLUSIONS: Significant preseason to postseason AD reduction was found in both YFB and HS groups after one season of competitive play. Our results did not confirm recent speculation that younger children are more susceptible to the deleterious effects of repetitive head impacts compared with their older counterparts. ",
        "Household income and contraceptive methods among female youth: a cross-sectional study using the Canadian Community Health Survey (2009-2010 and 2013-2014). BACKGROUND: Low socioeconomic status is one of many barriers that may limit access to family planning services. We aimed to examine the relation between household income and contraceptive methods among female youth in Canada. METHODS: Our study population included sexually active females aged 15-24 who were trying to avoid pregnancy. We used cross-sectional data from the 2009-2010 and 2013-2014 cycles of the Canadian Community Health Survey to compare household income and other sociodemographic covariates for those using oral contraceptives, injectable contraceptives, condoms or a dual method (condoms plus oral or injectable contraceptives). RESULTS: Of female youth at risk for unintended pregnancy, 59.2% reported using oral contraceptives, 29.0% used dual methods, 16.8% used condoms only, 2.5% used injectable contraceptives and 13.6% did not use contraception. In multiple regression models, lower annual household income (< $80 000) was associated with decreased use of oral contraceptives (relative risk [RR] 0.85, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.80-0.91) and dual methods (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.71-0.91), increased use of condoms (RR 1.36, 95% CI 1.11-1.67) and injectable contraceptives (RR 1.69, 95% CI 0.98-2.92), and a greater risk of contraceptive nonuse (RR 1.19, 95% CI 0.94-1.50). INTERPRETATION: We found that lower household income was associated with decreased use of oral contraceptives and increased reliance on injectable contraceptives and condoms only. Young, low-income females may face barriers to accessing the full range of contraceptive methods available in Canada. Easier access to affordable contraception may decrease the number of female youth at risk for unintended pregnancy due to financial barriers. ",
        "The Role of Drugs in Alcohol Poisoning and Blackout Events: A Latent Class Analysis of a Residential Treatment Sample. BACKGROUND: Alcohol can lead to fatal and nonfatal overdose (OD) through its neurobiological inhibitory effects when used alone or with other drugs. Little research has examined alcohol OD characteristics in the context of concomitant drug use. METHODS: This study utilized alcohol OD data (defined as alcohol poisoning, passing out, or blacking out) collected in a large residential addiction treatment facility (N\u00a0=\u00a0660). Latent class analysis identified classes of alcohol OD events based on concomitant drug use at the time of OD. We evaluated correlates of alcohol OD classes, including depression, emergency medical services, and hospitalization, using latent class regression. RESULTS: Only 20% of alcohol ODs involved alcohol alone. Marijuana was the most\u00a0commonly used drug during the most recent alcohol OD (43.2%), followed by sedatives (27.9%), cocaine or crack (25.9%), prescription opioids (26.1%), and heroin (20%). The final latent class model included 3 classes: no/low drug involvement (61%), moderate drug involvement (33%), and high drug involvement (6%). Relative to the no/low drug involvement class, participants admitted to the hospital were 6.4-fold more likely to be in the high drug involvement class (95% CI: 2.4 to 16.6) and 2.9-fold more likely to be in the moderate drug involvement class (95% CI: 1.2 to 7.2). Participants receiving emergency medical services were more likely to be in the high drug involvement class (aOR: 2.2, 95% CI: 2.2, 1.1 to 4.5) and less likely to be in the moderate drug involvement class (aOR 0.39, 95% CI: 0.2 to 0.96). CONCLUSIONS: Combining drug classes with alcohol prior to OD was common and associated with a higher likelihood of hospitalization. Overdose prevention efforts should address acute risks of alcohol ingestion with other drugs. ",
        "Defining the layers of a sensory cilium with STORM and cryoelectron nanoscopy. Primary cilia carry out numerous signaling and sensory functions, and defects in them, \"ciliopathies,\" cause a range of symptoms, including blindness. Understanding of their nanometer-scale ciliary substructures and their disruptions in ciliopathies has been hindered by limitations of conventional microscopic techniques. We have combined cryoelectron tomography, enhanced by subtomogram averaging, with superresolution stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (STORM) to define subdomains within the light-sensing rod sensory cilium of mouse retinas and reveal previously unknown substructures formed by resident proteins. Domains are demarcated by structural features such as the axoneme and its connections to the ciliary membrane, and are correlated with molecular markers of subcompartments, including the lumen and walls of the axoneme, the membrane glycocalyx, and the intervening cytoplasm. Within this framework, we report spatial distributions of key proteins in wild-type (WT) mice and the effects on them of genetic deficiencies in 3 models of Bardet-Biedl syndrome. ",
        "Imaging CAR T Cell Trafficking with eDHFR as a PET Reporter Gene. Cell-based therapeutics have considerable promise across diverse medical specialties; however, reliable human imaging of the distribution and trafficking of genetically engineered cells remains a challenge. We developed positron emission tomography (PET) probes based on the small-molecule antibiotic trimethoprim (TMP) that can be used to image the expression of the Escherichia coli dihydrofolate reductase enzyme (eDHFR) and tested the ability of [18F]-TMP, a fluorine-18 probe, to image primary human chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T\u00a0cells expressing the PET reporter gene eDHFR, yellow fluorescent protein (YFP), and Renilla luciferase (rLuc). Engineered T\u00a0cells showed an approximately 50-fold increased bioluminescent imaging signal and 10-fold increased [18F]-TMP uptake compared to controls in\u00a0vitro. eDHFR-expressing anti-GD2 CAR T\u00a0cells were then injected into mice bearing control GD2- and GD2+ tumors. PET/computed tomography (CT) images acquired on days 7 and 13 demonstrated early residency of CAR T\u00a0cells in the spleen followed by on-target redistribution to the GD2+ tumors. This was corroborated by autoradiography and anti-human CD8 immunohistochemistry. We found a high sensitivity of detection for identifying tumor-infiltrating CD8 CAR T\u00a0cells, \u223c11,000 cells per mm3. These data suggest that the [18F]-TMP/eDHFR PET pair offers important advantages that could better allow investigators to monitor immune cell trafficking to tumors in patients. ",
        "Dietary L-serine confers a competitive fitness advantage to Enterobacteriaceae in the inflamed gut. Metabolic reprogramming is associated with the adaptation of host cells to the disease environment, such as inflammation and cancer. However, little is known about microbial metabolic reprogramming or the role it plays in regulating the fitness of commensal and pathogenic bacteria in the gut. Here, we report that intestinal inflammation reprograms the metabolic pathways of Enterobacteriaceae, such as Escherichia coli LF82, in the gut to adapt to the inflammatory environment. We found that E. coli LF82 shifts its metabolism to catabolize L-serine in the inflamed gut in order to maximize its growth potential. However, L-serine catabolism has a minimal effect on its fitness in the healthy gut. In fact, the absence of genes involved in L-serine utilization reduces the competitive fitness of E. coli LF82 and Citrobacter rodentium only during inflammation. The concentration of luminal L-serine is largely dependent on dietary intake. Accordingly, withholding amino acids from the diet markedly reduces their availability in the gut lumen. Hence, inflammation-induced blooms of E. coli LF82 are significantly blunted when amino acids-particularly L-serine-are removed from the diet. Thus, the ability to catabolize L-serine increases bacterial fitness and provides Enterobacteriaceae with a growth advantage against competitors in the inflamed gut. ",
        "Extracellular NK histones promote immune cell anti-tumor activity by inducing cell clusters through binding to CD138 receptor. BACKGROUND: Natural killer (NK) cells are important anti-tumor cells of our innate immune system. Their anti-cancer activity is mediated through interaction of a wide array of activating and inhibitory receptors with their ligands on tumor cells. After activation, NK cells also secrete a variety of pro-inflammatory molecules that contribute to the final immune response by modulating other innate and adaptive immune cells. In this regard, external proteins from NK cell secretome and the mechanisms by which they mediate these responses are poorly defined. METHODS: TRANS-stable-isotope labeling of amino acids in cell culture (TRANS-SILAC) combined with proteomic was undertaken to identify early materials transferred between cord blood-derived NK cells (CB-NK) and multiple myeloma (MM) cells. Further in vitro and in vivo studies with knock-down of histones and CD138, overexpression of histones and addition of exogenous histones were undertaken to confirm TRANS-SILAC results and to determine functional roles of this material transferred. RESULTS: We describe a novel mechanism by which histones are actively released by NK cells early after contact with MM cells. We show that extracellular histones bind to the heparan sulfate proteoglycan CD138 on the surface of MM cells to promote the creation of immune-tumor cell clusters bringing immune and MM cells into close proximity, and thus facilitating not only NK but also T lymphocyte anti-MM activity. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates a novel immunoregulatory role of NK cells against MM cells mediated by histones, and an additional role of NK cells modulating T lymphocytes activity that will open up new avenues to design future immunotherapy clinical strategies.

        "Epidemiology of end-stage renal failure among twins and diagnosis, management, and current outcomes of kidney transplantation between identical twins. The aim of the study is to provide a comprehensive overview of identical twin kidney transplantation in the modern era. We provide epidemiologic trends in the US twin population from 1959 to 2000, current methods to identify zygosity, outcomes for identical twin transplants, and a comprehensive management strategy for identical twin kidney transplantation. By 2019, we project that 433\u00a0010 dizygotic and monozygotic twins will be alive and at risk for developing ESRF. Monozygosity between a donor-recipient pair can be confirmed by concordance in sex, blood type, and HLA antigen match with precision testing using 13/17 Short Tandem Repeat\u00a0sequencing to a likelihood of nearly 100%. Among identical twin transplants from 2001 to 2017, excellent patient and kidney graft survival rates were noted. Approximately 50% of kidney transplant recipients of identical twins transplant did not receive maintenance immunosuppression, and no differences in graft survival were noted among patients with and without immunosuppression at 6 and 12\u00a0months (P\u00a0=\u00a0.8 and .7). Patients with glomerulonephritis as the cause of ESRF had lower graft survival (P\u00a0=\u00a0.06) suggesting that recurrent glomerulonephritis as a likely cause of graft loss among these recipients.

        "Risk assessment of Ebola virus disease spreading in Uganda using a two-layer temporal network. Network-based modelling of infectious diseases apply compartmental models on a contact network, which makes the epidemic process crucially dependent on the network structure. For highly contagious diseases such as Ebola virus disease (EVD), interpersonal contact plays the most vital role in human-to-human transmission. Therefore, for accurate representation of EVD spreading, the contact network needs to resemble the reality. Prior research has mainly focused on static networks (only permanent contacts) or activity-driven networks (only temporal contacts) for Ebola spreading. A comprehensive network for EVD spreading should include both these network structures, as there are always some permanent contacts together with temporal contacts. Therefore, we propose a two-layer temporal network for Uganda, which is at risk of an Ebola outbreak from the neighboring Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) epidemic. The network has a permanent layer representing permanent contacts among individuals within the family level, and a data-driven temporal network for human movements motivated by cattle trade, fish trade, or general communications. We propose a Gillespie algorithm with the susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) compartmental model to simulate the evolution of EVD spreading as well as to evaluate the risk throughout our network. As an example, we applied our method to a network consisting of 23 districts along different movement routes in Uganda starting from bordering districts of the DRC to Kampala. Simulation results show that some regions are at higher risk of infection, suggesting some focal points for Ebola preparedness and providing direction to inform interventions in the field. Simulation results also show that decreasing physical contact as well as increasing preventive measures result in a reduction of chances to develop an outbreak. Overall, the main contribution of this paper lies in the novel method for risk assessment, which can be more precise with an increasing volume of accurate data for creating the network model. ",
        "Malignant Arrhythmias During Induction of Target Temperature Management After Cardiac Arrest. The aim of this study was to evaluate the incidence and determinants of malignant arrhythmias (MA) in patients with shock following out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) treated with targeted temperature management. Risk factors for the development of MA were prospectively analyzed in patients after OHCA. MA were defined as ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation with a duration >30 seconds, which had to be terminated by defibrillation. All patients were treated with therapeutic hypothermia for 24 hours. Demographics, OHCA details, interventions, and intensive care unit (ICU) treatment were recorded. A total of 55 patients were included, 11 (20%) of whom developed MA during the ICU stay. All MA occurred within the first 18 hours after admission. Patients who developed MA showed a stronger decrease in body temperature (\u0394 -2.4\u00b0C\u2009\u00b1\u20090.8\u00b0C vs. \u0394 -1.3\u00b0C\u2009\u00b1\u20091.3\u00b0C; p\u2009=\u20090.016) and in serum potassium levels (\u0394 -0.9\u2009\u00b1\u20091\u2009mmol/L vs. \u0394 -0.3\u2009\u00b1\u20090.6\u2009mmol/L; p\u2009=\u20090.037) during the cooling period compared with patients without MA. In the multivariable analysis, fast temperature decline as well as lower potassium levels were associated with MA. In addition, higher number of shocks during resuscitation and higher ICU epinephrine use were independent predictors of MA in patients with OHCA. The use of epinephrine as well as hypokalemia in context with intense cooling may increase the incidence of MA in patients with shock after cardiac arrest. Therefore, these therapeutic strategies should be applied with caution in this vulnerable group of patients. ",
        "Association of a School-Based, Asthma-Focused Telehealth Program With Emergency Department Visits Among Children Enrolled in South Carolina Medicaid. Importance: Telehealth may improve access to care for populations in rural communities. However, little is known about the effectiveness of telehealth programs designed for children. Objective: To examine the associations of a school-based telehealth program in Williamsburg county (South Carolina) with all-cause emergency department (ED) visits made by children enrolled in Medicaid. Design, Setting, and Participants: This Medicaid claims data analysis was conducted in Williamsburg county and 4 surrounding counties in South Carolina and included children aged 3 to 17 years who were enrolled in Medicaid and living in any of the 5 counties from January 2012 to December 2017. Williamsburg served as the intervention and the 4 surrounding counties without a telehealth program as the control; 2012 to 2014 was designated as the preintervention period, whereas 2015 to 2017 served as the postintervention period. The study was designed with a difference-in-differences specification, in which the unit-of-analysis was a child-month, and a subsample included children with asthma. The data analysis was performed from July 2018 to February 2019. Exposures: The school-based telehealth program implemented in Williamsburg county in 2015. Main Outcomes and Measures: The binary outcome was the status of at least 1 all-cause ED visit by a child in a given month. Results: The full sample included 2\u202f443\u202f405 child-months from 23\u202f198 children in Williamsburg county and 213\u202f164 children in the control counties. The mean (SD) proportions of monthly ED visits in Williamsburg were 3.65% (0.10%) during the preintervention and 3.87% (0.11%) during the postintervention. The corresponding proportions of the 4 control counties were 3.37% preintervention (0.04%), and 3.56% postintervention (0.04%), respectively. The trends in the proportion were paralleled. In the asthma subsample, the proportions in Williamsburg were 3.16% (0.31%) during the preintervention and 3.38% (0.34%) during the postintervention, respectively. The proportions for the control counties were 3.02% preintervention (0.10%) and 3.90% postintervention (0.11%), respectively. There was an interaction of the proportions between the pre/postintervention period and the intervention/control counties in this subsample. The regression analysis of the full sample showed no association of the telehealth program with ED visits. The additional analysis of the asthma subsample showed that this program was associated with a reduction of 0.66 (95% CI, -1.16 to -0.17; P\u2009<\u2009.01) percentage point per 100 children per month in ED visits, representing an approximately 21% relative decrease. Conclusions and Relevance: Although we found no association of this program with the ED visits of the overall studied population, this study suggests that telehealth with a focus on chronic pediatric diseases, such as asthma, may deliver substantial health benefits to rural and medically underserved communities.

        "Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders in a Pacific Southwest City: Maternal and Child Characteristics. BACKGROUND: There are limited data on the characteristics of children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) and their mothers from the general population in the United States. METHODS: During the 2012 and 2013 academic years, first-grade children in a large urban Pacific Southwest city were invited to participate in a study to estimate the prevalence of FASD. Children who screened positive on weight, height, or head circumference \u226425th centile or on parental report of developmental concerns were selected for evaluation, along with a random sample of those who screened negative. These children were examined for dysmorphology and neurobehavior and their mothers or collateral sources were interviewed. Children were classified as fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), partial fetal alcohol syndrome (pFAS), alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder (ARND), or No FASD. RESULTS: A total of 854 children were evaluated; 5 FAS, 44 pFAS, 44 ARND, and 761 No FASD. Children with FAS or pFAS were more likely to have dysmorphic features, and 32/49 (65.3%) of those met criteria for neurobehavioral impairment on cognitive measures with or without behavioral deficits. In contrast, 28/44 (63.6%) of children with ARND met criteria on behavioral measures alone. Mothers of FASD children were more likely to recognize pregnancy later, be unmarried, and report other substance use or psychiatric disorders, but did not differ on age, socioeconomic status, education, or parity. Mothers of FASD children reported more drinks/drinking day each trimester. The risk of FASD was elevated with increasing number of drinks/drinking day prior to pregnancy recognition, even at the level of 1 drink per day (adjusted odds ratio 3.802, 95% confidence interval 1.634, 8.374). CONCLUSIONS: Data from this general population sample in a large urban region in the United States demonstrate the variability of expression of FASD and point to risk and protective factors for mothers in this setting.

        "Mind-Body Therapies for Opioid-Treated Pain: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis. Importance: Mind-body therapies (MBTs) are emerging as potential tools for addressing the opioid crisis. Knowing whether mind-body therapies may benefit patients treated with opioids for acute, procedural, and chronic pain conditions may be useful for prescribers, payers, policy makers, and patients. Objective: To evaluate the association of MBTs with pain and opioid dose reduction in a diverse adult population with clinical pain. Data Sources: For this systematic review and meta-analysis, the MEDLINE, Embase, Emcare, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and Cochrane Library databases were searched for English-language randomized clinical trials and systematic reviews from date of inception to March 2018. Search logic included (pain OR analgesia OR opioids) AND mind-body therapies. The gray literature, ClinicalTrials.gov, and relevant bibliographies were also searched. Study Selection: Randomized clinical trials that evaluated the use of MBTs for symptom management in adults also prescribed opioids for clinical pain. Data Extraction and Synthesis: Independent reviewers screened citations, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. Meta-analyses were conducted using standardized mean differences in pain and opioid dose to obtain aggregate estimates of effect size with 95% CIs. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was pain intensity. The secondary outcomes were opioid dose, opioid misuse, opioid craving, disability, or function. Results: Of 4212 citations reviewed, 60 reports with 6404 participants were included in the meta-analysis. Overall, MBTs were associated with pain reduction (Cohen d\u2009=\u2009-0.51; 95% CI, -0.76 to -0.26) and reduced opioid dose (Cohen d\u2009=\u2009-0.26; 95% CI, -0.44 to -0.08). Studies tested meditation (n\u2009=\u20095), hypnosis (n\u2009=\u200925), relaxation (n\u2009=\u200914), guided imagery (n\u2009=\u20097), therapeutic suggestion (n\u2009=\u20096), and cognitive behavioral therapy (n\u2009=\u20097) interventions. Moderate to large effect size improvements in pain outcomes were found for meditation (Cohen d\u2009=\u2009-0.70), hypnosis (Cohen d\u2009=\u2009-0.54), suggestion (Cohen d\u2009=\u2009-0.68), and cognitive behavioral therapy (Cohen d\u2009=\u2009-0.43) but not for other MBTs. Although most meditation (n\u2009=\u20094 [80%]), cognitive-behavioral therapy (n\u2009=\u20094 [57%]), and hypnosis (n\u2009=\u200912 [63%]) studies found improved opioid-related outcomes, fewer studies of suggestion, guided imagery, and relaxation reported such improvements. Most MBT studies used active or placebo controls and were judged to be at low risk of bias. Conclusions and Relevance: The findings suggest that MBTs are associated with moderate improvements in pain and small reductions in opioid dose and may be associated with therapeutic benefits for opioid-related problems, such as opioid craving and misuse. Future studies should carefully quantify opioid dosing variables to determine the association of mind-body therapies with opioid-related outcomes. ",
        "Is Migration at Older Age Associated With Poorer Psychological Well-Being? Evidence from Chinese Older Immigrants in the United States. BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The migrating age of an individual has far-reaching implications for their acculturation experience, social integration, and well-being. This study addressed two questions: Is migrating at older age associated with poorer psychological well-being? If so, what factors account for such differences?. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Using data of 3,138 Chinese elderly people in Chicago, we compared the levels of depression and quality of life among individuals who migrated in young adulthood (before 35), adulthood (35-49), midlife (50-64), and later life (65+). Negative binominal and logistic regressions were performed to examine the associations between age at migration and the two outcomes, controlling for demographics and four sets of explanatory variables (socioeconomic status, health status, acculturation level, and family/social relations). RESULTS: The findings revealed mixed results. Migrating in later life was associated with more depressive symptoms, but also a higher chance of reporting good quality of life. Late-life immigrants' greater depression was partially contributed to their low income, lack of access to health care, poor physical health, and weak social relations. In contrast, regardless of the explanatory variables, migrating at middle age was associated with lower quality of life. DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS: Acknowledging that the older immigrant population is segmented with unique susceptibilities improves understanding of heterogeneity among the older immigrant populations and allows for targeted intervention. Gerontological practitioners should include migration history during their intakes and more actively screen for depression with socially isolated Chinese older immigrants who migrated at a later age.

        "A MYC-GCN2-eIF2\u03b1 negative feedback loop limits protein synthesis to prevent MYC-dependent apoptosis in colorectal cancer. Tumours depend on altered rates of protein synthesis for growth and survival, which suggests that mechanisms controlling mRNA translation may be exploitable for therapy. Here, we show that loss of APC, which occurs almost universally in colorectal tumours, strongly enhances the dependence on the translation initiation factor eIF2B5. Depletion of eIF2B5 induces an integrated stress response and enhances translation of MYC via an internal ribosomal entry site. This perturbs cellular amino acid and nucleotide pools, strains energy resources and causes MYC-dependent apoptosis. eIF2B5 limits MYC expression and prevents apoptosis in APC-deficient murine and patient-derived organoids and in APC-deficient murine intestinal epithelia in vivo. Conversely, the high MYC levels present in APC-deficient cells induce phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 via the kinases GCN2 and PKR. Pharmacological inhibition of GCN2 phenocopies eIF2B5 depletion and has therapeutic efficacy in tumour organoids, which demonstrates that a negative MYC-eIF2\u03b1 feedback loop constitutes a targetable vulnerability of colorectal tumours.

        "Context Dependency of Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition for Metastasis. Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) has been proposed to be important for metastatic dissemination. However, recent studies have challenged the requirement of EMT for metastasis. Here, we assessed in different models of primary skin squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) whether EMT is associated with metastasis. The incidence of metastasis was much higher in SCCs presenting EMT compared to SCCs without EMT, supporting the notion that a certain degree of EMT is required to initiate the metastatic cascade in primary skin SCCs. Most circulating tumor cells presented EMT, whereas most lung metastasis did not present EMT, showing that mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition is important for metastatic colonization. In contrast, immunodeficient mice transplanted with SCCs, whether displaying EMT or not, presented metastasis. Altogether, our data demonstrate that the association of EMT and metastasis is model dependent, and metastasis of primary skin SCCs is associated with EMT. ",
        "Is seniority of emergency physician associated with the weekend mortality effect? An exploratory analysis of electronic health records in the UK. OBJECTIVE: Admission to hospital over a weekend is associated with increased mortality, but the underlying causes of the weekend effect are poorly understood. We explore to what extent differences in emergency department (ED) admission and discharge processes, severity of illness and the seniority of the treating physician explain the weekend effect. METHODS: We analysed linked ED attendances to hospital admissions to Cambridge University Hospital over a 7-year period from 1 January 2007 to 31 December 2013, with 30-day in-hospital death as the primary outcome and discharge as a competing risk. The primary exposure was day of the week of arrival. Subdistribution hazards models controlled for multiple confounders, including physician seniority, calendar year, mode of arrival, triage category, referral from general practice, sex, arrival time, prior attendances and admissions, diagnosis group and age. RESULTS: 229\u2009401 patients made 424\u2009845 ED attendances, of which 158\u2009396 (37.3%) were admitted to the hospital. The case-mix of admitted patients was more ill at weekends: 2530 (6.4%) admitted at a weekend required immediate resuscitation compared with 6450 (5.4%) admitted on a weekday (p<0.0001). Senior doctors admitted 24.8% of patients on weekdays and 24.0% at weekends, but junior doctors admitted 61.7% of patients on weekdays and 44.2% at weekends. 3947 (3.3%) patients admitted on a weekday and 1454 (3.7%) patients admitted at a weekend died within 30 days. In the adjusted subdistribution hazards model, the HR of in-hospital death was 1.11 (95% CI 1.04 to 1.18) for weekend arrivals. After controlling for confounders, the in-hospital mortality of patients admitted by junior doctors was greater at the weekend (adjusted HR (aHR) 1.15, 95%\u2009CI 1.06 to 1.24). In-hospital mortality for patients admitted by senior doctors was not statistically different at the weekend (aHR 1.08, 95%\u2009CI 0.98 to 1.19). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that the weekend effect was driven by a higher proportion of admitted patients requiring immediate resuscitation at the weekend. Junior doctors admitted a lower proportion of relatively healthy patients at the weekend compared with the weekday, thus diluting the risk pool of weekday admissions and contributing to the weekend effect. Senior doctors' admitting behaviour did not change at the weekend, and the corresponding weekend effect was reduced. ",
        "Preventing sleep deficit in adolescents: Long-term effects of a quasi-experimental school-based intervention study. Adolescents are at risk of sleep deficit, which has serious consequences for their daytime functioning. However, school-based interventions to improve sleep have shown limited success. This might be due to the content of the programmes (e.g., not targeting central factors such as daytime stress and technology use) or because changes have not been captured due to a lack of long-term follow-ups. Hence, the aim of this study was to evaluate the long-term effects of a school-based sleep education curriculum including time-management training. The study used a quasi-experimental design. Participants were 3,622 adolescents (mean age 13.7, 48% girls); 286 were in the intervention group and 3,336 were followed as a natural control group. Data were collected before the intervention and at a 1-year follow-up. We divided participants into three groups according to baseline sleep duration (calculated from self-reported bed- and wake times, minus sleep onset latency): insufficient (<7\u00a0hr), borderline (7-8\u00a0hr) and adequate (>8\u00a0hr). Adolescents in the intervention group were ~2 times less likely to report insufficient sleep at follow-up as compared to controls. Sleep knowledge improved significantly in the intervention group but there were no changes in emotional sleep hygiene (e.g., bedtime worry) and perceived stress. Surprisingly, technology use increased and behavioural sleep hygiene worsened in the intervention group. Although the mechanisms of change need further investigation, the results of this study point to potential long-term benefits of school-based sleep programmes. ",
        "Activity of Hospital Disinfectants against Vegetative Cells and Spores of Clostridioides difficile Embedded in Biofilms. Clostridioides difficile spores can survive in the environment in either mono- or mixed-species biofilms. However, no previous studies have investigated chemical disinfection of C. difficile spores embedded in biofilms. Thus, the purpose of this study was to assess the in vitro effectiveness of hospital disinfectants against C. difficile spores embedded within biofilms. Five unique C. difficile strains embedded in three different biofilm types grown for 72 or 120\u2009h were exposed to seven different hospital disinfectants. C. difficile abundance [as log(number of CFU/milliliter)] was calculated after manufacturer-determined contact times along with biofilm biomass and microscopy. The primary analysis compared differences between C. difficile vegetative cell and spore counts as well as amounts of biomass after exposure to disinfectants. C. difficile vegetative cells and spores were recovered from biofilms regardless of the type of biofilm growth or biofilm growth time. No disinfectant was able to completely eliminate C. difficile from the biofilms. Overall, Clorox, ortho-phthalaldehyde (OPA), and Virex were most effective at killing C. difficile spores regardless of biofilm age, ribotype, or wash conditions (whether biofilms are washed or unwashed) (P = 0.001, each). Clorox and OPA were also effective at killing total vegetative cell growth (P\u2009=\u20090.001, each), but Virex was found to be ineffective against vegetative cell growth in biofilms (P\u2009=\u20090.77). Clorox and Virex were most effective in reducing biomass, followed by Nixall, OPA, and Vital Oxide. No disinfectant was able to completely eliminate C. difficile embedded within biofilms although differences among disinfectants were noted. Future research will be required to determine methods to eradicate this persister reservoir. ",
        "Rationally engineered Staphylococcus aureus Cas9 nucleases with high genome-wide specificity. RNA-guided CRISPR-Cas9 proteins have been widely used for genome editing, but their off-target activities limit broad application. The minimal Cas9 ortholog from Staphylococcus aureus (SaCas9) is commonly used for in vivo genome editing; however, no variant conferring high genome-wide specificity is available. Here, we report rationally engineered SaCas9 variants with highly specific genome-wide activity in human cells without compromising on-target efficiency. One engineered variant, referred to as SaCas9-HF, dramatically improved genome-wide targeting accuracy based on the genome-wide unbiased identification of double-stranded breaks enabled by sequencing (GUIDE-seq) method and targeted deep sequencing analyses. Among 15 tested human endogenous sites with the canonical NNGRRT protospacer adjacent motif (PAM), SaCas9-HF rendered no detectable off-target activities at 9 sites, minimal off-target activities at 6 sites, and comparable on-target efficiencies to those of wild-type SaCas9. Furthermore, among 4 known promiscuous targeting sites, SaCas9-HF profoundly reduced off-target activities compared with wild type. When delivered by an adeno-associated virus vector, SaCas9-HF also showed reduced off-target effects when targeting VEGFA in a human retinal pigmented epithelium cell line compared with wild type. Then, we further altered a previously described variant named KKH-SaCas9 that has a wider PAM recognition range. Similarly, the resulting KKH-HF remarkably reduced off-target activities and increased on- to off-target editing ratios. Our finding provides an alternative to wild-type SaCas9 for genome editing applications requiring exceptional genome-wide precision. ",
        "Increased dietary calcium inclusion in fully acidified prepartum diets improved postpartum uterine health and fertility when fed to Holstein cows. The objective of this study was to determine the effects of prepartum negative dietary cation-anion difference diet (DCAD) fed at two dietary Ca inclusion rates on postpartum uterine health and ovulation dynamics of multiparous Holstein cows (n\u202f=\u202f76). Treatments began at 28 days before expected calving until parturition and were: CON: DCAD\u00a0=\u00a0+6 mEq/100g of DM with low dietary Ca (46.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a015.2\u00a0g Ca/d; 0.4% DM; n\u00a0=\u00a026); ND: DCAD\u202f=\u202f-24 mEq/100g of DM with low dietary Ca (44.1\u202f\u00b1\u202f16.1 Ca/d; 0.4% DM; n\u202f=\u202f24); NDCA: DCAD\u202f=\u202f-24 mEq/100g of DM with high dietary Ca (226.6\u202f\u00b1\u202f96.0\u202fg Ca/d; 2.0% DM; n\u202f=\u202f26). Vaginal discharge was evaluated through the fresh period via Metricheck (MC) for presence of purulent material. Polymorphonuclear (PMN) cell concentration in the uterus was evaluated at 15 and 30 days relative to calving (DRC). Endometrial tissue was harvested at 30 DRC for glandular morphology, presence of tight-junctions and adheren-junctions proteins, as well as assessment of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPX) activity. Blood plasma and serum samples were harvested in the prepartum and postpartum phase and were assessed for concentrations of lipopolysaccharide binding protein (LBP), serum amyloid A (SAA), and haptoglobin (HP). Ovarian dynamics were assessed through the fresh period until first timed artificial insemination (TAI). Cows fed CON had a lower MC score (P\u202f=\u202f0.06) than the average of cows fed ND and cows fed NDCA. Cows fed ND had a higher MC score than cows fed NDCA. Cows fed NDCA had greater uterine gland epithelial height (P\u202f=\u202f0.02) than cows fed ND. Cows fed NDCA also had a greater number of epithelial cells per gland (P\u202f=\u202f0.05) than cows fed ND. Cows fed NDCA had greater intensity of occludin expression (P\u202f=\u202f0.15) than cows fed ND. Cows fed NDCA had increased activity of SOD (P\u202f=\u202f0.05) and decreased activity of GPX (P\u202f<\u202f0.001) than cows fed ND. Cows fed ND had higher plasma HP concentrations than cows fed NDCA in the prepartum (P\u202f=\u202f0.01) and post-partum (P\u202f=\u202f0.03) periods. Cows fed ND and NDCA had lower (P\u202f=\u202f0.01) postpartum plasma HP concentration than cows fed CON. In conclusion, cows fed NDCA had an improved uterine environment most likely due to alleviation of oxidative stress, an enhanced immune response to parturition and uterine discharge comparable to cows fed CON.

        "Current ecology, not ancestral dispersal patterns, influences menopause symptom severity. All human females who reach midlife experience menopause, however, it is currently unclear why women experience this period of infertility, and why it is accompanied by many unpleasant symptoms. Using primary data from four ethnic groups in China, we test an existing theory that age of menopause and its symptoms are the result of intragenomic conflict between maternally and paternally inherited genes, with the outcome of such conflict predicted to be contingent on the ancestral postmarital residence pattern of the female (\u00dabeda, Ohtsuki, & Gardner, Ecology Letters, 17, 2014, 165). The model predicts that being ancestrally patrilocal results in less intragenomic conflict, causing a shorter, less symptomatic perimenopause that terminates in a later menopause. Our findings show no support for this hypothesis and suggest current, rather than ancestral, residence patterns better predict aspects of the menopausal transition. Furthermore, current patrilocality when compared to duolocality is associated with more severe menopause symptoms, which may be due to sexual, rather than intragenomic, conflict.

        "Chemosensory Changes from Cancer Treatment and Their Effects on Patients' Food Behavior: A Scoping Review. Individuals undergoing treatment for cancer can experience changes in taste or smell that are often assumed to affect constructs related to food behavior, although this relationship is rarely measured directly. To ascertain the extent to which measured changes in taste and smell during and after cancer treatment affect food behavior, we conducted a scoping review and completed a comparative analysis for studies that met our criteria, which were: they directly measured cancer patients' (a) psychophysical response to taste and/or olfactory stimuli, and (b) food behavior (including food enjoyment, food preference, dietary intake) in people affected by cancer. Eleven studies met these criteria and were included in the review. All 11 studies evaluated taste and five also measured smell. A comparative analysis exploring taste and food behavior shows that a reduced sweet taste function (decreased sensitivity) was associated with a reduced intake of a variety of different macro and micro nutrients, reduced appetite, and overall lower energy intake. One out of six studies that measured smell and food measured observed changes in olfactory function following cancer treatment. There were no significant relationships reported between olfactory measures and food behavior. Taste changes that arise from cancer treatment appear to have a direct effect on food behavior, although there is a need for more research using standardized measures and larger sample sizes. A better understanding of taste alterations and their implications for dietary intake and food enjoyment will support optimal nutritional health by identifying strategies to help patients eat well during and after cancer treatment.

        "Beneficial effects of sound exposure on auditory cortex development in a mouse model of Fragile X Syndrome. BACKGROUND: Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common genetic cause of autism and intellectual disability. Fragile X mental retardation gene (Fmr1) knock-out (KO) mice display core deficits of FXS, including abnormally increased sound-evoked responses, and show a delayed development of parvalbumin (PV) cells. Here, we present the surprising result that sound exposure during early development reduces correlates of auditory hypersensitivity in Fmr1 KO mice. METHODS: Fmr1 KO and wild-type (WT) mice were raised in a sound-attenuated environment (AE) or sound-exposed (SE) to 14\u202fkHz tones (5\u202fHz repetition rate) from P9 until P21. At P21-P23, event-related potentials (ERPs), dendritic spine density, PV expression and phosphorylation of tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB) were analyzed in the auditory cortex of AE and SE mice. RESULTS: Enhanced N1 amplitude of ERPs, impaired PV cell development, and increased spine density in layers (L) 2/3 and L5/6 excitatory neurons were observed in AE Fmr1 KO compared to WT mice. In contrast, developmental sound exposure normalized ERP N1 amplitude, density of PV cells and dendritic spines in SE Fmr1 KO mice. Finally, TrkB phosphorylation was reduced in AE Fmr1 KO, but was enhanced in SE Fmr1 KO mice, suggesting that BDNF-TrkB signaling may be regulated by sound exposure to influence PV cell development. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that sound exposure, but not attenuation, during early developmental window restores molecular, cellular and functional properties in the auditory cortex of Fmr1 KO mice, and suggest this approach as a potential treatment for sensory phenotypes in FXS.

        "Patterns of Comorbidity Among Bereaved Family Members 14 Years after the September 11th, 2001, Terrorist Attacks. Studies of terrorism-related deaths are few and mostly focus on short-term effects. To characterize long-term bereavement outcomes, including resilience/recovery and patterns of comorbidity, following the September 11, 2001 (9/11), terrorist attacks, we report mental health conditions and grief-related impairment in 454 9/11 bereaved family members. In addition, the contribution of non-9/11 lifetime traumas, pre-9/11 mental health conditions, post-9/11 interim life events, grief services, income adequacy, and social support were examined. Latent class analyses yielded three groups: healthy, comorbid without PTSD (comorbid/noPTSD), and comorbid with PTSD and impaired (comorbid/PTSD+I). Participants in the healthy group (66.1%) were least likely to meet thresholds for mental conditions, whereas those in the comorbid/noPTSD (21.3%) and comorbid/PTSD+I (12.6%) groups had higher probabilities of meeting depression, grief, and anxiety thresholds. These groups also endorsed more negatively valenced post-9/11 interim life events than the healthy group: comorbid/noPTSD vs. healthy, odds ratio (OR) = 0.84, 95% CI [0.76, 0.94]; comorbid/PTSD+I vs. healthy, OR = 0.85, 95% CI [0.76, 0.96]. Comorbid/PTSD+I was the only group with elevated probabilities of meeting clinical thresholds for PTSD (.64) and grief-related impairment (.94). This group was also more likely to include bereaved parents: comorbid/PTSD+I vs. healthy, OR = 12.96, 95% CI [1.97, 85.41]; comorbid/PTSD+I vs. comorbid/noPTSD, OR = 15.55, 95% CI [1.63, 148.41]); and to experience more non-9/11 lifetime traumas: comorbid/PTSD+I vs. healthy, OR = 4.34, 95% CI [1.28, 14.70]; comorbid/PTSD+I vs. comorbid/noPTSD, OR = 6.54, 95% CI [1.53, 27.95]. Clinical and community programs should target this high-risk group to identify individuals in need of services. ",
        "Increased Sensitivity of Focused Cardiac Ultrasound for Pulmonary Embolism in Emergency Department Patients With Abnormal Vital Signs. BACKGROUND: Focused cardiac ultrasound (FOCUS) is insensitive for pulmonary embolism (PE). Theoretically, when a clot is large enough to cause vital sign abnormalities, it is more likely to show signs of right ventricular dysfunction on FOCUS, although this has not been well quantified. A rapid bedside test that could quickly and reliably exclude PE in patients with abnormal vital signs could be of high utility in emergency department (ED) patients. We hypothesized that in patients with tachycardia or hypotension, the sensitivity of FOCUS for PE would increase substantially. METHODS: We performed a prospective observational multicenter cohort study involving a convenience sample of patients from six urban academic EDs. Patients suspected to have PE with tachycardia (heart rate [HR] \u2265 100 beats/min) or hypotension (systolic blood pressure [sBP]\u00a0<\u00a090 mm\u00a0Hg) underwent FOCUS before computed tomography angiography (CTA). FOCUS included assessment for right ventricular dilation, McConnell's sign, septal flattening, tricuspid regurgitation, and tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion. If any of these were abnormal, FOCUS was considered positive, while if all were normal, FOCUS was considered negative. We a priori planned a subgroup analysis of all patients with a HR \u2265 110 beats/min (regardless of their sBP). We then determined the diagnostic test characteristics of FOCUS for PE in the entire patient population and in the predefined subgroup, based on CTA as the criterion standard. Inter-rater reliability of FOCUS was determined by blinded review of images by an emergency physician with fellowship training in ultrasound. RESULTS: A total of 143 subjects were assessed for enrollment and 136 were enrolled; four were excluded because they were non-English-speaking and three because of inability to obtain any FOCUS windows. The mean (\u00b1SD) age of enrolled subjects was 56 (\u00b17) years, mean (\u00b1SD) HR was 114 (\u00b112) beats/min, and 37 (27.2%) subjects were diagnosed with PE on CTA. In all subjects, FOCUS was 92% (95% confidence interval [CI]\u00a0= 78% to 98%) sensitive and 64% specific (95% CI\u00a0= 53% to 73%) for PE. In the subgroup of 98 subjects with a HR \u2265 110 beats/min, FOCUS was 100% sensitive (95% CI\u00a0= 88% to 100%) and 63% specific (95% CI\u00a0= 51% to 74%) for PE. There was substantial interobserver agreement for FOCUS (\u03ba =\u00a01.0, 95% CI\u00a0= 0.31 to 1.0). CONCLUSIONS: A negative FOCUS examination may significantly lower the likelihood of the diagnosis of PE in most patients who are suspected of PE and have abnormal vital signs. This was especially true in those patients with a HR \u2265 110 beats/min. Our results suggest that FOCUS can be an important tool in the initial evaluation of ED patients with suspected PE and abnormal vital signs. ",
        "Altered microbiota, fecal lactate, and fecal bile acids in dogs with gastrointestinal disease. The intestinal microbiota plays an important role in health and disease and produces, through fermentative reactions, several metabolic products, such as lactate, that can affect the host. The microbiota also interacts with and metabolizes compounds produced by the host, such as primary bile acids. Lactate and bile acids (BA) are of particular interest in gastrointestinal diseases because they have been associated with metabolic acidosis and bile acid diarrhea, respectively. The objectives of this study were to validate an enzymatic assay to quantify D-, L-, and total lactate in canine feces, and to characterize fecal lactate and BA concentrations as well as bacterial abundances in healthy dogs and dogs with gastrointestinal diseases. Fecal samples were collected from 34 healthy dogs, 15 dogs with chronic enteropathy (CE), and 36 dogs with exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI). Lactate was quantified with an enzymatic assay, BA with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, and 11 bacterial groups with qPCR. A fecal lactate reference interval was established from 34 healthy dogs and was 0.7-1.4 mM, 0.3-6.0 mM, and 1.0-7.0 mM for D-, L-, and total lactate, respectively. The assay to measure D-, L-, and total lactate in canine fecal samples was linear, accurate, precise, and reproducible. Significant increases in fecal lactate and decreases in secondary BA concentrations were observed in dogs with CE and dogs with EPI. Dogs with EPI had an increased abundance of Escherichia coli, Lactobacillus, and Bifidobacterium; a decreased abundance of Fusobacterium and Clostridium hiranonis; and a higher Dysbiosis Index when compared to healthy dogs. Further studies are necessary to determine the clinical utility of lactate and BA quantification in canine feces. These metabolites suggest functional alterations of intestinal dysbiosis and may become promising targets for further elucidating the role of the microbiota in health and disease. ",
        "HIV-1 Coreceptor Usage and Variable Loop Contact Impact V3 Loop Broadly Neutralizing Antibody Susceptibility. In clinical trials, HIV-1 broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) effectively lower plasma viremia and delay virus reemergence. The presence of less neutralization-susceptible strains prior to treatment decreases the efficacy of these antibody-based treatments, but neutralization sensitivity often cannot be predicted by sequence analysis alone. We found that phenotypically confirmed CXCR4-utilizing strains are less neutralization sensitive, especially to variable loop 3 (V3 loop)-directed bnAbs, than exclusively CCR5-utilizing strains in some, but not all, cases. Homology modeling suggested that the primary V3 loop bnAb epitope is equally accessible among CCR5- and CXCR4-using strains, although variants that exclusively use CXCR4 have V3 loop protrusions that interfere with CCR5 receptor interactions. Homology modeling also showed that among some, but not all, envelopes with decreased neutralization sensitivity, V1 loop orientation interfered with V3 loop-directed bnAb binding. Thus, there are likely different structural reasons for the coreceptor usage restriction and the different bnAb susceptibilities. Importantly, we show that individuals harboring envelopes with higher likelihood of using CXCR4 or greater predicted V1 loop interference have faster virus rebound and a lower maximum decrease in plasma viremia, respectively, after treatment with a V3 loop bnAb. Knowledge of receptor usage and homology models may be useful in developing future algorithms that predict treatment efficacy with V3 loop bnAbs.IMPORTANCE The efficacy of HIV-1 broadly neutralizing antibody (bnAb) therapies may be compromised by the preexistence of less susceptible variants. Sequence-based methods are needed to predict pretreatment variants' neutralization sensitivities. HIV-1 strains that exclusively use the CXCR4 receptor rather than the CCR5 receptor are less neutralization susceptible, especially to variable loop 3 (V3 loop) bnAbs in some, but not all, instances. While the inability to utilize the CCR5 receptor maps to a predicted protrusion in the envelope V3 loop, this viral determinant does not directly influence V3 loop bnAb sensitivity. Homology modeling predicts that contact between the envelope V1 loop and the antibody impacts V3 loop bnAb susceptibility in some cases. Among pretreatment envelopes, increased probability of using CXCR4 and greater predicted V1 interference are associated with faster virus rebound and a smaller decrease in the plasma virus level, respectively, after V3 loop bnAb treatment. Receptor usage information and homology models may be useful for predicting V3 loop bnAb therapy efficacy. ",
        "Changes in protein function underlie the disease spectrum in patients with CHIP mutations. Monogenetic disorders that cause cerebellar ataxia are characterized by defects in gait and atrophy of the cerebellum; however, patients often suffer from a spectrum of disease, complicating treatment options. Spinocerebellar ataxia autosomal recessive 16 (SCAR16) is caused by coding mutations in STUB1, a gene that encodes the multifunctional enzyme CHIP (C terminus of HSC70-interacting protein). The disease spectrum of SCAR16 includes a varying age of disease onset, cognitive dysfunction, increased tendon reflex, and hypogonadism. Although SCAR16 mutations span the multiple functional domains of CHIP, it is unclear whether the location of the mutation and the change in the biochemical properties of CHIP contributes to the clinical spectrum of SCAR16. In this study, we examined relationships between the clinical phenotypes of SCAR16 patients and the changes in biophysical, biochemical, and functional properties of the corresponding mutated protein. We found that the severity of ataxia did not correlate with age of onset; however, cognitive dysfunction, increased tendon reflex, and ancestry were able to predict 54% of the variation in ataxia severity. We further identified domain-specific relationships between biochemical changes in CHIP and clinical phenotypes and specific biochemical activities that associate selectively with either increased tendon reflex or cognitive dysfunction, suggesting that specific changes to CHIP-HSC70 dynamics contribute to the clinical spectrum of SCAR16. Finally, linear models of SCAR16 as a function of the biochemical properties of CHIP support the concept that further inhibiting mutant CHIP activity lessens disease severity and may be useful in the design of patient-specific targeted approaches to treat SCAR16.

        "The determinants of employability of people living with HIV/AIDS in Turkey. BACKGROUND: This study addresses an important field within HIV research, the factors affecting the determinants of the employability of people living with HIV/AIDS (PLHIV) in Turkey. The employability of PLHIV is now even more vital because the use of antiretroviral therapy improves the quality of life of patients. In spite of this, the related literature suggests that there are serious impediments to the employment of PLHIV who face considerable levels of discrimination based on their HIV status. METHODS: This is a cohort study of 170 PLHIV of working age, treated at the Izmir Bozyaka Education and Training Hospital. We use a univariate logistic model to determine the effects of all determinants of interest with probit/logit modeling and penalized maximum likelihood estimation to avoid bias and to test the robustness of results. RESULTS: Age, time since diagnosis, work status at diagnosis, wealth status, illicit drug use, and CD4 cell count were significantly related to the employability of PLHIV. Younger individuals had a higher probability of workforce participation. HIV-infected patients aged 19 to 39 and 40 to 54 years were 32% and 20% more likely, respectively, to be employed. Economically better-off PLHIV were more likely to participate in the labor force and HIV patients who were working at the time of diagnosis were more likely to be re-employed. Time since diagnosis was negatively associated with the employment status. Compared to recently diagnosed patients, PLHIV for more than a decade were less likely to be employed. Those with high CD4 cell counts were more likely to be employed. Illicit drug use was negatively associated with employment and drug-addicted HIV patients were less likely to be employed. Higher education did not significantly predict the employability of PLHIV. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that besides immunological status, socioeconomic factors play a substantial role in the employability of PLHIV. We suggest that even if a patient is skilled, educated, and qualified for the job, other factors such as stigma and employment discrimination in the workplace may hinder employment even among highly educated PLHIV.

        "The serum amyloid A3 promoter-driven luciferase reporter mice is a valuable tool to image early renal fibrosis development and shows the therapeutic effect of glucosyl-hesperidin treatment. Tubulointerstitial fibrosis is a progressive process affecting the kidneys, causing renal failure that can be life-threatening. Thus, renal fibrosis has become a serious concern in the ageing population; however, fibrotic development cannot be diagnosed early and assessed noninvasively in both patients and experimental animal models. Here, we found that serum amyloid A3 (Saa3) expression is a potent indicator of early renal fibrosis; we also established in vivo Saa3/C/EBP\u03b2-promoter bioluminescence imaging as a sensitive and specific tool for early detection and visualization of tubulointerstitial fibrosis. Saa3 promoter activity is specifically upregulated in parallel with tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) and fibrotic marker collagen I in injured kidneys. C/EBP\u03b2, upregulated in injured kidneys and expressed in tubular epithelial cells, is essential for the increased Saa3 promoter activity in response to TNF-\u03b1, suggesting that C/EBP\u03b2 plays a crucial role in renal fibrosis development. Our model successfully enabled visualization of the suppressive effects of a citrus flavonoid derivative, glucosyl-hesperidin, on inflammation and fibrosis in kidney disease, indicating that this model could be widely used in exploring therapeutic agents for fibrotic diseases.

        "Weight Loss and Illness Severity in Adolescents With Atypical Anorexia Nervosa. BACKGROUND: Lower weight has historically been equated with more severe illness in anorexia nervosa (AN). Reliance on admission weight to guide clinical concern is challenged by the rise in patients with atypical anorexia nervosa (AAN) requiring hospitalization at normal weight. METHODS: We examined weight history and illness severity in 12- to 24-year-olds with AN (n = 66) and AAN (n = 50) in a randomized clinical trial, the Study of Refeeding to Optimize Inpatient Gains (www.clinicaltrials.gov; NCT02488109). Amount of weight loss was the difference between the highest historical percentage median BMI and admission; rate was the amount divided by duration (months). Unpaired t tests compared AAN and AN; multiple variable regressions examined associations between weight history variables and markers of illness severity at admission. Stepwise regression examined the explanatory value of weight and menstrual history on selected markers. RESULTS: Participants were 16.5 \u00b1 2.6 years old, and 91% were of female sex. Groups did not differ by weight history or admission heart rate (HR). Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire global scores were higher in AAN (mean 3.80 [SD 1.66] vs mean 3.00 [SD 1.66]; P = .02). Independent of admission weight, lower HR (\u03b2 = -0.492 [confidence interval (CI) -0.883 to -0.100]; P = .01) was associated with faster loss; lower serum phosphorus was associated with a greater amount (\u03b2 = -0.005 [CI -0.010 to 0.000]; P = .04) and longer duration (\u03b2 = -0.011 [CI -0.017 to 0.005]; P = .001). Weight and menstrual history explained 28% of the variance in HR and 36% of the variance in serum phosphorus. CONCLUSIONS: Weight history was independently associated with markers of malnutrition in inpatients with restrictive eating disorders across a range of body weights and should be considered when assessing illness severity on hospital admission.

        "mTOR drives cerebrovascular, synaptic, and cognitive dysfunction in normative aging. Cerebrovascular dysfunction and cognitive decline are highly prevalent in aging, but the mechanisms underlying these impairments are unclear. Cerebral blood flow decreases with aging and is one of the earliest events in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We have previously shown that the mechanistic/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) drives disease progression in mouse models of AD and in models of cognitive impairment associated with atherosclerosis, closely recapitulating vascular cognitive impairment. In the present studies, we sought to determine whether mTOR plays a role in cerebrovascular dysfunction and cognitive decline during normative aging in rats. Using behavioral tools and MRI-based functional imaging, together with biochemical and immunohistochemical approaches, we demonstrate that chronic mTOR attenuation with rapamycin ameliorates deficits in learning and memory, prevents neurovascular uncoupling, and restores cerebral perfusion in aged rats. Additionally, morphometric and biochemical analyses of hippocampus and cortex revealed that mTOR drives age-related declines in synaptic and vascular density during aging. These data indicate that in addition to mediating AD-like cognitive and cerebrovascular deficits in models of AD and atherosclerosis, mTOR drives cerebrovascular, neuronal, and cognitive deficits associated with normative aging. Thus, inhibitors of mTOR may have potential to treat age-related cerebrovascular dysfunction and cognitive decline. Since treatment of age-related cerebrovascular dysfunction in older adults is expected to prevent further deterioration of cerebral perfusion, recently identified as a biomarker for the very early (preclinical) stages of AD, mTOR attenuation may potentially block the initiation and progression of AD.

        "The impact of proinflammatory cytokines on the \u03b2-cell regulatory landscape provides insights into the genetics of type 1 diabetes. The early stages of type 1 diabetes (T1D) are characterized by local autoimmune inflammation and progressive loss of insulin-producing pancreatic \u03b2 cells. Here we show that exposure to proinflammatory cytokines reveals a marked plasticity of the \u03b2-cell regulatory landscape. We expand the repertoire of human islet regulatory elements by mapping stimulus-responsive enhancers linked to changes in the \u03b2-cell transcriptome, proteome and three-dimensional chromatin structure. Our data indicate that the \u03b2-cell response to cytokines is mediated by the induction of new regulatory regions as well as the activation of primed regulatory elements prebound by islet-specific transcription factors. We find that T1D-associated loci are enriched with newly mapped cis-regulatory regions and identify T1D-associated variants disrupting cytokine-responsive enhancer activity in human \u03b2 cells. Our study illustrates how \u03b2 cells respond to a proinflammatory environment and implicate a role for stimulus response islet enhancers in T1D. ",
        "Structure and regulation of ZCCHC4 in m6A-methylation of 28S rRNA. N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification provides an important epitranscriptomic mechanism that critically regulates RNA metabolism and function. However, how m6A writers attain substrate specificities remains unclear. We report the 3.1 \u00c5-resolution crystal structure of human CCHC zinc finger-containing protein ZCCHC4, a 28S rRNA-specific m6A methyltransferase, bound to S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine. The methyltransferase (MTase) domain of ZCCHC4 is packed against N-terminal GRF-type and C2H2 zinc finger domains and a C-terminal CCHC domain, creating an integrated RNA-binding surface. Strikingly, the MTase domain adopts an autoinhibitory conformation, with a self-occluded catalytic site and a fully-closed cofactor pocket. Mutational and enzymatic analyses further substantiate the molecular basis for ZCCHC4-RNA recognition and a role of the stem-loop structure within substrate in governing the substrate specificity. Overall, this study unveils unique structural and enzymatic characteristics of ZCCHC4, distinctive from what was seen with the METTL family of m6A writers, providing the mechanistic basis for ZCCHC4 modulation of m6A RNA methylation.

        "Role of Patient Maximizing-Minimizing Preferences in Thyroid Cancer Surveillance. PURPOSE: To understand the effect of patient preferences on thyroid cancer surveillance intensity. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eligible patients diagnosed with thyroid cancer between January 1, 2014, and December 31, 2015, from the Georgia and Los Angeles County SEER registries were surveyed between February 2017 and October 2018 (N = 2,632; response rate, 63%). Patient reports on health care utilization in the past year and responses to the validated Medical Maximizer-Minimizer Scale were linked to SEER data in the 2,183 disease-free patients. Ordered logistic regression was performed using a cumulative logit with nonproportional odds. RESULTS: Of disease-free patients, 31.6% were classified as minimizers, 42.5% as moderate maximizers, and 25.9% as strong maximizers. In the past year, 25.2%, 27.3%, and 38.5% of minimizers, moderate maximizers, and strong maximizers, respectively, had \u2265 4 doctor visits, and 18.3%, 24.9%, and 29.5%, respectively, had \u2265 2 neck ultrasounds. When controlling for age, sex, race and ethnicity, comorbidity, stage, and SEER site, strong maximizers (compared with minimizers) were significantly more likely to report \u2265 4 doctor visits (odds ratio [OR], 1.45; 95% CI, 1.10-1.92), \u2265 2 neck ultrasounds (OR, 1.58; 95% CI, 1.17-2.14), \u2265 1 radioactive iodine scan (OR, 1.73; 95% CI, 1.19-2.50), and \u2265 1 additional imaging study (OR, 2.06; 95% CI, 1.56-2.72). CONCLUSION: Among patients with thyroid cancer who have been declared disease free, preference for a more maximal versus minimal approach to medical care is associated with increased number of physician visits and imaging tests. Because increased surveillance does not clearly correlate with improved outcomes, poses potential risks to patients, and contributes to increased healthcare costs, stronger consideration of the role of patient preferences is necessary when framing discussions on surveillance.

        "Short Sleep Is Associated With Low Bone Mineral Density and Osteoporosis in the Women's Health Initiative. Short sleep duration, recognized as a public health epidemic, is associated with adverse health conditions, yet little is known about the association between sleep and bone health. We tested the associations of usual sleep behavior and bone mineral density (BMD) and osteoporosis. In a sample of 11,084 postmenopausal women from the Women's Health Initiative (WHI; mean age 63.3\u2009years, SD = 7.4), we performed a cross-sectional study of the association of self-reported usual hours of sleep and sleep quality (WHI Insomnia Rating Score) with whole body, total hip, femoral neck, and spine BMD using linear regression models. We also studied the association of sleep duration and quality with dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA)-defined low bone mass (T-score\u2009<\u2009-2.5 to <-1) and osteoporosis (T-score\u2009\u2264\u2009-2.5) using multinomial regression models. We adjusted for age, DXA machine, race, menopausal symptoms, education, smoking, physical activity, body mass index, alcohol use, physical function, and sleep medication use. In adjusted linear regression models, women who reported sleeping 5\u2009hours or less per night had on average 0.012 to 0.018\u2009g/cm2 significantly lower BMD at all four sites compared with women who reported sleeping 7\u2009hours per night (reference). In adjusted multinomial models, women reporting 5\u2009hours or less per night had higher odds of low bone mass and osteoporosis of the hip (odds ratio [OR] =\u20091.22; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.03-1.45, and 1.63; 1.15-2.31, respectively). We observed a similar pattern for spine BMD, where women with 5\u2009hours or less per night had higher odds of osteoporosis (adjusted OR = 1.28; 95% CI 1.02-1.60). Associations of sleep quality and DXA BMD failed to reach statistical significance. Short sleep duration was associated with lower BMD and higher risk of osteoporosis. Longitudinal studies are needed to confirm the cross-sectional effects of sleep duration on bone health and explore associated mechanisms. \u00a9 2019 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.

        "Maternal use of drugs and preeclampsia. AIMS: The aim was to compare and describe maternal use of drugs between women with preeclampsia and controls and to estimate the possible association with preeclampsia. METHODS: The study cohort was collected from the Kuopio University Hospital Birth Register, which includes information about all women who gave birth in Kuopio University Hospital during the years 2002-2016, including information from approximately 36 000 parturients, of whom 1252 had preeclampsia. Maternal use of 16 groups of drugs during pregnancy was analysed from all women with preeclampsia and 1256 controls. RESULTS: Every second woman had used at least 1 drug during pregnancy but those with preeclampsia had used significantly more than the controls (cases 59.5% vs controls 35.5%; p < 0.001). In both study groups, the most commonly used drugs were antibiotics (cases 19.5%, controls 17.0%), antihypertensives (cases 29.0%, controls 7.6%) and paracetamol (cases 13.1%, controls 5.9%). Women with preeclampsia had used significantly more benzodiazepines, paracetamol, antihypertensives and acid-suppressive drugs than the women in the control group (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Women with preeclampsia were more likely to use medicines during pregnancy. While the association between benzodiazepines, antihypertensives and acid-suppressive drugs and preeclampsia may be explained by reverse causation, the association of paracetamol with preeclampsia remains to be clarified. Because paracetamol is a frequently used drug, more information about its safety during pregnancy including its role in preeclampsia is urgently needed. ",
        "Secretome of pleural effusions associated with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and malignant mesothelioma: therapeutic implications. INTRODUCTION: We compared the secretome of metastatic (non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)) and primary (mesothelioma) malignant pleural effusions, benign effusions and the published plasma profile of patients receiving chimeric antigen receptor T cells (CAR-T), to determine factors unique to neoplasia in pleural effusion (PE) and those accompanying an efficacious peripheral anti-tumor immune response. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cryopreserved cell-free PE fluid from 101 NSCLC patients, 8 mesothelioma and 13 with benign PE was assayed for a panel of 40 cytokines/chemokines using the Luminex system. RESULTS: Profiles of benign and malignant PE were dominated by high concentrations of sIL-6R\u03b1, CCL2/MCP1, CXCL10/IP10, IL-6, TGF\u03b21, CCL22/MDC, CXCL8/IL-8 and IL-10. Malignant PE contained significantly higher (p < 0.01, Bonferroni-corrected) concentrations of MIP1\u03b2, CCL22/MDC, CX3CL1/fractalkine, IFN\u03b12, IFN\u03b3, VEGF, IL-1\u03b1 and FGF2. When grouped by function, mesothelioma PE had lower effector cytokines than NSCLC PE. Comparing NSCLC PE and published plasma levels of CAR-T recipients, both were dominated by sIL-6R\u03b1 and IL-6 but NSCLC PE had more VEGF, FGF2 and TNF\u03b1, and less IL-2, IL-4, IL-13, IL-15, MIP1\u03b1 and IFN\u03b3. CONCLUSIONS: An immunosuppressive, wound-healing environment characterizes both benign and malignant PE. A dampened effector response (IFN\u03b12, IFN\u03b3, MIP1\u03b1, TNF\u03b1 and TNF\u03b2) was detected in NSCLC PE, but not mesothelioma or benign PE. The data indicate that immune effectors are present in NSCLC PE and suggest that the IL-6/sIL-6R\u03b1 axis is a central driver of the immunosuppressive, tumor-supportive pleural environment. A combination localized antibody-based immunotherapy with or without cellular therapy may be justified in this uniformly fatal condition. ",
        "When the Wave Breaks You: Magnetic Resonance Imaging Findings After Surfing Injuries. BACKGROUND: There are approximately 2.1 million recreational surfers in the United States. However, little has been reported on surfing-related injuries and, to date, no study has utilized magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to characterize injury patterns. OBJECTIVE: To use MRI to perform a descriptive analysis of surfing injuries in patients who presented to an urban tertiary care musculoskeletal hospital. This was not a hypothesis-driven study. STUDY DESIGN: Case series. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level 4. METHODS: A retrospective review of the picture archiving and communication system as well as the electronic medical record was performed to identify patients with surfing-related injuries who presented to a tertiary care musculoskeletal hospital for treatment. The search included participants over a 10-year period who presented between January 1, 2009, and August 1, 2018. Descriptive data analyses were performed to determine frequency of body part injured, diagnosis, and operative versus nonoperative treatment. RESULTS: The search yielded 109 patients with surfing-related injuries and MRIs. A total of 90 patients presented within 6 months of their surfing injury and were included in the final analysis. The median age was 36 years (range, 12-66 years). A majority of the patients included were male (74%; n = 67). Acute surfing injuries were diagnosed via imaging in 72% (n = 65) of patients. The joints injured most commonly were the shoulder (46%; n = 30) and the knee (28%; n = 18). Only 17% (n = 11) of acute surfing injuries required surgery, while 83% (n = 54) were treated nonoperatively. CONCLUSION: The most common surfing-related injuries occurred in the shoulder and knee. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: This study helps characterize the risk of injury for surfers and informs healthcare providers on common surfing injuries. ",
        "The predictive value of cervical shear wave elastography in the outcome of labor induction. INTRODUCTION: Bishop score, the traditional method to assess cervical condition, is not a promising predictive tool of the outcome of labor induction. As an objective assessment tool, many cervical ultrasound measurements have been proposed to represent the individual components of the Bishop score, but none of them can measure the cervical stiffness. Cervical shear wave elastography is a novel tool to assess the cervical stiffness quantitatively. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 475 women who required labor induction were studied prospectively. Prior to routine digital assessment of the Bishop score, transvaginal sonographic measurement of cervical length, posterior cervical angle, angle of progression and shear wave elastography was performed. Shear wave elastography measurement was made at the inner, middle and outer regions of the cervix to assess homogeneity. Association of labor induction outcomes including the overall cesarean section and subgroups of cesarean section for failure to enter active phase, with cervical sonographic parameters and the Bishop score, were assessed using multivariate regression analyses. The predictive accuracy of the outcomes using models based on ultrasound measurement and the Bishop score was compared using the area under the receiver-operating characteristics curves. RESULTS: Among 475 women, 82 (17.3%) required cesarean section. Shear wave elasticity was significantly higher in the inner cervical region than in other regions, indicating a greater stiffness (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Both inner cervical shear wave elasticity and cervical length were independent predictors of overall cesarean section (respective adjusted odds ratio [95% CI] 1.338 [1.001-1.598] and 1.717 [1.077-1.663]) and cesarean section for failure to enter active phase (respective adjusted odds ratio [95% CI] 1.689 [1.234-2.311] and 2.556 [1.462-4.467]), after adjusting for other covariates. Outcome prediction models using inner cervical shear wave elasticity and cervical length, had increased area under curve compared with models using the Bishop score (0.888 vs 0.819, P\u00a0=\u00a00.009). CONCLUSIONS: The cervix is not a homogenous structure, with the inner cervix having the highest stiffness, which is an independent predictor of overall cesarean section, and specifically for those indicated because of failure to enter active phase. Models based on shear wave elastography and cervical length had higher predictive accuracy than models based on the Bishop score. ",
        "BMI growth trajectory from ages 2 to 6\u00a0years and its association with maternal obesity, diabetes during pregnancy, gestational weight gain, and breastfeeding. OBJECTIVE: To identify latent BMI growth trajectories from ages 2 to 6\u00a0years and examine their independent associations with maternal prepregnancy obesity or overweight, pre-existing type 1 (T1D) or type 2 diabetes (T2D) or gestational diabetes (GDM) with or without requiring antidiabetic medications during pregnancy, excessive gestational weight gain (EGWG), and breastfeeding\u00a0\u2264\u00a06\u00a0months. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHOD: Data included 71\u00a0892 children born at Kaiser Permanente Southern California hospitals in 2007 to 2011 with complete information on maternal risk factors. Group-based trajectory modelling was used to identify latent BMI trajectory groups. Logistic regression was used to assess independent associations adjusted for covariates. RESULTS: Three distinct BMI trajectory groups were identified: Group 1 (59% of the cohort) had stable low BMI, Group 2 (35% of the cohort) had stable median BMI, and Group 3 (6% of the cohort) had high and increasing BMI over time. Relative to Groups 1 and 2 combined, the adjusted odds ratio (OR) (95% CI) of being in Group 3 associated with maternal exposures were 5.6 (5.1-6.2) for prepregnancy obesity, 2.4 (2.2-2.7) for prepregnancy overweight, 2.1 (1.2-3.7) for T1D, 1.6 (1.4-1.8) for T2D, 1.4 (1.3-1.6) for GDM requiring medication treatment, 1.1 (1.0-1.3) for GDM not requiring medication, 1.3 (1.2-1.4) for EGWG, and 1.2 (1.2-1.3) for breastfeeding\u00a0\u2264\u00a06\u00a0months. CONCLUSION: Child's high and increasing BMI trajectory was strongly associated with maternal prepregnancy obesity and overweight, modestly associated with maternal T1D, T2D, and GDM requiring medication treatment and EGWG, and slightly associated with breastfeeding\u00a0\u2264\u00a06\u00a0months. GDM not requiring medication treatment during pregnancy had little association. ",
        "TREK-1 and TRAAK Are Principal K+ Channels at the Nodes of Ranvier for Rapid Action Potential Conduction on Mammalian Myelinated Afferent Nerves. Rapid conduction of nerve impulses is critical in life and relies on action potential (AP) leaps through the nodes of Ranvier (NRs) along myelinated nerves. While NRs are the only sites where APs can be regenerated during nerve conduction on myelinated nerves, ion channel mechanisms underlying the regeneration and conduction of APs at mammalian NRs remain incompletely understood. Here, we show that TREK-1 and TRAAK, the thermosensitive and mechanosensitive two-pore-domain potassium (K2P) channels, are clustered at NRs of rat trigeminal A\u03b2-afferent nerves with a density over 3,000-fold higher than that on their somas. These K2P channels, but not voltage-gated K+ channels as in other parts of nerves, are required for rapid AP repolarization at the NRs. Furthermore, these channels permit high-speed and high-frequency AP conduction along the myelinated afferent nerves, and loss of function of these channels at NRs retards nerve conduction and impairs sensory behavioral responses in animals.

        "Dimerization of long hibernation promoting factor from Staphylococcus aureus: Structural analysis and biochemical characterization. Staphylococcus aureus hibernation promoting factor (SaHPF) is responsible for the formation of 100S ribosome dimers, which in turn help this pathogen to reduce energy spent under unfavorable conditions. Ribosome dimer formation strongly depends on the dimerization of the C-terminal domain of SaHPF (CTDSaHPF). In this study, we solved the crystal structure of CTDSaHPF at 1.6\u202f\u00c5 resolution and obtained a precise arrangement of the dimer interface. Residues Phe160, Val162, Thr171, Ile173, Tyr175, Ile185 andThr187 in the dimer interface of SaHPF protein were mutated and the effects were analyzed for the formation of 100S disomes of ribosomes isolated from S. aureus. It was shown that substitution of any of single residues Phe160, Val162, Ile173, Tyr175 and Ile185 in the SaHPF homodimer interface abolished the ribosome dimerization in vitro. ",
        "Vitamin D-VDR Signaling Inhibits Wnt/\u03b2-Catenin-Mediated Melanoma Progression and Promotes Antitumor Immunity. 1\u03b1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D3 signals via the vitamin D receptor (VDR). Higher serum vitamin D is associated with thinner primary melanoma and better outcome, although a causal mechanism has not been established. As patients with melanoma commonly avoid sun exposure, and consequent vitamin D deficiency might worsen outcomes, we interrogated 703 primary melanoma transcriptomes to understand the role of vitamin D-VDR signaling and replicated the findings in The Cancer Genome Atlas metastases. VDR expression was independently protective for melanoma-related death in both primary and metastatic disease. High tumor VDR expression was associated with upregulation of pathways mediating antitumor immunity and corresponding with higher imputed immune cell scores and histologically detected tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes. High VDR-expressing tumors had downregulation of proliferative pathways, notably Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling. Deleterious low VDR levels resulted from promoter methylation and gene deletion in metastases. Vitamin D deficiency (<25 nmol/L \u223c 10 ng/mL) shortened survival in primary melanoma in a VDR-dependent manner. In vitro functional validation studies showed that elevated vitamin D-VDR signaling inhibited Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling genes. Murine melanoma cells overexpressing VDR produced fewer pulmonary metastases than controls in tail-vein metastasis assays. In summary, vitamin D-VDR signaling contributes to controlling pro-proliferative/immunosuppressive Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling in melanoma and this is associated with less metastatic disease and stronger host immune responses. This is evidence of a causal relationship between vitamin D-VDR signaling and melanoma survival, which should be explored as a therapeutic target in primary resistance to checkpoint blockade. SIGNIFICANCE: VDR expression could potentially be used as a biomarker to stratify patients with melanoma that may respond better to immunotherapy. ",
        "Late developing cardiac lymphatic vasculature supports adult zebrafish heart function and regeneration. The cardiac lymphatic vascular system and its potentially critical functions in heart patients have been largely underappreciated, in part due to a lack of experimentally accessible systems. We here demonstrate that cardiac lymphatic vessels develop in young adult zebrafish, using coronary arteries to guide their expansion down the ventricle. Mechanistically, we show that in cxcr4a mutants with defective coronary artery development, cardiac lymphatic vessels fail to expand onto the ventricle. In regenerating adult zebrafish hearts the lymphatic vasculature undergoes extensive lymphangiogenesis in response to a cryoinjury. A significant defect in reducing the scar size after cryoinjury is observed in zebrafish with impaired Vegfc/Vegfr3 signaling that fail to develop intact cardiac lymphatic vessels. These results suggest that the cardiac lymphatic system can influence the regenerative potential of the myocardium. ",
        "Allosteric activation of an ion channel triggered by modification of mechanosensitive nano-pockets. Lipid availability within transmembrane nano-pockets of ion channels is linked with mechanosensation. However, the effect of hindering lipid-chain penetration into nano-pockets on channel structure has not been demonstrated. Here we identify nano-pockets on the large conductance mechanosensitive channel MscL, the high-pressure threshold channel. We restrict lipid-chain access to the nano-pockets by mutagenesis and sulfhydryl modification, and monitor channel conformation by PELDOR/DEER\u00a0spectroscopy. For a single site located at the entrance of the nano-pockets and distal to the channel pore we generate an allosteric response in the absence of tension. Single-channel recordings reveal a significant\u00a0decrease in the pressure activation threshold of the modified channel and a sub-conducting state in the absence of applied tension. Threshold is restored to wild-type levels upon reduction of the sulfhydryl modification. The modification associated with the conformational change restricts lipid access to the nano-pocket, interrupting the contact between the membrane and the channel that mediates mechanosensitivity.

        "Association of Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy With Change in Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction in Patients With Chemotherapy-Induced Cardiomyopathy. Importance: The incidence of chemotherapy-induced cardiomyopathy is increasing and is associated with poor clinical outcomes. Objective: To assess the association of cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) with improvement in cardiac function, as well as clinical improvement in patients with chemotherapy-induced cardiomyopathy. Design, Setting, and Participants: The Multicenter Automatic Defibrillator Implantation Trial-Chemotherapy-Induced Cardiomyopathy was an uncontrolled, prospective, cohort study conducted between November 21, 2014, and June 21, 2018, at 12 tertiary centers with cardio-oncology programs in the United States. Thirty patients were implanted with CRT owing to reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF\u226435%), New York Heart Association class II-IV heart failure symptoms, and wide QRS complex, with established chemotherapy-induced cardiomyopathy and were followed up for 6 months after CRT implantation. The date of final follow-up was February 6, 2019. Exposures: CRT implantation according to standard of care. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary end point was change in LVEF from baseline to 6 months after initiating CRT. Secondary outcomes included all-cause mortality and change in left ventricular end-systolic volume and end-diastolic volume. Results: Among 30 patients who were enrolled (mean [SD] age, 64 [11] years; 26 women [87%]; 73% had a history of breast cancer; 20% had a history of lymphoma or leukemia), primary end point data were available for 26 patients and secondary end point data were available for 23 patients. Patients had nonischemic cardiomyopathy with left bundle branch block, median LVEF of 29%, and a mean QRS duration of 152 ms. Patients with CRT experienced a statistically significant improvement in mean LVEF at 6 months from 28% to 39% (difference, 10.6% [95% CI, 8.0%-13.3%]; P\u2009<\u2009.001). This was accompanied by a reduction in LV end-systolic volume from 122.7 to 89.0 mL (difference, 37.0 mL [95% CI, 28.2-45.8]) and reduction in LV end-diastolic volume from 171.0 to 143.2 mL (difference, 31.9 mL [95% CI, 22.1-41.6]) (both P\u2009<\u2009.001). Adverse events included a procedure-related pneumothorax (1 patient), a device pocket infection (1 patient), and heart failure requiring hospitalization during follow-up (1 patient). Conclusions and Relevance: In this preliminary study of patients with chemotherapy-induced cardiomyopathy, CRT was associated with improvement in LVEF after 6 months. The findings are limited by the small sample size, short follow-up, and absence of a control group. Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02164721. ",
        "Novel Invasive and Noninvasive Cardiac-Specific Biomarkers in Obesity and Cardiovascular Diseases. Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of fatality and disability worldwide regardless of gender. Obesity has reached epidemic proportions in population across different regions. According to epidemiological studies, CVD risk markers in childhood obesity are one of the significant risk factors for adulthood CVD, but have received disproportionally little attention. This review has examined the evidence for the presence of traditional cardiac biomarkers (nonspecific; lactate dehydrogenase, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, creatine kinase, myoglobulin, glycogen phosphorylase isoenzyme BB, myosin light chains, ST2, and ischemia-modified albumin) and novel emerging cardiac-specific biomarkers (cardiac troponins, natriuretic peptides, heart-type fatty acid-binding protein, and miRNAs). Besides, noninvasive anatomical and electrophysiological markers (carotid intima-media thickness, coronary artery calcification, and heart rate variability) in CVDs and obesity are also discussed. Modifiable and nonmodifiable risk factors associated with metabolic syndrome in the progression of CVD, such as obesity, diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, oxidative stress, inflammation, and adipocytokines are also outlined. These underlying prognostic risk factors predict the onset of future microvascular and macrovascular complications. The understanding of invasive and noninvasive cardiac-specific biomarkers and the risk factors may yield valuable insights into the pathophysiology and prevention of CVD in a high-risk obese population at an early stage.

        "Neural structures supporting spontaneous and assisted (entrained) speech fluency. Non-fluent speech is one of the most common impairments in post-stroke aphasia. The rehabilitation of non-fluent speech in aphasia is particularly challenging as patients are rarely able to produce and practice fluent speech production. Speech entrainment is a behavioural technique that enables patients with non-fluent aphasia to speak fluently. However, its mechanisms are not well understood and the level of improved fluency with speech entrainment varies among individuals with non-fluent aphasia. In this study, we evaluated the behavioural and neuroanatomical factors associated with better speech fluency with the aid of speech entrainment during the training phase of speech entrainment. We used a lesion-symptom mapping approach to define the relationship between chronic stroke location on MRI and the number of different words per second produced during speech entrainment versus picture description spontaneous speech. The behavioural variable of interest was the speech entrainment/picture description ratio, which, if \u22651, indicated an increase in speech output during speech entrainment compared to picture description. We used machine learning (shallow neural network) to assess the statistical significance and out-of-sample predictive accuracy of the neuroanatomical model, and its regional contributors. We observed that better assisted speech (higher speech entrainment/picture description ratio) was achieved by individuals who had preservation of the posterior middle temporal gyrus, inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus and uncinate fasciculus, while exhibiting lesions in areas typically associated with non-fluent aphasia, such as the superior longitudinal fasciculus, precentral, inferior frontal, supramarginal and insular cortices. Our findings suggest that individuals with dorsal stream damage but preservation of ventral stream structures are more likely to achieve more fluent speech with the aid of speech entrainment compared to spontaneous speech. This observation provides insight into the mechanisms of non-fluent speech in aphasia and has potential implications for future research using speech entrainment for rehabilitation of non-fluent aphasia.

        "The effects of psychosocial stress on dopaminergic function and the acute stress response. Chronic psychosocial adversity induces vulnerability to mental illnesses. Animal studies demonstrate that this may be mediated by dopaminergic dysfunction. We therefore investigated whether long-term exposure to psychosocial adversity was associated with dopamine dysfunction and its relationship to psychological and physiological responses to acute stress. Using 3,4-dihydroxy-6-[18F]-fluoro-l-phenylalanine ([18F]-DOPA) positron emission tomography (PET), we compared dopamine synthesis capacity in n = 17 human participants with high cumulative exposure to psychosocial adversity with n = 17 age- and sex-matched participants with low cumulative exposure. The PET scan took place 2 hr after the induction of acute psychosocial stress using the Montr\u00e9al Imaging Stress Task to induce acute psychosocial stress. We found that dopamine synthesis correlated with subjective threat and physiological response to acute psychosocial stress in the low exposure group. Long-term exposure to psychosocial adversity was associated with dampened striatal dopaminergic function (p=0.03, d = 0.80) and that psychosocial adversity blunted physiological yet potentiated subjective responses to acute psychosocial stress. Future studies should investigate the roles of these changes in vulnerability to mental illnesses. ",
        "Integrative Transcriptomics Reveals Sexually Dimorphic Control of the Cholinergic/Neurokine Interface in Schizophrenia and Bipolar Disorder. RNA sequencing analyses are often limited to identifying lowest p value transcripts, which does not address polygenic phenomena. To overcome this limitation, we developed an integrative approach that combines large-scale transcriptomic meta-analysis of patient brain tissues with single-cell sequencing data of CNS neurons, short RNA sequencing of human male- and female-originating cell lines, and connectomics of transcription factor and microRNA interactions with perturbed transcripts. We used this pipeline to analyze cortical transcripts of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder patients. Although these pathologies show massive transcriptional parallels, their clinically well-known sexual dimorphisms remain unexplained. Our method reveals the differences between afflicted men and women and identifies disease-affected pathways of cholinergic transmission and gp130-family neurokine controllers of immune function interlinked by microRNAs. This approach may open additional perspectives for seeking biomarkers and therapeutic targets in other transmitter systems and diseases. ",
        "Depression in middle and older adulthood: the role of immigration, nutrition, and other determinants of health in the Canadian longitudinal study on aging. BACKGROUND: Little is known about depression in middle-aged and older Canadians and how it is affected by health determinants, particularly immigrant status. This study examined depression and socio-economic, health, immigration and nutrition-related factors in older adults. METHODS: Using weighted comprehensive cohort data from the baseline Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging (n\u2009=\u200927,162) of adults aged 45-85, gender-specific binary logistic regression was conducted with the cross-sectional data using the following variables: 1) Depression (outcome) measured using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Short Depression (CESD-10) rating scale; 2) Immigration status: native-born, recent and mid-term (<\u200920\u2009years), and long-term immigrants (\u226520\u2009years); and 3) covariates: socioeconomic status, physical health (e.g., multi-morbidity), health behavior (e.g., substance use), over-nutrition (e.g., anthropometrics), under-nutrition (e.g., nutrition risk), and dietary intake. RESULTS: The sample respondents were mainly Canadian-born (82.6%), women (50.6%), 56-65\u2009years (58.9%), earning between C$50,000-99,999 (33.2%), and in a relationship (69.4%). When compared to Canadian-born residents, recent, mid-term (<\u200920\u2009years), and longer-term (\u2265 20\u2009years) immigrant women were more likely to report depression and this relationship was robust to adjustments for 32 covariates (adjusted ORs\u2009=\u20091.19, 2.54, respectively, p\u2009<\u20090.001). For women, not completing secondary school (OR\u2009=\u20091.23, p\u2009<\u20090.05), stage 1 hypertension (OR\u2009=\u20091.31, p\u2009<\u20090.001), chronic pain (OR\u2009=\u20091.79, p\u2009<\u20090.001), low fruit/vegetable intakes (OR\u2009=\u20091.33, p\u2009<\u20090.05), and fruit juice (OR\u2009=\u20091.80, p\u2009<\u20090.001), chocolate (ORs\u2009=\u20091.15-1.66, p's\u2009<\u20090.05), or salty snack (OR\u2009=\u20091.19, p\u2009<\u20090.05) consumption were associated with depression. For all participants, lower grip strength (OR\u2009=\u20091.25, p\u2009<\u20090.001) and high nutritional risk (OR\u2009=\u20092.24, p\u2009<\u20090.001) were associated with depression. For men, being in a relationship (OR\u2009=\u20090.62, p\u2009<\u20090.001), completing post-secondary education (OR\u2009=\u20090.82, p\u2009<\u20090.05), higher fat (ORs\u2009=\u20090.67-83, p's\u2009<\u20090.05) and omega-3 egg intake (OR\u2009=\u20090.86, p\u2009<\u20090.05) as well as moderate intakes of fruits/vegetables and calcium/high vitamin D sources (ORs\u2009=\u20090.71-0.743, p's\u2009<\u20090.05) predicted a lower likelihood of depression. For men, chronic conditions (ORs\u2009=\u20091.36-3.65, p's\u2009<\u20090.001), chronic pain (OR\u2009=\u20091.86, p\u2009<\u20090.001), smoking (OR\u2009=\u20091.17, p\u2009<\u20090.001), or chocolate consumption (ORs\u2009=\u20091.14-1.72, p's\u2009<\u20090.05) predicted a higher likelihood of depression. CONCLUSIONS: The odds of developing depression were highest among immigrant women. Depression in middle-aged and older adults is also associated with socioeconomic, physical, and nutritional factors and the relationships differ by sex. These results provide insights for mental health interventions specific to adults aged 45-85. ",
        "Impact of brand drug discount cards on private insurer, government and patient expenditures. BACKGROUND: Brand discount cards have become a popular way for patients to reduce out-of-pocket spending on drugs; however, controversy exists over their potential to increase insurers' costs. We estimated the impact of brand discount cards on Canadian drug expenditures. METHODS: Using national claims-level pharmacy adjudication data, we performed a retrospective comparison of prescriptions filled using a brand discount card matched to equivalent generic prescriptions between September 2014 and September 2017. We investigated the impact on expenditures for 3 groups of prescriptions: those paid only through private insurance, those paid only through public insurance and those paid only out of pocket. RESULTS: We studied 2.82 million prescriptions for 89 different medications for which brand discount cards were used. Use of discount cards resulted in 46% higher private insurance expenditures than comparable generic prescriptions (+$23.09 per prescription, 95% confidence interval [CI] $22.97 to $23.21). Public insurance expenditures were only slightly higher with cards: an increase of 1.3% or $0.37 per prescription (95% CI $0.33 to $0.41). Finally, out-of-pocket transactions using a card resulted in mean patient savings of 7% or $3.49 per prescription (95% CI -$3.55 to -$3.43). The impact varied widely among medicines across all 3 analyses. INTERPRETATION: The use of brand discount cards increased costs to private insurers, had little impact on public insurers and resulted in mixed impacts for patients. These effects likely resulted from private insurers reimbursing brand drug prices even when generics were available and from discount cards being adjudicated after claims were sent to other insurers in most cases. Patients and their clinicians should recognize that discount cards have mixed impacts on out-of-pocket costs. ",
        "Dynamic transition of the blood-brain barrier in the development of non-small cell lung cancer brain metastases. Invasion of the brain by non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) results in a shift of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) to the insufficiently characterized blood-tumor barrier (BTB). Effective drug delivery through the BTB is one of the greatest therapeutic obstacles in treating brain metastases. Using an experimental model, we defined key changes within the BTB and the BBB in the brain around the tumor (BAT) region over time. Brain-seeking NSCLC cells were delivered into the circulation of athymic-nude mice via intracardiac injection and developing brain metastases were evaluated over six-weeks. Components of the BBB and BTB were analyzed using immunofluorescence microscopy and compared using a mixed model of regression. Our results demonstrate a dynamic time-dependent BTB phenotype. Capillaries of the BAT and BTB were dilated with increased CD31 expression compared to controls. Expression of collagen IV, a pan-basement membrane component, was significantly decreased in the BTB compared to the BBB. There was also a significant increase in the desmin-positive pericyte subpopulation in the BTB compared to the BBB. The most striking changes were identified in astrocyte water channels with a 12.18-fold (p < 0.001) decrease in aquaporin-4 in the BTB; the BAT was unchanged. Analysis of NSCLC brain metastases from patient samples similarly demonstrated dilated capillaries and loss of both collagen IV and aquaporin-4. These data provide a comprehensive analysis of the BTB in NSCLC brain metastasis. Astrocytic endfeet, pericytes, and the basement membrane are potential therapeutic targets to improve efficacy of chemotherapeutic delivery into NSCLC brain metastases. ",
        "The effects of musical auditory stimulation on heart rate autonomic responses to driving: A prospective randomized case-control pilot study. Stress induced by driving has been revealed to increase the chances of cardiovascular complications and is involved or related to traffic accidents. In order to develop strategies to avoid health problems during driving we aimed to evaluate the acute effects of auditory stimulation with music on heart rate variability (HRV) during driving in congested urban traffic. This is a prospective cross-sectional randomized controlled pilot study conducted with five healthy women. Subjects were evaluated on two different random days, whose order of execution was established through a randomization process. In the music protocol the volunteers were exposed to music for the entire 20\u202fmin of traffic while in the control protocol the subjects performed the same procedures but were not exposed to any music. We noted that all Higuchi fractal dimension parameters except Kmax 10, Kmax 130 and Kmax 140 were reduced between pre-driving in the control protocol vs. driving in the control protocol. The same changes were noted between pre-driving in the music protocol vs. driving in the control protocol. In conclusion, musical auditory stimulation improved nonlinear HRV changes induced by driving. ",
        "Cytoplasmic RNA Sensor Pathways and Nitazoxanide Broadly Inhibit Intracellular Mycobacterium tuberculosis Growth. To establish stable infection, Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTb) must overcome host innate immune mechanisms, including those that sense pathogen-derived nucleic acids. Here, we show that the host cytosolic RNA sensing molecules RIG-I-like receptor (RLR) signaling proteins RIG-I and MDA5, their common adaptor protein MAVS, and the RNA-dependent kinase PKR each independently inhibit MTb growth in human cells. Furthermore, we show that MTb broadly stimulates RIG-I, MDA5, MAVS, and PKR gene expression and their biological activities. We also show that the oral FDA-approved drug nitazoxanide (NTZ) significantly inhibits intracellular MTb growth and amplifies MTb-stimulated RNA sensor gene expression and activity. This study establishes prototypic cytoplasmic RNA sensors as innate restriction factors for MTb growth in human cells and it shows that targeting this pathway is a potential host-directed approach to treat tuberculosis disease.

        "TET2 Regulates the Neuroinflammatory Response in Microglia. Epigenomic mechanisms regulate distinct aspects of the inflammatory response in immune cells. Despite the central role for microglia in neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration, little is known about their epigenomic regulation of the inflammatory response. Here, we show that Ten-eleven translocation 2 (TET2) methylcytosine dioxygenase expression is increased in microglia upon stimulation with various inflammogens through a NF-\u03baB-dependent pathway. We found that TET2 regulates early gene transcriptional changes, leading to early\u00a0metabolic alterations, as well as a later inflammatory response independently of its enzymatic activity. We further show that TET2 regulates the proinflammatory response in microglia of mice\u00a0intraperitoneally injected with LPS. We observed that microglia associated with amyloid \u03b2 plaques expressed TET2 in brain tissue from individuals with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and in 5xFAD mice. Collectively, our findings show that\u00a0TET2 plays an important role in the microglial inflammatory response and suggest TET2 as a potential target to combat neurodegenerative brain disorders. ",
        "Genomic and epidemiological evidence of bacterial transmission from probiotic capsule to blood in ICU patients. Probiotics are routinely administered to hospitalized patients for many potential indications1 but have been associated with adverse effects that may outweigh their potential benefits2-7. It is particularly alarming that probiotic strains can cause bacteremia8,9, yet direct evidence for an ancestral link between blood isolates and administered probiotics is lacking. Here we report a markedly higher risk of Lactobacillus bacteremia for intensive care unit (ICU) patients treated with probiotics compared to those not treated, and provide genomics data that support the idea of direct clonal transmission of probiotics to the bloodstream. Whole-genome-based phylogeny showed that Lactobacilli isolated from treated patients' blood were phylogenetically inseparable from Lactobacilli isolated from the associated probiotic product. Indeed, the minute genetic diversity among the blood isolates mostly mirrored pre-existing genetic heterogeneity found in the probiotic product. Some blood isolates also contained de novo mutations, including a non-synonymous SNP conferring antibiotic resistance in one patient. Our findings support that probiotic strains can directly cause bacteremia and adaptively evolve within ICU patients. ",
        "Analysis of Powders Containing Illicit Drugs Using Magnetic Levitation. Magneto-Archimedes levitation (MagLev) enables the separation of powdered mixtures of illicit drugs (cocaine, methamphetamine, heroin, fentanyl, and its analogues), adulterants, and diluents based on density, and allows the presumptive identification of individual components. Small samples (mass <50\u2005mg), with low concentrations of illicit drugs, present a particular challenge to analysis for forensic chemists. The MagLev device, a cuvette containing a solution of paramagnetic gadolinium(III) chelate in a non-polar solvent, placed between two like-poles-facing NdFeB magnets, allowed separation of seven relevant compounds simultaneously. In particular, initial separation with MagLev, followed by characterization by FTIR-ATR, enabled identification of fentanyl in a sample of fentanyl-laced heroin (1.3\u2005wt\u2009% fentanyl, 2.6\u2005wt\u2009% heroin, and 96.1\u2005wt\u2009% lactose). MagLev allows identification of unknown powders in mixtures and enables confirmatory identification based on structure-specific techniques. ",
        "A Comparison of the effects of preterm birth and institutional deprivation on child temperament. Both preterm birth and early institutional deprivation are associated with neurodevelopmental impairment-with both shared and distinctive features. To explore shared underlying mechanisms, this study directly compared the effects of these putative risk factors on temperament profiles in six-year-olds: Children born very preterm (<32 weeks gestation) or at very low birthweight (<1500 g) from the Bavarian Longitudinal Study (n = 299); and children who experienced >6 months of deprivation in Romanian institutions from the English and Romanian Adoptees Study (n = 101). The former were compared with 311 healthy term born controls and the latter with 52 nondeprived adoptees. At 6 years, temperament was assessed via parent reports across 5 dimensions: effortful control, activity, shyness, emotionality, and sociability. Very preterm/very low birthweight and postinstitutionalized children showed similarly aberrant profiles in terms of lower effortful control, preterm = -0.50, 95% CI [-0.67, -0.33]; postinstitutionalized = -0.48, 95% CI [-0.82, -0.14], compared with their respective controls. Additionally, postinstitutionalized children showed higher activity, whereas very preterm/very low birthweight children showed lower shyness. Preterm birth and early institutionalization are similarly associated with poorer effortful control, which might contribute to long-term vulnerability. More research is needed to examine temperamental processes as common mediators of negative long-term outcomes following early adversity. ",
        "CD9 identifies pancreatic cancer stem cells and modulates glutamine metabolism to fuel tumour growth. Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) shows great cellular heterogeneity, with pronounced epithelial and mesenchymal cancer cell populations. However, the cellular hierarchy underlying PDAC cell diversity is unknown. Here we identify the tetraspanin CD9 as a marker of PDAC tumour-initiating cells. CD9high cells had increased organoid formation capability, and generated tumour grafts in vivo at limiting dilutions. Tumours initiated from CD9high cells recapitulated the cellular heterogeneity of primary PDAC, whereas CD9low cells produced only duct-like epithelial progeny. CD9 knockdown decreased the growth of PDAC organoids, and heterozygous CD9 deletion in Pdx1-Cre; LSL-KRasG12D; p53F/F mice prolonged overall survival. Mechanistically, CD9 promoted the plasma membrane localization of the glutamine transporter ASCT2, enhancing glutamine uptake in PDAC cells. Thus, our study identifies a PDAC subpopulation capable of initiating PDAC and giving rise to PDAC heterogeneity, suggesting that the cellular diversity of PDAC is generated by PDAC stem cell differentiation.

        "Return to work after critical illness: a systematic review and meta-analysis. BACKGROUND: Survivors of critical illness often experience poor outcomes after hospitalisation, including delayed return to work, which carries substantial economic consequences. OBJECTIVE: To conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of return to work after critical illness. METHODS: We searched PubMed, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL and Cochrane Library from 1970 to February 2018. Data were extracted, in duplicate, and random-effects meta-regression used to obtain pooled estimates. RESULTS: Fifty-two studies evaluated return to work in 10\u2009015 previously employed survivors of critical illness, over a median (IQR) follow-up of 12 (6.25-38.5) months. By 1-3, 12 and 42-60\u2009months' follow-up, pooled return to work prevalence (95% CI) was 36% (23% to 49%), 60% (50% to 69%) and 68% (51% to 85%), respectively (\u03c42=0.55, I2=87%, p=0.03). No significant difference was observed based on diagnosis (acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) vs non-ARDS) or region (Europe vs North America vs Australia/New Zealand), but was observed when comparing mode of employment evaluation (in-person vs telephone vs mail). Following return to work, 20%-36% of survivors experienced job loss, 17%-66%\u2009occupation change and 5%-84% worsening employment status (eg, fewer work hours). Potential risk factors for delayed return to work include pre-existing comorbidities and post-hospital impairments (eg, mental health). CONCLUSION: Approximately two-thirds, two-fifths and one-third of previously employed intensive care unit survivors are jobless up to 3, 12 and 60 months following hospital discharge. Survivors returning to work often experience job loss, occupation change or worse employment status. Interventions should be designed and evaluated to reduce the burden of this common and important problem for survivors of critical illness. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: PROSPERO CRD42018093135. ",
        "Cav2.3 channels contribute to dopaminergic neuron loss in a model of Parkinson's disease. Degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra causes the motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease. The mechanisms underlying this age-dependent and region-selective neurodegeneration remain unclear. Here we identify Cav2.3 channels as regulators of nigral neuronal viability. Cav2.3 transcripts were more abundant than other voltage-gated Ca2+ channels in mouse nigral neurons and upregulated during aging. Plasmalemmal Cav2.3 protein was higher than in dopaminergic neurons of the ventral tegmental area, which do not degenerate in Parkinson's disease. Cav2.3 knockout reduced activity-associated nigral somatic Ca2+ signals and Ca2+-dependent after-hyperpolarizations, and afforded full protection from degeneration in vivo in a neurotoxin Parkinson's mouse model. Cav2.3 deficiency upregulated transcripts for NCS-1, a Ca2+-binding protein implicated in neuroprotection. Conversely, NCS-1 knockout exacerbated nigral neurodegeneration and downregulated Cav2.3. Moreover, NCS-1 levels were reduced in a human iPSC-model of familial Parkinson's. Thus, Cav2.3 and NCS-1 may constitute potential therapeutic targets for combatting Ca2+-dependent neurodegeneration in Parkinson's disease. ",
        "A New Prospective, Home-Based Monitoring of Motor Symptoms in Parkinson's Disease. BACKGROUND: Subjective symptoms, which are retrospectively assessed during clinical interviews in the office, may be influenced by patient recall in Parkinson's disease (PD). Prospective collection of subjective data might be an effective tool to overcome this bias. OBJECTIVE: We investigated the correspondence between prospectively and retrospectively assessed motor symptoms in PD. METHODS: Forty-two consecutive patients (9 females, 67\u00b19.8 years old) with mild to moderate PD reported their symptoms four times a day for two weeks, using the \"SleepFit\" application (app) for tablets. This app incorporates a new Visual Analogue Scale assessing global mobility (m-VAS), and the Scales for Outcome in Parkinson Assessment Diary Card (SCOPA-DC). At day 14, the Movement Disorders Society Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) parts II and IV questionnaires were completed at the hospital. Agreement (root mean square difference) and the tendency to under- or overestimate their symptoms by patients (relative difference after normalization) were calculated to compare prospectively vs. retrospectively collected information. RESULTS: Although agreement was good for overall scores (m-VAS: 10.0%; SCOPA-DC: 18.3%), and for single motor symptoms (involuntary movements, hand dexterity, walking, changing position; each <20%), some individuals with more advanced disease, higher fatigue or worse sleep quality showed poor symptom recall in retrospect. Moreover, a subgroup of patients (16.7%) either over- or underestimated symptom severity. CONCLUSIONS: Regular, prospective monitoring of motor symptoms is suitable in PD patients. SleepFit might be a useful tool in routine practice to identify patients tending to under- or overestimate their symptoms, and for their follow-up. ",
        "Interspecies interactions induce exploratory motility in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Microbes often live in multispecies communities where interactions among community members impact both the individual constituents and the surrounding environment. Here, we developed a system to visualize interspecies behaviors at initial encounters. By imaging two prevalent pathogens known to be coisolated from chronic illnesses, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus, we observed P. aeruginosa can modify surface motility in response to secreted factors from S. aureus. Upon sensing S. aureus, P. aeruginosa transitioned from collective to single-cell motility with an associated increase in speed and directedness - a behavior we refer to as 'exploratory motility'. Explorer cells moved preferentially towards S. aureus and invaded S. aureus colonies through the action of the type IV pili. These studies reveal previously undescribed motility behaviors and lend insight into how P. aeruginosa senses and responds to other species. Identifying strategies to harness these interactions may open avenues for new antimicrobial strategies. ",
        "Association of Transplant Center With Survival Benefit Among Adults Undergoing Heart Transplant in the United States. Importance: In the United States, the number of deceased donor hearts available for transplant is limited. As a proxy for medical urgency, the US heart allocation system ranks heart transplant candidates largely according to the supportive therapy prescribed by transplant centers. Objective: To determine if there is a significant association between transplant center and survival benefit in the US heart allocation system. Design, Setting, and Participants: Observational study of 29\u202f199 adult candidates for heart transplant listed on the national transplant registry from January 2006 through December 2015 with follow-up complete through August 2018. Exposures: Transplant center. Main Outcomes and Measures: The survival benefit associated with heart transplant as defined by the difference between survival after heart transplant and waiting list survival without transplant at 5 years. Each transplant center's mean survival benefit was estimated using a mixed-effects proportional hazards model with transplant as a time-dependent covariate, adjusted for year of transplant, donor quality, ischemic time, and candidate status. Results: Of 29\u202f199 candidates (mean age, 52 years; 26% women) on the transplant waiting list at 113 centers, 19\u202f815 (68%) underwent heart transplant. Among heart transplant recipients, 5389 (27%) died or underwent another transplant operation during the study period. Of the 9384 candidates who did not undergo heart transplant, 5669 (60%) died (2644 while on the waiting list and 3025 after being delisted). Estimated 5-year survival was 77% (interquartile range [IQR], 74% to 80%) among transplant recipients and 33% (IQR, 17% to 51%) among those who did not undergo heart transplant, which is a survival benefit of 44% (IQR, 27% to 59%). Survival benefit ranged from 30% to 55% across centers and 31 centers (27%) had significantly higher survival benefit than the mean and 30 centers (27%) had significantly lower survival benefit than the mean. Compared with low survival benefit centers, high survival benefit centers performed heart transplant for patients with lower estimated expected waiting list survival without transplant (29% at high survival benefit centers vs 39% at low survival benefit centers; survival difference, -10% [95% CI, -12% to -8.1%]), although the adjusted 5-year survival after transplant was not significantly different between high and low survival benefit centers (77.6% vs 77.1%, respectively; survival difference, 0.5% [95% CI, -1.3% to 2.3%]). Overall, for every 10% decrease in estimated transplant candidate waiting list survival at a given center, there was an increase of 6.2% (95% CI, 5.2% to 7.3%) in the 5-year survival benefit associated with heart transplant. Conclusions and Relevance: In this registry-based study of US heart transplant candidates, transplant center was associated with the survival benefit of transplant. Although the adjusted 5-year survival after transplant was not significantly different between high and low survival benefit centers, compared with centers with survival benefit significantly below the mean, centers with survival benefit significantly above the mean performed heart transplant for recipients who had significantly lower estimated expected 5-year waiting list survival without transplant.

        "Increased flux through the mevalonate pathway mediates fibrotic repair without injury. Macrophages are important in mounting an innate immune response to injury as well as in repair of injury. Gene expression of Rho proteins is known to be increased in fibrotic models; however, the role of these proteins in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is not known. Here, we show that BAL cells from patients with IPF have a profibrotic phenotype secondary to increased activation of the small GTPase Rac1. Rac1 activation requires a posttranslational modification, geranylgeranylation, of the C-terminal cysteine residue. We found that by supplying more substrate for geranylgeranylation, Rac1 activation was substantially increased, resulting in profibrotic polarization by increasing flux through the mevalonate pathway. The increased flux was secondary to greater levels of acetyl-CoA from metabolic reprogramming to \u03b2 oxidation. The polarization mediated fibrotic repair in the absence of injury by enhancing macrophage/fibroblast signaling. These observations suggest that targeting the mevalonate pathway may abrogate the role of macrophages in dysregulated fibrotic repair. ",
        "Prediction of Alzheimer's disease diagnosis within 14\u00a0years through A\u03b2 misfolding in blood plasma compared to APOE4 status, and other risk factors. INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease (AD) has a long prodromal stage and identifying high-risk individuals is critical. We aimed to investigate the ability of A\u03b2 misfolding in blood plasma, APOE4 status, and dementia risk factors to predict diagnosis of AD. METHODS: Within a community-based cohort, A\u03b2 misfolding in plasma measured by immuno-infrared sensor and APOE genotype were determined at baseline in 770 participants followed over 14\u00a0years. Associations between A\u03b2 misfolding, APOE4, and other predictors with clinical AD, vascular dementia, and mixed dementia diagnoses were assessed. RESULTS: A\u03b2 misfolding was associated with a 23-fold increased odds of clinical AD diagnosis within 14\u00a0years. No association was observed with vascular dementia/mixed dementia diagnoses. APOE4-positive participants had a 2.4-fold increased odds of clinical AD diagnosis within 14\u00a0years. DISCUSSION: A\u03b2 misfolding in blood plasma was a strong, specific risk prediction marker for clinical AD even many years before diagnosis in a community-based setting. ",
        "Motor cortex can directly drive the globus pallidus neurons in a projection neuron type-dependent manner in the rat. The basal ganglia are critical for the control of motor behaviors and for reinforcement learning. Here, we demonstrate in rats that primary and secondary motor areas (M1 and M2) make functional synaptic connections in the globus pallidus (GP), not usually thought of as an input site of the basal ganglia. Morphological observation revealed that the density of axonal boutons from motor cortices in the GP was 47% and 78% of that in the subthalamic nucleus (STN) from M1 and M2, respectively. Cortical excitation of GP neurons was comparable to that of STN neurons in slice preparations. FoxP2-expressing arkypallidal neurons were preferentially innervated by the motor cortex. The connection probability of cortico-pallidal innervation was higher for M2 than M1. These results suggest that cortico-pallidal innervation is an additional excitatory input to the basal ganglia, and that it can affect behaviors via the cortex-basal ganglia-thalamus motor loop. ",
        "White Noise Background Improves Tone Discrimination by Suppressing Cortical Tuning Curves. The brain faces the difficult task of maintaining a stable representation of key features of the outside world in noisy sensory surroundings. How does the sensory representation change with noise, and how does the brain make sense of it? We investigated the effect of background white noise (WN) on tuning properties of neurons in mouse A1 and its impact on discrimination performance in a go/no-go task. We find that WN suppresses the activity of A1 neurons, which surprisingly increases the discriminability of tones spectrally close to each other. To confirm the involvement of A1, we optogenetically excited parvalbumin-positive (PV+) neurons in A1, which have similar effects as WN on both tuning properties and frequency discrimination. A population model suggests that the suppression of A1 tuning curves increases frequency selectivity and thereby improves discrimination. Our findings demonstrate that the cortical representation of pure tones adapts during noise to improve sensory acuity. ",
        "Towards a fully automated algorithm driven platform for biosystems design. Large-scale data acquisition and analysis are often required in the successful implementation of the design, build, test, and learn (DBTL) cycle in biosystems design. However, it has long been hindered by experimental cost, variability, biases, and missed insights from traditional analysis methods. Here, we report the application of an integrated robotic system coupled with machine learning algorithms to fully automate the DBTL process for biosystems design. As proof of concept, we have demonstrated its capacity by optimizing the lycopene biosynthetic pathway. This fully-automated robotic platform, BioAutomata, evaluates less than 1% of possible variants while outperforming random screening by 77%. A paired predictive model and Bayesian algorithm select experiments which are performed by Illinois Biological Foundry for Advanced Biomanufacturing (iBioFAB). BioAutomata excels with black-box optimization problems, where experiments are expensive and noisy and the success of the experiment is not dependent on extensive prior knowledge of biological mechanisms.

        "Psychophysiological Responses in People Living with Dementia after an Art Gallery Intervention: An Exploratory Study. The use of existing public spaces by people living with dementia, such as museums and art galleries, are becoming popular due to their ability to facilitate programs which promote social engagement and inclusion. However, few studies have investigated physiological outcomes of art gallery-based programs. Using a quasi-experimental design, the present study aimed to investigate the levels of salivary biomarkers of cortisol and interleukin-6, quality of life (QoL), depressive symptoms, cognition, and wellbeing, after attending the National Gallery of Australia (NGA) Art and Dementia program. Twenty-eight people living with dementia, each supported by a carer or family member, were recruited for a six-week program and were followed up at twelve weeks. In total, 25 participants (17 female; mean age 84.6\u00b17.27 years) completed the study, and 22 provided viable saliva samples. The waking to evening salivary cortisol ratio was higher post-intervention (p\u200a=\u200a0.033), and returned to baseline levels at follow-up (p\u200a=\u200a1.00), indicating a more dynamic salivary cortisol rhythm in response to the six-week program. Interleukin-6 levels remained unchanged (p\u200a=\u200a0.664). No improvements in QoL (DEMQOL-Carer) were observed between baseline and post-intervention (p\u200a=\u200a0.076). However, self-reported depressive symptoms decreased post-intervention compared with baseline (p\u200a=\u200a0.015), and memory (immediate recall) (p\u200a=\u200a0.009) and verbal fluency (p\u200a=\u200a0.027) improved between the same timepoints. The NGA Art and Dementia program appears to have quantifiable benefits, including improved hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis function, justifying a need for longer controlled trial inclusive of physiological outcomes.

        "Translocation of TRPV4-PI3K\u03b3 complexes to the plasma membrane drives myofibroblast transdifferentiation. Myofibroblasts are key contributors to pathological fibrotic conditions of several major organs. The transdifferentiation of fibroblasts into myofibroblasts requires both a mechanical signal and transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) signaling. The cation channel transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 (TRPV4) is a critical mediator of myofibroblast transdifferentiation and in vivo fibrosis through its mechanosensitivity to extracellular matrix stiffness. Here, we showed that TRPV4 promoted the transdifferentiation of human and mouse lung fibroblasts through its interaction with phosphoinositide 3-kinase \u03b3 (PI3K\u03b3), forming nanomolar-affinity, intracellular TRPV4-PI3K\u03b3 complexes. TGF-\u03b2 induced the recruitment of TRPV4-PI3K\u03b3 complexes to the plasma membrane and increased the activities of both TRPV4 and PI3K\u03b3. Using gain- and loss-of-function approaches, we showed that both TRPV4 and PI3K\u03b3 were required for myofibroblast transdifferentiation as assessed by the increased production of \u03b1-smooth muscle actin and its incorporation into stress fibers, cytoskeletal changes, collagen-1 production, and contractile force. Expression of various mutant forms of the PI3K\u03b3 catalytic subunit (p110\u03b3) in cells lacking PI3K\u03b3 revealed that only the noncatalytic, amino-terminal domain of p110\u03b3 was necessary and sufficient for TGF-\u03b2-induced TRPV4 plasma membrane recruitment and myofibroblast transdifferentiation. These data suggest that TGF-\u03b2 stimulates a noncanonical scaffolding action of PI3K\u03b3, which recruits TRPV4-PI3K\u03b3 complexes to the plasma membrane, thereby increasing myofibroblast transdifferentiation. Given that both TRPV4 and PI3K\u03b3 have pleiotropic actions, targeting the interaction between them could provide a specific therapeutic approach for inhibiting myofibroblast transdifferentiation.

        "High expression of apoptosis protein (Api-5) in chemoresistant triple-negative breast cancers: an innovative target. Anti-apoptotic protein-5 (API-5) is a survival protein interacting with the protein acinus, preventing its cleavage by caspase-3 and thus inhibiting apoptosis. We studied the effect of targeting API-5 in chemoresistant triple negative breast cancers (TNBCs), to reverse chemoresistance. 78 TNBC biopsies from patients with different responses to chemotherapy were analysed for API-5 expression before any treatment. Further studies on API-5 expression and inhibition were performed on patient-derived TNBC xenografts, one highly sensitive to chemotherapies (XBC-S) and the other resistant to most tested drugs (XBC-R). In situ assessments of necrosis, cell proliferation, angiogenesis, and apoptosis in response to anti-API-5 peptide were performed on the TNBC xenografts. Clinical analyses of the 78 TNBC biopsies revealed that API-5 was more markedly expressed in endothelial cells before any treatment among patients with chemoresistant TNBC, and this was associated with greater micro-vessel density. A transcriptomic analysis of xenografted tumors showed an involvement of anti-apoptotic genes in the XBC-R model, and API-5 expression was higher in XBC-R endothelial cells. API-5 expression was also correlated with hypoxic stress conditions both in vitro and in vivo. 28 days of anti-API-5 peptide efficiently inhibited the XBC-R xenograft via caspase-3 apoptosis. This inhibition was associated with major inhibition of angiogenesis associated with necrosis and apoptosis. API-5 protein could be a valid therapeutic target in chemoresistant metastatic TNBC. ",
        "Fast fit-free analysis of fluorescence lifetime imaging via deep learning. Fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLI) provides unique quantitative information in biomedical and molecular biology studies but relies on complex data-fitting techniques to derive the quantities of interest. Herein, we propose a fit-free approach in FLI image formation that is based on deep learning (DL) to quantify fluorescence decays simultaneously over a whole image and at fast speeds. We report on a deep neural network (DNN) architecture, named fluorescence lifetime imaging network (FLI-Net) that is designed and trained for different classes of experiments, including visible FLI and near-infrared (NIR) FLI microscopy (FLIM) and NIR gated macroscopy FLI (MFLI). FLI-Net outputs quantitatively the spatially resolved lifetime-based parameters that are typically employed in the field. We validate the utility of the FLI-Net framework by performing quantitative microscopic and preclinical lifetime-based studies across the visible and NIR spectra, as well as across the 2 main data acquisition technologies. These results demonstrate that FLI-Net is well suited to accurately quantify complex fluorescence lifetimes in cells and, in real time, in intact animals without any parameter settings. Hence, FLI-Net paves the way to reproducible and quantitative lifetime studies at unprecedented speeds, for improved dissemination and impact of FLI in many important biomedical applications ranging from fundamental discoveries in molecular and cellular biology to clinical translation.

        "Massively-Parallelized, Deterministic Mechanoporation for Intracellular Delivery. Microfluidic intracellular delivery approaches based on plasma membrane poration have shown promise for addressing the limitations of conventional cellular engineering techniques in a wide range of applications in biology and medicine. However, the inherent stochasticity of the poration process in many of these approaches often results in a trade-off between delivery efficiency and cellular viability, thus potentially limiting their utility. Herein, we present a novel microfluidic device concept that mitigates this trade-off by providing opportunity for deterministic mechanoporation (DMP) of cells en masse. This is achieved by the impingement of each cell upon a single needle-like penetrator during aspiration-based capture, followed by diffusive influx of exogenous cargo through the resulting membrane pore, once the cells are released by reversal of flow. Massive parallelization enables high throughput operation, while single-site poration allows for delivery of small and large-molecule cargos in difficult-to-transfect cells with efficiencies and viabilities that exceed both conventional and emerging transfection techniques. As such, DMP shows promise for advancing cellular engineering practice in general and engineered cell product manufacturing in particular. ",
        "Phosphatidylserine on viable sperm and phagocytic machinery in oocytes regulate mammalian fertilization. Fertilization is essential for species survival. Although Izumo1 and Juno are critical for initial interaction between gametes, additional molecules necessary for sperm:egg fusion on both the sperm and the oocyte remain to be defined. Here, we show that phosphatidylserine (PtdSer) is exposed on the head region of viable and motile sperm, with PtdSer exposure progressively increasing during sperm transit through the epididymis. Functionally, masking phosphatidylserine on sperm via three different approaches inhibits fertilization. On the oocyte, phosphatidylserine recognition receptors BAI1, CD36, Tim-4, and Mer-TK contribute to fertilization. Further, oocytes lacking the cytoplasmic ELMO1, or functional disruption of RAC1 (both of which signal downstream of BAI1/BAI3), also affect sperm entry into oocytes. Intriguingly, mammalian sperm could fuse with skeletal myoblasts, requiring PtdSer on sperm and BAI1/3, ELMO2, RAC1 in myoblasts. Collectively, these data identify phosphatidylserine on viable sperm and PtdSer recognition receptors on oocytes as key players in sperm:egg fusion. ",
        "Association of Preoperative Patient Frailty and Operative Stress With Postoperative Mortality. Importance: Patients with frailty have higher risk for postoperative mortality and complications; however, most research has focused on small groups of high-risk procedures. The associations among frailty, operative stress, and mortality are poorly understood. Objective: To assess the association between frailty and mortality at varying levels of operative stress as measured by the Operative Stress Score, a novel measure created for this study. Design, Setting, and Participants: This retrospective cohort study included veterans in the Veterans Administration Surgical Quality Improvement Program from April 1, 2010, through March 31, 2014, who underwent a noncardiac surgical procedure at Veterans Health Administration Hospitals and had information available on vital status (whether the patient was alive or deceased) at 1 year postoperatively. A Delphi consensus method was used to stratify surgical procedures into 5 categories of physiologic stress. Exposures: Frailty as measured by the Risk Analysis Index and operative stress as measured by the Operative Stress Score. Main Outcomes and Measures: Postoperative mortality at 30, 90, and 180 days. Results: Of 432\u202f828 unique patients (401\u202f453 males [92.8%]; mean (SD) age, 61.0 [12.9] years), 36\u202f579 (8.5%) were frail and 9113 (2.1%) were very frail. The 30-day mortality rate among patients who were frail and underwent the lowest-stress surgical procedures (eg, cystoscopy) was 1.55% (95% CI, 1.20%-1.97%) and among patients with frailty who underwent the moderate-stress surgical procedures (eg, laparoscopic cholecystectomy) was 5.13% (95% CI, 4.79%-5.48%); these rates exceeded the 1% mortality rate often used to define high-risk surgery. Among patients who were very frail, 30-day mortality rates were higher after the lowest-stress surgical procedures (10.34%; 95% CI, 7.73%-13.48%) and after the moderate-stress surgical procedures (18.74%; 95% CI, 17.72%-19.80%). For patients who were frail and very frail, mortality continued to increase at 90 and 180 days, reaching 43.00% (95% CI, 41.69%-44.32%) for very frail patients at 180 days after moderate-stress surgical procedures. Conclusions and Relevance: We developed a novel operative stress score to quantify physiologic stress for surgical procedures. Patients who were frail and very frail had high rates of postoperative mortality across all levels of the Operative Stress Score. These findings suggest that frailty screening should be applied universally because low- and moderate-stress procedures may be high risk among patients who are frail. ",
        "Plasma Desmosine and Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm Disease. Background It is recognized that factors beyond aortic size are important in predicting outcome in abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) disease. AAA is characterized by the breakdown of elastin within the aortic tunica media, leading to aortic dilatation and rupture. The aim of this study was to investigate the association of plasma desmosine (pDES), an elastin-specific degradation product, with disease severity and clinical outcome in patients with AAA. Methods and Results We measured pDES and serum biomarker concentrations in 507 patients with AAAs (94% men; mean age, 72.4\u00b16.1\u00a0years; mean AAA diameter, 48\u00b18\u00a0mm) and 162 control subjects (100% men; mean age, 71.5\u00b14.4\u00a0years) from 2 observational cohort studies. In the longitudinal cohort study (n=239), we explored the incremental prognostic value of pDES on AAA events. pDES was higher in patients with AAA compared with control subjects (mean\u00b1SD: 0.46\u00b10.22 versus 0.33\u00b10.16\u00a0ng/mL; P<0.001) and had the strongest correlation with AAA diameter (r=0.39; P<0.0001) of any serum biomarker. After adjustment for baseline AAA diameter, pDES was associated with an AAA event (hazard ratio, 2.03 per SD increase [95% CI, 1.02-4.02]; P=0.044). In addition to AAA diameter, pDES provided incremental improvement in risk stratification (continuous net reclassification improvement, 34.4% [95% CI, -10.8% to 57.5%; P=0.09]; integrated discrimination improvement, 0.04 [95% CI, 0.00-0.15; P=0.050]). Conclusions pDES concentrations predict disease severity and clinical outcomes in patients with AAA. Clinical Trial Registration http://www.isrctn.com. Unique identifier: ISRCTN76413758. ",
        "Evidence for independent brain and neurocranial reorganization during hominin evolution. Throughout hominin evolution, the brain of our ancestors underwent a 3-fold increase in size and substantial structural reorganization. However, inferring brain reorganization from fossil hominin neurocrania (=braincases) remains a challenge, above all because comparative data relating brain to neurocranial structures in living humans and great apes are still scarce. Here we use MRI and same-subject spatially aligned computed tomography (CT) and MRI data of humans and chimpanzees to quantify the spatial relationships between these structures, both within and across species. Results indicate that evolutionary changes in brain and neurocranial structures are largely independent of each other. The brains of humans compared to chimpanzees exhibit a characteristic posterior shift of the inferior pre- and postcentral gyri, indicative of reorganization of the frontal opercular region. Changes in human neurocranial structure do not reflect cortical reorganization. Rather, they reflect constraints related to increased encephalization and obligate bipedalism, resulting in relative enlargement of the parietal bones and anterior displacement of the cerebellar fossa. This implies that the relative position and size of neurocranial bones, as well as overall endocranial shape (e.g., globularity), should not be used to make inferences about evolutionary changes in the relative size or reorganization of adjacent cortical regions of fossil hominins.

        "Prospective cohort study examining the use of regional anesthesia for early pain management after combat-related extremity injury. BACKGROUND: No studies have examined the long-term benefits of regional anesthesia (RA) for pain management after combat-related injury. The objective of this prospective cohort study was to examine the relationship between RA administration and patient-reported pain-related outcomes among Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) and Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) service members sustaining a combat-related extremity injury. METHODS: Between 2007 and 2013, n=358 American military personnel injured in OEF/OIF were enrolled at two military treatment facilities. Individuals were followed for up to 2\u2009years after injury. Cohorts were defined based on whether participants were administered RA within 7 days after sustaining a combat-related injury, or not. Linear mixed effects models examined the association between RA and average pain intensity. Secondary outcomes included pain relief, pain interference, neuropathic pain symptoms, treatment outcomes related to pain management, and mental health symptoms. RESULTS: Receiving early RA was associated with improved average pain over the first 6 months after injury (\u03b2=-0.57; p=0.012) adjusting for injury severity and length of stay at the primary treatment facility. This difference was observed up to 24 months after injury (\u03b2=-0.36; p=0.046). Individuals receiving early RA reported greater pain relief, improved neuropathic pain intensity, and higher satisfaction with pain outcomes; however, by 24 months, mean scores did not significantly differ between cohorts. CONCLUSION: Findings indicate that when administered soon after traumatic injury, RA is a valuable pain management intervention. Future longitudinal studies investigating the timely delivery of RA for optimal pain management in civilian trauma settings are needed. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT00431847. ",
        "A randomised single-centre trial of inhaled liposomal cyclosporine for bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome post-lung transplantation. Introduction: No proven treatments exist for bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS) following lung transplantation. Inhaled liposomal cyclosporine (L-CsA) may prevent BOS progression. Methods: A 48-week phase IIb randomised clinical trial was conducted in 21 lung transplant patients with BOS assigned to either L-CsA with standard-of-care (SOC) oral immunosuppression (L-CsA group) or SOC (SOC-alone group). Efficacy end-points were BOS progression-free survival (defined as absence of \u226520% decline in forced expiratory volume in 1\u2005s (FEV1) from randomisation, re-transplantation or death) and BOS grade change. Results: BOS progression-free survival was 82% for L-CsA versus 50% for SOC-alone (p=0.1) and BOS grade worsened in 18% for L-CsA versus 60% for SOC-alone (p=0.05). Mean changes in \u0394FEV1 and forced vital capacity, respectively, stabilised with L-CsA: +0.005 (95% CI -0.004-\u200a+0.013) and -0.005 (95% CI -0.015-\u200a+0.006)\u2005L\u00b7month-1, but worsened with SOC-alone: -0.023 (95% CI -0.033-\u200a-0.013) and -0.026 (95% CI -0.039-\u200a-0.014)\u2005L\u00b7month-1 (p<0.0001 and p=0.009). Median survival (4.1 versus 2.9\u2005years; p=0.03) and infection rate (45% versus 60%; p=0.7) improved with L-CsA versus SOC-alone; creatinine and tacrolimus levels were similar. Conclusions: L-CsA was well tolerated and stabilised lung function in lung transplant recipients affected by BOS without systemic toxicity, providing a basis for a global phase III trial using L-CsA.

        "G protein-biased kratom-alkaloids and synthetic carfentanil-amide opioids as potential treatments for alcohol use disorder. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Mitragyna speciosa, more commonly known as kratom, is a plant that contains opioidergic alkaloids but is unregulated in most countries. Kratom is used in the self-medication of chronic pain and to reduce illicit and prescription opioid dependence. Kratom may be less dangerous than typical opioids because of the stronger preference of kratom alkaloids to induce receptor interaction with G proteins over \u03b2-arrestin proteins. We hypothesized that kratom (alkaloids) can also reduce alcohol intake. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: We pharmacologically characterized kratom extracts, kratom alkaloids (mitragynine, 7-hydroxymitragynine, paynantheine, and speciogynine) and synthetic carfentanil-amide opioids for their ability to interact with G proteins and \u03b2-arrestin at \u03bc, \u03b4, and \u03ba opioid receptors in vitro. We used C57BL/6 mice to assess to which degree these opioids could reduce alcohol intake and whether they had rewarding properties. KEY RESULTS: Kratom alkaloids were strongly G protein-biased at all three opioid receptors and reduced alcohol intake, but kratom and 7-hydroxymitragynine were rewarding. Several results indicated a key role for \u03b4 opioid receptors, including that the synthetic carfentanil-amide opioid MP102-a G protein-biased agonist with modest selectivity for \u03b4 opioid receptors-reduced alcohol intake, whereas the G protein-biased \u03bc opioid agonist TRV130 did not. CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS: Our results suggest that kratom extracts can decrease alcohol intake but still carry significant risk upon prolonged use. Development of more \u03b4 opioid-selective synthetic opioids may provide a safer option than kratom to treat alcohol use disorder with fewer side effects. ",
        "Improving risk prediction in heart failure using machine learning. BACKGROUND: Predicting mortality is important in patients with heart failure (HF). However, current strategies for predicting risk are only modestly successful, likely because they are derived from statistical analysis methods that fail to capture prognostic information in large data sets containing multi-dimensional interactions. METHODS AND RESULTS: We used a machine learning algorithm to capture correlations between patient characteristics and mortality. A model was built by training a boosted decision tree algorithm to relate a subset of the patient data with a very high or very low mortality risk in a cohort of 5822 hospitalized and ambulatory patients with HF. From this model we derived a risk score that accurately discriminated between low and high-risk of death by identifying eight variables (diastolic blood pressure, creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, haemoglobin, white blood cell count, platelets, albumin, and red blood cell distribution width). This risk score had an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.88 and was predictive across the full spectrum of risk. External validation in two separate HF populations gave AUCs of 0.84 and 0.81, which were superior to those obtained with two available risk scores in these same populations. CONCLUSIONS: Using machine learning and readily available variables, we generated and validated a mortality risk score in patients with HF that was more accurate than other risk scores to which it was compared. These results support the use of this machine learning approach for the evaluation of patients with HF and in other settings where predicting risk has been challenging. ",
        "Unbiased peptoid combinatorial cell screen identifies plectin protein as a potential biomarker for lung cancer stem cells. Tumors often contain a small subset of drug-resisting, self-renewing, and highly metastatic cells called tumor initiating cells or cancer stem cells (CSCs). To develop new approaches to detecting and targeting lung cancer CSCs, we applied an \"unbiased\" peptoid combinatorial cell screen to identify highly specific ligands that bind a CSC subpopulation of non-small cell lung cancer cells (defined by Aldefluor positivity), but not the remaining aldefluor negative cancer cells from the same preclinical model. One of the 'hit' peptoids bound to plectin, a structural protein, predominantly expressed intracellularly, but whose localization on the cell surface is linked to tumor invasion and metastasis. Our studies show both genotypic and phenotypic correlations between plectin and lung CSCs, as well as association of high plectin mRNA expression with poor patient survival in lung adenocarcinoma, potentially identifying plectin as a biomarker for lung CSCs.

        "Trends in Self-perceived Weight Status, Weight Loss Attempts, and Weight Loss Strategies Among Adults in the United States, 1999-2016. Importance: The self-perception of weight and weight loss attempts might promote weight loss and maintenance. Objective: To examine trends in current measured body mass index (BMI) and weight, self-reported weight, self-perceived weight status, weight loss attempts, and weight loss strategies among adults in the United States. Design, Setting, and Participants: This national cross-sectional study used data from continuous National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data sets (1999-2000 to 2015-2016). Participants were US residents older than 20 years. Data were analyzed from January 2018 to December 2018. Main Outcomes and Measures: Current measured BMI and weight, self-reported weight, self-perceived weight status, weight loss attempts, and applied weight loss strategies. Adjusted, self-reported, prior-year weight was calculated using correction equations that considered age, sex, race/ethnicity, and quartile of self-reported prior-year weight. Results: Data were collected from 48\u202f026 participants (19\u202f792 [41.2%] aged 40-64 years; 24\u202f255 [50.5%] women; 21\u202f725 [45.2%] white) through 9 surveys from 1999-2000 to 2015-2016. Increasing trends were observed in current measured BMI (difference, 1.20; 95% CI, 0.92-1.47; P for trend\u2009<\u2009.001), current measured weight (difference 2.77 kg; 95% CI, 1.92-3.61 kg; P for trend\u2009<\u2009.001), adjusted, self-reported, prior-year weight (difference, 2.36 kg; 95% CI, 1.52-3.21 kg; P for trend\u2009<\u2009.001), and the difference between measured and adjusted self-reported weight (difference 0.70 kg; 95% CI, 0.34-1.07 kg; P for trend\u2009<\u2009.001). During this period, the proportion of overall participants who had attempted to lose weight increased from 34.3% to 42.2% (difference, 8.0%; 95% CI, 4.1%-10.5%; P for trend\u2009<\u2009.001). The most commonly reported weight loss strategies with the most rapidly increasing prevalence during the study period were reduced food consumption (21.2%-31.9%; difference, 11.1%; 95% CI, 8.2%-13.3%; P for trend\u2009<\u2009.001), exercise (18.2%-31.5%; difference, 14.4%; 95% CI, 11.3%-16.9%; P for trend\u2009<\u2009.001), and frequent water intake (0.2%-26.3%; difference, 26.2%; 95% CI, 24.1%-29.0%; P for trend\u2009<\u2009.001). Between 2005-2006 and 2015-2016, increases were also observed for the reported consumption of more fruits, vegetables, and salads (0.1%-29.4%; difference, 30.3%; 95% CI, 28.1%-31.2%; P for trend\u2009<\u2009.001), changing eating habits (0.3%-20.5%; difference, 20.2%; 95% CI, 19.1%-22.3%; P for trend\u2009<\u2009.001), and the consumption of less sugar, candy, and sweets (0.2%-20.9%; difference, 21.7%; 95% CI, 19.3%-22.6%; P for trend\u2009<\u2009.001). Conclusions and Relevance: In this cross-sectional study, our data indicated an increasing trend in the proportion of participants who attempted to lose weight and a parallel increasing trend in current measured BMI and weight among adults in the United States.

        "Addressing palliative and end-of-life care needs with Native American elders. BACKGROUND: Life-limiting illness plagues Native Americans, yet access to palliative and end-of-life care, including hospice care, is severely limited. AIM: This study aimed to explore palliative and hospice care with Native American elders and tribal health educators on a Northern Plains reservation in the US. METHODS: Using a community-based participatory approach, participants discussed the cultural acceptability of palliative and hospice care in their tribal community. Monthly talking circles were held over a 5-month period. RESULTS: Opportunities were present for improving cultural awareness and advance directive education to elders. Challenges raised were related to infrastructure, tribal government and the Indian Health Service. Needs identified included cultural awareness and language education for health-care providers and advance directive education. CONCLUSION: Community-based participatory research is useful when working with indigenous populations. Health professionals providing services to Native American communities must embrace cultural differences, seeking to learn from the culture itself how to best meet its people's needs. ",
        "Association of Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy With Change in Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction in Patients With Chemotherapy-Induced Cardiomyopathy. Importance: The incidence of chemotherapy-induced cardiomyopathy is increasing and is associated with poor clinical outcomes. Objective: To assess the association of cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) with improvement in cardiac function, as well as clinical improvement in patients with chemotherapy-induced cardiomyopathy. Design, Setting, and Participants: The Multicenter Automatic Defibrillator Implantation Trial-Chemotherapy-Induced Cardiomyopathy was an uncontrolled, prospective, cohort study conducted between November 21, 2014, and June 21, 2018, at 12 tertiary centers with cardio-oncology programs in the United States. Thirty patients were implanted with CRT owing to reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF\u226435%), New York Heart Association class II-IV heart failure symptoms, and wide QRS complex, with established chemotherapy-induced cardiomyopathy and were followed up for 6 months after CRT implantation. The date of final follow-up was February 6, 2019. Exposures: CRT implantation according to standard of care. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary end point was change in LVEF from baseline to 6 months after initiating CRT. Secondary outcomes included all-cause mortality and change in left ventricular end-systolic volume and end-diastolic volume. Results: Among 30 patients who were enrolled (mean [SD] age, 64 [11] years; 26 women [87%]; 73% had a history of breast cancer; 20% had a history of lymphoma or leukemia), primary end point data were available for 26 patients and secondary end point data were available for 23 patients. Patients had nonischemic cardiomyopathy with left bundle branch block, median LVEF of 29%, and a mean QRS duration of 152 ms. Patients with CRT experienced a statistically significant improvement in mean LVEF at 6 months from 28% to 39% (difference, 10.6% [95% CI, 8.0%-13.3%]; P\u2009<\u2009.001). This was accompanied by a reduction in LV end-systolic volume from 122.7 to 89.0 mL (difference, 37.0 mL [95% CI, 28.2-45.8]) and reduction in LV end-diastolic volume from 171.0 to 143.2 mL (difference, 31.9 mL [95% CI, 22.1-41.6]) (both P\u2009<\u2009.001). Adverse events included a procedure-related pneumothorax (1 patient), a device pocket infection (1 patient), and heart failure requiring hospitalization during follow-up (1 patient). Conclusions and Relevance: In this preliminary study of patients with chemotherapy-induced cardiomyopathy, CRT was associated with improvement in LVEF after 6 months. The findings are limited by the small sample size, short follow-up, and absence of a control group. Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02164721. ",
        "Association of Receiving Multiple, Concurrent Fracture-Associated Drugs With Hip Fracture Risk. Importance: Many prescription drugs increase fracture risk, which raises concern for patients receiving 2 or more such drugs concurrently. Logic suggests that risk will increase with each additional drug, but the risk of taking multiple fracture-associated drugs (FADs) is unknown. Objective: To estimate hip fracture risk associated with concurrent exposure to multiple FADs. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study used a 20% random sample of Medicare fee-for-service administrative data for age-eligible Medicare beneficiaries from 2004 to 2014. Sex-stratified Cox regression models estimated hip fracture risk associated with current receipt of 1, 2, or 3 or more of 21 FADs and, separately, risk associated with each FAD and 2-way FAD combination vs no FADs. Models included sociodemographic characteristics, comorbidities, and use of non-FAD medications. Analyses began in November 2018 and were completed April 2019. Exposure: Receipt of prescription FADs. Main Outcomes and Measures: Hip fracture hospitalization. Results: A total of 11.3 million person-years were observed, reflecting 2\u202f646\u202f255 individuals (mean [SD] age, 77.2 [7.3] years, 1\u202f615\u202f613 [61.1%] women, 2\u202f136\u202f585 [80.7%] white, and 219\u202f579 [8.3%] black). Overall, 2\u202f827\u202f284 person-years (25.1%) involved receipt of 1 FAD; 1\u202f322\u202f296 (11.7%), 2 FADs; and 954\u202f506 (8.5%), 3 or more FADs. In fully adjusted, sex-stratified models, an increase in hip fracture risk among women was associated with the receipt of 1, 2, or 3 or more FADs (1 FAD: hazard ratio [HR], 2.04; 95% CI, 1.99-2.11; P\u2009<\u2009.001; 2 FADs: HR, 2.86; 95% CI, 2.77-2.95; P\u2009<\u2009.001; \u22653 FADs: HR, 4.50; 95% CI, 4.36-4.65; P\u2009<\u2009.001). Relative risks for men were slightly higher (1 FAD: HR, 2.23; 95% CI, 2.11-2.36; P\u2009<\u2009.001; 2 FADs: HR, 3.40; 95% CI, 3.20-3.61; P\u2009<\u2009.001; \u22653 FADs: HR, 5.18; 95% CI, 4.87-5.52; P\u2009<\u2009.001). Among women, 2 individual FADs were associated with HRs greater than 3.00; 80 pairs of FADs exceeded this threshold. Common, risky pairs among women included sedative hypnotics plus opioids (HR, 4.90; 95% CI, 3.98-6.02; P\u2009<\u2009.001), serotonin reuptake inhibitors plus benzodiazepines (HR, 4.50; 95% CI, 3.76-5.38; P\u2009<\u2009.001), and proton pump inhibitors plus opioids (HR, 4.00; 95% CI, 3.56-4.49; P\u2009<\u2009.001). Receipt of 1, 2, or 3 or more non-FADs was associated with a small, significant reduction in fracture risk compared with receipt of no non-FADs among women (1 non-FAD: HR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.90-0.96; P\u2009<\u2009.001; 2 non-FADs: HR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.81-0.87; P\u2009<\u2009.001; \u22653 non-FADs: HR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.72-0.77; P\u2009<\u2009.001). Conclusions and Relevance: Among older adults, FADs are commonly used and commonly combined. In this cohort study, the addition of a second and third FAD was associated with a steep increase in fracture risk. Many risky pairs of FADs included potentially avoidable drugs (eg, sedatives and opioids). If confirmed, these findings suggest that fracture risk could be reduced through tighter adherence to long-established prescribing guidelines and recommendations. ",
        "Development and Validation of a Predictive Model of the Risk of Pediatric Septic Shock Using Data Known at the Time of Hospital Arrival. OBJECTIVE: To derive and validate a model of risk of septic shock among children with suspected sepsis, using data known in the electronic health record at hospital arrival. STUDY DESIGN: This observational cohort study at 6 pediatric emergency department and urgent care sites used a training dataset (5 sites, April 1, 2013, to December 31, 2016), a temporal test set (5 sites, January 1, 2017 to June 30, 2018), and a geographic test set (a sixth site, April 1, 2013, to December 31, 2018). Patients 60\u00a0days to 18\u00a0years of age in whom clinicians suspected sepsis were included; patients with septic shock on arrival were excluded. The outcome, septic shock, was systolic hypotension with vasoactive medication or \u226530\u00a0mL/kg of isotonic crystalloid within 24\u00a0hours of arrival. Elastic net regularization, a penalized regression technique, was used to develop a model in the training set. RESULTS: Of 2464 included visits, septic shock occurred in 282 (11.4%). The model had an area under the curve of 0.79 (0.76-0.83) in the training set, 0.75 (0.69-0.81) in the temporal test set, and 0.87 (0.73-1.00) in the geographic test set. With a threshold set to 90% sensitivity in the training set, the model yielded 82% (72%-90%) sensitivity and 48% (44%-52%) specificity in the temporal test set, and 90% (55%-100%) sensitivity and 32% (21%-46%) specificity in the geographic test set. CONCLUSIONS: This model estimated the risk of septic shock in children at hospital arrival earlier than existing models. It leveraged the predictive value of routine electronic health record data through a modern predictive algorithm and has the potential to enhance clinical risk stratification in the critical moments before deterioration.

        "Enhanced gaze-following behavior in Deaf infants of Deaf parents. Gaze following plays a role in parent-infant communication and is a key mechanism by which infants acquire information about the world from social input. Gaze following in Deaf infants has been understudied. Twelve Deaf infants of Deaf parents (DoD) who had native exposure to American Sign Language (ASL) were gender-matched and age-matched (\u00b17\u00a0days) to 60 spoken-language hearing control infants. Results showed that the DoD infants had significantly higher gaze-following scores than the hearing infants. We hypothesize that in the absence of auditory input, and with support from ASL-fluent Deaf parents, infants become attuned to visual-communicative signals from other people, which engenders increased gaze following. These findings underscore the need to revise the 'deficit model' of deafness. Deaf infants immersed in natural sign language from birth are better at understanding the signals and identifying the referential meaning of adults' gaze behavior compared to hearing infants not exposed to sign language.\u00a0Broader implications for theories of social-cognitive development are discussed.

        "Lin28b controls a neonatal to adult switch in B cell positive selection. The ability of B-1 cells to become positively selected into the mature B cell pool, despite being weakly self-reactive, has puzzled the field since its initial discovery. Here, we explore changes in B cell positive selection as a function of developmental time by exploiting a link between CD5 surface levels and the natural occurrence of self-reactive B cell receptors (BCRs) in BCR wild-type mice. We show that the heterochronic RNA binding protein Lin28b potentiates a neonatal mode of B cell selection characterized by enhanced overall positive selection in general and the developmental progression of CD5+ immature B cells in particular. Lin28b achieves this by amplifying the CD19/PI3K/c-Myc positive feedback loop, and ectopic Lin28b expression restores both positive selection and mature B cell numbers in CD19-/- adult mice. Thus, the temporally restricted expression of Lin28b relaxes the rules for B cell selection during ontogeny by modulating tonic signaling. We propose that this neonatal mode of B cell selection represents a cell-intrinsic cue to accelerate the de novo establishment of the adaptive immune system and incorporate a layer of natural antibody-mediated immunity throughout life.

        "Single-cell transcriptomics reveals expansion of cytotoxic CD4 T cells in supercentenarians. Supercentenarians, people who have reached 110 y of age, are a great model of healthy aging. Their characteristics of delayed onset of age-related diseases and compression of morbidity imply that their immune system remains functional. Here we performed single-cell transcriptome analysis of 61,202 peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), derived from 7 supercentenarians and 5 younger controls. We identified a marked increase of cytotoxic CD4 T cells (CD4 cytotoxic T lymphocytes [CTLs]) as a signature of supercentenarians. Furthermore, single-cell T cell receptor sequencing of 2 supercentenarians revealed that CD4 CTLs had accumulated through massive clonal expansion, with the most frequent clonotypes accounting for 15 to 35% of the entire CD4 T cell population. The CD4 CTLs exhibited substantial heterogeneity in their degree of cytotoxicity as well as a nearly identical transcriptome to that of CD8 CTLs. This indicates that CD4 CTLs utilize the transcriptional program of the CD8 lineage while retaining CD4 expression. Indeed, CD4 CTLs extracted from supercentenarians produced IFN-\u03b3 and TNF-\u03b1 upon ex vivo stimulation. Our study reveals that supercentenarians have unique characteristics in their circulating lymphocytes, which may represent an essential adaptation to achieve exceptional longevity by sustaining immune responses to infections and diseases.

        "BRN4 Is a Novel Driver of Neuroendocrine Differentiation in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer and Is Selectively Released in Extracellular Vesicles with BRN2. PURPOSE: Neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC), an aggressive variant of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), often emerges after androgen receptor-targeted therapies such as enzalutamide or de novo, via trans-differentiation process of neuroendocrine differentiation. The mechanistic basis of neuroendocrine differentiation is poorly understood, contributing to lack of effective predictive biomarkers and late disease recognition. The purpose of this study was to examine the role of novel proneural Pit-Oct-Unc-domain transcription factors (TF) in NEPC and examine their potential as noninvasive predictive biomarkers.Experimental Design: Prostate cancer patient-derived xenograft models, clinical samples, and cellular neuroendocrine differentiation models were employed to determine the expression of TFs BRN1 and BRN4. BRN4 levels were modulated in prostate cancer cell lines followed by functional assays. Furthermore, extracellular vesicles (EV) were isolated from patient samples and cell culture models, characterized by nanoparticle tracking analyses, Western blotting, and real-time PCR. RESULTS: We identify for the first time that: (i) BRN4 is amplified and overexpressed in NEPC clinical samples and that BRN4 overexpression drives neuroendocrine differentiation via its interplay with BRN2, a TF that was previously implicated in NEPC; (ii) BRN4 and BRN2 mRNA are actively released in prostate cancer EVs upon neuroendocrine differentiation induction; and (iii) enzalutamide treatment augments release of BRN4 and BRN2 in prostate cancer EVs, promoting neuroendocrine differentiation induction. CONCLUSIONS: Our study identifies a novel TF that drives NEPC and suggests that as adaptive mechanism to enzalutamide treatment, prostate cancer cells express and secrete BRN4 and BRN2 in EVs that drive oncogenic reprogramming of prostate cancer cells to NEPC. Importantly, EV-associated BRN4 and BRN2 are potential novel noninvasive biomarkers to predict neuroendocrine differentiation in CRPC. ",
        "Secondary Surgical Cytoreduction for Recurrent Ovarian Cancer. BACKGROUND: Secondary surgical cytoreduction in women with platinum-sensitive, recurrent epithelial ovarian, primary peritoneal, or fallopian-tube (\"ovarian\") cancer is widely practiced but has not been evaluated in phase 3 investigation. METHODS: We randomly assigned patients with recurrent ovarian cancer who had received one previous therapy, had an interval during which no platinum-based chemotherapy was used (platinum-free interval) of 6 months or more, and had investigator-determined resectable disease (to no macroscopic residual disease) to undergo secondary surgical cytoreduction and then receive platinum-based chemotherapy or to receive platinum-based chemotherapy alone. Adjuvant chemotherapy (paclitaxel-carboplatin or gemcitabine-carboplatin) and use of bevacizumab were at the discretion of the investigator. The primary end point was overall survival. RESULTS: A total of 485 patients underwent randomization, 240 to secondary cytoreduction before chemotherapy and 245 to chemotherapy alone. The median follow-up was 48.1 months. Complete gross resection was achieved in 67% of the patients assigned to surgery who underwent the procedure. Platinum-based chemotherapy with bevacizumab followed by bevacizumab maintenance was administered to 84% of the patients overall and was equally distributed between the two groups. The hazard ratio for death (surgery vs. no surgery) was 1.29 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.97 to 1.72; P\u2009=\u20090.08), which corresponded to a median overall survival of 50.6 months and 64.7 months, respectively. Adjustment for platinum-free interval and chemotherapy choice did not alter the effect. The hazard ratio for disease progression or death (surgery vs. no surgery) was 0.82 (95% CI, 0.66 to 1.01; median progression-free survival, 18.9 months and 16.2 months, respectively). Surgical morbidity at 30 days was 9%; 1 patient (0.4%) died from postoperative complications. Patient-reported quality of life decreased significantly after surgery but did not differ significantly between the two groups after recovery. CONCLUSIONS: In this trial involving patients with platinum-sensitive, recurrent ovarian cancer, secondary surgical cytoreduction followed by chemotherapy did not result in longer overall survival than chemotherapy alone.

        "3D Deformation Patterns of S Shaped Elastic Rods as a Pathogenesis Model for Spinal Deformity in Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis. Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) is a three-dimensional (3D) deformity of the spinal column in pediatric population. The primary cause of scoliosis remains unknown. The lack of such understanding has hampered development of effective preventive methods for management of this disease. A long-held assumption in pathogenesis of AIS is that the upright spine in human plays an important role in induction of scoliosis. Here, the variations in the sagittal curve of the scoliotic and non-scoliotic pediatric spines were used to study whether specific sagittal curves, under physiological loadings, are prone to 3D deformation leading to scoliosis. To this end, finite element models of the S shaped elastic rods, which their curves were derived from the radiographs of 129 sagittal spinal curves of adolescents with and without scoliosis, were generated. Using the mechanics of deformation in elastic rods, this study showed that the 3D deformation patterns of the two-dimensional S shaped slender elastic rods mimics the 3D patterns of the spinal deformity in AIS patients with the same S shaped sagittal spinal curve. On the other hand, the rods representing the non-scoliotic sagittal spinal curves, under the same mechanical loading, did not twist thus did not lead to a 3D deformation. This study provided strong evidence that the shape of the sagittal profile in individuals can be a leading cause of the 3D spinal deformity as is observed in the AIS population. ",
        "Using EMG to deliver lumbar dynamic electrical stimulation to facilitate cortico-spinal excitability. BACKGROUND: Potentiation of synaptic activity in spinal networks is reflected in the magnitude of modulation of motor responses evoked by spinal and cortical input. After spinal cord injury, motor evoked responses can be facilitated by pairing cortical and peripheral nerve stimuli. OBJECTIVE: To facilitate synaptic potentiation of cortico-spinal input with epidural electrical stimulation, we designed a novel neuromodulation method called dynamic stimulation (DS), using patterns derived from hind limb EMG signal during stepping. METHODS: DS was applied dorsally to the lumbar enlargement through a high-density epidural array composed of independent platinum-based micro-electrodes. RESULTS: In fully anesthetized intact adult rats, at the interface array/spinal cord, the temporal and spatial features of DS neuromodulation affected the entire lumbosacral network, particularly the most rostral and caudal segments covered by the array. DS induced a transient (at least 1\u202fmin) increase in spinal cord excitability and, compared to tonic stimulation, generated a more robust potentiation of the motor output evoked by single pulses applied to the spinal cord. When sub-threshold pulses were selectively applied to a cortical motor area, EMG responses from the contralateral leg were facilitated by the delivery of DS to the lumbosacral cord. Finally, based on motor-evoked responses, DS was linked to a greater amplitude of motor output shortly after a calibrated spinal cord contusion. CONCLUSION: Compared to traditional tonic waveforms, DS amplifies both spinal and cortico-spinal input aimed at spinal networks, thus significantly increasing the potential and accelerating the rate of functional recovery after a severe spinal lesion.

        "Bacteriophage targeting of gut bacterium attenuates alcoholic liver disease. Chronic liver disease due to alcohol-use disorder contributes markedly to the global burden of disease and mortality1-3. Alcoholic hepatitis is a severe and life-threatening form of alcohol-associated liver disease. The gut microbiota promotes ethanol-induced liver disease in mice4, but little is known about the microbial factors that are responsible for this process. Here we identify cytolysin-a two-subunit exotoxin that is secreted by Enterococcus faecalis5,6-as a cause of hepatocyte death and liver injury. Compared with non-alcoholic individuals or patients with alcohol-use disorder, patients with alcoholic hepatitis have increased faecal numbers of E.\u00a0faecalis. The presence of cytolysin-positive (cytolytic) E.\u00a0faecalis correlated with the severity of liver disease and with mortality in patients with alcoholic hepatitis. Using humanized mice that were colonized with bacteria from the faeces of patients with alcoholic hepatitis, we investigated the therapeutic effects of bacteriophages that target cytolytic E.\u00a0faecalis. We found that these bacteriophages decrease cytolysin in the liver and abolish ethanol-induced liver disease in humanized mice. Our findings link cytolytic E.\u00a0faecalis with more severe clinical outcomes and increased mortality in patients with alcoholic hepatitis. We show that bacteriophages can specifically target cytolytic E.\u00a0faecalis, which provides a method for precisely editing the intestinal microbiota. A clinical trial with a larger cohort is required to validate the relevance of our findings in humans, and to test whether this therapeutic approach is effective for patients with alcoholic hepatitis.

        "Variation in blood pressure and long-term risk of dementia: A population-based cohort study. BACKGROUND: Variation in blood pressure may relate to dementia risk via autonomic disturbance or hemodynamic mechanisms, but the long-term associations are unclear. We aimed to determine whether blood pressure variation over a period of years, considering both magnitude and direction, is associated with the risk of dementia. METHODS AND FINDINGS: In a prospective cohort study ongoing since 1989 in the Netherlands, 5,273 dementia-free participants (58.1% women; mean [SD] age, 67.6 [8.0] years) were included. As of 2016, 1,059 dementia cases occurred during a median follow-up of 14.6 years. Absolute variation in systolic blood pressure (SBP) was assessed as the absolute difference in SBP divided by the mean over two sequential visits every 4.2 (median) years, with the first quantile set as the reference level. The direction was the rise or fall in SBP, with the third quantile set as the reference level. We estimated the risk of dementia in relation to SBP variation measured at different time windows (i.e., at least 0, 5, 10, and 15 years) prior to dementia diagnosis, with adjustments for age, sex, education, apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype, vascular risk factors, and history of cardiovascular disease. We repeated the above analysis for variation in diastolic blood pressure (DBP). A large SBP variation was associated with an increased dementia risk, which became more pronounced with longer intervals between the assessment of SBP variation and the diagnosis of dementia. The hazard ratio (HR) associated with large variation (the highest quintile) increased from 1.08 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.88-1.34, P = 0.337) for risk within 5 years of SBP variation measurement to 3.13 (95% CI 2.05-4.77; P < 0.001) for risk after at least 15 years since the measurement of SBP variation. The increased long-term risk was associated with both large rises (HR for the highest quintile, 3.31 [95% CI 2.11-5.18], P < 0.001) and large falls in SBP (HR for the lowest quintile, 2.20 [95% CI 1.33-3.63], P = 0.002), whereas the higher short-term risk was only associated with large falls in SBP (HR, 1.21 [95% CI 1.00-1.48], P = 0.017). Similar findings were observed for variation in DBP. Despite our assessment of major confounders, potential residual confounding is possible, and the findings on blood pressure variability over periods of years may not be generalizable to variability over periods of days and other shorter periods. CONCLUSIONS: Results of this study showed that a large blood pressure variation over a period of years was associated with an increased long-term risk of dementia. The association between blood pressure variation and dementia appears most pronounced when this variation occurred long before the diagnosis. An elevated long-term risk of dementia was observed with both a large rise and fall in blood pressure. ",
        "Gastrointestinal Immunity and Alpha-Synuclein. The gastrointestinal (GI) tract is equipped with robust immune defenses which protect the organism from infection. Enteric nerves are front and center in this defensive network, even in the most primitive organisms. Neuropeptides exhibit potent antimicrobial activity in the vicinity of the nerve and attract the innate and adaptive immune systems to help confine the invading agent. Alpha-synuclein (\u03b1S) has many biophysical characteristics of antimicrobial peptides and binds small vesicles such as those carrying endocytosed viruses. It is induced in nerve cells in response to viral and bacterial infections. It renders the nerve cell resistant to viral infection and propagation. It signals the immune system by attracting neutrophils and macrophages, and by activating dendritic cells. Most remarkably \u03b1S is trafficked to the central nervous system (CNS) conferring immunity in advance of an infection. Chronic GI infection or breakdown of the epithelial barrier can cause \u03b1S to accumulate and form neurotoxic aggregates. Overproduction of \u03b1S in the enteric nervous system (ENS) and its chronic trafficking to the CNS may damage nerves and lead to Parkinson's disease. Targeting the formation of \u03b1S aggregates in the ENS may therefore slow the progression of the disease. ",
        "Recovirus NS1-2 Has Viroporin Activity That Induces Aberrant Cellular Calcium Signaling To Facilitate Virus Replication. Enteric viruses in the Caliciviridae family cause acute gastroenteritis in humans and animals, but the cellular processes needed for virus replication and disease remain unknown. A common strategy among enteric viruses, including rotaviruses and enteroviruses, is to encode a viral ion channel (i.e., viroporin) that is targeted to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and disrupts host calcium (Ca2+) homeostasis. Previous reports have demonstrated genetic and functional similarities between the nonstructural proteins of caliciviruses and enteroviruses, including the calicivirus NS1-2 protein and the 2B viroporin of enteroviruses. However, it is unknown whether caliciviruses alter Ca2+ homeostasis for virus replication or whether the NS1-2 protein has viroporin activity like its enterovirus counterpart. To address these questions, we used Tulane virus (TV), a rhesus enteric calicivirus, to examine Ca2+ signaling during infection and determine whether NS1-2 has viroporin activity that disrupts Ca2+ homeostasis. We found that TV increases Ca2+ signaling during infection and that increased cytoplasmic Ca2+ levels are important for efficient replication. Further, TV NS1-2 localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum, the predominant intracellular Ca2+ store, and the NS2 region has characteristics of a viroporin domain (VPD). NS1-2 had viroporin activity in a classic bacterial functional assay and caused aberrant Ca2+ signaling when expressed in mammalian cells, but truncation of the VPD abrogated these activities. Together, our data provide new mechanistic insights into the function of the NS2 region of NS1-2 and support the premise that enteric viruses, including those within Caliciviridae, exploit host Ca2+ signaling to facilitate their replication.IMPORTANCE Tulane virus is one of many enteric caliciviruses that cause acute gastroenteritis and diarrheal disease. Globally, enteric caliciviruses affect both humans and animals and amass >65 billion dollars per year in treatment and health care-associated costs, thus imposing an enormous economic burden. Recent progress has resulted in several cultivation systems (B cells, enteroids, and zebrafish larvae) to study human noroviruses, but mechanistic insights into the viral factors and host pathways important for enteric calicivirus replication and infection are still largely lacking. Here, we used Tulane virus, a calicivirus that is biologically similar to human noroviruses and can be cultivated by conventional cell culture, to identify and functionally validate NS1-2 as an enteric calicivirus viroporin. Viroporin-mediated calcium signaling may be a broadly utilized pathway for enteric virus replication, and its existence within caliciviruses provides a novel approach to developing antivirals and comprehensive therapeutics for enteric calicivirus diarrheal disease outbreaks.

        "An AND-Gated Drug and Photoactivatable Cre-loxP System for Spatiotemporal Control in Cell-Based Therapeutics. While engineered chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells have shown promise in detecting and eradicating cancer cells within patients, it remains difficult to identify a set of truly cancer-specific CAR-targeting cell surface antigens to prevent potentially fatal on-target off-tumor toxicity against other healthy tissues within the body. To help address this issue, we present a novel tamoxifen-gated photoactivatable split-Cre recombinase optogenetic system, called TamPA-Cre, that features high spatiotemporal control to limit CAR T cell activity to the tumor site. We created and optimized a novel genetic AND gate switch by integrating the features of tamoxifen-dependent nuclear localization and blue-light-inducible heterodimerization of Magnet protein domains (nMag, pMag) into split Cre recombinase. By fusing the cytosol-localizing mutant estrogen receptor ligand binding domain (ERT2) to the N-terminal half of split Cre(2-59aa)-nMag, the TamPA-Cre protein ERT2-CreN-nMag is physically separated from its nuclear-localized binding partner, NLS-pMag-CreC(60-343aa). Without tamoxifen to drive nuclear localization of ERT2-CreN-nMag, the typically high background of the photoactivation system was significantly suppressed. Upon blue light stimulation following tamoxifen treatment, the TamPA-Cre system exhibits sensitivity to low intensity, short durations of blue light exposure to induce robust Cre-loxP recombination efficiency. We finally demonstrate that this TamPA-Cre system can be applied to specifically control localized CAR expression and subsequently T cell activation. As such, we posit that CAR T cell activity can be confined to a solid tumor site by applying an external stimulus, with high precision of control in both space and time, such as light. ",
        "Psychological Function, Iyengar Yoga, and Coherent Breathing: A Randomized Controlled Dosing Study. BACKGROUND: Evidence suggests that yoga may be an effective treatment for major depressive disorder (MDD). Studies evaluating the \"dosing\" of yoga treatment and efficacy for MDD are needed. The goal of this study was to assess the effects of an intervention combining Iyengar yoga and coherent breathing in participants with MDD and determine the optimal intervention dose. METHODS: Thirty-two participants (18 to 65\u2009y of age) diagnosed with MDD were randomized to a high-dose group (HDG) or a low-dose group (LDG) of yoga and coherent breathing for 12 weeks. The HDG (n=15) involved three 90-minute yoga classes and four 30-minute homework sessions per week. The LDG (n=15) involved two 90-minute yoga classes and three 30-minute homework sessions per week. Participants were evaluated at baseline, week 4, week 8, and week 12 with the following instruments: Positivity Self-Test, Spielberger State Anxiety Inventory, Patient Health Questionnaire-9, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, and Exercise-induced Feeling Inventory. Data were analyzed using intent-to-treat methods. RESULTS: Significant improvements in all outcome measures were found for both groups, with acute and cumulative benefits. Although the HDG showed greater improvements on all scales, between-group differences did not reach significance, possibly due to lack of power because of the small sample size. Cumulative yoga minutes were correlated with improvement in outcome measures. LIMITATION: This dosing study did not include a non-yoga control. CONCLUSIONS: Improvement in psychological symptoms correlated with cumulative yoga practice. Both interventions reduced symptoms of depression and anxiety and increased feelings of positivity. The time commitment for yoga practice needs to be weighed against benefits when designing yoga interventions. ",
        "Prescription drug monitoring programs operational characteristics and fatal heroin poisoning. BACKGROUND: Prescription drug monitoring programs (PDMP), by reducing access to prescribed opioids (POs), may contribute to a policy environment in which some people with opioid dependence are at increased risk for transitioning from POs to heroin/other illegal opioids. This study examines how PDMP adoption and changes in the characteristics of PDMPs over time contribute to changes in fatal heroin poisoning in counties within states from 2002 to 2016. METHODS: Latent transition analysis to classify PDMPs into latent classes (Cooperative, Proactive, and Weak) for each state and year, across three intervals (1999-2004, 2005-2009, 2010-2016). We examined the association between probability of PDMP latent class membership and the rate of county-level heroin poisoning death. RESULTS: After adjustment for potential county-level confounders and co-occurring policy changes, adoption of a PDMP was significantly associated with increased heroin poisoning rates (22% increase by third year post-adoption). Findings varied by PDMP type. From 2010-2016, states with Cooperative PDMPs (those more likely to share data with other states, to require more frequent reporting, and include more drug schedules) had 19% higher heroin poisoning rates than states with Weak PDMPs (adjusted rate ratio [ARR]\u00a0=\u00a01.19; 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a01.14, 1.25). States with Proactive PDMPs (those more likely to report outlying prescribing and dispensing and provide broader access to law enforcement) had 6% lower heroin poisoning rates than states with No/Weak PDMPs (ARR\u00a0=\u00a00.94; 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a00.90, 0.98). CONCLUSION: There is a consistent, positive association between state PDMP adoption and heroin poisoning mortality. However, this varies by PDMP type, with Proactive PDMPs associated with a small reduction in heroin poisoning deaths. This raises questions about the potential for PDMPs to support efforts to decrease heroin overdose risk, particularly by using proactive alerts to identify patients in need of treatment for opioid use disorder. Future research on mechanisms explaining the reduction in heroin poisonings after enactment of Proactive PDMPs is merited. ",
        "Activated leukocyte cell adhesion molecule regulates B lymphocyte migration across central nervous system barriers. The presence of B lymphocyte-associated oligoclonal immunoglobulins in the cerebrospinal fluid is a classic hallmark of multiple sclerosis (MS). The clinical efficacy of anti-CD20 therapies supports a major role for B lymphocytes in MS development. Although activated oligoclonal populations of pathogenic B lymphocytes are able to traffic between the peripheral circulation and the central nervous system (CNS) in patients with MS, molecular players involved in this migration have not yet been elucidated. In this study, we demonstrated that activated leukocyte cell adhesion molecule (ALCAM/CD166) identifies subsets of proinflammatory B lymphocytes and drives their transmigration across different CNS barriers in mouse and human. We also showcased that blocking ALCAM alleviated disease severity in animals affected by a B cell-dependent form of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. Last, we determined that the proportion of ALCAM+ B lymphocytes was increased in the peripheral blood and within brain lesions of patients with MS. Our findings indicate that restricting access to the CNS by targeting ALCAM on pathogenic B lymphocytes might represent a promising strategy for the development of next-generation B lymphocyte-targeting therapies for the treatment of MS.

        "Access to Athletic Trainer Services in California Secondary Schools. CONTEXT: California is currently the only state that does not regulate who can and cannot call themselves athletic trainers (ATs). Therefore, previous national or state-specific investigations may not have provided an accurate representation of AT availability at the secondary school level in California. Similarly, it is unknown whether the factors that influence AT availability in California, such as socioeconomic status, are similar to or different from those identified in previous studies. OBJECTIVE: To describe the availability of ATs certified by the Board of Certification in California secondary schools and to examine potential factors influencing access to AT services in California secondary schools. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: Online survey. PATIENTS OR OTHER PARTICIPANTS: Representatives of 1270 California high schools. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Officials from member schools completed the 2017-2018 California Interscholastic Federation Participation Census. Respondents provided information regarding school type, student and student-athlete enrollment, whether the school had ATs on staff, and whether the ATs were certified by the Board of Certification. The socioeconomic status of public and charter schools was determined using the percentage of students eligible for free or reduced-price lunch. RESULTS: More than half (54.6%) of schools reported that they either did not employ ATs (47.6%) or employed unqualified health personnel (UHP) in the role of AT (7.0%). Nearly 30% of student-athletes in California participated in athletics at a school that did not employ ATs (n = 191\u200a626, 28.9%) and 8% of student-athletes participated at a school that employed UHP in the role of AT (n = 54\u200a361, 8.2%). Schools that reported employing ATs had a lower proportion of students eligible for free or reduced-price lunch than schools that did not employ ATs and schools that employed UHP (both P values < .001). CONCLUSIONS: With ongoing legislative efforts to obtain regulation of ATs in California, secondary school administrators are encouraged to hire ATs with the proper certification to enhance the patient care provided to student-athletes and improve health outcomes.

        "The Association Between Perceived Electronic Health Record Usability and Professional Burnout Among US Physicians. OBJECTIVE: To describe and benchmark physician-perceived electronic health record (EHR) usability as defined by a standardized metric of technology usability and evaluate the association with professional burnout among physicians. PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS: This cross-sectional survey of US physicians from all specialty disciplines was conducted between October 12, 2017, and March 15, 2018, using the American Medical Association Physician Masterfile. Among the 30,456 invited physicians, 5197 (17.1%) completed surveys. A random 25% (n=1250) of respondents in the primary survey received a subsurvey evaluating EHR usability, and 870 (69.6%) completed it. EHR usability was assessed using the System Usability Scale (SUS; range 0-100). SUS scores were normalized to percentile rankings across more than 1300 previous studies from other industries. Burnout was measured using the Maslach Burnout Inventory. RESULTS: Mean \u00b1 SD SUS score was 45.9\u00b121.9. A score of 45.9 is in the bottom 9% of scores across previous studies and categorized in the \"not acceptable\" range or with a grade of F. On multivariate analysis adjusting for age, sex, medical specialty, practice setting, hours worked, and number of nights on call weekly, physician-rated EHR usability was independently associated with the odds of burnout with each 1 point more favorable SUS score associated with a 3% lower odds of burnout (odds ratio, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.97-0.98; P<.001). CONCLUSION: The usability of current EHR systems received a grade of F by physician users when evaluated using a standardized metric of technology usability. A strong dose-response relationship between EHR usability and the odds of burnout was observed. ",
        "Association of Subclinical Hearing Loss With Cognitive Performance. Importance: Age-related hearing loss (HL) is a common and treatable condition that has been associated with cognitive impairment. The level of hearing at which this association begins has not been studied to date. Objective: To investigate whether the association between hearing and cognition is present among individuals traditionally classified as having normal hearing. Design, Setting, and Participants: Cross-sectional study of 2 US epidemiologic studies (Hispanic Community Health Study [HCHS], 2008-2011, and National Health and Nutrition Examination Study [NHANES], 1999-2000, 2001-2002, and 2011-2012 cycles). The dates of analysis were November 2018 to August 2019. Multivariable generalized additive model (GAM) regression and linear regression were used to assess the association between HL (exposure) and cognition (outcome). Participants included 6451 individuals aged 50 years or older from the general Hispanic population (HCHS [n\u2009=\u20095190]) and the general civilian, noninstitutionalized US population (NHANES [n\u2009=\u20091261]). Exposures: Audiometric HL (4-frequency pure-tone average). Main Outcomes and Measures: Neurocognitive performance measured by the Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST) (score range, 0-113), Word Frequency Test (range, 0-49), Spanish-English Verbal Learning Test (SEVLT) 3 trials (range, 5-40), SEVLT recall (range, 0-15), and Six-Item Screener (range, 0-6); higher scores indicated better cognitive performance. Results: Among 6451 individuals, the mean (SD) age was 59.4 (6.1) years, and 3841 (59.5%) were women. The GAM regression showed a significant inverse association between hearing and cognition across the entire spectrum of hearing after adjusting for demographics and cardiovascular disease. In separate multivariable linear regressions stratified by the classic binary definition of HL, decreased hearing was independently associated with decreased cognition in adults with normal hearing (pure-tone average \u226425 dB) across all cognitive tests in the HCHS. For example in this group, a 10-dB decrease in hearing was associated with a clinically meaningful 1.97-point (95% CI, 1.18-2.75) decrease in score on the DSST. When using a stricter HL cut point (15 dB), an association was also present in NHANES. The associations between hearing and cognition were stronger or equivalent in individuals with normal hearing than among those with HL. For example, there was a 2.28-point (95% CI, 1.56-3.00) combined cohort DSST score decrease per 10-dB decrease among individuals with normal hearing vs a 0.97-point (95% CI, 0.20-1.75) decrease among those with HL, with a significant interaction term between continuous and binary hearing. Conclusions and Relevance: An independent association was observed between cognition and subclinical HL. The association between hearing and cognition may be present earlier in HL than previously understood. Studies investigating whether treating HL can prevent impaired cognition and dementia should consider a lower threshold for defining HL than the current 25-dB threshold. ",
        "Joint impact of phthalate exposure and stressful life events in pregnancy on preterm birth. BACKGROUND: Urinary phthalate metabolites and psychosocial stress in pregnancy have each been associated with preterm birth (PTB), but no study has examined the joint impact of these two environmental exposures. We hypothesized that there would be stronger associations between phthalate exposure and PTB in mothers with higher stress in pregnancy compared to mothers with lower stress. METHODS: We addressed this question using data from The Infant Development and the Environment Study (TIDES), a prospective birth cohort conducted at four US sites (N\u202f=\u202f783). We examined urinary phthalate metabolite concentrations measured in samples collected from up to three trimesters of pregnancy. Mothers reported their exposure to stressful life events (SLE) in each trimester in a questionnaire administered in the third trimester. PTB was defined as delivery before 37\u202fweeks completed gestation (n\u202f=\u202f71, 9.1%). We examined associations between urinary phthalate metabolite concentrations (individual time points and on average) and PTB using logistic regression models adjusted for maternal race, age, pre-pregnancy body mass index, education, specific gravity, and gestational age at sample collection. In addition, we created models stratified by whether or not mothers were exposed to any or no SLE in pregnancy. RESULTS: Summed di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (\u03a3DEHP) metabolites measured in urine samples from the third trimester, but not the first trimester, were associated with an increased odds ratio (OR) of PTB (OR\u202f=\u202f1.44, 95% confidence interval [CI]\u202f=\u202f1.06, 1.95). In models stratified by SLE, associations between third trimester \u03a3DEHP concentrations and PTB were significant only for women experiencing one or more SLE during pregnancy (OR for \u03a3DEHP: 2.09, 95% CI: 1.29, 3.37) but not for women with no SLE during pregnancy (OR for \u03a3DEHP: 1.04, 95% CI: 0.66, 1.63) (p for interaction\u202f=\u202f0.07). CONCLUSIONS: We observed an association between urinary \u03a3DEHP levels and PTB that was modified by whether a mother was exposed to one or more psychosocial stressors during pregnancy. Additional research to understand the joint impacts of chemical and non-chemical exposures, with an emphasis on timing of exposure, is needed in order to advance the state of the science on how the environment influences pregnancy.

        "Neurogenesis and prolongevity signaling in young germ-free mice transplanted with the gut microbiota of old mice. The gut microbiota evolves as the host ages, yet the effects of these microbial changes on host physiology and energy homeostasis are poorly understood. To investigate these potential effects, we transplanted the gut microbiota of old or young mice into young germ-free recipient mice. Both groups showed similar weight gain and skeletal muscle mass, but germ-free mice receiving a gut microbiota transplant from old donor mice unexpectedly showed increased neurogenesis in the hippocampus of the brain and increased intestinal growth. Metagenomic analysis revealed age-sensitive enrichment in butyrate-producing microbes in young germ-free mice transplanted with the gut microbiota of old donor mice. The higher concentration of gut microbiota-derived butyrate in these young transplanted mice was associated with an increase in the pleiotropic and prolongevity hormone fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21). An increase in FGF21 correlated with increased AMPK and SIRT-1 activation and reduced mTOR signaling. Young germ-free mice treated with exogenous sodium butyrate recapitulated the prolongevity phenotype observed in young germ-free mice receiving a gut microbiota transplant from old donor mice. These results suggest that gut microbiota transplants from aged hosts conferred beneficial effects in responsive young recipients. ",
        "Validation of the Postnatal Growth and Retinopathy of Prematurity Screening Criteria. Importance: The first Postnatal Growth and Retinopathy of Prematurity Study (G-ROP-1) developed new screening criteria with 100% sensitivity for type 1 retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) and 30% reduction of infants requiring examinations in a retrospective development cohort of 7483 infants from 29 North American hospitals in 2006-2012. Infants meeting 1 or more of the following criteria undergo examinations: gestational age less than 28 weeks or birth weight less than 1051 g; weight gain less than 120 g during age 10 to 19 days, weight gain less than 180 g during age 20 to 29 days, or weight gain less than 170 g during age 30 to 39 days; or hydrocephalus. Objective: To evaluate the generalizability of the G-ROP screening criteria in a new cohort of at-risk infants. Design, Setting, and Participants: This prospective validation cohort study (G-ROP-2) was conducted at 41 hospitals in the United States and Canada (25 G-ROP-1 hospitals and 16 new hospitals) from September 8, 2015, to June 13, 2017, among 3981 premature infants at risk for ROP and with known ROP outcomes. Main Outcomes and Measures: Sensitivity for Early Treatment for Retinopathy of Prematurity Study type 1 ROP and potential reduction in infants receiving examinations. Results: Among the 3981 infants in the study (1878 girls and 2103 boys; median gestational age, 28 weeks [range, 22-35 weeks]; median birth weight, 1072 g [range, 350-4080 g]; 1966 white; 942 black; 321 Latino; 120 Asian; 22 Native Hawaian or Pacific Islander; and 25 American Indian or Alaskan Native), the G-ROP criteria correctly predicted 219 of 219 cases of type 1 ROP (sensitivity, 100%; 95% CI, 98.3%-100%), while reducing the number of infants undergoing examinations by 35.6% (n\u2009=\u20091418). In a combined G-ROP-1 and G-ROP-2 cohort of 11\u202f463 infants, the G-ROP criteria predicted 677 of 677 cases of type 1 ROP (sensitivity, 100%; 95% CI, 99.4%-100%), reducing the number of infants receiving examinations by 32.5% (n\u2009=\u20093730), while current criteria (birth weight <1501 g or gestational age \u226430 weeks 0 days) predicted 674 of 677 type 1 cases (sensitivity, 99.6%; 95% CI, 98.7%-99.8%). Conclusions and Relevance: This study found that the G-ROP screening criteria were generalizable on validation and, if used clinically in the United States and Canada, could reduce the number of infants receiving examinations. The large G-ROP cohorts provide evidence-based screening criteria that have higher sensitivity and higher specificity (fewer infants receiving examinations) for type 1 ROP than currently recommended guidelines.

        "An inhalable nanoparticulate STING agonist synergizes with radiotherapy to confer long-term control of lung metastases. Mounting evidence suggests that the tumor microenvironment is profoundly immunosuppressive. Thus, mitigating tumor immunosuppression is crucial for inducing sustained antitumor immunity. Whereas previous studies involved intratumoral injection, we report here an inhalable nanoparticle-immunotherapy system targeting pulmonary antigen presenting cells (APCs) to enhance anticancer immunity against lung metastases. Inhalation of phosphatidylserine coated liposome loaded with STING agonist cyclic guanosine monophosphate-adenosine monophosphate (NP-cGAMP) in mouse models of lung metastases enables rapid distribution of NP-cGAMP to both lungs and subsequent uptake by APCs without causing immunopathology. NP-cGAMP designed for enhanced cytosolic release of cGAMP stimulates STING signaling and type I interferons production in APCs, resulting in the pro-inflammatory tumor microenvironment in multifocal lung metastases. Furthermore, fractionated radiation delivered to one tumor-bearing lung synergizes with inhaled NP-cGAMP, eliciting systemic anticancer immunity, controlling metastases in both lungs, and conferring long-term survival in mice with lung metastases and with repeated tumor challenge.

        "Long-range temporal coordination of gene expression in synthetic microbial consortia. Synthetic microbial consortia have an advantage over isogenic synthetic microbes because they can apportion biochemical and regulatory tasks among the strains. However, it is difficult to coordinate gene expression in spatially extended consortia because the range of signaling molecules is limited by diffusion. Here, we show that spatio-temporal coordination of gene expression can be achieved even when the spatial extent of the consortium is much greater than the diffusion distance of the signaling molecules. To do this, we examined the dynamics of a two-strain synthetic microbial consortium that generates coherent oscillations in small colonies. In large colonies, we find that temporally coordinated oscillations across the population depend on the presence of an intrinsic positive feedback loop that amplifies and propagates intercellular signals. These results demonstrate that synthetic multicellular systems can be engineered to exhibit coordinated gene expression using only transient, short-range coupling among constituent cells. ",
        "Targeting melanoma's MCL1 bias unleashes the apoptotic potential of BRAF and ERK1/2 pathway inhibitors. BRAF and MEK1/2 inhibitors are effective in melanoma but resistance inevitably develops. Despite increasing the abundance of pro-apoptotic BIM and BMF, ERK1/2 pathway inhibition is predominantly cytostatic, reflecting residual pro-survival BCL2 family activity. Here, we show that uniquely low BCL-XL expression in melanoma biases the pro-survival pool towards MCL1. Consequently, BRAF or MEK1/2 inhibitors are synthetic lethal with the MCL1 inhibitor AZD5991, driving profound\u00a0tumour cell death that requires BAK/BAX, BIM and BMF, and inhibiting tumour growth in vivo. Combination of ERK1/2 pathway inhibitors with BCL2/BCL-w/BCL-XL inhibitors is stronger in CRC, correlating with a low MCL1:BCL-XL ratio; indeed the MCL1:BCL-XL ratio is predictive of ERK1/2 pathway inhibitor synergy with MCL1 or BCL2/BCL-w/BCL-XL inhibitors. Finally, AZD5991 delays acquired BRAFi/MEKi resistance and enhances the efficacy of an ERK1/2 inhibitor in a model of acquired BRAFi\u2009+\u2009MEKi resistance. Thus combining ERK1/2 pathway inhibitors with MCL1 antagonists in melanoma could improve therapeutic index and patient outcomes. ",
        "Vaccine-related advertising in the Facebook Ad Archive. BACKGROUND: In 2018, Facebook introduced Ad Archive as a platform to improve transparency in advertisements related to politics and \"issues of national importance.\" Vaccine-related Facebook advertising is publicly available for the first time. After measles outbreaks in the US brought renewed attention to the possible role of Facebook advertising in the spread of vaccine-related misinformation, Facebook announced steps to limit vaccine-related misinformation. This study serves as a baseline of advertising before new policies went into effect. METHODS: Using the keyword 'vaccine', we searched Ad Archive on December 13, 2018 and again on February 22, 2019. We exported data for 505 advertisements. A team of annotators sorted advertisements by content: pro-vaccine, anti-vaccine, not relevant. We also conducted a thematic analysis of major advertising themes. We ran Mann-Whitney U tests to compare ad performance metrics. RESULTS: 309 advertisements were included in analysis with 163 (53%) pro-vaccine advertisements and 145 (47%) anti-vaccine advertisements. Despite a similar number of advertisements, the median number of ads per buyer was significantly higher for anti-vaccine ads. First time buyers are less likely to complete disclosure information and risk ad removal. Thematically, anti-vaccine advertising messages are relatively uniform and emphasize vaccine harms (55%). In contrast, pro-vaccine advertisements come from a diverse set of buyers (83 unique) with varied goals including promoting vaccination (49%), vaccine related philanthropy (15%), and vaccine related policy (14%). CONCLUSIONS: A small set of anti-vaccine advertisement buyers have leveraged Facebook advertisements to reach targeted audiences. By deeming all vaccine-related content an issue of \"national importance,\" Facebook has further the politicized vaccines. The implementation of a blanket disclosure policy also limits which ads can successfully run on Facebook. Improving transparency and limiting misinformation should not be separate goals. Public health communication efforts should consider the potential impact on Facebook users' vaccine attitudes and behaviors. ",
        "Combined gene essentiality scoring improves the prediction of cancer dependency maps. BACKGROUND: Probing genetic dependencies of cancer cells can improve our understanding of tumour development and progression, as well as identify potential drug targets. CRISPR-Cas9-based and shRNA-based genetic screening are commonly utilized to identify essential genes that affect cancer growth. However, systematic methods leveraging these genetic screening techniques to derive consensus cancer dependency maps for individual cancer cell lines are lacking. FINDING: In this work, we first explored the CRISPR-Cas9 and shRNA gene essentiality profiles in 42 cancer cell lines representing 10 cancer types. We observed limited consistency between the essentiality profiles of these two screens at the genome scale. To improve consensus on the cancer dependence map, we developed a computational model called combined essentiality score (CES) to integrate the genetic essentiality profiles from CRISPR-Cas9 and shRNA screens, while accounting for the molecular features of the genes. We found that the CES method outperformed the existing gene essentiality scoring approaches in terms of ability to detect cancer essential genes. We further demonstrated the power of the CES method in adjusting for screen-specific biases and predicting genetic dependencies in individual cancer cell lines. INTERPRETATION: Systematic comparison of the CRISPR-Cas9 and shRNA gene essentiality profiles showed the limitation of relying on a single technique to identify cancer essential genes. The CES method provides an integrated framework to leverage both genetic screening techniques as well as molecular feature data to determine gene essentiality more accurately for cancer cells. ",
        "Inflammatory Bowel Diseases and Parkinson's Disease. The etiology of Parkinson's disease (PD) is multifactorial, with genetics, aging, and environmental agents all a part of the PD pathogenesis. Widespread aggregation of the \u03b1-synuclein protein in the form of Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites, and degeneration of substantia nigra dopamine neurons are the pathological hallmarks of PD. Inflammatory responses manifested by glial reactions, T cell infiltration, and increased expression of inflammatory cytokines, as well as other toxic mediators derived from activated glial cells, are currently recognized as prominent features of PD. Experimental, clinical and epidemiological data suggest that intestinal inflammation contributes to the pathogenesis of PD, and the increasing number of studies suggests that the condition may start in the gastrointestinal system years before any motor symptoms develop. Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) have a higher risk of developing PD compared with non-IBD individuals. Gene association study has found a genetic link between IBD and PD, and an evidence from animal studies suggests that gut inflammation, similar to that observed in IBD, may induce loss of dopaminergic neurons. Based on preclinical models of PD, it is suggested that the enteric microbiome changes early in PD, and gut infections trigger \u03b1-synuclein release and aggregation. In this paper, the possible link between IBD and PD is reviewed based on the available literature. Given the potentially critical role of gastrointestinal pathology in PD pathogenesis, there is reason to suspect that IBD or its treatments may impact PD risk. Thus, clinicians should be aware of PD symptoms in IBD patients. ",
        "Analysis of official deceased organ donation data casts doubt on the credibility of China's organ transplant reform. BACKGROUND: Since 2010 the People's Republic of China has been engaged in an effort to reform its system of organ transplantation by developing a voluntary organ donation and allocation infrastructure. This has required a shift in the procurement of organs sourced from China's prison and security apparatus to hospital-based voluntary donors declared dead by neurological and/or circulatory criteria. Chinese officials announced that from January 1, 2015, hospital-based donors would be the sole source of organs. This paper examines the availability, transparency, integrity, and consistency of China's official transplant data. METHODS: Forensic statistical methods were used to examine key deceased organ donation datasets from 2010 to 2018. Two central-level datasets - published by the China Organ Transplant Response System (COTRS) and the Red Cross Society of China - are tested for evidence of manipulation, including conformance to simple mathematical formulae, arbitrary internal ratios, the presence of anomalous data artefacts, and cross-consistency. Provincial-level data in five regions are tested for coherence, consistency, and plausibility, and individual hospital data in those provinces are examined for consistency with provincial-level data. RESULTS: COTRS data conforms almost precisely to a mathematical formula (which first appeared to be a general quadratic, but with further confirmatory data was discovered to be a simpler one-parameter quadratic) while Central Red Cross data mirrors it, albeit imperfectly. The analysis of both datasets suggests human-directed data manufacture and manipulation. Contradictory, implausible, or anomalous data artefacts were found in five provincial datasets, suggesting that these data may have been manipulated to enforce conformity with central quotas. A number of the distinctive features of China's current organ procurement and allocation system are discussed, including apparent misclassification of nonvoluntary donors as voluntary. CONCLUSION: A variety of evidence points to what the authors believe can only be plausibly explained by systematic falsification and manipulation of official organ transplant datasets in China. Some apparently nonvoluntary donors also appear to be misclassified as voluntary. This takes place alongside genuine voluntary organ transplant activity, which is often incentivized by large cash payments. These findings are relevant for international interactions with China's organ transplantation system. ",
        "Ambulatory Hemodialysis-Technology Landscape and Potential for Patient-Centered Treatment. CKD is a worldwide health problem and the number of patients requiring kidney replacement therapy is rising. In the United States, most patients with ESKD rely on in-center hemodialysis, which is burdensome and does not provide the same long-term benefits as kidney transplantation. Intensive hemodialysis treatments have demonstrated improved clinical outcomes, but its wider adoption is limited by equipment complexity and patient apprehension. Ambulatory devices for hemodialysis offer the potential for self-care treatment outside the clinical setting as well as frequent and prolonged sessions. This article explains the motivation for ambulatory hemodialysis and provides an overview of the necessary features of key technologies that will be the basis for new wearable and implantable devices. Early work by pioneers of hemodialysis is described followed by recent experience using a wearable unit on patients. Finally, ongoing efforts to develop an implantable device for kidney replacement and its potential for implantable hemodialysis are presented. ",
        "Brain cell type-specific enhancer-promoter interactome maps and disease-risk association. Noncoding genetic variation is a major driver of phenotypic diversity, but functional interpretation is challenging. To better understand common genetic variation associated with brain diseases, we defined noncoding regulatory regions for major cell types of the human brain. Whereas psychiatric disorders were primarily associated with variants in transcriptional enhancers and promoters in neurons, sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD) variants were largely confined to microglia enhancers. Interactome maps connecting disease-risk variants in cell-type-specific enhancers to promoters revealed an extended microglia gene network in AD. Deletion of a microglia-specific enhancer harboring AD-risk variants ablated BIN1 expression in microglia, but not in neurons or astrocytes. These findings revise and expand the list of genes likely to be influenced by noncoding variants in AD and suggest the probable cell types in which they function. ",
        "B Cells and T Follicular Helper Cells Mediate Response to Checkpoint Inhibitors in High Mutation Burden Mouse Models of Breast Cancer. This study identifies mechanisms mediating responses to immune checkpoint inhibitors using mouse models of triple-negative breast cancer. By creating new mammary tumor models, we find that tumor mutation burden and specific immune cells are associated with response. Further, we developed a rich resource of single-cell RNA-seq and bulk mRNA-seq data of immunotherapy-treated and non-treated tumors from sensitive and resistant murine models. Using this, we uncover that immune checkpoint therapy induces T follicular helper cell activation of B cells to facilitate the anti-tumor response in these models. We also show that B cell activation of T\u00a0cells and the generation of antibody are key to immunotherapy response and propose a new biomarker for immune checkpoint therapy. In total, this work presents resources of new preclinical models of breast cancer with large mRNA-seq and single-cell RNA-seq datasets annotated for sensitivity to therapy and uncovers new components of response to immune checkpoint inhibitors.

        "Diverging Trends in the Relationship Between Binge Drinking and Depressive Symptoms Among Adolescents in the U.S. From 1991 Through 2018. PURPOSE: From 1991 to 2018, binge drinking among U.S. adolescents has precipitously declined; since 2012, depressive symptoms among U.S. adolescents have sharply increased. Binge drinking and depressive symptoms have historically been correlated, thus understanding whether there are dynamic changes in their association informs prevention and intervention. METHODS: Data were drawn from the U.S. nationally representative cross-sectional Monitoring the Future surveys (1991-2018) among school-attending 12th-grade adolescents (N\u00a0= 58,444). Binge drinking was measured as any occasion of more than five drinks/past 2 weeks; depressive symptoms were measured with four items (e.g., belief that life is meaningless or hopeless), dichotomized at 75th percentile. Time-varying effect modeling was conducted by sex, race/ethnicity, and parental education. RESULTS: In 1991, adolescents with high depressive symptoms had 1.74 times the odds of binge drinking (95% confidence interval 1.54-1.97); by 2018, the strength of association between depressive symptoms and binge drinking among 12th-grade adolescents declined 24% among girls and 25% among boys. There has been no significant relation between depressive symptoms and binge drinking among boys since 2009; among girls, the relationship has been positive throughout most of the study period, with no significant relationship from 2016 to\u00a02017. CONCLUSIONS: Diverging trends between depressive symptoms and alcohol use among youth are coupled with declines in the strength of their comorbidity. This suggests that underlying drivers of recent diverging population trends are likely distinct and indicates that the nature of comorbidity between substance use and mental health may need to be reconceptualized for recent and future cohorts.

        "The Crohn's disease-associated Escherichia coli strain LF82 relies on SOS and stringent responses to survive, multiply and tolerate antibiotics within macrophages. Adherent Invasive Escherichia coli (AIEC) strains recovered from Crohn's disease lesions survive and multiply within macrophages. A reference strain for this pathovar, AIEC LF82, forms microcolonies within phagolysosomes, an environment that prevents commensal E. coli multiplication. Little is known about the LF82 intracellular growth status, and signals leading to macrophage intra-vacuolar multiplication. We used single-cell analysis, genetic dissection and mathematical models to monitor the growth status and cell cycle regulation of intracellular LF82. We found that within macrophages, bacteria may replicate or undergo non-growing phenotypic switches. This switch results from stringent response firing immediately after uptake by macrophages or at later stages, following genotoxic damage and SOS induction during intracellular replication. Importantly, non-growers resist treatment with various antibiotics. Thus, intracellular challenges induce AIEC LF82 phenotypic heterogeneity and non-growing bacteria that could provide a reservoir for antibiotic-tolerant bacteria responsible for relapsing infections.

        "Peripheral blood DNA methylation differences in twin pairs discordant for Alzheimer's disease. BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease results from a neurodegenerative process that starts well before the diagnosis can be made. New prognostic or diagnostic markers enabling early intervention into the disease process would be highly valuable. Environmental and lifestyle factors largely modulate the disease risk and may influence the pathogenesis through epigenetic mechanisms, such as DNA methylation. As environmental and lifestyle factors may affect multiple tissues of the body, we hypothesized that the disease-associated DNA methylation signatures are detectable in the peripheral blood of discordant twin pairs. RESULTS: Comparison of 23 disease discordant Finnish twin pairs with reduced representation bisulfite sequencing revealed peripheral blood DNA methylation differences in 11 genomic regions with at least 15.0% median methylation difference and FDR adjusted p value \u2264\u20090.05. Several of the affected genes are primarily associated with neuronal functions and pathologies and do not display disease-associated differences in gene expression in blood. The DNA methylation mark in ADARB2 gene was found to be differentially methylated also in the anterior hippocampus, including entorhinal cortex, of non-twin cases and controls. Targeted bisulfite pyrosequencing of the DNA methylation mark in ADARB2 gene in 62 Finnish and Swedish twin pairs revealed that, in addition to the disease status, DNA methylation of this region is influenced by gender, age, zygosity, APOE genotype, and smoking. Further analysis of 120 Swedish twin pairs indicated that this specific DNA methylation mark is not predictive for Alzheimer's disease and becomes differentially methylated after disease onset. CONCLUSIONS: DNA methylation differences can be detected in the peripheral blood of twin pairs discordant for Alzheimer's disease. These DNA methylation signatures may have value as disease markers and provide insights into the molecular mechanisms of pathogenesis. We found no evidence that the DNA methylation marks would be associated with gene expression in blood. Further studies are needed to elucidate the potential importance of the associated genes in neuronal functions and to validate the prognostic or diagnostic value of the individual marks or marker panels.

        "Homologous bd oxidases share the same architecture but differ in mechanism. Cytochrome bd oxidases are terminal reductases of bacterial and archaeal respiratory chains. The enzyme couples the oxidation of ubiquinol or menaquinol with the reduction of dioxygen to water, thus contributing to the generation of the protonmotive force. Here, we determine the structure of the Escherichia coli bd oxidase treated with the specific inhibitor aurachin by cryo-electron\u00a0microscopy\u00a0(cryo-EM). The major subunits CydA and CydB are related by a pseudo two fold symmetry. The heme b and d cofactors are found in CydA, while ubiquinone-8 is bound at the homologous positions in CydB to stabilize its structure. The architecture of the E. coli enzyme is highly similar to that of Geobacillus thermodenitrificans, however, the positions of heme b595 and d are interchanged, and\u00a0a common oxygen channel is blocked by a fourth subunit and substituted by a more narrow, alternative channel. Thus, with the same overall fold, the homologous enzymes exhibit a different mechanism. ",
        "A high-sugar diet rapidly enhances susceptibility to colitis via depletion of luminal short-chain fatty acids in mice. Western-style diets have been implicated in triggering inflammatory bowel disease activity. The aim of this study was to identify the effect of a short-term diet high in sugar on susceptibility to colitis. Adult wild-type mice were placed on chow or a high sugar diet (50% sucrose)\u2009\u00b1\u2009acetate. After two days of diet, mice were treated with dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) to induce colitis. Disease severity was assessed daily. Colonic tissues were analyzed for cytokine expression using the MesoScale discovery platform. Intestinal dextran permeability and serum lipopolysaccharide levels (LPS) were measured. Gut microbiota were analyzed by 16s rRNA sequencing and short chain fatty acid (SCFA) concentrations by gas chromatography. Bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM) were incubated with LPS and cytokine secretion measured. Mice on a high sugar diet had increased gut permeability, decreased microbial diversity and reduced SCFA. BMDM derived from high sugar fed mice were highly responsive to LPS. High sugar fed mice had increased susceptibility to colitis and pro-inflammatory cytokine concentrations. Oral acetate significantly attenuated colitis in mice by restoring permeability. In conclusion, short term exposure to a high sugar diet increases susceptibility to colitis by reducing short-chain fatty acids and increasing gut permeability. ",
        "Randomized Study of Providing Evidence Context to Mitigate Physician Misinterpretation Arising From Off-Label Drug Promotion. BACKGROUND: Recent court decisions have thrown into question the Food and Drug Administration's rules limiting manufacturer promotion of prescription drugs for unapproved uses. We assessed how providing pro forma disclosures or more descriptive evidence context about the data supporting an off-label claim affected physicians' beliefs about drug efficacy. METHODS AND RESULTS: In online and mailed surveys, we randomized national samples of board-certified, clinically active cardiologists, internists, and endocrinologists to receive 1 of 3 information scenarios about a hypothetical drug derived verbatim from excerpts on the website for Vascepa, a prescription fish oil for which Food and Drug Administration specially permitted off-label promotion after a manufacturer lawsuit. The scenarios presented information about the approved on-label indication (severe hypertriglyceridemia), off-label claim + pro forma disclaimers (suggestive but not conclusive evidence for use as an add-on to a statin for patients reaching low-density lipoprotein goal but with persistent moderate hypertriglyceridemia), and off-label claim + evidence context (eg, reports on 3 trials failing to demonstrate cardiovascular benefit of other triglyceride-lowering drugs for such patients). Among 686 respondents (48% response rate), 29% reported receiving off-label information about Vascepa (ie, use as an add-on to a statin) from the manufacturer, and 16% had prescribed it off-label for this purpose. Off-label prescribing was 5 times higher among physicians who received such off-label information (38% versus 7%, P<0.001). For the hypothetical drug, the proportion of physicians endorsing the unproven claim that the drug reduced cardiovascular risk was similar among those randomized to the on-label and off-label claim + pro forma disclaimers scenarios (35% versus 37% [95% CI, -6% to 11%]), but substantially lower among those randomized to the off-label claim + evidence context scenario (21% [95% CI, -24% to 7%]). CONCLUSIONS: Physicians who received company information about the unapproved use of Vascepa were more likely to report prescribing it off-label. Supplementing off-label claims with evidence context improved the prescribers' knowledge and reduced enthusiasm for the unproven, off-label indication of reducing cardiovascular risk. ",
        "Sex differences in treatment and outcome after stroke: Pooled analysis including 19,000 participants. OBJECTIVE: To explore the sex differences in outcomes and management after stroke using a large sample with high-quality international trial data. METHODS: Individual participant data were obtained from 5 acute stroke randomized controlled trials. Data were obtained on demographics, medication use, in-hospital treatment, and functional outcome. Study-specific crude and adjusted models were used to estimate sex differences in outcomes and management, and then pooled using random-effects meta-analysis. RESULTS: There were 19,652 participants, of whom 7,721 (40%) were women. After multivariable adjustments, women with ischemic stroke had higher survival at 3-6 months (odds ratio [OR] 0.82, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.70-0.97), higher likelihood of disability (OR 1.20, 95% CI 1.06-1.36), and worse quality of life (weighted mean difference -0.07, 95% CI -0.09 to 0.04). For management, women were more likely to be admitted to an acute stroke unit (OR 1.17, 95% CI 1.01-1.34), but less likely to be intubated (OR 0.58, 95% CI 0.36-0.93), treated for fever (OR 0.82, 95% CI 0.70-0.95), or admitted to an intensive care unit (OR 0.83, 95% CI 0.74-0.93). For preadmission medications, women had higher odds of being prescribed antihypertensive agents (OR 1.22, 95% CI 1.13-1.31) and lower odds of being prescribed antiplatelets (OR 0.86, 95% CI 0.79-0.93), glucose-lowering agents (OR 0.86, 95% CI 0.78-0.94), or lipid-lowering agents (OR 0.85, 95% CI 0.77-0.94). CONCLUSIONS: This analysis suggests that women who had ischemic stroke had better survival but were also more disabled and had poorer quality of life. Variations in hospital and out-of-hospital management may partly explain the disparities. ",
        "Image-Based 3D Characterization of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm Deformation After Endovascular Aneurysm Repair. An abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a focal dilation of the abdominal aorta, that if not treated, tends to grow and may rupture. The most common treatment for AAAs is the endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR), which requires that patients undergo Computed Tomography Angiography (CTA)-based post-operative lifelong surveillance due to the possible appearance of complications. These complications may again lead to AAA dilation and rupture. However, there is a lack of advanced quantitative image-analysis tools to support the clinicians in the follow-up. Currently, the approach is to evaluate AAA diameter changes along time to infer the progress of the patient and the post-operative risk of AAA rupture. An increased AAA diameter is usually associated with a higher rupture risk, but there are some small AAAs that rupture, whereas other larger aneurysms remain stable. This means that the diameter-based rupture risk assessment is not suitable for all the cases, and there is increasing evidence that the biomechanical behavior of the AAA may provide additional valuable information regarding the progression of the disease and the risk of rupture. Hence, we propose a promising methodology for post-operative CTA time-series registration and subsequent aneurysm biomechanical strain analysis. From these strains, quantitative image-based descriptors are extracted using a principal component analysis of the tensile and compressive strain fields. Evaluated on 22 patients, our approach yields a mean area under the curve of 88.6% when correlating the strain-based quantitative descriptors with the long-term patient prognosis. This suggests that the strain information directly extracted from the CTA images is able to capture the biomechanical behavior of the aneurysm without relying on finite element modeling and simulation. Furthermore, the extracted descriptors set the basis for possible future imaging biomarkers that may be used in clinical practice. Apart from the diameter, these biomarkers may be used to assess patient prognosis and to enable informed decision making after an EVAR intervention, especially in difficult uncertain cases. ",
        "Total Syntheses and Preliminary Biological Evaluation of Brominated Fascaplysin and Reticulatine Alkaloids and Their Analogues. A simple approach toward the synthesis of the marine sponge derived pigment fascaplysin was used to obtain the marine alkaloids 3-bromofascaplysin and 3,10-dibromofascaplysin. These compounds were used for first syntheses of the alkaloids 14-bromoreticulatate and 14-bromoreticulatine. Preliminary bioassays showed that 14-bromoreticulatine has a selective antibiotic (to Pseudomonas aeruginosa) activity and reveals cytotoxicity toward human melanoma, colon, and prostate cancer cells. 3,10-Dibromofascaplysin was able to target metabolic activity of the prostate cancer cells, without disrupting cell membrane's integrity and had a wide therapeutic window amongst the fascaplysin alkaloids.

        "HIV Infection Is Associated With Variability in Ventricular Repolarization: The Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS). BACKGROUND: People living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV+) have greater risk for sudden arrhythmic death than HIV-uninfected (HIV-) individuals. HIV-associated abnormal cardiac repolarization may contribute to this risk. We investigated whether HIV serostatus is associated with ventricular repolarization lability by using the QT variability index (QTVI), defined as a log measure of QT-interval variance indexed to heart rate variance. METHODS: We studied 1123 men (589 HIV+ and 534 HIV-) from MACS (Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study), using the ZioXT ambulatory electrocardiography patch. Beat-to-beat analysis of up to 4 full days of electrocardiographic data per participant was performed using an automated algorithm (median analyzed duration [quartile 1-quartile 3]: 78.3 [66.3-83.0] hours/person). QTVI was modeled using linear mixed-effects models adjusted for demographics, cardiac risk factors, and HIV-related and inflammatory biomarkers. RESULTS: Mean (SD) age was 60.1 (11.9) years among HIV- and 54.2 (11.2) years among HIV+ participants (P<0.001), 83% of whom had undetectable (<20 copies/mL) HIV-1 viral load (VL). In comparison with HIV- men, HIV+ men had higher QTVI (adjusted difference of +0.077 [95% CI, +0.032 to +0.123]). The magnitude of this association depended on the degree of viremia, such that in HIV+ men with undetectable VL, adjusted QTVI was +0.064 (95% CI, +0.017 to +0.111) higher than in HIV- men, whereas, in HIV+ men with detectable VL, adjusted QTVI was higher by +0.150 (95% CI, 0.072-0.228) than in HIV- referents. Analysis of QTVI subcomponents showed that HIV+ men had: (1) lower heart rate variability irrespective of VL status, and (2) higher QT variability if they had detectable, but not with undetectable, VL, in comparison with HIV- men. Higher levels of C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, intercellular adhesion molecule-1, soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor 2, and soluble cluster of differentiation-163 (borderline), were associated with higher QTVI and partially attenuated the association with HIV serostatus. CONCLUSIONS: HIV+ men have greater beat-to-beat variability in QT interval (QTVI) than HIV- men, especially in the setting of HIV viremia and heightened inflammation. Among HIV+ men, higher QTVI suggests ventricular repolarization lability, which can increase susceptibility to arrhythmias, whereas lower heart rate variability signals a component of autonomic dysfunction.

        "Mutations in ANKLE2, a ZIKA Virus Target, Disrupt an Asymmetric Cell Division Pathway in Drosophila Neuroblasts to Cause Microcephaly. The apical Par complex, which contains atypical protein kinase C (aPKC), Bazooka (Par-3), and Par-6, is required for establishing polarity during asymmetric division of neuroblasts in Drosophila, and its activity depends on L(2)gl. We show that loss of Ankle2, a protein associated with microcephaly in humans and known to interact with Zika protein NS4A, reduces brain volume in flies and impacts the function of the Par complex. Reducing Ankle2 levels disrupts endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and nuclear envelope morphology, releasing the kinase Ballchen-VRK1 into the cytosol. These defects are associated with reduced phosphorylation of aPKC, disruption of Par-complex localization, and spindle alignment defects. Importantly, removal of one copy of ballchen or l(2)gl suppresses Ankle2 mutant phenotypes and restores viability and brain size. Human mutational studies implicate the above-mentioned genes in microcephaly and motor neuron disease. We suggest that NS4A, ANKLE2, VRK1, and LLGL1 define a pathway impinging on asymmetric determinants of neural stem cell division. ",
        "Cryo-EM structure of the complete and ligand-saturated insulin receptor ectodomain. Glucose homeostasis and growth essentially depend on the hormone insulin engaging its receptor. Despite biochemical and structural advances, a fundamental contradiction has persisted in the current understanding of insulin ligand-receptor interactions. While biochemistry predicts two distinct insulin binding sites, 1 and 2, recent structural analyses have resolved only site 1. Using a combined approach of cryo-EM and atomistic molecular dynamics simulation, we present the structure of the entire dimeric insulin receptor ectodomain saturated with four insulin molecules. Complementing the previously described insulin-site 1 interaction, we present the first view of insulin bound to the discrete insulin receptor site 2. Insulin binding stabilizes the receptor ectodomain in a T-shaped conformation wherein the membrane-proximal domains converge and contact each other. These findings expand the current models of insulin binding to its receptor and of its regulation. In summary, we provide the structural basis for a comprehensive description of ligand-receptor interactions that ultimately will inform new approaches to structure-based drug design. ",
        "Estimation of clinical trial success rates and related parameters. Previous estimates of drug development success rates rely on relatively small samples from databases curated by the pharmaceutical industry and are subject to potential selection biases. Using a sample of 406 038 entries of clinical trial data for over 21 143 compounds from January 1, 2000 to October 31, 2015, we estimate aggregate clinical trial success rates and durations. We also compute disaggregated estimates across several trial features including disease type, clinical phase, industry or academic sponsor, biomarker presence, lead indication status, and time. In several cases, our results differ significantly in detail from widely cited statistics. For example, oncology has a 3.4% success rate in our sample vs. 5.1% in prior studies. However, after declining to 1.7% in 2012, this rate has improved to 2.5% and 8.3% in 2014 and 2015, respectively. In addition, trials that use biomarkers in patient-selection have higher overall success probabilities than trials without biomarkers. ",
        "Temporal stability of functional brain modules associated with human intelligence. Individual differences in general cognitive ability (i.e., intelligence) have been linked to individual variations in the modular organization of functional brain networks. However, these analyses have been limited to static (time-averaged) connectivity, and have not yet addressed whether dynamic changes in the configuration of brain networks relate to general intelligence. Here, we used multiband functional MRI resting-state data (N\u2009=\u2009281) and estimated subject-specific time-varying functional connectivity networks. Modularity optimization was applied to determine individual time-variant module partitions and to assess fluctuations in modularity across time. We show that higher intelligence, indexed by an established composite measure, the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence (WASI), is associated with higher temporal stability (lower temporal variability) of brain network modularity. Post-hoc analyses reveal that subjects with higher intelligence scores engage in fewer periods of extremely high modularity - which are characterized by greater disconnection of task-positive from task-negative networks. Further, we show that brain regions of the dorsal attention network contribute most to the observed effect. In sum, our study suggests that investigating the temporal dynamics of functional brain network topology contributes to our understanding of the neural bases of general cognitive abilities. ",
        "Assessing the interplay between human mobility and mosquito borne diseases in urban environments. Urbanization drives the epidemiology of infectious diseases to many threats and new challenges. In this research, we study the interplay between human mobility and dengue outbreaks in the complex urban environment of the city-state of Singapore. We integrate both stylized and mobile phone data-driven mobility patterns in an agent-based transmission model in which humans and mosquitoes are represented as agents that go through the epidemic states of dengue. We monitor with numerical simulations the system-level response to the epidemic by comparing our results with the observed cases reported during the 2013 and 2014 outbreaks. Our results show that human mobility is a major factor in the spread of vector-borne diseases such as dengue even on the short scale corresponding to intra-city distances. We finally discuss the advantages and the limits of mobile phone data and potential alternatives for assessing valuable mobility patterns for modeling vector-borne diseases outbreaks in cities. ",
        "GSTM1 Deletion Exaggerates Kidney Injury in Experimental Mouse Models and Confers the Protective Effect of Cruciferous Vegetables in Mice and Humans. BACKGROUND: GSTM1 encodes glutathione S-transferase \u03bc-1 (GSTM1), which belongs to a superfamily of phase 2 antioxidant enzymes. The highly prevalent GSTM1 deletion variant is associated with kidney disease progression in human cohorts: the African American Study of Kidney Disease and Hypertension and the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study. METHODS: We generated a Gstm1 knockout mouse line to study its role in a CKD model (involving subtotal nephrectomy) and a hypertension model (induced by angiotensin II). We examined the effect of intake of cruciferous vegetables and GSTM1 genotypes on kidney disease in mice as well as in human ARIC study participants. We also examined the importance of superoxide in the mediating pathways and of hematopoietic GSTM1 on renal inflammation. RESULTS: Gstm1 knockout mice displayed increased oxidative stress, kidney injury, and inflammation in both models. The central mechanism for kidney injury is likely mediated by oxidative stress, because treatment with Tempol, an superoxide dismutase mimetic, rescued kidney injury in knockout mice without lowering BP. Bone marrow crosstransplantation revealed that Gstm1 deletion in the parenchyma, and not in bone marrow-derived cells, drives renal inflammation. Furthermore, supplementation with cruciferous broccoli powder rich in the precursor to antioxidant-activating sulforaphane significantly ameliorated kidney injury in Gstm1 knockout, but not wild-type mice. Similarly, among humans (ARIC study participants), high consumption of cruciferous vegetables was associated with fewer kidney failure events compared with low consumption, but this association was observed primarily in participants homozygous for the GSTM1 deletion variant. CONCLUSIONS: Our data support a role for the GSTM1 enzyme in the modulation of oxidative stress, inflammation, and protective metabolites in CKD. ",
        "Association of an Active Choice Intervention in the Electronic Health Record Directed to Medical Assistants With Clinician Ordering and Patient Completion of Breast and Colorectal Cancer Screening Tests. Importance: Early cancer detection can lead to improved outcomes, but cancer screening tests are often underused. Objective: To evaluate the association of an active choice intervention in the electronic health record directed to medical assistants with changes in clinician ordering and patient completion of breast and colorectal cancer screening tests. Design, Setting, and Participants: A retrospective quality improvement study was conducted among 69\u202f916 patients eligible for breast or colorectal cancer screening at 25 primary care practices at the University of Pennsylvania Health System between September 1, 2014, and August 31, 2017. Data analysis was conducted from January 21 to July 8, 2019. Interventions: From 2016 to 2017, 3 primary care practices at the University of Pennsylvania Health System implemented an active choice intervention in the electronic health record that prompted medical assistants to inform patients about cancer screening during check-in and template orders for clinicians to review during the visit. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was clinician ordering of cancer screening tests. The secondary outcome was patient completion of cancer screening tests within 1 year of the primary care visit. Results: The sample eligible for breast cancer screening comprised 26\u202f269 women with a mean (SD) age of 60.4 (6.9) years; 15\u202f873 (60.4%) were white and 7715 (29.4%) were black. The sample eligible for colorectal cancer screening comprised 43\u202f647 patients with a mean (SD) age of 59.4 (7.5) years; 24\u202f416 (55.9%) were women, 19\u202f231 (44.1%) were men, 29\u202f029 (66.5%) were white, and 9589 (22.0%) were black. For breast cancer screening, the intervention was associated with a significant increase in clinician ordering of tests (22.2 percentage points; 95% CI, 17.2-27.6 percentage points; P\u2009<\u2009.001) but no change in patient completion (0.1 percentage points; 95% CI, -4.0 to 4.3 percentage points; P\u2009=\u2009.45). For colorectal cancer screening, the intervention was associated with a significant increase in clinician ordering of tests (13.7 percentage points; 95% CI, 8.0-18.9 percentage points; P\u2009<\u2009.001) but no change in patient completion (1.0 percentage points; 95% CI, -3.2 to 4.6 percentage points; P\u2009=\u2009.36). Conclusions and Relevance: An active choice intervention in the electronic health record directed to medical assistants was associated with a significant increase in clinician ordering of breast and colorectal cancer screening tests. However, it was not associated with a significant change in patient completion of either cancer screening test during a 1-year follow-up. ",
        "Local ancestry at APOE modifies Alzheimer's disease risk in Caribbean Hispanics. INTRODUCTION: Although the relationship between APOE and Alzheimer's disease (AD) is well established in populations of European descent, the effects of APOE and ancestry on AD risk in diverse populations is not well understood. METHODS: Logistic mixed model regression and survival analyses were performed in a sample of 3067 Caribbean Hispanics and 3028 individuals of European descent to assess the effects of APOE genotype, local ancestry, and genome-wide ancestry on AD risk and age at onset. RESULTS: Among the Caribbean Hispanics, individuals with African-derived ancestry at APOE had 39% lower odds of AD than individuals with European-derived APOE, after adjusting for APOE genotype, age, and genome-wide ancestry. While APOE E2 and E4 effects on AD risk and age at onset were significant in the Caribbean Hispanics, they were substantially attenuated compared with those in European ancestry individuals. DISCUSSION: These results suggest that additional genetic variation in the APOE region influences AD risk beyond APOE E2/E3/E4. ",
        "A therapeutic antibody targeting osteoprotegerin attenuates severe experimental pulmonary arterial hypertension. Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a rare but fatal disease. Current treatments increase life expectancy but have limited impact on the progressive pulmonary vascular remodelling that drives PAH. Osteoprotegerin (OPG) is increased within serum and lesions of patients with idiopathic PAH and is a mitogen and migratory stimulus for pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (PASMCs). Here, we report that the pro-proliferative and migratory phenotype in PASMCs stimulated with OPG is mediated via the Fas receptor and that treatment with a human antibody targeting OPG can attenuate pulmonary vascular remodelling associated with PAH in multiple rodent models of early and late treatment. We also demonstrate that the therapeutic efficacy of the anti-OPG antibody approach in the presence of standard of care vasodilator therapy is mediated by a reduction in pulmonary vascular remodelling. Targeting OPG with a therapeutic antibody is a potential treatment strategy in PAH. ",
        "Pain as a predictor of frailty over time among older Mexican Americans. The objective of this study was to examine pain as a predictor of frailty over 18 years of follow-up among older Mexican Americans who were nonfrail at baseline. Data were from a prospective cohort study of 1545 community-dwelling Mexican Americans aged \u226567 years from the Hispanic Established Populations for the Epidemiological Study of the Elderly (1995/1996-2012/2013). Frailty was defined as meeting 2 or more of the following: unintentional weight loss of >10 pounds, weakness, self-reported exhaustion, and slowness. The independent predictor was self-reported pain. Covariates included age, sex, marital status, education, comorbid conditions, body mass index, Mini-Mental State Examination, depressive symptoms, and limitation in activities of daily livings. General equation estimation was performed to estimate the odds ratio of frailty as a function of pain. A total of 538 participants (34.8%) reported pain at baseline. The prevalence of frailty among those with pain ranged from 24.4% in wave 3 to 41% in wave 8. The odds ratio of becoming frail over time as a function of pain was 1.71; 95% confidence interval: 1.41 to 2.09 after controlling for all covariates. Older age, hip fracture, high depressive symptoms, and activities of daily living disability were also associated with higher odds of becoming frail over time. Female participants and those with higher levels of education and high Mini-Mental State Examination scores were less at risk. In conclusion, pain was a significantly predictor of frailty. Early assessment and better management of pain may prevent early onset of frailty in older Mexican Americans. ",
        "Cerebellar Morphometry and Cognition in the Context of Chronic Alcohol Consumption and Cigarette Smoking. BACKGROUND: Cerebellar atrophy (especially involving the superior-anterior cerebellar vermis) is among the most salient and clinically significant effects of chronic hazardous alcohol consumption on brain structure. Smaller cerebellar volumes are also associated with chronic cigarette smoking. The present study investigated effects of both chronic alcohol consumption and cigarette smoking on cerebellar structure and its relation to performance on select cognitive/behavioral tasks. METHODS: Using T1-weighted Magnetic Resonance Images (MRIs), the Cerebellar Analysis Tool Kit segmented the cerebellum into bilateral hemispheres and 3 vermis parcels from 4 participant groups: smoking (s) and nonsmoking (ns) abstinent alcohol-dependent treatment seekers (ALC) and controls (CON) (i.e., sALC, nsALC, sCON, and nsCON). Cognitive and behavioral data were also obtained. RESULTS: We found detrimental effects of chronic drinking on all cerebellar structural measures in ALC participants, with largest reductions seen in vermis areas. Furthermore, both smoking groups had smaller volumes of cerebellar hemispheres but not vermis areas compared to their nonsmoking counterparts. In exploratory analyses, smaller cerebellar volumes were related to lower measures of intelligence. In sCON, but not sALC, greater smoking severity was related to smaller cerebellar volume and smaller superior-anterior vermis area. In sALC, greater abstinence duration was associated with larger cerebellar and superior-anterior vermis areas, suggesting some recovery with abstinence. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that both smoking and alcohol status are associated with smaller cerebellar structural measurements, with vermal areas more vulnerable to chronic alcohol consumption and less affected by chronic smoking. These morphometric cerebellar deficits were also associated with lower intelligence and related to duration of abstinence in sALC only. ",
        "Identification of candidate cancer drivers by integrative Epi-DNA and Gene Expression (iEDGE) data analysis. The emergence of large-scale multi-omics data warrants method development for data integration. Genomic studies from cancer patients have identified epigenetic and genetic regulators - such as methylation marks, somatic mutations, and somatic copy number alterations (SCNAs), among others - as predictive features of cancer outcome. However, identification of \"driver genes\" associated with a given alteration remains a challenge. To this end, we developed a computational tool, iEDGE, to model cis and trans effects of (epi-)DNA alterations and identify potential cis driver genes, where cis and trans genes denote those genes falling within and outside the genomic boundaries of a given (epi-)genetic alteration, respectively. iEDGE first identifies the cis and trans gene expression signatures associated with the presence/absence of a particular epi-DNA alteration across samples. It then applies tests of statistical mediation to determine the cis genes predictive of the trans gene expression. Finally, cis and trans effects are annotated by pathway enrichment analysis to gain insights into the underlying regulatory networks. We used iEDGE to perform integrative analysis of SCNAs and gene expression data from breast cancer and 18 additional cancer types included in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Notably, cis gene drivers identified by iEDGE were found to be significantly enriched for known driver genes from multiple compendia of validated oncogenes and tumor suppressors, suggesting that the remainder are of equal importance. Furthermore, predicted drivers were enriched for functionally relevant cancer genes with amplification-driven dependencies, which are of potential prognostic and therapeutic value. All the analyses results are accessible at https://montilab.bu.edu/iEDGE. In summary, integrative analysis of SCNAs and gene expression using iEDGE successfully identified known cancer driver genes and putative cancer therapeutic targets across 19 cancer types in the TCGA. The proposed method can easily be applied to the integration of gene expression profiles with other epi-DNA assays in a variety of disease contexts. ",
        "Faecal Transplantation, Pro- and Prebiotics in Parkinson's Disease; Hope or Hype?. Faecal microbiome transplantation (FMT) is an attractive technique, because the administration is relatively simple and in general has a mild adverse effect pattern. Moreover, FMT consists of a broad mixture, which could be beneficial, because at this moment it is not known what type of changes in the microbiome are needed. However, except from a few cases no clinical data in Parkinson's disease (PD) is available yet. There is some indication that FMT might be beneficial in severe constipated PD patients, but the clinical data to support this are very scarce. So, actually there are no good data in the public domain to support FMT at this moment in PD patients. FMT at this moment is a black box with too many unanswered questions, also with respect to safety concerns. Only the administration of species of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium over a time period of four to twelve weeks has repeatedly proven to be effective in treating constipation in PD. Also, no solid clinical data are available about the possible effects of probiotic treatment on motor symptoms or progression of PD. Therefore, also probiotic treatments in PD should wait until better clinical data become available, in order to select the right target populations and to have good estimates of the clinical effects to be expected.

        "Cardiovascular Effects of Switching From\u00a0Tobacco Cigarettes to Electronic\u00a0Cigarettes. BACKGROUND: E-cigarette (EC) use is increasing exponentially worldwide. The early cardiovascular effects of switching from tobacco cigarettes (TC) to EC in chronic smokers is unknown. Meta-analysis of flow-mediated dilation (FMD) studies indicate 13% lower pooled, adjusted relative risks of cardiovascular events with every 1% improvement in\u00a0FMD. OBJECTIVES: This study sought to determine the early vascular impact of switching from TC to EC in chronic smokers. METHODS: The authors conducted a prospective, randomized control trial with a parallel nonrandomized preference cohort and blinded endpoint of smokers \u226518 years of age who had smoked\u00a0\u226515 cigarettes/day for\u00a0\u22652 years and were free from established cardiovascular disease. Participants were randomized to EC with nicotine or EC without nicotine for 1\u00a0month. Those unwilling to quit continued with TC in a parallel preference arm. A propensity score analysis was done to adjust for differences between the randomized and preference arms. Vascular function was assessed by FMD and pulse wave velocity. Compliance with EC was measured by carbon monoxide levels. RESULTS: Within 1\u00a0month of switching from TC to EC, there was a significant improvement in endothelial function (linear trend \u03b2\u00a0=\u00a00.73%; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.41 to 1.05; p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001; TC vs. EC combined: 1.49%; 95%\u00a0CI: 0.93 to 2.04; p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001) and vascular stiffness (-0.529\u00a0m/s; 95%\u00a0CI:\u00a0-0.946 to\u00a0-0.112; p\u00a0=\u00a00.014). Females benefited from switching more than males did in every between-group comparison. Those who complied best with EC switch demonstrated the largest improvement. There was no difference in vascular effects between EC with and without nicotine within the study timeframe. CONCLUSIONS: TC smokers, particularly females, demonstrate significant improvement in vascular health within\u00a01\u00a0month of switching from TC to EC. Switching from TC to EC may be considered a harms reduction measure. (Vascular\u00a0Effects of Regular Cigarettes Versus Electronic Cigarette Use [VESUVIUS]; NCT02878421; ISRCTN59133298). ",
        "Semi-Supervised Learning Algorithm for Identifying High-Priority Drug-Drug Interactions Through Adverse Event Reports. Identifying drug-drug interactions (DDIs) is a critical enabler for reducing adverse drug events and improving patient safety. Generating proper DDI alerts during prescribing workflow has the potential to prevent DDI-related adverse events. However, the implementation of DDI alerting system remains a challenge as users are experiencing alert overload which causes alert fatigue. One strategy to optimize the current system is to establish a list of high-priority DDIs for alerting purposes, though it is a resource-intensive task. In this study, we propose a machine learning framework to extract useful features from the FDA adverse event reports and then identify potential high-priority DDIs using an autoencoder-based semi-supervised learning algorithm. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of using adverse event feature representations in differentiating high- and low-priority DDIs. Additionally, the proposed algorithm utilizes stacked autoencoders and weighted support vector machine for boosting classification performance, which outperforms other competing methods in terms of F-measure and AUC score. This framework integrates multiple information sources, leverages domain knowledge and clinical evidence, and provides a practical approach for pre-screening high-priority DDI candidates for medication alerts.

        "Epidemiological, Clinical and Genetic Study of Hypophosphatasia in A Spanish Population: Identification of Two Novel Mutations in The Alpl Gene. Hypophosphatasia (HPP) is a genetic disease caused by one or several mutations in ALPL gene encoding the tissue-nonspecific alkaline phosphatase affecting the mineralization process. Due to its low prevalence and lack of recognition, this metabolic disorder is generally confused with other more frequent bone disorders. An assessment of serum total alkaline phosphatase (ALP) levels was performed in 78,590 subjects. Pyridoxal-5'-phosphate (PLP) concentrations were determined and ALPL gene was sequenced in patients potentially affected by HPP. Functional validation of the novel mutations found was performed using a cell-based assay. Our results showed persistently low serum ALP levels in 0.12% of subjects. Among the studied subjects, 40% presented with HPP-related symptoms. Nine of them (~28%) had a history of fractures, 5 (~16%) subjects showed chondrocalcinosis and 4 (~13%) subjects presented with dental abnormalities. Eleven subjects showed increased PLP concentrations. Seven of them showed ALPL gene mutations (2 of the mutations corresponded to novel genetic variants). In summary, we identified two novel ALPL gene mutations associated with adult HPP. Using this protocol, almost half of the studied patients were diagnosed with HPP. Based on these results, the estimated prevalence of mild HPP in Spain could be up to double than previously reported. ",
        "Subclinical in utero Zika virus infection is associated with interferon alpha sequelae and sex-specific molecular brain pathology in asymptomatic porcine offspring. Zika virus (ZIKV) infection during human pregnancy may lead to severe fetal pathology and debilitating impairments in offspring. However, the majority of infections are subclinical and not associated with evident birth defects. Potentially detrimental life-long health outcomes in asymptomatic offspring evoke high concerns. Thus, animal models addressing sequelae in offspring may provide valuable information. To induce subclinical infection, we inoculated selected porcine fetuses at the mid-stage of development. Inoculation resulted in trans-fetal virus spread and persistent infection in the placenta and fetal membranes for two months. Offspring did not show congenital Zika syndrome (e.g., microcephaly, brain calcifications, congenital clubfoot, arthrogryposis, seizures) or other visible birth defects. However, a month after birth, a portion of offspring exhibited excessive interferon alpha (IFN-\u03b1) levels in blood plasma in a regular environment. Most affected offspring also showed dramatic IFN-\u03b1 shutdown during social stress providing the first evidence for the cumulative impact of prenatal ZIKV exposure and postnatal environmental insult. Other eleven cytokines tested before and after stress were not altered suggesting the specific IFN-\u03b1 pathology. While brains from offspring did not have histopathology, lesions, and ZIKV, the whole genome expression analysis of the prefrontal cortex revealed profound sex-specific transcriptional changes that most probably was the result of subclinical in utero infection. RNA-seq analysis in the placenta persistently infected with ZIKV provided independent support for the sex-specific pattern of in utero-acquired transcriptional responses. Collectively, our results provide strong evidence that two hallmarks of fetal ZIKV infection, altered type I IFN response and molecular brain pathology can persist after birth in offspring in the absence of congenital Zika syndrome.

        "Economic Value of Anti-Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Treatment for Patients With Wet Age-Related Macular Degeneration in the United States. Importance: Anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) is a breakthrough treatment for wet age-related macular degeneration (wAMD), the most common cause of blindness in western countries. Anti-VEGF treatment prevents vision loss and has been shown to produce vision gains lasting as long as 5 years. Although this treatment is costly, the benefits associated with vision gains are large. Objective: To estimate the economic value of benefits, costs for patients with wAMD, and societal value in the United States generated from vision improvement associated with anti-VEGF treatment. Design, Setting, and Participants: This economic evaluation study used data from the published literature to simulate vision outcomes for a cohort of 168 820 patients with wAMD aged 65 years or older and to translate them into economic variables. Data were collected and analyzed from March 2018 to November 2018. Main Outcomes and Measures: Main outcomes included patient benefits, costs, and societal value. Each outcome was estimated for a newly diagnosed cohort and the full population across 5 years, with a focus on year 3 as the primary outcome because data beyond that point may be less representative of the general population. Drug costs were the weighted mean across anti-VEGF therapies. Two current treatment scenarios were considered: less frequent injections (mean [SD], 8.2 [1.6] injections annually) and more frequent injections (mean [range], 10.5 [6.8-13.1] injections annually). The 2 treatment innovation scenarios, improved adherence and best case, had the same vision outcomes as the current treatment scenarios had but included more patients treated from higher initiation and lower discontinuation. Results: The study population included 168 820 patients aged 65 years at the time of diagnosis with wAMD. The underlying clinical trials that were used to parameterize the model did not stratify visual acuity outcomes or treatment frequency by sex; therefore, the model parameters could not be stratified by sex. The current treatment scenario of less frequent injections generated $1.1 billion for the full population in year 1 and $5.1 billion in year 3, whereas the scenario of more frequent injections generated $1.6 billion (year 1) and $8.2 billion (year 3). Three-year benefits ranged from $7.3 billion to $11.4 billion in the improved adherence scenario and from $9.7 billion to $15.0 billion if 100% of the patients initiated anti-VEGF treatment and the discontinuation rates were 6% per year or equivalent to clinical trial discontinuation (best-case scenario). Societal value (patient benefits net of treatment cost) ranged from $0.9 billion to $3.0 billion across 3 years in the current treatment scenarios and from $0.9 billion to $4.3 billion in the treatment innovation scenarios. Conclusions and Relevance: This study's findings suggest that improved vision associated with anti-VEGF treatment may provide economic value to patients and society if the outcomes match published outcomes data used in these analyses; however, future innovations that increase treatment utilization may result in added economic benefit.

        "Rab5-mediated endosome formation is regulated at the trans-Golgi network. Early endosomes, also called sorting endosomes, are known to mature into late endosomes via the Rab5-mediated endolysosomal trafficking pathway. Thus, early endosome existence is thought to be maintained by the continual fusion of transport vesicles from the plasma membrane and the trans-Golgi network (TGN). Here we show instead that endocytosis is dispensable and post-Golgi vesicle transport is crucial for the formation of endosomes and the subsequent endolysosomal traffic regulated by yeast Rab5 Vps21p. Fittingly, all three proteins required for endosomal nucleotide exchange on Vps21p are first recruited to the TGN before transport to the endosome, namely the GEF Vps9p and the epsin-related adaptors Ent3/5p. The TGN recruitment of these components is distinctly controlled, with Vps9p appearing to require the Arf1p GTPase, and the Rab11s, Ypt31p/32p. These results provide a different view of endosome formation and identify the TGN as a critical location for regulating progress through the endolysosomal trafficking pathway. ",
        "Transplanted interneurons improve memory precision after traumatic brain injury. Repair of the traumatically injured brain has been envisioned for decades, but regenerating new neurons at the site of brain injury has been challenging. We show GABAergic progenitors, derived from the embryonic medial ganglionic eminence, migrate long distances following transplantation into\u00a0the hippocampus of adult mice with traumatic brain injury, functionally integrate as mature inhibitory interneurons and restore post-traumatic decreases in synaptic inhibition. Grafted animals had improvements in memory precision that were reversed by chemogenetic silencing of the transplanted neurons and a long-lasting reduction in spontaneous seizures. Our results reveal a striking ability of transplanted interneurons for incorporating into injured brain circuits, and this approach is a powerful therapeutic strategy for correcting post-traumatic memory and seizure disorders.

        "Transcriptional regulatory model of fibrosis progression in the human lung. To develop a systems biology model of fibrosis progression within the human lung we performed RNA sequencing and microRNA analysis on 95 samples obtained from 10 idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and 6 control lungs. Extent of fibrosis in each sample was assessed by microCT-measured alveolar surface density (ASD) and confirmed by histology. Regulatory gene expression networks were identified using linear mixed-effect models and dynamic regulatory events miner (DREM). Differential gene expression analysis identified a core set of genes increased or decreased before fibrosis was histologically evident that continued to change with advanced fibrosis. DREM generated a systems biology model (www.sb.cs.cmu.edu/IPFReg) that identified progressively divergent gene expression tracks with microRNAs and transcription factors that specifically regulate mild or advanced fibrosis. We confirmed model predictions by demonstrating that expression of POU2AF1, previously unassociated with lung fibrosis but proposed by the model as regulator, is increased in B lymphocytes in IPF lungs and that POU2AF1-knockout mice were protected from bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis. Our results reveal distinct regulation of gene expression changes in IPF tissue that remained structurally normal compared with moderate or advanced fibrosis and suggest distinct regulatory mechanisms for each stage.

        "Aging Induces an Nlrp3 Inflammasome-Dependent Expansion of Adipose B Cells That Impairs Metabolic Homeostasis. During aging, visceral adiposity is often associated with alterations in adipose tissue (AT) leukocytes, inflammation, and metabolic dysfunction. However, the contribution of AT B cells in immunometabolism during aging is unexplored. Here, we show that aging is associated with an expansion of a unique population of resident non-senescent aged adipose B cells (AABs) found in fat-associated lymphoid clusters (FALCs). AABs are transcriptionally distinct from splenic age-associated B cells (ABCs) and show greater expansion in female mice. Functionally, whole-body B cell depletion restores proper lipolysis and core body temperature maintenance during cold stress. Mechanistically, the age-induced FALC formation, AAB, and splenic ABC expansion is dependent on the Nlrp3 inflammasome. Furthermore, AABs express IL-1R, and inhibition of IL-1 signaling reduces their proliferation and increases lipolysis in aging. These data reveal that inhibiting Nlrp3-dependent B cell accumulation can be targeted to reverse metabolic impairment in aging AT. ",
        "Results of the FUEL Trial. BACKGROUND: The Fontan operation creates a total cavopulmonary connection, a circulation in which the importance of pulmonary vascular resistance is magnified. Over time, this circulation leads to deterioration of cardiovascular efficiency associated with a decline in exercise performance. Rigorous clinical trials aimed at improving physiology and guiding pharmacotherapy are lacking. METHODS: The FUEL trial (Fontan Udenafil Exercise Longitudinal) was a phase III clinical trial conducted at 30 centers. Participants were randomly assigned udenafil, 87.5 mg twice daily, or placebo in a 1:1 ratio. The primary outcome was the between-group difference in change in oxygen consumption at peak exercise. Secondary outcomes included between-group differences in changes in submaximal exercise at the ventilatory anaerobic threshold, the myocardial performance index, the natural log of the reactive hyperemia index, and serum brain-type natriuretic peptide. RESULTS: Between 2017 and 2019, 30 clinical sites in North America and the Republic of Korea randomly assigned 400 participants with Fontan physiology. The mean age at randomization was 15.5\u00b12 years; 60% of participants were male, and 81% were white. All 400 participants were included in the primary analysis with imputation of the 26-week end point for 21 participants with missing data (11 randomly assigned to udenafil and 10 to placebo). Among randomly assigned participants, peak oxygen consumption increased by 44\u00b1245 mL/min (2.8%) in the udenafil group and declined by 3.7\u00b1228 mL/min (-0.2%) in the placebo group (P=0.071). Analysis at ventilatory anaerobic threshold demonstrated improvements in the udenafil group versus the placebo group in oxygen consumption (+33\u00b1185 [3.2%] versus -9\u00b1193 [-0.9%] mL/min, P=0.012), ventilatory equivalents of carbon dioxide (-0.8 versus -0.06, P=0.014), and work rate (+3.8 versus +0.34 W, P=0.021). There was no difference in change of myocardial performance index, the natural log of the reactive hyperemia index, or serum brain-type natriuretic peptide level. CONCLUSIONS: In the FUEL trial, treatment with udenafil (87.5 mg twice daily) was not associated with an improvement in oxygen consumption at peak exercise but was associated with improvements in multiple measures of exercise performance at the ventilatory anaerobic threshold.

        "Plasma phospholipid fatty acids and prostate cancer risk in the SELECT trial. BACKGROUND: Studies of dietary \u03c9-3 fatty acid intake and prostate cancer risk are inconsistent; however, recent large prospective studies have found increased risk of prostate cancer among men with high blood concentrations of long-chain \u03c9-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids ([LC\u03c9-3PUFA] 20:5\u03c93; 22:5\u03c93; 22:6\u03c93]. This case-cohort study examines associations between plasma phospholipid fatty acids and prostate cancer risk among participants in the Selenium and Vitamin E Cancer Prevention Trial. METHODS: Case subjects were 834 men diagnosed with prostate cancer, of which 156 had high-grade cancer. The subcohort consisted of 1393 men selected randomly at baseline and from within strata frequency matched to case subjects on age and race. Proportional hazards models estimated hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for associations between fatty acids and prostate cancer risk overall and by grade. All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: Compared with men in the lowest quartiles of LC\u03c9-3PUFA, men in the highest quartile had increased risks for low-grade (HR = 1.44, 95% CI = 1.08 to 1.93), high-grade (HR = 1.71, 95% CI = 1.00 to 2.94), and total prostate cancer (HR = 1.43, 95% CI = 1.09 to 1.88). Associations were similar for individual long-chain \u03c9-3 fatty acids. Higher linoleic acid (\u03c9-6) was associated with reduced risks of low-grade (HR = 0.75, 95% CI = 0.56 to 0.99) and total prostate cancer (HR = 0.77, 95% CI = 0.59 to 1.01); however, there was no dose response. CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms previous reports of increased prostate cancer risk among men with high blood concentrations of LC\u03c9-3PUFA. The consistency of these findings suggests that these fatty acids are involved in prostate tumorigenesis. Recommendations to increase LC\u03c9-3PUFA intake should consider its potential risks. ",
        "Rare Genetic Variants Associated With Sudden Cardiac Death in Adults. BACKGROUND: Sudden cardiac death occurs in \u223c220,000 U.S. adults annually, the majority of whom have no prior symptoms or cardiovascular diagnosis. Rare pathogenic DNA variants in any of 49 genes can pre-dispose to 4 important causes of sudden cardiac death: cardiomyopathy, coronary artery disease, inherited arrhythmia syndrome, and aortopathy or aortic dissection. OBJECTIVES: This study assessed the prevalence of rare pathogenic variants in sudden cardiac death cases versus controls, and the prevalence and clinical importance of such mutations in an asymptomatic adult population. METHODS: The authors performed whole-exome sequencing in a case-control cohort of 600 adult-onset sudden cardiac death cases and 600 matched controls from 106,098 participants of 6 prospective cohort studies. Observed DNA sequence variants in any of 49 genes with known association to cardiovascular disease were classified as pathogenic or likely pathogenic by a clinical laboratory geneticist blinded to case status. In an independent population of 4,525 asymptomatic adult participants of a prospective cohort study, the authors performed whole-genome sequencing and determined the prevalence of pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants and prospective association with cardiovascular death. RESULTS: Among the 1,200 sudden cardiac death cases and controls, the authors identified 5,178 genetic variants and classified 14 as pathogenic or likely pathogenic. These 14 variants were present in 15 individuals, all of whom had experienced sudden cardiac death-corresponding to a pathogenic variant prevalence of 2.5% in cases and 0% in controls (p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001). Among the 4,525 participants of the prospective cohort study, 41 (0.9%) carried a pathogenic or likely pathogenic variant and these individuals had 3.24-fold higher risk of cardiovascular death over a median follow-up of 14.3 years (p\u00a0=\u00a00.02). CONCLUSIONS: Gene sequencing identifies a pathogenic or likely pathogenic variant in a small but potentially important subset of adults experiencing sudden cardiac death; these variants are present in \u223c1% of asymptomatic adults.

        "Strengthened Hippocampal Circuits Underlie Enhanced Retrieval of Extinguished Fear Memories Following Mindfulness Training. BACKGROUND: The role of hippocampus in context-dependent recall of extinction is well recognized. However, little is known about how intervention-induced changes in hippocampal networks relate to improvements in extinction learning. In this study, we hypothesized that mindfulness training creates an optimal exposure condition by heightening attention and awareness of present moment sensory experience, leading to enhanced extinction learning, improved emotion regulation, and reduced anxiety symptoms. METHODS: We tested this hypothesis in a randomized controlled longitudinal study design using a 2-day fear conditioning and extinction protocol. The mindfulness training group included 42 participants (28 women) and the control group included 25 participants (15 women). RESULTS: We show that mindfulness training is associated with differential engagement of the right supramarginal gyrus as well as hippocampal-cortical reorganization. We also report enhanced hippocampal connectivity to the primary sensory cortex during retrieval of extinguished stimuli following mindfulness training. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest hippocampal-dependent changes in contextual retrieval as one plausible neural mechanism through which mindfulness-based interventions enhance fear extinction and foster stress resilience.

        "Association of maternal antiretroviral use with microcephaly in children who are HIV-exposed but uninfected (SMARTT): a prospective cohort study. BACKGROUND: Perinatal HIV transmission has substantially decreased with combination antiretroviral regimens, but complications in children who are HIV-exposed but uninfected, such as microcephaly, warrant ongoing surveillance. We aimed to evaluate whether individual in utero antiretroviral exposures were associated with increased risk of microcephaly based on long-term follow-up of infants and children who are HIV-exposed but uninfected. METHODS: We evaluated children aged younger than 18 years who were HIV-exposed but uninfected with at least one head circumference measurement while enrolled in the Surveillance Monitoring for ART Toxicities (SMARTT) study at 22 clinical sites in the USA, including Puerto Rico. This prospective cohort study was done by the Pediatric HIV/AIDS Cohort Study network. Microcephaly was defined as having a head circumference Z score <-2 according to the 2000 US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention growth charts for children 6-36 months old and according to Nellhaus standards (head circumference <2nd percentile) after 36 months (SMARTT criteria); an alternate definition for microcephaly was based on applying Nellhaus standards across all ages (Nellhaus criteria). Modified Poisson regression models were fit to obtain relative risks (RRs) for associations between in utero antiretroviral exposure and microcephaly status, adjusted for potential confounders. Neurodevelopmental functioning was compared in children who are HIV-exposed but uninfected with or without microcephaly. FINDINGS: Between March 21, 2007, and Aug 1, 2017, 3055 participants enrolled in SMARTT had at least one head circumference measurement. The cumulative incidence of microcephaly over a median of 5\u00b71 years of follow-up (IQR 3\u00b70-7\u00b72) was 159 (5\u00b72%, 95% CI 4\u00b74-6\u00b71) by Nellhaus criteria and 70 (2\u00b73%, 1\u00b78-2\u00b79) by SMARTT criteria. In adjusted models, in utero exposure to efavirenz (4\u00b77% exposed) was associated with increased risk of microcephaly by both Nellhaus standards (adjusted RR 2\u00b702, 95% CI 1\u00b716-3\u00b751) and SMARTT criteria (2\u00b756, 1\u00b722-5\u00b737). These associations were more pronounced in children exposed to combination regimens of efavirenz that included zidovudine plus lamivudine than those including tenofovir plus emtricitabine. Protective associations were observed for darunavir exposure (adjusted RR 0\u00b750, 95% CI 0\u00b724-1\u00b700). Children who are HIV-exposed but uninfected with microcephaly had lower mean scores on neurodevelopmental assessments at age 1 and 5 years and a higher prevalence of neurodevelopmental impairment than those without microcephaly. INTERPRETATION: These findings support consideration of alternatives to efavirenz as part of first-line antiretroviral therapy for pregnant women.

Sporadic colorectal cancer (CRC) is a result of complex interactions between the host and its environment. Environmental stressors act by causing host cell DNA alterations implicated in the onset of cancer. Here we investigate the stressor ability of CRC-associated gut dysbiosis as causal agent of host DNA alterations. The epigenetic nature of these alterations was investigated in humans and in mice. Germ-free mice receiving fecal samples from subjects with normal colonoscopy or from CRC patients were monitored for 7 or 14 wk. Aberrant crypt foci, luminal microbiota, and DNA alterations (colonic exome sequencing and methylation patterns) were monitored following human feces transfer. CRC-associated microbiota induced higher numbers of hypermethylated genes in murine colonic mucosa (vs. healthy controls' microbiota recipients). Several gene promoters including SFRP1,2,3, PENK, NPY, ALX4, SEPT9, and WIF1 promoters were found hypermethylated in CRC but not in normal tissues or effluents from fecal donors. In a pilot study (n = 266), the blood methylation levels of 3 genes (Wif1, PENK, and NPY) were shown closely associated with CRC dysbiosis. In a validation study (n = 1,000), the cumulative methylation index (CMI) of these genes was significantly higher in CRCs than in controls. Further, CMI appeared as an independent risk factor for CRC diagnosis as shown by multivariate analysis that included fecal immunochemical blood test. Consequently, fecal bacterial species in individuals with higher CMI in blood were identified by whole metagenomic analysis. Thus, CRC-related dysbiosis induces methylation of host genes, and corresponding CMIs together with associated bacteria are potential biomarkers for CRC. ",
        "Prospective Study of Dietary Patterns and Hearing Threshold Decline. Healthier dietary patterns were associated with lower risk of self-reported hearing loss, but associations with worsening audiometric hearing thresholds have not been prospectively studied. Therefore, we conducted a prospective study among 3135 women (mean age 59 years) in the Nurses' Health Study II (2012-2018). Diet adherence scores for the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) and Alternate Mediterranean (AMED) diets and the Alternate Healthy Eating Index (AHEI-2010) were calculated using validated food-frequency questionnaires. Baseline and 3-year follow-up hearing sensitivities were assessed by pure-tone audiometry at 19 sites across the United States. Multivariable-adjusted logistic regression models examined independent associations between diet adherence scores and risk of low-frequency pure-tone average (PTA0.5,1,2 kHz), mid-frequency pure-tone average (PTA3,4 kHz), and high-frequency pure-tone average (PTA6,8 kHz) hearing threshold decline. Higher adherence scores were associated with lower risk of hearing loss. Compared with the lowest quintile of DASH score, the multivariable-adjusted odds ratios (MVORs) for mid-frequency and high-frequency decline in the highest quintile were 0.71 (95% CI:0.55,0.92; P-trend=0.003) and 0.75 (95% CI:0.59,0.96; P-trend=0.02). For AMED or AHEI scores, the MVORs for mid-frequency decline were 0.77 (95% CI:0.60,0.99; P-trend=0.02) and 0.72 (95% CI:0.57,0.92;P-trend=0.002); non-significant inverse associations were observed for high-frequency decline. There were no significant associations between adherence scores and low-frequency decline. Our findings indicate that eating a healthy diet may reduce the risk of acquired hearing loss. ",
        "The Evolving Landscape of Impella Use in the United States Among Patients Undergoing Percutaneous Coronary Intervention With Mechanical Circulatory Support. BACKGROUND: Impella was approved for mechanical circulatory support (MCS) in 2008, but large-scale, real-world data on its use are lacking. Our objective was to describe trends and variations in Impella use, clinical outcomes, and costs across US hospitals in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) treated with MCS (Impella or intra-aortic balloon pump). METHODS: From the Premier Healthcare Database, we analyzed 48\u2009306 patients undergoing PCI with MCS at 432 hospitals between January 2004 and December 2016. Association analyses were performed at 3 levels: time period, hospital, and patient. Hierarchical models with propensity adjustment were used for association analyses. We examined trends and variations in the proportion of Impella use, and associated clinical outcomes (in-hospital mortality, bleeding requiring transfusion, acute kidney injury, stroke, length of stay, and hospital costs). RESULTS: Among patients undergoing PCI treated with MCS, 4782 (9.9%) received Impella; its use increased over time, reaching 31.9% of MCS in 2016. There was wide variation in Impella use across hospitals (>5-fold variation). Specifically, among patients receiving Impella, there was a wide variation in outcomes of bleeding (>2.5-fold variation), and death, acute kidney injury, and stroke (all \u22481.5-fold variation). Adverse outcomes and costs were higher in the Impella era (years 2008-2016) versus the pre-Impella era (years 2004-2007). Hospitals with higher Impella use had higher rates of adverse outcomes and costs. After adjustment for the propensity score, and accounting for clustering of patients by hospitals, Impella use was associated with death: odds ratio, 1.24 (95% CI, 1.13-1.36); bleeding: odds ratio, 1.10 (95% CI, 1.00-1.21); and stroke: odds ratio, 1.34 (95% CI, 1.18-1.53), although a similar, nonsignificant result was observed for acute kidney injury: odds ratio, 1.08 (95% CI, 1.00-1.17). CONCLUSIONS: Impella use is rapidly increasing among patients undergoing PCI treated with MCS, with marked variability in its use and associated outcomes. Although unmeasured confounding cannot be ruled out, when analyzed by time periods, or at the hospital level or the patient level, Impella use was associated with higher rates of adverse events and costs. More data are needed to define the appropriate role of MCS in patients undergoing PCI. ",
        "Life-long epigenetic programming of cortical architecture by maternal 'Western' diet during pregnancy. The evolution of human diets led to preferences toward polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) content with 'Western' diets enriched in \u03c9-6 PUFAs. Mounting evidence points to \u03c9-6 PUFA excess limiting metabolic and cognitive processes that define longevity in humans. When chosen during pregnancy, \u03c9-6 PUFA-enriched 'Western' diets can reprogram maternal bodily metabolism with maternal nutrient supply precipitating the body-wide imprinting of molecular and cellular adaptations at the level of long-range intercellular signaling networks in the unborn fetus. Even though unfavorable neurological outcomes are amongst the most common complications of intrauterine \u03c9-6 PUFA excess, cellular underpinnings of life-long modifications to brain architecture remain unknown. Here, we show that nutritional \u03c9-6 PUFA-derived endocannabinoids desensitize CB1 cannabinoid receptors, thus inducing epigenetic repression of transcriptional regulatory networks controlling neuronal differentiation. We found that cortical neurons lose their positional identity and axonal selectivity when mouse fetuses are exposed to excess \u03c9-6 PUFAs in utero. Conversion of \u03c9-6 PUFAs into endocannabinoids disrupted the temporal precision of signaling at neuronal CB1 cannabinoid receptors, chiefly deregulating Stat3-dependent transcriptional cascades otherwise required to execute neuronal differentiation programs. Global proteomics identified the immunoglobulin family of cell adhesion molecules (IgCAMs) as direct substrates, with DNA methylation and chromatin accessibility profiling uncovering epigenetic reprogramming at >1400 sites in neurons after prolonged cannabinoid exposure. We found anxiety and depression-like behavioral traits to manifest in adult offspring, which is consistent with genetic models of reduced IgCAM expression, to suggest causality for cortical wiring defects. Overall, our data uncover a regulatory mechanism whose disruption by maternal food choices could limit an offspring's brain function for life. ",
        "Effect of Internet-Distributed HIV Self-tests on HIV Diagnosis and Behavioral Outcomes in Men Who Have Sex With Men: A Randomized Clinical Trial. Importance: Undiagnosed HIV infection results in delayed access to treatment and increased transmission. Self-tests for HIV may increase awareness of infection among men who have sex with men (MSM). Objective: To evaluate the effect of providing HIV self-tests on frequency of testing, diagnoses of HIV infection, and sexual risk behaviors. Design, Setting, and Participants: This 12-month longitudinal, 2-group randomized clinical trial recruited MSM through online banner advertisements from March through August 2015. Those recruited were at least 18 years of age, reported engaging in anal sex with men in the past year, never tested positive for HIV, and were US residents with mailing addresses. Participants completed quarterly online surveys. Telephone call notes and laboratory test results were included in the analysis, which was completed from August 2017 through December 2018. Interventions: All participants had access to online web-based HIV testing resources and telephone counseling on request. Participants were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to the control group or a self-testing (ST) group, which received 4 HIV self-tests after completing the baseline survey with the option to replenish self-tests after completing quarterly surveys. At study completion, all participants were offered 2 self-tests and 1 dried blood spot collection kit. Main Outcomes and Measures: Primary outcomes were HIV testing frequency (tested \u22653 times during the trial) and number of newly identified HIV infections among participants in both groups and social network members who used the study HIV self-tests. Secondary outcomes included sex behaviors (eg, anal sex, serosorting). Results: Of 2665 participants, the mean (SD) age was 30 (9.6) years, 1540 (57.8%) were white, and 443 (16.6%) had never tested for HIV before enrollment. Retention rates at each time point were more than 54%, and 1991 (74.7%) participants initiated 1 or more follow-up surveys. More ST participants reported testing 3 or more times during the trial than control participants (777 of 1014 [76.6%] vs 215 of 977 [22.0%]; P\u2009<\u2009.01). The cumulative number of newly identified infections during the trial was twice as high in the ST participants as the control participants (25 of 1325 [1.9%] vs 11 of 1340 [0.8%]; P\u2009=\u2009.02), with the largest difference in HIV infections identified in the first 3 months (12 of 1325 [0.9%] vs 2 of 1340 [0.1%]; P\u2009<\u2009.01). The ST participants reported 34 newly identified infections among social network members who used the self-tests. Conclusions and Relevance: Distribution of HIV self-tests provides a worthwhile mechanism to increase awareness of HIV infection and prevent transmission among MSM.

        "Treatment of Drug-Resistant Tuberculosis. An Official ATS/CDC/ERS/IDSA Clinical Practice Guideline. Background: The American Thoracic Society, U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, European Respiratory Society, and Infectious Diseases Society of America jointly sponsored this new practice guideline on the treatment of drug-resistant tuberculosis (DR-TB). The document includes recommendations on the treatment of multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) as well as isoniazid-resistant but rifampin-susceptible TB.Methods: Published systematic reviews, meta-analyses, and a new individual patient data meta-analysis from 12,030 patients, in 50 studies, across 25 countries with confirmed pulmonary rifampin-resistant TB were used for this guideline. Meta-analytic approaches included propensity score matching to reduce confounding. Each recommendation was discussed by an expert committee, screened for conflicts of interest, according to the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology.Results: Twenty-one Population, Intervention, Comparator, and Outcomes questions were addressed, generating 25 GRADE-based recommendations. Certainty in the evidence was judged to be very low, because the data came from observational studies with significant loss to follow-up and imbalance in background regimens between comparator groups. Good practices in the management of MDR-TB are described. On the basis of the evidence review, a clinical strategy tool for building a treatment regimen for MDR-TB is also provided.Conclusions: New recommendations are made for the choice and number of drugs in a regimen, the duration of intensive and continuation phases, and the role of injectable drugs for MDR-TB. On the basis of these recommendations, an effective all-oral regimen for MDR-TB can be assembled. Recommendations are also provided on the role of surgery in treatment of MDR-TB and for treatment of contacts exposed to MDR-TB and treatment of isoniazid-resistant TB. ",
        "Air Quality and Health Impact of Future Fossil Fuel Use for Electricity Generation and Transport in Africa. Africa has ambitious plans to address energy deficits and sustain economic growth with fossil fueled power plants. The continent is also experiencing faster population growth than anywhere else in the world that will lead to proliferation of vehicles. Here, we estimate air pollutant emissions in Africa from future (2030) electricity generation and transport. We find that annual emissions of two precursors of fine particles (PM2.5) hazardous to health, sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NO.                         x.                     ), approximately double by 2030 relative to 2012, increasing from 2.5 to 5.5 Tg SO2 and 1.5 to 2.8 Tg NO.                         x.                     . We embed these emissions in the GEOS-Chem model nested over the African continent to simulate ambient concentrations of PM2.5 and determine the burden of disease (excess deaths) attributable to exposure to future fossil fuel use. We calculate 48000 avoidable deaths in 2030 (95% confidence interval: 6000-88000), mostly in South Africa (10400), Nigeria (7500), and Malawi (2400), with 3-times higher mortality rates from power plants than transport. Sensitivity of the burden of disease to either population growth or air quality varies regionally and suggests that emission mitigation strategies would be most effective in Southern Africa, whereas population growth is the main driver everywhere else.

        "Mitoautophagy: A Unique Self-Destructive Path Mitochondria of Upper Motor Neurons With TDP-43 Pathology Take, Very Early in ALS. Mitochondrial dysfunction is one of the converging paths for many neurodegenerative diseases, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and TDP-43 pathology is the most common proteinopathy detected in ALS and ALS/Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (ALS/FTLD). We recently identified mitochondrial problems in corticospinal motor neurons (CSMN) and in Betz cells of patients with TDP-43 pathology. However, the timing and the extent of mitochondrial defects, and their mode of degeneration have not been revealed. Because it is important to reveal when problems first begin to emerge and whether they are shared or unique, we investigated the health and integrity of mitochondria in CSMN of prpTDP-43A315T, PFN1G118V, and hSOD1G93A mice at P15 (post-natal day 15)-a very early age in mice without any sign of cellular degeneration.Utilization of immuno-coupled electron microscopy for a detailed surveillance of mitochondria in CSMN and other non-CSMN cells revealed presence of a novel self-destructive path of mitochondrial degeneration, which we named mitoautophagy. Mitoauthopgy is different from mitophagy, as it does not require autophagosome-mediated degradation. In contrast, in this novel path, mitochondria can clear themselves independently. We find that even at this early age, all diseased CSMN begin to display mitochondrial defects, whereas mitochondria in non-CSMN cells are healthy. Our findings not only reveal mitoautophagy as a novel path of mitochondrial clearance that occurs prior to neuronal vulnerability, but it also highlights that it is present mainly in the upper motor neurons of prpTDP-43A315T and PFN1G118V mice, which mimic many aspects of the disease in patients with TDP-43 pathology.

        "Impacts of environmental and socio-economic factors on emergence and epidemic potential of Ebola in Africa. Recent outbreaks of animal-borne emerging infectious diseases have likely been precipitated by a complex interplay of changing ecological, epidemiological and socio-economic factors. Here, we develop modelling methods that capture elements of each of these factors, to predict the risk of Ebola virus disease (EVD) across time and space. Our modelling results match previously-observed outbreak patterns with high accuracy, and suggest further outbreaks could occur across most of West and Central Africa. Trends in the underlying drivers of EVD risk suggest a 1.75 to 3.2-fold increase in the endemic rate of animal-human viral spill-overs in Africa by 2070, given current modes of healthcare intervention. Future global change scenarios with higher human population growth and lower rates of socio-economic development yield a fourfold higher likelihood of epidemics occurring as a result of spill-over events. Our modelling framework can be used to target interventions designed to reduce epidemic risk for many zoonotic diseases. ",
        "Distinct trajectories of long-term symptom severity in pediatric obsessive-compulsive disorder during and after stepped-care treatment. BACKGROUND: First-line treatments for pediatric obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) include exposure-based cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). No studies have thus far identified distinct classes and associated predictors of long-term symptom severity during and after treatment. Yet, these could form the basis for more personalized treatment in pediatric OCD. METHOD: The study included 269 OCD patients aged 7-17\u00a0years from the Nordic Long-term OCD Treatment Study (NordLOTS). All participants received stepped-care treatment starting with 14 weekly sessions of manualized CBT. Nonresponders were randomized to either prolonged CBT or SSRIs. Symptom severity was assessed using the Children's Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale at seven time points from pre- to post-treatment and over a three-year follow-up. Latent class growth analysis (LCGA) was performed to identify latent classes of symptom severity trajectories. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to detect differences between classes and identify predictors of trajectory class membership including several clinical and demographic variables. TRIAL REGISTRY: Nordic Long-term Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) Treatment Study; www.controlled-trials.com; ISRCTN66385119. RESULTS: Three LCGA classes were identified: (a) acute, sustained responders (54.6%); (b) slow, continued responders (23.4%); and (c) limited long-term responders (21.9%). Class membership was predicted by distinct baseline characteristics pertaining to age, symptom severity, contamination/cleaning and anxiety symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: The LCGA suggests three distinct trajectory classes of long-term symptom severity during and after treatment in pediatric OCD with different clinical profiles at pretreatment. The results point to required clinical attention for adolescent patients with contamination/cleaning and anxiety symptoms who do not show convincing responses to first-line treatment even though they may have reached the established cutoff for treatment response.

        "#MedToo: A Large-Scale Examination of the Incidence and Impact of Sexual Harassment of Physicians and Other Faculty at an Academic Medical Center. .                         Background:.                      A landmark National Academies report highlighted the need for rigorous evaluation of sexual harassment in medicine. We examined the prevalence and impact of sexual harassment using the Sexual Experiences Questionnaire, the standard for measurement of sexual harassment, but which has not been previously applied within academic medicine. .                         Materials and Methods:.                      A 20-minute online survey was administered to all faculty who had been working at University of Michigan Medical School for at least 1 year (n\u2009=\u20092723). We assessed sexual harassment within the past year from insiders (i.e., from staff, students, and faculty) and from patients and patients' families. We also evaluated mental health, job satisfaction, sense of safety at work, and turnover intentions. .                         Results:.                      In the final sample (n\u2009=\u2009705; which included 25.9% of the originally targeted population), most respondents, 82.5% of women and 65.1% of men, reported at least one incident of sexual harassment from insiders in the past year; 64.4% of women and 44.1% of men reported harassment from patients and patients' families. The most frequently experienced dimension of sexual harassment for women and men was sexist gender harassment. Increased experiences of harassment were independently associated with lower mental health, job satisfaction, and sense of safety at work, as well as increased turnover intentions, with no significant interactions by gender. .                         Conclusions:.                      Sexual harassment against medical faculty is alarmingly common at an institution that is not expected to be atypical. Interventions must address sexual harassment, which affects mental health and career outcomes of male and female physicians. ",
        "Impact of Wartime Stress Exposures and Mental Health on Later-Life Functioning and Disability in Vietnam-Era Women Veterans: Findings From the Health of Vietnam-Era Women's Study. OBJECTIVE: The effect of stress exposures and mental health sequelae on health-related outcomes is understudied among older women veterans. We examined a) the impact of wartime stress exposures on later-life functioning and disability in Vietnam-era women veterans and b) the extent to which mental health conditions known to be associated with stress-posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), major depressive disorder (MDD), and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD)-are associated with additional later-life functioning and disability. METHODS: Data were collected in 2011 to 2012 using a mail survey and telephone interview of 4219 women veterans who were active duty during the Vietnam Era. Health functioning was assessed using the Veterans RAND 36-Item Health Survey, and disability was assessed using the World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule 2.0. Wartime exposures were assessed using the Women's War-Zone Stressor Scale-Revised; the Composite International Diagnostic Interview, version 3.0 was used to assess PTSD, MDD, and GAD. RESULTS: Several wartime stress exposures-including job-related pressures, dealing with death, and sexual discrimination and harassment-were associated with worse later-life health (\u03b2 ranges, -0.04 to -0.26 for functioning, 0.05 to 0.30 for disability). Current PTSD was linked with lower health functioning (physical, \u03b2 = -0.06; mental, \u03b2 = -0.15) and greater disability (\u03b2 = 0.14). Current MDD and GAD were also associated with lower mental health functioning (MDD, \u03b2 = -0.29; GAD, \u03b2 = -0.10) and greater disability (MDD, \u03b2 = 0.16; GAD, \u03b2 = 0.06). CONCLUSIONS: Results underscore the importance of detection and treatment of the potential long-term effects of wartime stressors and mental health conditions among women veterans. ",
        "A Platform for Generation of Chamber-Specific Cardiac Tissues and Disease Modeling. Tissue engineering using cardiomyocytes derived from human pluripotent stem cells holds a promise\u00a0to revolutionize drug discovery, but only if limitations related to cardiac chamber specification and platform versatility can be overcome. We describe here a scalable tissue-cultivation platform that is cell source agnostic and enables drug testing under electrical pacing. The plastic platform enabled on-line noninvasive recording of passive tension, active force, contractile dynamics, and Ca2+ transients, as well as endpoint assessments of action potentials and conduction velocity. By combining directed cell differentiation with electrical field conditioning, we engineered electrophysiologically distinct atrial and ventricular tissues with\u00a0chamber-specific drug responses and gene expression. We report, for the first time, engineering of heteropolar cardiac tissues containing distinct atrial and ventricular ends, and we demonstrate their spatially confined responses to serotonin and ranolazine. Uniquely, electrical conditioning for up to\u00a08\u00a0months enabled modeling of polygenic left ventricular hypertrophy starting from patient cells. ",
        "Expanding the limits of the second genetic code with ribozymes. The site-specific incorporation of noncanonical monomers into polypeptides through genetic code reprogramming permits synthesis of bio-based products that extend beyond natural limits. To better enable such efforts, flexizymes (transfer RNA (tRNA) synthetase-like ribozymes that recognize synthetic leaving groups) have been used to expand the scope of chemical substrates for ribosome-directed polymerization. The development of design rules for flexizyme-catalyzed acylation should allow scalable and rational expansion of genetic code reprogramming. Here we report the\u00a0systematic synthesis of 37 substrates based on 4 chemically diverse scaffolds (phenylalanine, benzoic acid, heteroaromatic, and aliphatic monomers) with different electronic and steric factors. Of these substrates, 32 were acylated onto tRNA and incorporated into peptides by in vitro translation. Based on the design rules derived from this expanded alphabet, we successfully predicted the acylation of 6 additional monomers that could uniquely be incorporated into peptides and direct N-terminal incorporation of an aldehyde group for orthogonal bioconjugation reactions.

        "Notch signalling in cervical cancer. The initial discovery of key developmental signalling pathways, largely using classical genetic approaches in model organisms, was followed by an intense burst of characterisation of the molecular components. Studies also began demonstrating a role for these pathways in oncogenesis. Patterns of mutations in Notch pathway components, such as those reported in subsets of hematological malignancies, have been easier to study, and the cumulative information is leading to potentially new therapies. However, it has been more challenging to clearly define the role of the Notch pathway in human solid tumours, given the absence of widespread specific activating or repressive mutations in key components of the pathway. In this review, we trace more than two decades of work looking at the role of Notch signalling in human cervical cancer progression. We document the contrasting reports on a tumour suppressive role and pro-oncogenic role in cervical cancers. However, an analysis of recent genomic data strikingly shows both widespread features of Notch expression and genetic changes that largely amplify positive regulators and delete negative controllers of the Notch pathway. This analysis reinforces a largely pro-oncogenic role for Notch signalling and lays the foundation for a nuanced exploration of synergistic and targeted therapies. Lastly, we further trace some of the complex challenges in advanced cervical cancer progression, including issues of cancer stem cells and metastasis. ",
        "Ammonia Levels Do Not Guide Clinical Management of Patients With Hepatic Encephalopathy Caused by Cirrhosis. INTRODUCTION: Ammonia appears to play a major role in the pathophysiology of hepatic encephalopathy (HE), but its role in guiding management is unclear. We aimed to understand the impact of ammonia levels on inpatient HE management, hypothesizing that patients with elevated ammonia levels would receive more aggressive lactulose therapy than patients with normal ammonia or no ammonia level drawn. METHODS: We examined patients with cirrhosis older than 18 years admitted for management of HE from 2005 to 2015. We additionally used propensity matching to control for confounding by the severity of underlying disease. Patients with an ammonia level taken at time of HE diagnosis were further separated into those with normal or elevated ammonia levels. The primary endpoint was the total lactulose (mL) amount (or dose) given in the first 48 hours of HE management. RESULTS: One thousand two hundred two admissions with HE were identified. Ammonia levels were drawn in 551 (46%) patients; 328 patients (60%) had an abnormal ammonia level (>72 \u03bcmol/L). There were no significant differences in the Child-Pugh score, MELD, or Charlson Comorbidity Index in those with and without ammonia levels drawn. The average total lactulose dose over 48 hours was 167 and 171 mL in the no ammonia vs ammonia groups, respectively (P = 0.42). The average lactulose dose in patients with an elevated ammonia level was 161 mL, identical to the lactulose dose in patients with a normal ammonia level. There was no correlation between lactulose dose and ammonia level (R = 0.0026). DISCUSSION: Inpatient management of HE with lactulose was not influenced by either the presence or level of ammonia level, suggesting that ammonia levels do not guide therapy in clinical practice. ",
        "Alarm Settings of Continuous Glucose Monitoring Systems and Associations to Glucose Outcomes in Type 1 Diabetes. Context: Little evidence exists regarding the positive and negative impacts of continuous glucose monitor system (CGM) alarm settings for diabetes control in patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D). Objective: Evaluate the associations between CGM alarm settings and glucose outcomes. Design and Setting: A cross-sectional observational study in a single academic institution. Patients and Main Outcome Measures: CGM alarm settings and 2-week CGM glucose information were collected from 95 T1D patients with > 3 months of CGM use and \u2265 86% active usage time. The associations between CGM alarm settings and glucose outcomes were analyzed. Results: Higher glucose thresholds for hypoglycemia alarms (ie, \u2265 73 mg/dL vs < 73 mg/dL) were related to 51% and 65% less time with glucose < 70 and < 54 mg/dL, respectively (P = 0.005; P = 0.016), higher average glucose levels (P = 0.002) and less time-in-range (P = 0.005), but not more hypoglycemia alarms. The optimal alarm threshold for < 1% of time in hypoglycemia was 75 mg/dL.Lower glucose thresholds for hyperglycemia alarms (ie, \u2264 205 mg/dL vs > 205 mg/dL) were related to lower average glucose levels and 42% and 61% less time with glucose > 250 and > 320 mg/dL (P = 0.020, P = 0.016, P = 0.007, respectively), without more hypoglycemia. Lower alarm thresholds were also associated with more alarms (P < 0.0001). The optimal alarm threshold for < 5% of time in hyperglycemia and hemoglobin A1c \u2264 7% was 170 mg/dL. Conclusions: Different CGM glucose thresholds for hypo/hyperglycemia alarms are associated with various hypo/hyperglycemic outcomes. Configurations to the hypo/hyperglycemia alarm thresholds could be considered as an intervention to achieve therapeutic goals. ",
        "Epigenetic SMAD3 Repression in Tumor-Associated Fibroblasts Impairs Fibrosis and Response to the Antifibrotic Drug Nintedanib in Lung Squamous Cell Carcinoma. The tumor-promoting fibrotic stroma rich in tumor-associated fibroblasts (TAF) is drawing increased therapeutic attention. Intriguingly, a trial with the antifibrotic drug nintedanib in non-small cell lung cancer reported clinical benefits in adenocarcinoma (ADC) but not squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), even though the stroma is fibrotic in both histotypes. Likewise, we reported that nintedanib inhibited the tumor-promoting fibrotic phenotype of TAFs selectively in ADC. Here we show that tumor fibrosis is actually higher in ADC-TAFs than SCC-TAFs in vitro and patient samples. Mechanistically, the reduced fibrosis and nintedanib response of SCC-TAFs was associated with increased promoter methylation of the profibrotic TGF\u03b2 transcription factor SMAD3 compared with ADC-TAFs, which elicited a compensatory increase in TGF\u03b21/SMAD2 activation. Consistently, forcing global DNA demethylation of SCC-TAFs with 5-AZA rescued TGF\u03b21/SMAD3 activation, whereas genetic downregulation of SMAD3 in ADC-TAFs and control fibroblasts increased TGF\u03b21/SMAD2 activation, and reduced their fibrotic phenotype and antitumor responses to nintedanib in vitro and in vivo. Our results also support that smoking and/or the anatomic location of SCC in the proximal airways, which are more exposed to cigarette smoke particles, may prime SCC-TAFs to stronger SMAD3 epigenetic repression, because cigarette smoke condensate selectively increased SMAD3 promoter methylation. Our results unveil that the histotype-specific regulation of tumor fibrosis in lung cancer is mediated through differential SMAD3 promoter methylation in TAFs and provide new mechanistic insights on the selective poor response of SCC-TAFs to nintedanib. Moreover, our findings support that patients with ADC may be more responsive to antifibrotic drugs targeting their stromal TGF\u03b21/SMAD3 activation. SIGNIFICANCE: This study implicates the selective epigenetic repression of SMAD3 in SCC-TAFs in the clinical failure of nintedanib in SCC and supports that patients with ADC may benefit from antifibrotic drugs targeting stromal TGF\u03b21/SMAD3.

        "The effects of integrating behavioral health into primary care for low-income children. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the impact of TEAM UP-an initiative that fully integrates behavioral health services into pediatric primary care in three Boston-area Community Health Centers (CHCs)-on health care utilization and costs. DATA SOURCES: 2014-2017 claims data on continuously enrolled children from a Massachusetts Medicaid managed care plan. STUDY DESIGN: We used a difference-in-difference approach with inverse probability of treatment weights to compare outcomes in children receiving primary care at TEAM UP CHCs versus comparison site CHCs, in the pre (2014-2016q2)- versus post (2016q3-2017)-intervention periods. Utilization outcomes included emergency department visits, inpatient admissions, primary care visits, and outpatient/professional visits (all cause and those with mental health (MH) diagnoses). Cost outcomes included total cost of care (inpatient, outpatient, professional, pharmacy). We further assessed differential effects by baseline MH diagnosis. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: After 1.5\u00a0years, TEAM UP was associated with a relative increase in the rate of primary care visits (IRR\u00a0=\u00a01.15, 95% CI 1.04-1.27, or 115 additional visits/1000 patients/quarter), driven by children with a MH diagnosis at baseline. There was no significant change in avoidable health care utilization or cost. CONCLUSIONS: Expanding the TEAM UP behavioral health integration model to other sites has the potential to improve primary care engagement in low-income children with MH needs. ",
        "Multiplexed activation of endogenous genes by CRISPRa elicits potent antitumor immunity. Immunotherapy has transformed cancer treatment. However, current immunotherapy modalities face various limitations. In the present study, we developed multiplexed activation of endogenous genes as an immunotherapy (MAEGI), a new form of immunotherapy that elicits antitumor immunity through multiplexed activation of endogenous genes in tumors. We leveraged CRISPR activation (CRISPRa) to directly augment the in situ expression of endogenous genes, and thereby the presentation of tumor antigens, leading to dramatic antitumor immune responses. Deploying this as a cell-based vaccination strategy showed efficacy in both prophylactic and therapeutic settings. Intratumoral adeno-associated virus delivery of CRISPRa libraries elicited strong antitumor immunity across multiple cancer types. Precision targeting of mutated gene sets eradicated a large fraction of established tumors at both local and distant sites. This treatment modality led to alterations in the tumor microenvironment, marked by enhanced T cell infiltration and antitumor immune signatures. Multiplexed endogenous gene activation is a versatile and highly scalable strategy to elicit potent immune responses against cancer, distinct from all existing cancer therapies. ",
        "Sex and Individual Differences in Alcohol Intake Are Associated with Differences in Ketamine Self-Administration Behaviors and Nucleus Accumbens Dendritic Spine Density. Clinical and preclinical studies have shown that ketamine, an NMDA receptor antagonist, has promising therapeutic value for the treatment of alcohol use disorder (AUD). However, the maintenance of remission will ultimately require repeated infusions of ketamine, which may lead to abuse potential and may hinder its therapeutic benefits. It is therefore crucial to assess the effects of repeated treatments with ketamine on alcohol intake. Accordingly, this study aimed to examine in both sexes how individual differences in alcohol intake alter ketamine self-administration and how ketamine self-administration will alter subsequent alcohol-drinking behaviors. Male and female rats intermittently drank alcohol or water for 10 weeks and were divided into high- or low-alcohol intake groups prior to ketamine self-administration. Rats self-administered ketamine under fixed and progressive ratio schedules of reinforcement from week 4 to 7, and the incubation of ketamine craving was examined from week 8 to 10. To investigate structural plasticity in a brain region involved in reward, nucleus accumbens dendritic spine morphology was examined. Our results show that high alcohol intake in male rats attenuated ketamine self-administration, whereas in female rats high alcohol intake enhanced motivation to self-administer ketamine. Ketamine reduced alcohol intake in high-alcohol male rats but increased it in low-alcohol female rats. Incubation of ketamine craving developed in all groups except low-alcohol females. Three weeks of abstinence from ketamine was associated with increased mushroom spines in all groups except the high-alcohol male group. Overall, these data suggest that ketamine as a treatment for AUD may benefit male subjects, but not female subjects, and warrants further investigation before use as a therapeutic agent. ",
        "Catatonia in Down syndrome: systematic approach to diagnosis, treatment and outcome assessment based on a case series of seven patients. Objective: The goal is to expand our knowledge of catatonia occurring in adolescents and young adults with Down syndrome (DS) by describing the first prospective, consecutive, well-characterized cohort of seven young people with DS diagnosed with catatonia and treated between 2013 and 2018, and to assess each patient's treatment responses. Longitudinal assessment of each patient's response to treatment is intended to provide clinicians and psychiatrists a firm foundation from which assess treatment efficacy. Study design: Young adults with Down syndrome were consecutively enrolled in the study as they were diagnosed with catatonia. A comprehensive data set included medical, laboratory, developmental, demographic, family, social and genetic data, including query into disorders for which individuals with DS are at risk. Catatonia was diagnosed based on an unequivocal history of regression, positive Bush-Francis Catatonia Rating Scale and positive response to intravenous lorazepam. Patients' longitudinal progress was monitored using the Catatonia Impact Scale (CIS) developed for this purpose. Results: Seven consecutive DS patients, who presented with unequivocal regression were diagnosed with catatonia and treated for 2.7-6\u00a0years using standard-of-care therapies; primarily GABA agonist, lorazepam, electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) and glutamate antagonists (dextromethorphan/quinidine, memantine, minocycline). Responses to each treatment modality were assessed at clinic visits and through weekly electronic CIS reports. Conclusion: Seven young adults with DS were diagnosed with catatonia; all responded to Lorazepam and/or ECT therapy with good to very good results. Though ECT most dramatically returned patients to baseline, symptoms often returned requiring additional ECT. Dextromethorphan/quinidine, not used until mid-2017, appeared to reduce the reoccurrence of symptoms following ECT. Though all seven patients improved significantly, each continues to require some form of treatment to maintain a good level of functioning. Findings of a significant number of autoimmune disorders and laboratory markers of immune activation in this population may guide new diagnostic and treatment opportunities. ",
        "From surviving to thriving: factors associated with complete mental health among childhood sexual abuse survivors. BACKGROUND: Despite many negative health and social consequences of childhood sexual abuse (CSA), some of those with a history of adversity manage to thrive in adulthood and achieve complete mental health (CMH). CMH is defined as the absence of mental illness in combination with almost daily happiness and/or life satisfaction, as well as high levels of social and psychological well-being. The objectives of this study were (1) to identify the pathways linking CSA to CMH in adulthood and (2) to estimate the magnitude of risk and protective factors associated with CMH among those exposed to CSA. METHODS: A sample of 17,014 respondents aged 20\u00a0years and older from the 2012 Canadian Community Health Survey-Mental Health was selected including 651 with a history of CSA. Path analysis was used to estimate indirect and direct pathways between CSA, a priori hypothesized risk and protective factors, and CMH. Multivariable logistic regression was then used to investigate the magnitude of effects of the same risk and protective factors on CMH among CSA survivors. RESULTS: After controlling for age, sex, race, education, and marital status, the association between CSA and CMH was mediated by lifetime depression, anxiety, substance abuse, chronic pain, and having a confidant. The strongest predictor of past-year CMH among those with a history of CSA was lifetime depression (OR 0.12, 95% CI 0.07-0.20) followed by having a confidant (OR 6.78, 95% CI 1.89-24.38). The odds of CMH was decreased by over three times among those with a history of substance misuse, and halved for those with lifetime anxiety and/or presence of pain. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that CMH among survivors of CSA is related to social and emotional factors such as social support and lifetime\u00a0history of mental health conditions. Future research should investigate the effectiveness of multilevel interventions for promoting recovery among CSA survivors. ",
        "Analysis of nonstandardized stress echocardiography sequences using multiview dimensionality reduction. Alternative stress echocardiography protocols such as handgrip exercise are potentially more favorable towards large-scale screening scenarios than those currently adopted in clinical practice. However, these are still underexplored because the maximal exercise levels are not easily quantified and regulated, requiring the analysis of the complete data sequences (thousands of images), which represents a challenging task for the clinician. We propose a framework for the analysis of these complex datasets, and illustrate it on a handgrip exercise dataset including complete acquisitions of 10 healthy controls and 5 ANT1 mutation patients (1377 cardiac cycles). The framework is based on an unsupervised formulation of multiple kernel learning, which is used to integrate information coming from myocardial velocity traces and heart rate to obtain a lower-dimensional representation of the data. Such simplified representation is then explored to discriminate groups of response and understand the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms. The analysis pipeline involves the reconstruction of population-specific signatures using multiscale kernel regression, and the clustering of subjects based on the trajectories defined by their projected sequences. The results confirm that the proposed framework is able to detect distinctive clusters of response and to provide insight regarding the underlying pathophysiology. ",
        "BacFITBase: a database to assess the relevance of bacterial genes during host infection. Bacterial infections have been on the rise world-wide in recent years and have a considerable impact on human well-being in terms of attributable deaths and disability-adjusted life years. Yet many mechanisms underlying bacterial pathogenesis are still poorly understood. Here, we introduce the BacFITBase database for the systematic characterization of bacterial proteins relevant for host infection aimed to enable the identification of new antibiotic targets. BacFITBase is manually curated and contains more than 90 000 entries with information on the contribution of individual genes to bacterial fitness under in vivo infection conditions in a range of host species. The data were collected from 15 different studies in which transposon mutagenesis was performed, including top-priority pathogens such as Acinetobacter baumannii and Campylobacter jejuni, for both of which increasing antibiotic resistance has been reported. Overall, BacFITBase includes information on 15 pathogenic bacteria and 5 host vertebrates across 10 different tissues. It is freely available at www.tartaglialab.com/bacfitbase. ",
        "Mechanical segregation and capturing of clonal circulating plasma cells in multiple myeloma using micropillar-integrated microfluidic device. Multiple myeloma (MM), the disorder of plasma cells, is the second most common type of hematological cancer and is responsible for approximately 20% of deaths from hematological malignancies. The current gold standard for MM diagnosis includes invasive bone marrow aspiration. However, it lacks the sensitivity to detect minimal residual disease, and the nonuniform distribution of clonal plasma cells (CPCs) within bone marrow also often results in inaccurate reporting. Serum and urine assessment of monoclonal proteins, such as Kappa light chains, is another commonly used approach for MM diagnosis. Although it is noninvasive, the level of paraprotein elevation is still too low for detecting minimal residual disease and nonsecretive MM. Circulating CPCs (cCPCs) have been reported to be present in the peripheral blood of MM patients, and high levels of cCPCs were shown to correlate with poor survival. This suggests a potential noninvasive approach for MM disease progress monitoring and prognosis. In this study, we developed a mechanical property-based microfluidic platform to capture cCPCs. Using human myeloma cancer cell lines spiked in healthy donor blood, the microfluidic platform demonstrates high enrichment ratio (>500) and sufficient capture efficiency (40%-55%). Patient samples were also assessed to investigate the diagnostic potential of cCPCs for MM by correlating with the levels of Kappa light chains in patients. ",
        "Effect of Ubrogepant vs Placebo on Pain and the Most Bothersome Associated Symptom in the Acute Treatment of Migraine: The ACHIEVE II Randomized Clinical Trial. Importance: Ubrogepant is an oral calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor antagonist under investigation for acute treatment of migraine. Objective: To evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of ubrogepant compared with placebo for acute treatment of a single migraine attack. Design, Setting, and Participants: Phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single-attack, clinical trial (ACHIEVE II) conducted in the United States (99 primary care and research clinics; August 26, 2016-February 26, 2018). Participants were adults with migraine with or without aura experiencing 2 to 8 migraine attacks per month. Interventions: Ubrogepant 50 mg (n\u2009=\u2009562), ubrogepant 25 mg (n\u2009=\u2009561), or placebo (n\u2009=\u2009563) for a migraine attack of moderate or severe pain intensity. Main Outcomes and Measures: Co-primary efficacy outcomes were pain freedom and absence of the participant-designated most bothersome migraine-associated symptom (among photophobia, phonophobia, and nausea) at 2 hours after taking the medication. Results: Among 1686 randomized participants, 1465 received study treatment (safety population; mean age, 41.5 years; 90% female); 1355 of 1465 (92.5%) were evaluable for efficacy. Pain freedom at 2 hours was reported by 101 of 464 participants (21.8%) in the ubrogepant 50-mg group, 90 of 435 (20.7%) in the ubrogepant 25-mg group, and 65 of 456 (14.3%) in the placebo group (absolute difference for 50 mg vs placebo, 7.5%; 95% CI, 2.6%-12.5%; P\u2009=\u2009.01; 25 mg vs placebo, 6.4%; 95% CI, 1.5%-11.5%; P\u2009=\u2009.03). Absence of the most bothersome associated symptom at 2 hours was reported by 180 of 463 participants (38.9%) in the ubrogepant 50-mg group, 148 of 434 (34.1%) in the ubrogepant 25-mg group, and 125 of 456 (27.4%) in the placebo group (absolute difference for 50 mg vs placebo, 11.5%; 95% CI, 5.4%-17.5%; P\u2009=\u2009.01; 25 mg vs placebo, 6.7%; 95% CI, 0.6%-12.7%; P\u2009=\u2009.07). The most common adverse events within 48 hours of any dose were nausea (50 mg, 10 of 488 [2.0%]; 25 mg, 12 of 478 [2.5%]; and placebo, 10 of 499 [2.0%]) and dizziness (50 mg, 7 of 488 [1.4%]; 25 mg, 10 of 478 [2.1%]; placebo, 8 of 499 [1.6%]). Conclusions and Relevance: Among adults with migraine, acute treatment with ubrogepant compared with placebo led to significantly greater rates of pain freedom at 2 hours with 50-mg and 25-mg doses, and absence of the most bothersome migraine-associated symptom at 2 hours only with the 50-mg dose. Further research is needed to assess the effectiveness of ubrogepant against other acute treatments for migraine and to evaluate the long-term safety of ubrogepant among unselected patient populations.

        "Glassy carbon microelectrodes minimize induced voltages, mechanical vibrations, and artifacts in magnetic resonance imaging. The recent introduction of glassy carbon (GC) microstructures supported on flexible polymeric substrates has motivated the adoption of GC in a variety of implantable and wearable devices. Neural probes such as electrocorticography and penetrating shanks with GC microelectrode arrays used for neural signal recording and electrical stimulation are among the first beneficiaries of this technology. With the expected proliferation of these neural probes and potential clinical adoption, the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) compatibility of GC microstructures needs to be established to help validate this potential in clinical settings. Here, we present GC microelectrodes and microstructures-fabricated through the carbon micro-electro-mechanical systems process and supported on flexible polymeric substrates-and carry out experimental measurements of induced vibrations, eddy currents, and artifacts. Through induced vibration, induced voltage, and MRI experiments and finite element modeling, we compared the performances of these GC microelectrodes against those of conventional thin-film platinum (Pt) microelectrodes and established that GC microelectrodes demonstrate superior magnetic resonance compatibility over standard metal thin-film microelectrodes. Specifically, we demonstrated that GC microelectrodes experienced no considerable vibration deflection amplitudes and minimal induced currents, while Pt microelectrodes had significantly larger currents. We also showed that because of their low magnetic susceptibility and lower conductivity, the GC microelectrodes caused almost no susceptibility shift artifacts and no eddy-current-induced artifacts compared to Pt microelectrodes. Taken together, the experimental, theoretical, and finite element modeling establish that GC microelectrodes exhibit significant MRI compatibility, hence demonstrating clear clinical advantages over current conventional thin-film materials, further opening avenues for wider adoption of GC microelectrodes in chronic clinical applications.

        "Musculoskeletal Pain, Physical Function, and Quality of Life After Bariatric Surgery. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the longitudinal effects of metabolic and bariatric surgery (MBS) on the prevalence of musculoskeletal and lower extremity (LE) pain, physical function, and health-related quality of life. METHODS: The Teen Longitudinal Assessment of Bariatric Surgery study (NCT00474318) prospectively collected data on 242 adolescents undergoing MBS at 5 centers over a 3-year follow-up. Joint pain and physical function outcomes were assessed by using the Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index, Impact of Weight on Quality of Life - Kids, and the Short Form 36 Health Survey. Adolescents with Blount disease (n = 9) were excluded. RESULTS: Prevalent musculoskeletal and LE pain were reduced by 40% within 12 months and persisted over 3 years. Adjusted models revealed a 6% lower odds of having musculoskeletal pain (odds ratio = 0.94, 95% confidence interval: 0.92-0.99) and a 10% lower odds of having LE pain (odds ratio = 0.90, 95% confidence interval: 0.86-0.95) per 10% reduction of BMI. The prevalence of poor physical function (Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index score >0) declined from 49% to <20% at 6 months (P < .05), Physical comfort and the physical component scores, measured by the Impact of Weight on Quality of Life - Kids and the Short Form 36 Health Survey, improved at 6 months postsurgery and beyond (P < .01). Poor physical function predicted persistent joint pain after MBS. CONCLUSIONS: Joint pain, impaired physical function, and impaired health-related quality of life significantly improve after MBS. These benefits in patient-reported outcomes support the use of MBS in adolescents with severe obesity and musculoskeletal pain and suggest that MBS in adolescence may reverse and reduce multiple risk factors for future joint disease.

        "Molecular harvesting with electroporation for tissue profiling. Recent developments in personalized medicine are based on molecular measurement steps that guide personally adjusted medical decisions. A central approach to molecular profiling consists of measuring DNA, RNA, and/or proteins in tissue samples, most notably in and around tumors. This measurement yields molecular biomarkers that are potentially predictive of response and of tumor type. Current methods in cancer therapy mostly use tissue biopsy as the starting point of molecular profiling. Tissue biopsies involve a physical resection of a small tissue sample, leading to localized tissue injury, bleeding, inflammation and stress, as well as to an increased risk of metastasis. Here we developed a technology for harvesting biomolecules from tissues using electroporation. We show that tissue electroporation, achieved using a combination of high-voltage short pulses, 50 pulses 500\u2009V\u2009cm-1, 30\u2009\u00b5s, 1\u2009Hz, with low-voltage long pulses 50 pulses 50\u2009V\u2009cm-1, 10\u2009ms, delivered at 1\u2009Hz, allows for tissue-specific extraction of RNA and proteins. We specifically tested RNA and protein extraction from excised kidney and liver samples and from excised HepG2 tumors in mice. Further in vivo development of extraction methods based on electroporation can drive novel approaches to the molecular profiling of tumors and of tumor environment and to related diagnosis practices.

        "RGS4 Maintains Chronic Pain Symptoms in Rodent Models. Regulator of G-protein signaling 4 (RGS4) is a potent modulator of G-protein-coupled receptor signal transduction that is expressed throughout the pain matrix. Here, we use genetic mouse models to demonstrate a role of RGS4 in the maintenance of chronic pain states in male and female mice. Using paradigms of peripheral inflammation and nerve injury, we show that the prevention of RGS4 action leads to recovery from mechanical and cold allodynia and increases the motivation for wheel running. Similarly, RGS4KO eliminates the duration of nocifensive behavior in the second phase of the formalin assay. Using the Complete Freud's Adjuvant (CFA) model of hindpaw inflammation we also demonstrate that downregulation of RGS4 in the adult ventral posterolateral thalamic nuclei promotes recovery from mechanical and cold allodynia. RNA sequencing analysis of thalamus (THL) from RGS4WT and RGS4KO mice points to many signal transduction modulators and transcription factors that are uniquely regulated in CFA-treated RGS4WT cohorts. Ingenuity pathway analysis suggests that several components of glutamatergic signaling are differentially affected by CFA treatment between RGS4WT and RGS4KO groups. Notably, Western blot analysis shows increased expression of metabotropic glutamate receptor 2 in THL synaptosomes of RGS4KO mice at time points at which they recover from mechanical allodynia. Overall, our study provides information on a novel intracellular pathway that contributes to the maintenance of chronic pain states and points to RGS4 as a potential therapeutic target.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT There is an imminent need for safe and efficient chronic pain medications. Regulator of G-protein signaling 4 (RGS4) is a multifunctional signal transduction protein, widely expressed in the pain matrix. Here, we demonstrate that RGS4 plays a prominent role in the maintenance of chronic pain symptoms in male and female mice. Using genetically modified mice, we show a dynamic role of RGS4 in recovery from symptoms of sensory hypersensitivity deriving from hindpaw inflammation or hindlimb nerve injury. We also demonstrate an important role of RGS4 actions in gene expression patterns induced by chronic pain states in the mouse thalamus. Our findings provide novel insight into mechanisms associated with the maintenance of chronic pain states and demonstrate that interventions in RGS4 activity promote recovery from sensory hypersensitivity symptoms.

        "A revision of the conductive hearing loss in Cranium 4 from the Middle Pleistocene site of Sima de los Huesos (Burgos, Spain). Pathological conditions have been previously documented in the Middle Pleistocene Sima de los Huesos hominins from northern Spain, and several of these have clear behavioral implications. Within this fossil assemblage, Cranium 4 shows bilateral external auditory exostoses which have been preliminarily interpreted as causing a significant hearing loss in this individual. If confirmed, this would be the oldest recorded case of deafness in human history and could have important implications for the antiquity of this condition, as well as social interactions. To further investigate this case, the current study presents 3D reconstructions of the entire outer and middle ear, based on computed tomography scans of both temporal bones in Cranium 4. We established the degree of stenosis in both external auditory canals, showing that in both cases the degree of stenosis is less than 52% of the original cross-sectional area of each canal. Based on clinical studies in living humans, the buildup of wax due to the degree of stenosis in Cranium 4 is unlikely to have caused frequent external ear infections. In addition, we estimated the pattern of sound power transmission up to 5\u00a0kHz in both ears relying on a comprehensive model developed in the bioengineering literature and which has been applied previously to the Sima de los Huesos hominins. The model was modified to account for the peculiar shape of the pathological external ear canals in Cranium 4. The results show that this pathology had little to no influence on the sound power transmission in this individual. Thus, we conclude that the exostoses present in both ears of Cranium 4 did not significantly affect their hearing. ",
        "Consuming cholera toxin counteracts age-associated obesity. During the past forty years there has been an inexplicable increase in chronic inflammatory disorders, including obesity. One theory, the 'hygiene hypothesis', involves dysregulated immunity arising after too few beneficial early life microbe exposures. Indeed, earlier studies have shown that gut microbe-immune interactions contribute to smoldering inflammation, adiposity, and weight gain. Here we tested a safe and well-established microbe-based immune adjuvant to restore immune homeostasis and counteract inflammation-associated obesity in animal models. We found that consuming Vibrio cholerae exotoxin subunit B (ctB) was sufficient to inhibit age-associated obesogenic outcomes in wild type mice, including reduced crown-like structures (CLS) and granulomatous necrosis histopathology in fat depots. Administration of cholera toxin reduced weight gain irrespective of age during administration; however, exposure during youth imparted greater slenderizing effects when compared with animals receiving ctB for the first time during adulthood. Beneficial effects were transplantable to other obesity-prone animals using immune cells alone, demonstrating an immune-mediated mechanism. Taken together, we concluded that oral vaccination with cholera toxin B helps stimulate health-protective immune responses that counteract age-associated obesity. ",
        "Factors associated with utilization of high cost agents for the treatment of metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. BACKGROUND: Antineoplastic agents approved in recent decades are a marked advancement in cancer treatment but come at considerable cost. These drugs may widen survival disparities between patients who receive these agents and those who do not. We examine factors associated with the utilization of high cost antineoplastic agents for the treatment of metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (mNSCLC). METHODS: We conducted a retrospective observational study using 2007-2015 SEER-Medicare data supplemented with the Area Health Resource File. Patients were aged 66 years or older enrolled in fee-for-service Medicare Part D, were diagnosed with a first primary diagnosis of mNSCLC, and received an antineoplastic agent. High cost agents were defined as agents costing $5000 or more per month. Independent variables include race/ethnicity, urban or rural residency, census tract poverty, and treatment facility type (e.g., National Cancer Institute (NCI) designation). RESULTS: Patients who lived in areas of high poverty were 4 percentage points less likely to receive high cost agents (two-sided p\u2009<\u20090.001). Patients who were not treated at a NCI designated center were 10 percentage points less likely to receive these agents (two-sided p\u2009<\u20090.001). A 27 percentage point increase in the likelihood of receiving a high cost agent was observed in 2015 compared to 2007, highlighting the rapid change in practice patterns (two-sided p\u2009<\u20090.001). CONCLUSION: Potential policy and care delivery solutions involve outreach and support to community physicians who treat patients in remote areas. We estimate that widespread use of these agents conservatively cost approximately $3 billion per year for metastatic non-small cell lung cancer alone. ",
        "Prescription Opioid Misuse in US Older Adults: Associated Comorbidities and Reduced Quality of Life in the National Epidemiologic Survey of Alcohol and Related Conditions-III. OBJECTIVE: Prescription opioid misuse (POM) prevalence in US older adults (50 years and older) has increased, and preliminary evidence associates POM with poor outcomes. Despite this, little is known about the health-related quality of life, mental and physical health, and substance use profiles of older adults with current and/or past POM. The aim of this study was to evaluate differences in these variables by POM history in US older adults. METHODS: Data were from the 2012-2013 National Epidemiologic Survey of Alcohol and Related Conditions-III, using adults 50 years and older (n = 14,667). Respondents were grouped into mutually exclusive categories: no lifetime POM, prior-to-past-year POM, past-year POM, and persistent POM (ie, prior-to-past-year and past-year POM). Groups were compared using design-based linear regression on health-related quality of life and logistic regression on mental health, physical health, and substance use variables, controlling for sociodemographics. RESULTS: Older adults with persistent POM had the greatest impairment, including lower mental and physical health-related quality of life and high rates of past-year major depression (17.6%), emergency department use (42.7%), and any substance use disorder (37.4%). Older adults with past-year POM had high rates of physical health diagnoses and health care utilization (eg, 45.6% past-year overnight hospitalization), while those with prior-to-past-year POM had significant current psychopathology (eg, 13.7% with past-year major depression). CONCLUSIONS: Older adults with persistent POM likely need multidisciplinary care for their significant physical and mental health and substance use conditions. Given the elevated psychopathology in those with persistent POM, psychiatrists are well placed to identify those with long-term POM. ",
        "Contemporary prostate cancer treatment choices in multidisciplinary clinics referenced to national trends. BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to assess treatment choices among men with prostate cancer who presented at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center multidisciplinary (MultiD) clinic compared with nationwide trends. METHODS: In total, 4451 men with prostate cancer who presented at the MultiD clinic from 2004 to 2016 were analyzed. To assess nationwide trends, the authors analyzed 392,710 men with prostate cancer who were diagnosed between 2004 and 2015 from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database. The primary endpoint was treatment choice as a function of pretreatment demographics. RESULTS: Univariate analyses revealed similar treatment trends in the MultiD and SEER cohorts. The use of procedural forms of definitive therapy decreased with age, including brachytherapy and prostatectomy (all P\u00a0<\u00a0.05). Later year of diagnosis/clinic visit was associated with decreased use of definitive treatments, whereas higher risk grouping was associated with increased use (all P\u00a0<\u00a0.001). Patients with low-risk disease treated at the MultiD clinic were more likely to receive nondefinitive therapy than patients in SEER, whereas the opposite trend was observed for patients with high-risk disease, with a substantial portion of high-risk patients in SEER not receiving definitive therapy. In the MultiD clinic, African American men with intermediate-risk and high-risk disease were more likely to receive definitive therapy than white men, but for SEER the opposite was true. CONCLUSIONS: Presentation at a MultiD clinic facilitates the appropriate disposition of patients with low-risk disease to nondefinitive strategies of patients with high-risk disease to definitive treatment, and it may obviate the influence of race.

Close to 100% of all platelets passing the thrombus are captured by long von Willebrand factor (vWF) strands that quickly form tethered nets. The nets grow in patches where shear stress is high, and the local concentration of vWF is elevated due to <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\">.                         <mi>\u03b1</mi>.                     </math> -granule release by previously captured platelets. This rapidly formed thrombus has few red blood cells and so has a white appearance and is much stronger and more porous than clots formed through coagulation. Understanding and modeling the biophysics of this event can predict totally new approaches to prevent and treat heart attacks and strokes. ",
        "Robotic kidney transplantation in the obese patient: 10-year experience from a single center. Despite increasing obesity rates in the dialysis population, obese kidney transplant candidates are still denied transplantation by many centers. We performed a single-center retrospective analysis of a robotic-assisted kidney transplant (RAKT) cohort from January 2009 to December 2018. A total of 239 patients were included in this analysis. The median BMI was 41.4\u00a0kg/m2 , with the majority (53.1%) of patients being African American and 69.4% of organs sourced from living donors. The median surgery duration and warm ischemia times were 4.8\u00a0hours and 45\u00a0minutes respectively. Wound complications (mostly seromas and hematomas) occurred in 3.8% of patients, with 1 patient developing a surgical site infection (SSI). Seventeen (7.1%) graft failures, mostly due to acute rejection, were reported during follow-up. Patient survival was 98% and 95%, whereas graft survival was 98% and 93%, at 1 and 3 years respectively. Similar survival statistics were obtained from patients undergoing open transplant over the same time period from the UNOS database. In conclusion, RAKT can be safely performed in obese patients with minimal SSI risk, excellent graft function, and patient outcomes comparable to national data. RAKT could improve access to kidney transplantation in obese patients due to the low surgical complication rate. ",
        "Salt-inducible kinase inhibition suppresses acute myeloid leukemia progression in vivo. Lineage-defining transcription factors (TFs) are compelling targets for leukemia therapy, yet they are among the most challenging proteins to modulate directly with small molecules. We previously used CRISPR screening to identify a salt-inducible kinase 3 (SIK3) requirement for the growth of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell lines that overexpress the lineage TF myocyte enhancer factor (MEF2C). In this context, SIK3 maintains MEF2C function by directly phosphorylating histone deacetylase 4 (HDAC4), a repressive cofactor of MEF2C. In this study, we evaluated whether inhibition of SIK3 with the tool compound YKL-05-099 can suppress MEF2C function and attenuate disease progression in animal models of AML. Genetic targeting of SIK3 or MEF2C selectively suppressed the growth of transformed hematopoietic cells under in vitro and in vivo conditions. Similar phenotypes were obtained when cells were exposed to YKL-05-099, which caused cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis in MEF2C-expressing AML cell lines. An epigenomic analysis revealed that YKL-05-099 rapidly suppressed MEF2C function by altering the phosphorylation state and nuclear localization of HDAC4. Using a gatekeeper allele of SIK3, we found that the antiproliferative effects of YKL-05-099 occurred through on-target inhibition of SIK3 kinase activity. Based on these findings, we treated 2 different mouse models of MLL-AF9 AML with YKL-05-099, which attenuated disease progression in vivo and extended animal survival at well-tolerated doses. These findings validate SIK3 as a therapeutic target in MEF2C-addicted AML and provide a rationale for developing druglike inhibitors of SIK3 for definitive preclinical investigation and for studies in human patients.

        "Generation of complex human organoid models including vascular networks by incorporation of mesodermal progenitor cells. Organoids derived from human pluripotent stem cells are interesting models to study mechanisms of morphogenesis and promising platforms for disease modeling and drug screening. However, they mostly remain incomplete as they lack stroma, tissue resident immune cells and in particular vasculature, which create important niches during development and disease.\u00a0We propose, that the directed incorporation of mesodermal progenitor cells (MPCs) into organoids will overcome the aforementioned limitations. In order to demonstrate the feasibility of the method, we generated complex human tumor as well as neural organoids. We show that the formed blood vessels display a hierarchic organization and mural cells are assembled into the vessel wall. Moreover, we demonstrate a typical blood vessel ultrastructure including endothelial cell-cell junctions, a basement membrane as well as luminal caveolae and microvesicles. We observe a high plasticity in the endothelial network, which expands, while the organoids grow and is responsive to anti-angiogenic compounds and pro-angiogenic conditions such as hypoxia. We show that vessels within tumor organoids connect to host vessels following transplantation. Remarkably, MPCs also deliver Iba1+ cells that infiltrate the neural tissue in a microglia-like manner.

        "Shared Reading at Age 1\u00a0Year and Later Vocabulary: A Gene-Environment Study. OBJECTIVE: To assess the extent to which associations between shared reading at age 1 years and child vocabulary at age 3 years differ based on the presence of sensitizing alleles in the dopaminergic and serotonergic neurotransmitter systems. STUDY DESIGN: We conducted a secondary analysis of data from a national urban birth cohort using mother reports in conjunction with child assessments and salivary genetic data. Child vocabulary was assessed using the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test. The primary exposure was mother-reported shared reading. We used data on gene variants that may affect the function of the dopaminergic and serotonergic systems. We examined associations between shared reading and Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test score using multiple linear regression. We then included interaction terms between shared reading and the presence of sensitizing alleles for each polymorphism to assess potential moderator effects adjusting for multiple comparisons. RESULTS: Of the 1772 children included (56% black, 52% male), 31% of their mothers reported reading with their child daily. Daily shared reading was strongly associated with child Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test scores in unadjusted (B\u00a0=\u00a07.9; 95% CI, 4.3-11.4) and adjusted models (B\u00a0=\u00a05.3; 95% CI, 2.0-8.6). The association differed based on the presence of sensitizing alleles in the dopamine receptor 2 and serotonin transporter genes. CONCLUSIONS: Among urban children, shared reading at age 1 years was associated with greater vocabulary at age 3 years. Although children with sensitizing alleles on the dopamine receptor 2 and serotonin transporter genes were at greater risk when not read to, they fared as well as children without these alleles when shared reading occurred.

        "Complications following frenotomy for ankyloglossia: A 24-month prospective New Zealand Paediatric Surveillance Unit study. AIM: To investigate the incidence and characteristics of complications arising from frenotomy for ankyloglossia (tongue-tie) in New Zealand. METHODS: Prospective surveillance among hospital-based paediatricians of complications arising from frenotomy for ankyloglossia to children <1\u2009year old was conducted by the New Zealand Paediatric Surveillance Unit for 24\u2009months, from August 2016 to July 2018, inclusive. RESULTS: A total of 16 cases of complications arising from frenotomy were reported. The overall average annual incidence rate was 13.9/100\u2009000. Geographic variation was noted with a peak of 85.6/100\u2009000 in one region. Complications reported: poor feeding (44%), respiratory events (25%), pain (19%), bleeding (19%) and weight loss (19%). Three children (19%) also had delayed diagnosis of an underlying medical condition initially overlooked in favour of treating their ankyloglossia, this has not previously been reported. The majority (75%) of cases required admission to hospital. Treatments given included supplementary feeds (44%), surgical intervention (25%), breastfeeding support (19%), analgesia (13%) and blood products (13%). A total of 25% of children had one or more frenotomies; 50% were treated for two or more of: 'anterior' ankyloglossia, 'posterior' ankyloglossia or 'lip tie'; 50% had their frenotomies performed out of the hospital. Dentists were the most common performing practitioner (31%). CONCLUSIONS: Frenotomy rates in New Zealand are unknown. Poor feeding, pain, bleeding, weight loss and delayed diagnosis of an alternative underlying medical condition are important complications that require hospital assessment and admission. Practitioners and parents/families need to be aware of these possibilities. Centralised guidelines with access to specialist second opinions should be developed. ",
        "Synaptic Specializations of Melanopsin-Retinal Ganglion Cells in Multiple Brain Regions Revealed by Genetic Label for Light and Electron Microscopy. The form and synaptic fine structure of melanopsin-expressing retinal ganglion cells, also called intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs), were determined using a new membrane-targeted version of a genetic probe for correlated light and electron microscopy (CLEM). ipRGCs project to multiple brain regions, and because the method labels the entire neuron, it was possible to analyze nerve terminals in multiple retinorecipient brain regions, including the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), olivary pretectal nucleus (OPN), and subregions of the lateral geniculate. Although ipRGCs provide the only direct retinal input to the OPN and SCN, ipRGC terminal arbors and boutons were found to be remarkably different in each target region. A network of dendro-dendritic chemical synapses (DDCSs) was also revealed in the SCN, with ipRGC axon terminals preferentially synapsing on the DDCS-linked cells. The methods developed to enable this analysis should propel other CLEM studies of long-distance brain circuits at high resolution. ",
        "Neural correlates of the DMT experience assessed with multivariate EEG. Studying transitions in and out of the altered state of consciousness caused by intravenous (IV) N,N-Dimethyltryptamine (DMT - a fast-acting tryptamine psychedelic) offers a safe and powerful means of advancing knowledge on the neurobiology of conscious states. Here we sought to investigate the effects of IV DMT on the power spectrum and signal diversity of human brain activity (6 female, 7 male) recorded via multivariate EEG, and plot relationships between subjective experience, brain activity and drug plasma concentrations across time. Compared with placebo, DMT markedly reduced oscillatory power in the alpha and beta bands and robustly increased spontaneous signal diversity. Time-referenced and neurophenomenological analyses revealed close relationships between changes in various aspects of subjective experience and changes in brain activity. Importantly, the emergence of oscillatory activity within the delta and theta frequency bands was found to correlate with the peak of the experience - particularly its eyes-closed visual component. These findings highlight marked changes in oscillatory activity and signal diversity with DMT that parallel broad and specific components of the subjective experience, thus advancing our understanding of the neurobiological underpinnings of immersive states of consciousness.

        "Neurohormonal Blockade and Clinical Outcomes in Patients With Heart Failure Supported by Left Ventricular Assist Devices. Importance: Left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) improve outcomes in patients with advanced heart failure, but little is known about the role of neurohormonal blockade (NHB) in treating these patients. Objective: To analyze the association between NHB blockade and outcomes in patients with LVADs. Design, Setting, and Participants: This retrospective cohort analysis of the Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support (INTERMACS) included patients from more than 170 centers across the United States and Canada with continuous flow LVADs from 2008 to 2016 who were alive with the device in place at 6 months after implant. The data were analyzed between February and November 2019. Exposures: Patients were stratified based on exposure to NHB and represented all permutations of the following drug classes: angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers, \u03b2-blockers, and mineralocorticoid antagonists. Main Outcomes and Measures: The outcomes of interest were survival at 4 years and quality of life at 2 years based on Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire scores and a 6-minute walk test. Results: A total of 12\u202f144 patients in INTERMACS met inclusion criteria, of whom 2526 (20.8% ) were women, 8088 (66.6%) were white, 3024 (24.9%) were African American, and 753 (6.2%) were Hispanic; the mean (SD) age was 56.8 (12.9) years. Of these, 10\u202f419 (85.8%) were receiving NHB. Those receiving any NHB medication at 6 months had a better survival rate at 4 years compared with patients not receiving NHB (56.0%; 95% CI, 54.5%-57.5% vs 43.9%; 95% CI, 40.5%-47.7%). After sensitivity analyses with an adjusted model, this trend persisted with patients receiving triple therapy with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker, \u03b2-blocker, and mineralocorticoid antagonist having the lowest hazard of death compared with patients in the other groups (hazard ratio, 0.34; 95% CI, 0.28-0.41). Compared with patients not receiving NHB, use of NHB was associated with a higher Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire score (66.6; bootstrapped 95% CI, 65.8-67.3 vs 63.0; bootstrapped 95% CI, 60.1-65.8; P\u2009=\u2009.02) and a 6-minute walk test (1103 ft; bootstrapped 95% CI, 1084-1123 ft vs 987 ft; bootstrapped 95% CI, 913-1060 ft; P\u2009<\u2009.001). Conclusions and Relevance: Among patients with LVADs who tolerated NHB therapy, continued treatment was associated with improved survival and quality of life. The optimal heart failure regimen for patients after LVAD implant may be the initiation and continuation of guideline-directed medical therapy. ",
        "PPAR\u03b1-targeted mitochondrial bioenergetics mediate repair of intestinal barriers at the host-microbe intersection during SIV infection. Chronic gut inflammatory diseases are associated with disruption of intestinal epithelial barriers and impaired mucosal immunity. HIV-1 (HIV) causes depletion of mucosal CD4+ T cells early in infection and disruption of gut epithelium, resulting in chronic inflammation and immunodeficiency. Although antiretroviral therapy (ART) is effective in suppressing viral replication, it is incapable of restoring the \"leaky gut,\" which poses an impediment for HIV cure efforts. Strategies are needed for rapid repair of the epithelium to protect intestinal microenvironments and immunity in inflamed gut. Using an in vivo nonhuman primate intestinal loop model of HIV/AIDS, we identified the pathogenic mechanism underlying sustained disruption of gut epithelium and explored rapid repair of gut epithelium at the intersection of microbial metabolism. Molecular, immunological, and metabolomic analyses revealed marked loss of peroxisomal proliferator-activated receptor-\u03b1 (PPAR\u03b1) signaling, predominant impairment of mitochondrial function, and epithelial disruption both in vivo and in vitro. To elucidate pathways regulating intestinal epithelial integrity, we introduced probiotic Lactobacillus plantarum into Simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)-inflamed intestinal lumen. Rapid recovery of the epithelium occurred within 5 h of L. plantarum administration, independent of mucosal CD4+ T cell recovery, and in the absence of ART. This intestinal barrier repair was driven by L. plantarum-induced PPAR\u03b1 activation and restoration of mitochondrial structure and fatty acid \u03b2-oxidation. Our data highlight the critical role of PPAR\u03b1 at the intersection between microbial metabolism and epithelial repair in virally inflamed gut and as a potential mitochondrial target for restoring gut barriers in other infectious or gut inflammatory diseases.

        "Cancer-derived exosomes loaded with ultrathin palladium nanosheets for targeted bioorthogonal catalysis. The transformational impact of bioorthogonal chemistries has inspired new strategies for the in vivo synthesis of bioactive agents through non-natural means. Among these, palladium (Pd) catalysts have played a prominent role in the growing subfield of bioorthogonal catalysis by producing xenobiotics and uncaging biomolecules in living systems. However, delivering catalysts selectively to specific cell types still lags behind catalyst development. Here we have developed a bio-artificial device consisting of cancer-derived exosomes loaded with Pd catalysts by a method that enables the controlled assembly of Pd nanosheets directly inside the vesicles. This hybrid system mediates Pd-triggered dealkylation reactions in vitro and inside cells and displays preferential tropism for their progenitor cells. The use of Trojan exosomes to deliver abiotic catalysts into designated cancer cells creates the opportunity for a new targeted therapy modality: exosome-directed catalyst prodrug therapy, whose first steps are presented herein with the cell-specific release of the anticancer drug panobinostat.

        "Yoga, Physical Therapy, and Back Pain Education for Sleep Quality in Low-Income Racially Diverse Adults with Chronic Low Back Pain: a Secondary Analysis of a Randomized Controlled Trial. BACKGROUND: Poor sleep is common among adults with chronic low back pain (cLBP), but the influence of cLBP treatments, such as yoga and physical therapy (PT), on sleep quality is under studied. OBJECTIVE: Evaluate the effectiveness of yoga and PT for improving sleep quality in adults with cLBP. DESIGN: Secondary analysis of a randomized controlled trial. SETTING: Academic safety-net hospital and 7 affiliated community health centers. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 320 adults with cLBP. INTERVENTION: Twelve weekly yoga classes, 1-on-1 PT sessions, or an educational book. MAIN MEASURES: Sleep quality was measured using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) global score (0-21) at baseline, 12\u00a0weeks, and 52\u00a0weeks. Additionally, we also evaluated how the proportion of participants who achieved a clinically meaningful improvement in sleep quality (>\u20093-point reduction in PSQI) at 12\u00a0weeks varied by changes in pain and physical function at 6\u00a0weeks. KEY RESULTS: Among participants (mean age\u2009=\u200946.0, 64% female, 82% non-white), nearly all (92%) reported poor sleep quality (PSQI >\u20095) at baseline. At 12\u00a0weeks, modest improvements in sleep quality were observed among the yoga (PSQI mean difference [MD]\u2009=\u2009-\u20091.19, 95% confidence interval [CI] -\u20091.82, -\u20090.55) and PT (PSQI MD\u2009=\u2009-\u20090.91, 95% CI -\u20091.61, -\u20090.20) groups. Participants who reported a \u2265\u200930% improvement in pain or physical function at 6\u00a0weeks, compared with those who improved <\u200910%, were more likely to be a sleep quality responder at 12\u00a0weeks (odds ratio [OR]\u2009=\u20093.51, 95% CI 1.73, 7.11 and OR\u2009=\u20092.16, 95% CI 1.18, 3.95, respectively). Results were similar at 52\u00a0weeks. CONCLUSION: In a sample of adults with cLBP, virtually all with poor sleep quality prior to intervention, modest but statistically significant improvements in sleep quality were observed with both yoga and PT. Irrespective of treatment, clinically important sleep improvements at the end of the intervention were associated with mid-intervention pain and physical function improvements.

        "Projected number of people with onchocerciasis-loiasis co-infection in Africa, 1995 to 2025. BACKGROUND: Onchocerciasis elimination through mass drug administration (MDA) is hampered by co-endemicity of Loa loa in Africa, as people with high L. loa microfilariae (mf) density can develop serious adverse events (SAEs) after ivermectin treatment. We assessed the geographical overlap of onchocerciasis and loiasis prevalence and estimated the number of co-infected individuals at risk of post-ivermectin SAEs in West and Central Africa from 1995 to 2025. METHODS: Focussing on regions with suspected loiasis transmission in 14 African countries, we overlaid pre-control maps of loiasis and onchocerciasis prevalence to calculate pre-control prevalence of co-infection by 5x5 km\u00b2 pixel, distinguishing different categories of L. loa mf intensity. Using statistical and mathematical models, we predicted the prevalence of both infections and co-infection for 2015 and 2025, accounting for the impact of MDA with ivermectin. RESULTS: The number of people infected with onchocerciasis was predicted to decline from almost 19 million in 1995 to 4 million in 2025. Of these, 137,000 people were estimated to also have L. loa hypermicrofilaraemia (\u226520,000 L. loa mf/mL) in 1995, declining to 31,000 in 2025. In 2025, 92.8% of co-infected cases with loiasis hypermicrofilaraemia are predicted to live in hypoendemic areas currently not targeted for MDA. CONCLUSIONS: Loiasis co-infection is a major concern for onchocerciasis elimination in Africa. We predict that under current strategies, at least 31,000 co-infected people will still require treatment for onchocerciasis in 2025 while being at risk of SAEs, justifying continued efforts in research and development for safer drugs and control strategies.

        "Particulate matter and episodic memory decline mediated by early neuroanatomic biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease. Evidence suggests exposure to particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter <2.5 \u03bcm (PM2.5) may increase the risk for Alzheimer's disease and related dementias. Whether PM2.5 alters brain structure and accelerates the preclinical neuropsychological processes remains unknown. Early decline of episodic memory is detectable in preclinical Alzheimer's disease. Therefore, we conducted a longitudinal study to examine whether PM2.5 affects the episodic memory decline, and also explored the potential mediating role of increased neuroanatomic risk of Alzheimer's disease associated with exposure. Participants included older females (n = 998; aged 73-87) enrolled in both the Women's Health Initiative Study of Cognitive Aging and the Women's Health Initiative Memory Study of Magnetic Resonance Imaging, with annual (1999-2010) episodic memory assessment by the California Verbal Learning Test, including measures of immediate free recall/new learning (List A Trials 1-3; List B) and delayed free recall (short- and long-delay), and up to two brain scans (MRI-1: 2005-06; MRI-2: 2009-10). Subjects were assigned Alzheimer's disease pattern similarity scores (a brain-MRI measured neuroanatomical risk for Alzheimer's disease), developed by supervised machine learning and validated with data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. Based on residential histories and environmental data on air monitoring and simulated atmospheric chemistry, we used a spatiotemporal model to estimate 3-year average PM2.5 exposure preceding MRI-1. In multilevel structural equation models, PM2.5 was associated with greater declines in immediate recall and new learning, but no association was found with decline in delayed-recall or composite scores. For each interquartile increment (2.81 \u03bcg/m3) of PM2.5, the annual decline rate was significantly accelerated by 19.3% [95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.9% to 36.2%] for Trials 1-3 and 14.8% (4.4% to 24.9%) for List B performance, adjusting for multiple potential confounders. Long-term PM2.5 exposure was associated with increased Alzheimer's disease pattern similarity scores, which accounted for 22.6% (95% CI: 1% to 68.9%) and 10.7% (95% CI: 1.0% to 30.3%) of the total adverse PM2.5 effects on Trials 1-3 and List B, respectively. The observed associations remained after excluding incident cases of dementia and stroke during the follow-up, or further adjusting for small-vessel ischaemic disease volumes. Our findings illustrate the continuum of PM2.5 neurotoxicity that contributes to early decline of immediate free recall/new learning at the preclinical stage, which is mediated by progressive atrophy of grey matter indicative of increased Alzheimer's disease risk, independent of cerebrovascular damage.

        "Associations between Dietary Pulses Alone or with Other Legumes and Cardiometabolic Disease Outcomes: An Umbrella Review and Updated Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of Prospective Cohort Studies. To update the European Association for the Study of Diabetes clinical practice guidelines for nutrition therapy, we conducted an umbrella review and updated systematic review and meta-analysis (SRMA) of prospective cohort studies of the association between dietary pulses with or without other legumes and cardiometabolic disease outcomes. We searched the PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases through March 2019. We included the most recent SRMAs of prospective cohort studies and new prospective cohort studies published after the census dates of the included SRMAs assessing the relation between dietary pulses with or without other legumes and incidence and mortality of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) [including coronary heart disease (CHD), myocardial infarction (MI), and stroke], diabetes, hypertension, and/or obesity. Two independent reviewers extracted data and assessed risk of bias. Risk estimates were pooled using the generic inverse variance method and expressed as risk ratios (RRs) with 95% CIs. The overall certainty of the evidence was assessed using the GRADE approach. Six SRMAs were identified and updated to include 28 unique prospective cohort studies with the following number of cases for each outcome: CVD incidence, 10,261; CVD mortality, 16,168; CHD incidence, 7786; CHD mortality, 3331; MI incidence, 2585; stroke incidence, 8570; stroke mortality, 2384; diabetes incidence, 10,457; hypertension incidence, 83,284; obesity incidence, 8125. Comparing the highest with the lowest level of intake, dietary pulses with or without other legumes were associated with significant decreases in CVD (RR: 0.92; 95% CI: 0.85, 0.99), CHD (RR: 0.90; 95% CI: 0.83, 0.99), hypertension (RR: 0.91; 95% CI: 0.86, 0.97), and obesity (RR: 0.87; 95% CI: 0.81, 0.94) incidence. There was no association with MI, stroke, and diabetes incidence or CVD, CHD, and stroke mortality. The overall certainty of the evidence was graded as \"low\" for CVD incidence and \"very low\" for all other outcomes. Current evidence shows that dietary pulses with or without other legumes are associated with reduced CVD incidence with low certainty and reduced CHD, hypertension, and obesity incidence with very low certainty. More research is needed to improve our estimates. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT03555734. ",
        "Safety and immunogenicity of the oral, inactivated, enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli vaccine ETVAX in Bangladeshi children and infants: a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled phase 1/2 trial. BACKGROUND: Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli causes diarrhoea, leading to substantial mortality and morbidity in children, but no specific vaccine exists. This trial tested an oral, inactivated, enterotoxigenic E coli vaccine (ETVAX), which has been previously shown to be safe and highly immuongenic in Swedish and Bangladeshi adults. We tested the safety and immunogenicity of ETVAX, consisting of four E coli strains overexpressing the most prevalent colonisation factors (CFA/I, CS3, CS5, and CS6) and a toxoid (LCTBA) administered with or without a double-mutant heat-labile enterotoxin (dmLT) as an adjuvant, in Bangladeshi children. METHODS: We did a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-escalation, age-descending, phase 1/2 trial in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Healthy children in one of three age groups (24-59 months, 12-23 months, and 6-11 months) were eligible. Children were randomly assigned with block randomisation to receive either ETVAX, with or without dmLT, or placebo. ETVAX (half [5\u00b75 \u00d7 1010 cells], quarter [2\u00b75 \u00d7 1010 cells], or eighth [1\u00b725 \u00d7 1010 cells] adult dose), with or without dmLT adjuvant (2\u00b75 \u03bcg, 5\u00b70 \u03bcg, or 10\u00b70 \u03bcg), or placebo were administered orally in two doses 2 weeks apart. Investigators and participants were masked to treatment allocation. The primary endpoint was safety and tolerability, assessed in all children who received at least one dose of vaccine. Antibody responses to vaccine antigens, defined as at least a two-times increase in antibody levels between baseline and post-immunisation, were assessed as secondary endpoints. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02531802. FINDINGS: Between Dec 7, 2015, and Jan 10, 2017, we screened 1500 children across the three age groups, of whom 430 were enrolled and randomly assigned to the different treatment groups (130 aged 24-59 months, 100 aged 12-23 months, and 200 aged 6-11 months). All participants received at least one dose of vaccine. No solicited adverse events occurred that were greater than moderate in severity, and most were mild. The most common solicited event was vomiting (ten [8%] of 130 patients aged 24-59 months, 13 [13%] of 100 aged 12-23 months, and 29 [15%] of 200 aged 6-11 months; mostly of mild severity), which appeared related to dose and age. The addition of dmLT did not modify the safety profile. Three serious adverse events occurred but they were not considered related to the study drug. Mucosal IgA antibody responses in lymphocyte secretions were detected against all primary vaccine antigens (CFA/I, CS3, CS5, CS6, and the LCTBA toxoid) in most participants in the two older age groups, whereas such responses to four of the five antigens were less frequent and of lower magnitude in infants aged 6-11 months than in older children. Faecal secretory IgA immune responses were recorded against all vaccine antigens in infants aged 6-11 months. 78 (56%) of 139 infants aged 6-11 months who were vaccinated developed mucosal responses against at least three of the vaccine antigens versus 14 (29%) of 49 of the infants given placebo. Addition of the adjuvant dmLT enhanced the magnitude, breadth, and kinetics (based on number of responders after the first dose of vaccine) of immune responses in infants. INTERPRETATION: The encouraging safety and immunogenicity of ETVAX and benefit of dmLT adjuvant in young children support its further assessment for protective efficacy in children in enterotoxigenic E coli-endemic areas.

        "Association of Maternal Eating Disorders With Pregnancy and Neonatal Outcomes. Importance: The prevalence of eating disorders is high among women of reproductive age, yet the association of eating disorders with pregnancy complications and neonatal health has not been investigated in detail, to our knowledge. Objective: To investigate the relative risk of adverse pregnancy and neonatal outcomes for women with eating disorders. Design, Setting, and Participants: This population-based cohort study included all singleton births included in the Swedish Medical Birth Register from January 1, 2003, to December 31, 2014. A total of 7542 women with eating disorders were compared with 1\u202f225\u202f321 women without eating disorders. Statistical analysis was performed from January 1, 2018, to April 30, 2019. Via linkage with the national patient register, women with eating disorders were identified and compared with women free of any eating disorder. Eating disorders were further stratified into active or previous disease based on last time of diagnosis. Main Outcomes and Measures: The risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes (hyperemesis, anemia, preeclampsia, and antepartum hemorrhage), the mode of delivery (cesarean delivery, vaginal delivery, or instrumental vaginal delivery), and the neonatal outcomes (preterm birth, small and large sizes for gestational age, Apgar score <7 at 5 minutes, and microcephaly) were calculated using Poisson regression analysis to estimate risk ratios (RRs). Models were adjusted for age, parity, smoking status, and birth year. Results: There were 2769 women with anorexia nervosa (mean [SD] age, 29.4 [5.3] years), 1378 women with bulimia nervosa (mean [SD] age, 30.2 [4.9] years), and 3395 women with an eating disorder not otherwise specified (EDNOS; mean [SD] age, 28.9 [5.3] years), and they were analyzed and compared with 1\u202f225\u202f321 women without eating disorders (mean [SD] age, 30.3 [5.2] years). All subtypes of maternal eating disorders were associated with an approximately 2-fold increased risk of hyperemesis during pregnancy (anorexia nervosa: RR, 2.1 [95% CI, 1.8-2.5]; bulimia nervosa: RR, 2.1 [95% CI, 1.6-2.7]; EDNOS: RR, 2.6 [95% CI, 2.3-3.0]). The risk of anemia during pregnancy was doubled for women with active anorexia nervosa (RR, 2.1 [95% CI, 1.3-3.2]) or EDNOS (RR, 2.1 [95% CI, 1.5-2.8]). Maternal anorexia nervosa was associated with an increased risk of antepartum hemorrhage (RR, 1.6 [95% CI, 1.2-2.1]), which was more pronounced in active vs previous disease. Women with anorexia nervosa (RR, 0.7 [95% CI, 0.6-0.9]) and women with EDNOS (RR, 0.8 [95% CI, 0.7-1.0]) were at decreased risk of instrumental-assisted vaginal births; otherwise, there were no major differences in mode of delivery. Women with eating disorders, all subtypes, were at increased risk of a preterm birth (anorexia nervosa: RR, 1.6 [95% CI, 1.4-1.8]; bulimia nervosa: RR, 1.3 [95% CI, 1.0-1.6]; and EDNOS: RR, 1.4 [95% CI, 1.2-1.6]) and of delivering neonates with microcephaly (anorexia nervosa: RR, 1.9 [95% CI, 1.5-2.4]; bulimia nervosa: RR, 1.6 [95% CI, 1.1-2.4]; EDNOS: RR, 1.4 [95% CI, 1.2-1.9]). Conclusions and Relevance: The findings of this study suggest that women with active or previous eating disorders, regardless of subtype, are at increased risk of adverse pregnancy and neonatal outcomes and may need increased surveillance in antenatal and delivery care.

        "Association of Positive Airway Pressure Use With Acute Care Utilization and Costs. STUDY OBJECTIVES: The current value-based medical climate has led to scrutiny of all medical costs. Given the relationship between obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and many significant comorbid medical conditions, treating patients with OSA via positive airway pressure (PAP) therapy might reduce health care expenditures. Our goal was to determine the relationship between PAP use and acute care utilization and costs. METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study of adult patients who initiated PAP therapy after a diagnosis of moderate-severe OSA at a large integrated health system during 2014-2016. RESULTS: The study consisted of 1,098 patients, of which 60% were on PAP > 4 h/night for \u2265 70% of the nights. The average h/night were 5.3 (standard deviation 2.4). Increasing PAP usage was associated with reduced inpatient (rate ratio [RR] 0.92, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.86-0.98) and overall acute care visits (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.92-0.99). The linear relationships were supported by the threshold effects identified in the categorical adherence measures. No linear association was identified with emergency department visits and inpatient stays. However, lower number of emergency department visits (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.62-0.98) and inpatient stays (RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.35-0.91) were observed among adherent (> 4 h/night for \u2265 70% of the nights) patients. CONCLUSIONS: PAP usage was linearly associated with reduced number of inpatient and overall acute care visits, and lower likelihood of having positive costs from these visits. PAP usage was also associated with less emergency department visits and inpatient stays when comparing adherent patients to less adherent patients.

        "Disruption of the mouse Shmt2 gene confers embryonic anaemia via foetal liver-specific metabolomic disorders. In a previous study, we proposed that age-related mitochondrial respiration defects observed in elderly subjects are partially due to age-associated downregulation of nuclear-encoded genes, including serine hydroxymethyltransferase 2 (SHMT2), which is involved in mitochondrial one-carbon (1C) metabolism. This assertion is supported by evidence that the disruption of mouse Shmt2 induces mitochondrial respiration defects in mouse embryonic fibroblasts generated from Shmt2-knockout E13.5 embryos experiencing anaemia and lethality. Here, we elucidated the potential mechanisms by which the disruption of this gene induces mitochondrial respiration defects and embryonic anaemia using Shmt2-knockout E13.5 embryos. The livers but not the brains of Shmt2-knockout E13.5 embryos presented mitochondrial respiration defects and growth retardation. Metabolomic profiling revealed that Shmt2 deficiency induced foetal liver-specific downregulation of 1C-metabolic pathways that create taurine and nucleotides required for mitochondrial respiratory function and cell division, respectively, resulting in the manifestation of mitochondrial respiration defects and growth retardation. Given that foetal livers function to produce erythroblasts in mouse embryos, growth retardation in foetal livers directly induced depletion of erythroblasts. By contrast, mitochondrial respiration defects in foetal livers also induced depletion of erythroblasts as a consequence of the inhibition of erythroblast differentiation, resulting in the manifestation of anaemia in Shmt2-knockout E13.5 embryos.

        "Intermittent Fasting in Cardiovascular Disorders-An Overview. Intermittent fasting is a form of time restricted eating (typically 16 h fasting and 8 h eating), which has gained popularity in recent years and shows promise as a possible new paradigm in the approach to weight loss and the reduction of inflammation, and has many potential long term health benefits. In this review, the authors will incorporate many aspects of fasting, mainly focusing on its effects on the cardiovascular system, involving atherosclerosis progression, benefits for diabetes mellitus type 2, lowering of blood pressure, and exploring other cardiovascular risk factors (such as lipid profile and inflammation).

        "Immune cell type, cell activation, and single cell heterogeneity revealed by label-free optical methods. Measurement techniques that allow the global analysis of cellular responses while retaining single-cell sensitivity are increasingly needed in order to understand complex and dynamic biological processes. In this context, compromises between sensitivity, degree of multiplexing, throughput, and invasiveness are often unavoidable. We present here a noninvasive optical approach that can retrieve quantitative biomarkers of both morphological and molecular phenotypes of individual cells, based on a combination of quantitative phase imaging and Raman spectroscopy measurements. We then develop generalized statistical tools to assess the influence of both controlled (cell sub-populations, immune stimulation) and uncontrolled (culturing conditions, animal variations, etc.) experimental parameters on the label-free biomarkers. These indicators can detect different macrophage cell sub-populations originating from different progenitors as well as their activation state, and how these changes are related to specific differences in morphology and molecular content. The molecular indicators also display further sensitivity that allow identification of other experimental conditions, such as differences between cells originating from different animals, allowing the detection of outlier behaviour from given cell sub-populations.

        "Walking enhances peripheral visual processing in humans. Cognitive processes are almost exclusively investigated under highly controlled settings during which voluntary body movements are suppressed. However, recent animal work suggests differences in sensory processing between movement states by showing drastically changed neural responses in early visual areas between locomotion and stillness. Does locomotion also modulate visual cortical activity in humans, and what are the perceptual consequences? Our study shows that walking increased the contrast-dependent influence of peripheral visual input on central visual input. This increase is prevalent in stimulus-locked electroencephalogram (EEG) responses (steady-state visual evoked potential [SSVEP]) alongside perceptual performance. Ongoing alpha oscillations (approximately 10 Hz) further positively correlated with the walking-induced changes of SSVEP amplitude, indicating the involvement of an altered inhibitory process during walking. The results predicted that walking leads to an increased processing of peripheral visual input. A second study indeed showed an increased contrast sensitivity for peripheral compared to central stimuli when subjects were walking. Our work shows complementary neurophysiological and behavioural evidence corroborating animal findings that walking leads to a change in early visual neuronal activity in humans. That neuronal modulation due to walking is indeed linked to specific perceptual changes extends the existing animal work. ",
        "Antidepressant prescriptions, discontinuation, depression and perinatal outcomes, including breastfeeding: A population cohort analysis. OBJECTIVES: To explore associations between exposure to antidepressants, their discontinuation, depression [medicated or unmediated] and preterm birth [<37 and <32 weeks], small for gestational age (SGA) [<10th and <3rd centiles], breastfeeding [any] at 6-8 weeks. METHODS: Design: A population-based cohort study. Setting: The Secure Anonymised Information Linkage [SAIL] databank in Wales, linking maternal primary care data with infant outcomes. Participants: 107,573, 105,331, and 38,725 infants born 2000-2010 with information on prematurity, SGA and breastfeeding respectively, after exclusions. Exposures: Maternal antidepressant prescriptions in trimesters 2 or 3, discontinuation after trimester 1, recorded diagnosis of depression [medicated or unmediated] in pregnancy. Methods: Odds ratios for adverse pregnancy outcomes were calculated, adjusted for smoking, parity, socio-economic status, and depression. RESULTS: Exclusive formula feeding at 6-8 weeks was associated with prescriptions in trimesters 2 or 3 for any antidepressants (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 0.81, 95% confidence intervals 0.67-0.98), SSRIs [aOR 0.77, 0.62-0.95], particularly higher doses [aOR 0.45, 0.23-0.86], discontinuation of antidepressants or SSRIs after trimester 1 (aOR 0.70, 0.57-0.83 and 0.66, 0.51-0.87), diagnosis of depression aOR 0.76 [0.70-0.82), particularly if medicated (aOR 0.70, 0.58-0.85), rather than unmedicated (aOR 0.87, 0.82-0.92). Preterm birth at <37 and <32 weeks' gestation was associated with diagnosis of depression (aOR 1.27, 1.17-1.38, and 1.33, 1.09-1.62), particularly if medicated (aOR 1.56, 1.23-1.96, and 1.63, 0.94-2.84); birth at <37 weeks was associated with antidepressants, (aOR 1.24, 1.04-1.49]. SGA <3rd centile was associated with antidepressants (aOR 1.43, 1.07-1.90), and SSRIs (aOR 1.46, 1.06-2.00], particularly higher doses [aOR 2.10, 1.32-3.34]. All adverse outcomes were associated with socio-economic status and smoking. IMPLICATIONS: Exposure to antidepressants or depression increased risks of exclusive formula feeding at 6-8 weeks, and prescription of antidepressants was associated with SGA <3rd centile. Prescription of antidepressants offers a useful marker to target additional support and additional care before and during pregnancy and lactation. ",
        "Genetic Variants Implicate Dual Oxidase-2 in Familial and Sporadic Nonmedullary Thyroid Cancer. Highly penetrant hereditary thyroid cancer manifests as familial nonmedullary thyroid cancer (FNMTC), whereas low-penetrance hereditary thyroid cancer manifests as sporadic disease and is associated with common polymorphisms, including rs965513[A]. Whole-exome sequencing of an FNMTC kindred identified a novel Y1203H germline dual oxidase-2 (DUOX2) mutation. DUOX2Y1203H is enzymatically active, with increased production of reactive oxygen species. Furthermore, patients with sporadic thyroid cancer homozygous for rs965513[A] demonstrated higher DUOX2 expression than heterozygous rs965513[A/G] or homozygous rs965513[A]-negative patients. These data suggest that dysregulated hydrogen peroxide metabolism is a common mechanism by which high- and low-penetrance genetic factors increase thyroid cancer risk. SIGNIFICANCE: This study provides novel insights into the genetic and molecular mechanisms underlying familial and sporadic thyroid cancers. ",
        "Characterizing symptoms of traumatic brain injury in survivors of intimate partner violence. Objective: This study examined the extent symptoms associated with potential traumatic brain injury (TBI) in intimate partner violence (IPV) survivors overlap with sport-related concussions (SRC). IPV survivor responses on the Brain Injury Severity Assessment (BISA) tool, an IPV-specific questionnaire developed to assess TBI symptoms; and the widely-used Sport Concussion Assessment Tool (SCAT5), were compared. Additionally, psychopathological assessments of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, and anxiety were completed to account for confounding influences. Design: Eighteen women who had experienced IPV were recruited from high-barrier community-based women's shelters. Results: The total number of reported TBI were higher when employing the BISA compared to SCAT5, the strongest symptom-based correlations associated TBI severity was associated with arousal states (\"Fatigue\", \"Anxious\", \"Drowsiness\", \"Just Don't Feel Right\") or aspects of memory/cognition (\"Difficulty Concentrating\", \"Difficulty Remembering\"). Furthermore, TBI severity was also related to the degree of depression and anxiety, but unrelated to PTSD. Conclusions: Taken together, these findings can contribute to the development of enhanced screening tools and supports to help front-line staff identify TBI as a possible contributor to challenges faced by IPV survivors. By this means, women who have experienced IPV will be more likely to break the cycle of abuse and have more positive long-term health outcomes. "
